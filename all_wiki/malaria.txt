<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Malaria''' is a [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-borne infectious disease]] that affects humans and other animals.<ref name=WHO2014/> Malaria causes [[symptoms]] that typically include [[fever]], [[fatigue (medical)|tiredness]], [[vomiting]], and [[headache]]s.<ref name=Cara2014/> In severe cases, it can cause [[jaundice|yellow skin]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[coma]], or [[death]].<ref name=Cara2014/> Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected [[mosquito]].<ref name=WHO2014/> If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.<ref name=WHO2014/> In those who have recently survived an [[infection]], reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.<ref name=Cara2014/> This partial [[Immunity (medical)|resistance]] disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.<ref name=Cara2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Caraballo H |title=Emergency department management of mosquito-borne illness: Malaria, dengue, and west Nile virus |journal=Emergency Medicine Practice |year=2014 |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=1–23; quiz 23–4 |url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=405 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202316/http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=405 |archive-date=2016-08-01 |pmid=25207355 }}</ref>

<!--Prevention and treatment-->
The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of [[mosquito net]]s and [[insect repellent]]s or with [[Mosquito control|mosquito-control measures]] such as spraying [[insecticide]]s and draining [[standing water]].<ref name=Cara2014/> Several [[medications]] are available to [[malaria prophylaxis|prevent malaria]] in travellers to areas where the disease is common.<ref name=WHO2014/> Occasional doses of the combination medication [[sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine]] are recommended in [[infant]]s and after the [[first trimester]] of [[pregnancy]] in areas with high rates of malaria.<ref name=WHO2014/> As of 2020, there is one [[malaria vaccine|vaccine]] which has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa.<ref name=WHO2020Fact>{{cite web |title=Fact sheet about Malaria |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria |website=www.who.int |access-date=6 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=WHO2016/> Efforts to develop more effective vaccines are ongoing.<ref name=WHO2016>{{cite journal|title=Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper – January 2016|journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record|date=4 Nov 2016|volume=91|issue=4|pages=33–52|pmid=26829826|url=https://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9104.pdf?ua=1|lay-url=https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/position_papers/malaria_pp_jan2016_summary.pdf?ua=1}}</ref> The recommended treatment for malaria is a [[antimalarial medication#Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)|combination]] of [[antimalarial medication]]s that includes [[artemisinin]].<ref name=Cara2014/><ref name=WHO2014/> The second medication may be either [[mefloquine]], [[lumefantrine]], or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.<ref name=WHO2010>{{cite book |title=Guidelines for the treatment of malaria|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-154792-5|page=ix|edition=2nd}}</ref> [[Quinine]], along with [[doxycycline]], may be used if artemisinin is not available.<ref name=WHO2010/> It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing [[drug resistance]].<ref name=WHO2014/> Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, [[chloroquine]]-resistant ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.<ref name=WHO2014>{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94 |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/ |website=WHO |access-date=28 August 2014|date=March 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140903002027/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|archive-date=3 September 2014}}</ref>

<!--Epidemiology, society, and culture-->
The disease is widespread in the [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions that exist in a broad band around the [[equator]].<ref name=Cara2014/> This includes much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]].<ref name=WHO2014/> In 2018 there were 228&nbsp;million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 405,000 deaths.<ref name=who2019/> Approximately 93% of the cases and 94% of deaths occurred in Africa.<ref name=who2019/> Rates of disease have decreased from 2010 to 2014 but increased from 2015 to 2017, during which there were 231&nbsp;million cases.<ref name="who2019">{{cite book |last1=WHO |title=World Malaria Report 2019 |date=2019 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Switzerland |isbn=978-92-4-156572-1 |pages=xii–xiii, 4–10 |url=https://www.who.int/publications-detail/world-malaria-report-2019}}</ref> Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on [[economic development]].<ref name="IftSoL"/><ref name="Worrall 2005"/> In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12&nbsp;billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and adverse effects on tourism.<ref name="Greenwood 2005"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of Malaria.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Main symptoms of malaria<ref name="PPID 2010"/>]]
The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection,<ref name="PPID 2010"/> but may occur later in those who have taken [[Malaria prophylaxis|antimalarial medications as prevention]].<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to [[flu|flu-like symptoms]],<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> and can resemble other conditions such as [[sepsis]], [[gastroenteritis]], and [[viral disease]]s.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> The presentation may include [[headache]], [[fever]], [[shivering]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[vomiting]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[jaundice]], [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]], [[Retinopathy|retinal damage]], and [[convulsion]]s.<ref name="Beare 2006"/>

The classic symptom of malaria is [[Paroxysmal attacks|paroxysm]]—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days ([[Fever#Types|tertian fever]]) in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections, and every three days ([[Fever#Types|quartan fever]]) for ''P.&nbsp;malariae''. ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.<ref name="Ferri 2009"/>

Severe malaria is usually caused by ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit [[neurological disorder|neurological]] symptoms, including [[abnormal posturing]], [[nystagmus]], [[conjugate gaze palsy]] (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), [[opisthotonus]], [[seizure]]s, or [[coma]].<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/>

===Complications===
Malaria has several serious [[Complication (medicine)|complications]]. Among these is the development of [[respiratory distress]], which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of [[metabolic acidosis]], noncardiogenic [[pulmonary oedema]], concomitant [[pneumonia]], and severe [[anaemia]]. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.<ref name="Taylor 2012"/> [[Coinfection]] of [[HIV]] with malaria increases mortality.<ref name="Korenromp 2005"/> [[Kidney failure]] is a feature of [[blackwater fever]], where haemoglobin from [[lysis|lysed]] red blood cells leaks into the urine.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/>

Infection with ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves [[encephalopathy]]. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.<ref name="Beare 2011"/> An [[Splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] or [[hepatosplenomegaly|both of these]], severe headache, [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], and [[hemoglobinuria|haemoglobin in the urine]] with [[kidney failure]] may occur.<ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/> Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, [[coagulopathy]], and [[circulatory shock|shock]].<ref>Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine/21st/351</ref>

[[Pregnancy-associated malaria|Malaria in pregnant women]] is an important cause of [[stillbirth]]s, [[infant mortality]], [[abortion]] and [[low birth weight]],<ref name="Hartman 2010"/> particularly in ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection, but also with ''P.&nbsp;vivax''.<ref name="Rijken 2012"/>

==Cause==
{{main|Plasmodium}}

Malaria [[parasite]]s belong to the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' (phylum [[Apicomplexa]]). In humans, malaria is caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P.&nbsp;falciparum]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P.&nbsp;malariae]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P.&nbsp;ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P.&nbsp;vivax]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P.&nbsp;knowlesi]]''.<ref name="Mueller 2007"/><ref name="Collins 2012"/> Among those infected, ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' (~20%).<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Although ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,<ref name="Sarkar 2009"/> recent evidence suggests that ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of ''P. falciparum'' infection.<ref name="Baird 2013"/> ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' proportionally is more common outside Africa.<ref name="Arnott 2012"/> There have been documented human infections with several species of ''Plasmodium'' from [[simian|higher apes]]; however, except for ''P.&nbsp;knowlesi''—a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] species that causes malaria in [[macaques]]<ref name="Collins 2012"/>—these are mostly of limited public health importance.<ref name="Collins 2009"/>

===Life cycle===
[[File:Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The life cycle of malaria parasites. A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, infect the insect and continue the life cycle.]]

In the [[Plasmodium#¬if cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA70 70–1]}}</ref>

Other merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilised mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]—a fertilised, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.<ref name="Cowman 2012"/>

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.<ref name="Arrow 2004"/> Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref name="Owusu-Ofori 2010"/>

===Recurrent malaria===
Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=vi}}</ref> Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood but persist as dormant [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|hypnozoites]] in liver cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markus MB | title = Malaria: origin of the term "hypnozoite" | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 781–6 | date = 2011 | pmid = 20665090 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/22a9a94fd803f97d7d145d7fa529b96a7177b8ed }}</ref> Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is often seen in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' infections.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> However, relapse-like ''P. vivax'' recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. Some of them might have an extra-vascular merozoite origin, making these recurrences recrudescences, not relapses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markus MB | title = Biological concepts in recurrent Plasmodium vivax malaria | journal = Parasitology | volume = 145 | issue = 13 | pages = 1765–1771 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 29564998 | doi = 10.1017/S003118201800032X }}</ref> One newly recognised, non-hypnozoite, possible contributing source to recurrent peripheral ''P. vivax'' parasitemia is erythrocytic forms in bone marrow.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markus MB | title = Malaria Eradication and the Hidden Parasite Reservoir | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 492–495 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28366603 | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2017.03.002 }}</ref> ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' malaria cases in [[temperate]] areas often involve [[overwintering]] by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.<ref name="White 2011"/> Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=17}}</ref> People may develop some [[premunity|immunity]] when exposed to frequent infections.<ref name="Tran 2012"/>

===Climate change===

==Pathophysiology==
{{further|Plasmodium falciparum#Pathogenesis}}
[[File:Maternal malaria placenta - cropped - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a [[placenta]] from a [[stillbirth]] due to maternal malaria. [[H&E stain]]. Red blood cells are anuclear; blue/black staining in bright red structures (red blood cells) indicate foreign nuclei from the parasites.]]
[[File:Red blood cells infected with malaria.jpg|thumb|Electron micrograph of a ''Plasmodium falciparum''-infected red blood cell (center), illustrating adhesion protein "knobs"]]

Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the [[liver]] (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or [[erythrocyte]]s (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/>

After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.<ref name="Vaughan 2008"/>

Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.<ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/>

Some ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years.<ref name="White 2011"/> After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&nbsp;vivax'' infections,<ref name="White 2011"/> although their existence in ''P.&nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.<ref name="Richter 2010"/>

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name="Tilley 2011"/> The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria.<ref name="Mens 2010"/> Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood–brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.<ref name="Rénia 2012"/>

===Genetic resistance===
{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}
According to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria—especially the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' species—it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pierron D, Heiske M, Razafindrazaka H, Pereda-Loth V, Sanchez J, Alva O, Arachiche A, Boland A, Olaso R, Deleuze JF, Ricaut FX, Rakotoarisoa JA, Radimilahy C, Stoneking M, Letellier T | display-authors = 6 | title = Strong selection during the last millennium for African ancestry in the admixed population of Madagascar | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 932 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29500350 | pmc = 5834599 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-03342-5 }}</ref><ref name="Kwiatkowski 2005"/><ref name="Hedrick 2011"/>

The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|haemoglobin&nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.<ref name="Hedrick 2011"/><ref name="Weatherall 2008"/>

===Liver dysfunction===
Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis''.<ref name="Bhalla 2006"/> While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.<ref name="Bhalla 2006"/>

Owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], fever, [[thrombocytopenia|low number of platelets]] in the blood, and [[hyperbilirubinemia|higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin]] in the blood combined with a normal level of [[white blood cells]].<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries where malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Manguin S, Foumane V, Besnard P, Fortes F, Carnevale P | title = Malaria overdiagnosis and subsequent overconsumption of antimalarial drugs in Angola: Consequences and effects on human health | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 171 | pages = 58–63 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28356231 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.03.022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Orish VN, Ansong JY, Onyeabor OS, Sanyaolu AO, Oyibo WA, Iriemenam NC | title = Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of malaria in children in a secondary healthcare centre in Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana | journal = Tropical Doctor | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 191–198 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 26738767 | doi = 10.1177/0049475515622861 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ad45f0fb954715d6e12f0e93cfb5d11d8b4e26b }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yegorov S, Galiwango RM, Ssemaganda A, Muwanga M, Wesonga I, Miiro G, Drajole DA, Kain KC, Kiwanuka N, Bagaya BS, Kaul R | display-authors = 6 | title = Low prevalence of laboratory-confirmed malaria in clinically diagnosed adult women from the Wakiso district of Uganda | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 555 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27842555 | pmc = 5109652 | doi = 10.1186/s12936-016-1604-z }}</ref>

Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of [[blood film]]s or by [[antigen]]-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|rapid diagnostic tests]] (RDT).<ref name="Abba 2011"/><ref name="Kattenberg 2011"/> In some areas, RDTs must be able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by ''Plasmodium falciparum'' or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-''P. falciparum'' infections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abba K, Kirkham AJ, Olliaro PL, Deeks JJ, Donegan S, Garner P, Takwoingi Y | title = Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD011431 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25519857 | pmc = 4453861 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd011431 }}</ref> Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165&nbsp;million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010.<ref name="Wilson 2012"/> Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of blood films ranges from 75 to 90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.<ref name="Wilson 2012"/> However, incorporating RDTs into the diagnosis of malaria can reduce antimalarial prescription. Although RDT does not improve the health outcomes of those infected with malaria, it also does not lead to worse outcomes when compared to presumptive antimalarial treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Odaga J, Sinclair D, Lokong JA, Donegan S, Hopkins H, Garner P | title = Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD008998 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24740584 | pmc = 4468923 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008998.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

In regions where laboratory tests are readily available, malaria should be suspected, and tested for, in any unwell person who has been in an area where malaria is endemic. In areas that cannot afford laboratory diagnostic tests, it has become common to use only a history of fever as the indication to treat for malaria—thus the common teaching "fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise". A drawback of this practice is [[overdiagnosis]] of malaria and mismanagement of non-malarial fever, which wastes limited resources, erodes confidence in the health care system, and contributes to drug resistance.<ref name="Perkins 2008"/> Although [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based tests have been developed, they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common as of 2012, due to their complexity.<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/>

===Classification===
Malaria is classified into either "severe" or "uncomplicated" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref name="Nadjm 2012"/> It is deemed severe when ''any'' of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=35}}</ref>
* Decreased consciousness
* Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk
* Inability to feed
* Two or more [[convulsions]]
* [[Low blood pressure]] (less than 70&nbsp;[[mmHg]] in adults and 50&nbsp;mmHg in children)
* [[respiratory distress|Breathing problems]]
* [[Circulatory shock]]
* [[Kidney failure]] or [[haemoglobin]] in the urine
* Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50&nbsp;g/L (5&nbsp;g/dL)
* [[Pulmonary oedema ]]
* [[Blood glucose]] less than 2.2&nbsp;mmol/L (40&nbsp;mg/dL)
* [[Acidosis]] or [[lactic acid|lactate]] levels of greater than 5&nbsp;mmol/L
* A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per [[microlitre]] (µL) in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per µL in high-intensity transmission areas

Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe ''P.&nbsp;falciparum''-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a [[Glasgow coma scale]] less than 11, or a [[Blantyre coma scale]] less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.<ref>{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=v}}</ref>

==Prevention==
<!-- The list of methods seems to put the least cost-effective first. What's the reason for that? -->
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|An ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'' mosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]

Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2020, there is one [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]] (known as [[RTS,S]]) which is licensed for use.<ref name=WHO2016/><ref name=WHO2020Fact/> The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.<ref name="whqlibdoc"/>

Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.<ref name="Sabot 2010"/>

In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anaemia]], which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Athuman M, Kabanywanyi AM, Rohwer AC | title = Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment for children with anaemia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD010767 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25582096 | pmc = 4447115 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010767.pub2 }}</ref>

===Mosquito control===
{{further|Mosquito control}}
[[File:Mansprayingkeroseneoil.jpg|thumb|left|Man spraying kerosene oil in standing water, [[Panama Canal Zone]], 1912]]
[[Vector control]] refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective [[insect repellent]]s are based on [[DEET]] or [[picaridin]].<ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/> However, there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maia MF, Kliner M, Richardson M, Lengeler C, Moore SJ | title = Mosquito repellents for malaria prevention | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD011595 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29405263 | pmc = 5815492 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011595.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref> Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s (ITNs) and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal| vauthors = Furnival-Adams J, Olanga EA, Napier M, Garner P |date=2020-10-15|title=House modifications for preventing malaria |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd013398.pub2|issn=1465-1858}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pryce J, Richardson M, Lengeler C | title = Insecticide-treated nets for preventing malaria | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD000363 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30398672 | pmc = 6418392 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000363.pub3 }}</ref><ref name="Pluess 2010"/> ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to completely eliminate the disease as these interventions depend on how many people use nets, how many gaps in insecticide there are (low coverage areas), if people are not protected when outside of the home, and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides.<ref name=":3" /> Modifications to people's houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure.<ref name=":3" /> 
[[File:Mosquitoes-Killedy-By-DDT-Lake-Victoria.JPG|thumb|right|Walls where indoor residual spraying of DDT has been applied. The mosquitoes remain on the wall until they fall down dead on the floor.]]

====Insecticide treated nets====
[[File:Mosquitonet149.jpg|thumb|A mosquito net in use.]]
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.<ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/> Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Howitt 2012"/> About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007<ref name="Miller 2007"/> and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7&nbsp;million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3&nbsp;million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6&nbsp;million children unprotected<ref name="Noor 2009"/> and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.<ref name = UNICEF2015/> Most nets are impregnated with [[pyrethroid]]s, a class of insecticides with low [[toxicity]]. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.<ref>{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&pg=PA215 215]}}</ref> It is recommended to hang a large "bed net" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.<ref>{{cite book|title=Instructions for treatment and use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets|date=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|page=34|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2002/WHO_CDS_RBM_2002.41.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706081401/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2002/WHO_CDS_RBM_2002.41.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-06}}</ref> ITN is beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gamble C, Ekwaru JP, ter Kuile FO | title = Insecticide-treated nets for preventing malaria in pregnancy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD003755 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16625591 | pmc = 6532581 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003755.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

In areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide combined with pyrethroids in ITN is effective in reducing malaria infection rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gleave K, Lissenden N, Richardson M, Choi L, Ranson H | title = Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in insecticide-treated nets to prevent malaria in Africa | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD012776 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30488945 | pmc = 6262905 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012776.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

====Indoor residual spraying====
Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.<ref name="Enayati 2010"/> As of 2006, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT]] and the pyrethroids [[cyfluthrin]] and [[deltamethrin]].<ref name="WHO Indoor Residual Spraying"/> This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the [[Stockholm Convention]], which prohibits its agricultural use.<ref name="van den Berg 2009"/> One problem with all forms of IRS is [[insecticide resistance]]. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.<ref name="Pates 2005"/> It is uncertain whether the use of IRS together with ITN is effective in reducing malaria cases due to wide geographical variety of malaria distribution, malaria transmission,  and insecticide resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria in communities using insecticide-treated nets | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | date = 2019-05-23 | pmid = 31120132 | pmc = 6532761 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012688.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

==== Housing modifications ====
Housing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as [[Pyrethroid|pyrethroids]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tusting LS, Ippolito MM, Willey BA, Kleinschmidt I, Dorsey G, Gosling RD, Lindsay SW | title = The evidence for improving housing to reduce malaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 209 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26055986 | pmc = 4460721 | doi = 10.1186/s12936-015-0724-1 }}</ref> The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations. Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites, drainage and water supply near the home, availability of mosquito resting sites (vegetation around the home), the proximity to live stock and domestic animals, and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering.<ref name=":3" />

====Other mosquito control methods====
People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, are effective in some locations.<ref name="Tusting 2013"/> Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.<ref name="Enayati 2007"/> There is a low certainty evidence that [[Fogging (insect control)|fogging]] may have an effect on malaria transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pryce J, Choi L, Richardson M, Malone D | title = Insecticide space spraying for preventing malaria transmission | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD012689 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30388303 | pmc = 6516806 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012689.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref> Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi L, Majambere S, Wilson AL | title = Larviciding to prevent malaria transmission | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 8 | pages = CD012736 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31425624 | pmc = 6699674 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012736.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref> There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walshe DP, Garner P, Adeel AA, Pyke GH, Burkot TR | title = Larvivorous fish for preventing malaria transmission | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD008090 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29226959 | pmc = 5741835 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008090.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

===Medications===
{{Main|Malaria prophylaxis}}
There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where ''Plasmodium'' is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—[[mefloquine]], [[doxycycline]], or the combination of [[atovaquone/proguanil]] (''Malarone'')—are frequently used for prevention.<ref name=Tic2017/> Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.<ref name=Tic2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tickell-Painter M, Maayan N, Saunders R, Pace C, Sinclair D | title = Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | pages = CD006491 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29083100 | pmc = 5686653 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006491.pub4 }}</ref> Areas of the world with [[chloroquine]]-sensitive malaria are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaria Worldwide – How Can Malaria Cases and Deaths Be Reduced? – Drug resistance in the Malaria Endemic World|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/drug_resistance.html|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Poirot E, Skarbinski J, Sinclair D, Kachur SP, Slutsker L, Hwang J | title = Mass drug administration for malaria | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD008846 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24318836 | pmc = 4468927 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008846.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).<ref name="Freedman 2008"/> The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.<ref name="Fernando 2011"/> During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of [[anaemia]] in the mother.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Radeva-Petrova D, Kayentao K, ter Kuile FO, Sinclair D, Garner P | title = Drugs for preventing malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas: any drug regimen versus placebo or no treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = CD000169 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25300703 | pmc = 4498495 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000169.pub3 }}</ref> The use of preventive drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.<ref name="Turschner 2009"/>

Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022215922/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|archive-date=2012-10-22|publisher=WHO|vauthors=Palmer J}}</ref> 

===Others===
Community participation and [[health education]] strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.<ref name="Lalloo 2006"/> Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.<ref name="Mehlhorn 2008"/> [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,<ref name="Bardají 2012"/> and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.<ref name="Meremikwu 2012"/>

Malaria is treated with [[antimalarial medication]]s; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease.

==History==
{{Main|History of malaria|Mosquito-malaria theory}}
[[File:Malaria pathogens.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient malaria oocysts preserved in [[Dominican amber]]]]
Although the parasite responsible for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture<ref name="Harper 2011"/> and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria may have originated in gorillas.<ref name="Prugnolle 2012"/>

References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history.<ref name="Cox 2002"/> Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian.<ref name="The Blakiston company">{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Richard P | name-list-style = vanc |title=Stitt's Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Tropical Diseases|date=1944|publisher=The Blakiston Company|location=York, PA|page=3|edition=Seventh}}</ref> The Roman [[Columella]] associated the disease with insects from swamps.<ref name="The Blakiston company"/> Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the [[Roman Empire]],<ref name="Sallares 2001"/> and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the "[[Roman Fever (disease)|Roman fever]]".<ref name="Sallares 2003"/> Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of [[Sardinia]], the [[Pontine Marshes]], the lower regions of coastal [[Etruria]] and the city of [[Rome]] along the [[Tiber]]. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, run-off from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.<ref name="Hays 2005"/> In Medieval [[West Africa]], the people of [[Djenné]] successfully identified the mosquito as the vector and cause of malaria.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Royal Kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay Life in Medieval Africa |last1=McKissack |first1=Patricia |last2=McKissack |first2=Fredrick | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Macmillan |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8050-4259-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/royalkingdomsofg00patr/page/104 104] |url=https://archive.org/details/royalkingdomsofg00patr/page/104 }}</ref>

[[File:Ronald Ross.jpg|thumb|left|British doctor [[Ronald Ross]] received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1902 for his work on malaria.]]

The term malaria originates from [[Middle Ages|Mediaeval]] {{lang-it|mala aria}}—"[[miasma theory of disease|bad air]]"; the disease was formerly called ''ague'' or ''marsh fever'' due to its association with swamps and marshland.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reiter P | title = From Shakespeare to Defoe: malaria in England in the Little Ice Age | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10653562 | pmc = 2627969 | doi = 10.3201/eid0601.000101 }}</ref> The term first appeared in the English literature about 1829.<ref name="The Blakiston company"/> Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,<ref name="Lindemann 1999"/> where it is no longer endemic,<ref name="Gratz 2006"/> though imported cases do occur.<ref name="Webb 2009"/>

Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]]—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in [[Algeria]]—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a [[protist]] was identified as causing disease.<ref name="Laveran bio"/> For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]]. A year later, [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor treating people with [[yellow fever]] in [[Havana]], provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.<ref name="Tan 2008"/> This work followed earlier suggestions by [[Josiah C. Nott]],<ref name="Chernin 1983"/> and work by [[Sir Patrick Manson]], the "father of tropical medicine", on the transmission of [[filariasis]].<ref name="Chernin 1977"/>

In April 1894, a Scottish physician, [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]], visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the [[Presidency General Hospital]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes.<ref name=":1" /> He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<ref name=":1" /> For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the [[Indian Medical Service]], Ross worked at the newly established [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and directed malaria-control efforts in [[Egypt]], [[Panama]], [[Greece]] and [[Mauritius]].<ref name="CDC Ross"/> The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by [[Walter Reed]] in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by [[William C. Gorgas]] in [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the health measures undertaken]] during construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.<ref name="Simmons 1979"/>

In 1896, [[Amico Bignami]] discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amico Bignami |url=https://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2484.html |website=www.whonamedit.com |access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> In 1898, Bignami, [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] and [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]] succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans, using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox FE | title = History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors | journal = Parasites & Vectors | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 5 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20205846 | pmc = 2825508 | doi = 10.1186/1756-3305-3-5 }}</ref>

[[File:Artemisia annua West Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|''Artemisia annua'', source of the antimalarial drug [[artemisinin]]]]

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. The [[indigenous peoples of Peru]] made a [[tincture]] of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the [[London Pharmacopoeia]] as an antimalarial treatment.<ref name="Kaufman 2005"/> It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]].<ref name="Pelletier 1820"/><ref name="Kyle 1974"/>

Quinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.<ref name="Achan 2011"/>

The medicinal value of ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' has been used by Chinese herbalists in [[traditional Chinese medicines]] for 2,000 years. In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his "[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]". Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist [[Tu Youyou]] and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant ''Artemisia annua'', became the recommended treatment for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials.<ref name="Hsu 2006"/> Tu says she was influenced by a [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese herbal medicine]] source, ''The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments'', written in 340 by [[Ge Hong]].<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Hao C |date=29 September 2011 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title=Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery |publisher=Science/AAAS |work=News: ScienceInsider |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104214759/http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |archive-date=4 January 2014 }}</ref> For her work on malaria, [[Tu Youyou]] received the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name=Nobel>{{cite web |title = Nobel Prize announcement |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/press.pdf |website = NobelPrize.org |access-date = 5 October 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006112430/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/press.pdf |archive-date = 6 October 2015 }}</ref>

''Plasmodium vivax'' was used between 1917 and the 1940s for [[malariotherapy]]—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary [[syphilis]]. In 1927, the inventor of this technique, [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]], received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.<ref name="Vogel 2013"/>

[[File:GuadMarinesMalaria.gif|thumb|U.S. Marines with malaria in a field hospital on [[Guadalcanal]], October 1942]]

The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was [[DDT]].<ref name="CDC history"/> Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to [[agriculture]]. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|pesticide-resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.<ref name="van den Berg 2009"/> Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.<ref name="Killeen 2002"/>

[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans.<ref name="Vanderberg 2009"/> The first vaccine, called [[RTS,S]], was approved by European regulators in 2015.<ref name="Walsh2015"/>

==Society and culture==
{{see also|World Malaria Day}}

=== Economic impact ===
[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|thumb|right|Malaria clinic in Tanzania]]

Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with [[poverty]]: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]].<ref name="IftSoL"/><ref name="Worrall 2005"/> Although [[Tropics|tropical regions]] are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.<ref name="Humphreys 2001"/>

A comparison of average per capita [[GDP]] in 1995, adjusted for [[purchasing power parity|parity of purchasing power]], between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<ref name="Sachs 2002"/>

Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12&nbsp;billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name="Greenwood 2005"/> The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.<ref name="Roll Back Malaria WHO"/>

[[File:Malaria Patient, Nyangaton, Ethiopia (15151075077).jpg|thumb|Child with malaria in [[Ethiopia]]]]
Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.<ref name="Idro 2010"/> Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.<ref name="Fernando 2010"/> Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.<ref name="Ricci 2012"/>

===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===
Sophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],<ref name="Lon 2006"/> [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name="Newton 2008"/> [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.<ref name="Newton 2006"/> The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries.<ref name="Parry 2005"/> There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.<ref name="Gautam 2009"/>

Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.<ref name="Caudron 2008"/> A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.<ref name="Nayyar 2012"/>

===War===
[[File:"Don't go to Bed with Malaria Mosquito" - NARA - 514146.tif|thumb|right|World War II poster]]
Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.<ref name="Russell 2009"/> In 1910, [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]]-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled ''The Prevention of Malaria'' that included a chapter titled "The Prevention of Malaria in War." The chapter's author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at [[Royal Army Medical College]] in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: "The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era.&nbsp;... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin."<ref name="Ross 1910"/> In British-occupied India the cocktail [[Gin and tonic#History|gin and tonic]] may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Bronwen Jean |last2=Knights |first2=Kathleen Mary | name-list-style = vanc |title=Pharmacology for Health Professionals |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Australia |isbn=9780729539296 |page=895 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQV6sLzYsOYC&pg=PA895 |language=en}}</ref>

Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.<ref name="Bray 2004"/> According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns."<ref name="Byrne 2008"/>

Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents. During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines. American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.<ref name="malariasite1"/>

Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA "was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic".<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Eradication efforts===
[[File:Members of the Malaria Commission on the Danube delta, 1929 Wellcome L0011626.jpg|thumb|Members of the Malaria Commission of the [[League of Nations]] collecting larvae on the [[Danube delta]], 1929]]
Several notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world or [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate it worldwide]]. In 2006, the organization [[Malaria No More]] set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished. In 2007, [[World Malaria Day]] was established by the 60th session of [[World Health Assembly|the World Health Assembly]]. As of 2018, they are still functioning.<ref name="Strom 2011"/> Only one [[malaria vaccine]] is licensed for use, while several others are in clinical trials <ref name=WHO2016/>, which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of transmission of the disease. {{As of|2012}}, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria]] has distributed 230&nbsp;million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria.<ref name="Global Fund"/> The U.S.-based [[Clinton Foundation]] has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.<ref name="WSJ 2008"/> Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites<ref name="Guerra 2007"/>. The [[Malaria Policy Advisory Committee]] (MPAC) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) was formed in 2012, "to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination".<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive summary and key points|url=https://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr13_summary_key_points.pdf?ua=1|work=World Malaria Report 2013|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=13 February 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091723/http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr13_summary_key_points.pdf?ua=1|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>  In November 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication's long-term goal.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Malaria Report 2013|url=https://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr2013_no_profiles.pdf?ua=1|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=13 February 2014 |format=PDF}}</ref>

Malaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, combined with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of [[wetland]] breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in [[water management]] practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.<ref name="Meade 2010"/> Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the United States in the early 20th century by such methods. The use of the [[pesticide]] DDT and other means eliminated it from the South's remaining pockets in the 1950s as part of the [[National Malaria Eradication Program]].<ref name="Williams 1963"/>

One of the targets of [[Sustainable Development Goal 3|Goal 3]] of the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030.

In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030<ref name=":0" />, and [[Bill Gates]] said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public-health-threats-and-pandemics/can-malaria-eradicated/p38243 |title=Can Malaria Be Eradicated? |first=Danielle |last=Radwick | name-list-style = vanc |date=October 5, 2016 |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201520/http://www.cfr.org/public-health-threats-and-pandemics/can-malaria-eradicated/p38243 |archive-date=October 5, 2016 }}</ref>

===Vaccine===
{{See also|Malaria vaccine}}
A vaccine against malaria called [[RTS,S|RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S)]] was approved by European regulators in 2015.<ref name="Walsh2015"/> As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – as part of the WHO's Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/ |title=Q&A on the malaria vaccine implementation programme (MVIP) | author = World Health Organization|date= March 2020|publisher= WHO|access-date= 6 May 2020}}</ref>
 
Immunity (or, more accurately, [[immune tolerance|tolerance]]) to ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.<ref name="Tran 2012"/> An individual can be protected from a ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of [[X-ray]] [[irradiation]].<ref name="Hill 2011"/> The highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] nature of many ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'' proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce [[antibodies]] in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.<ref name="Cromptom 2010"/> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.<ref name="Graves 2006b"/> For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]] was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.<ref name="Graves 2006"/>

===Medications===
Malaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite [[metabolism]], such as [[fatty acid biosynthesis]]. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs.<ref name="Kalanon 2010"/>

With the onset of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'' parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic [[pyridoxal]]-amino acid [[adduct]]s, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential [[B vitamin]]s.<ref name="Müller 2010"/><ref name="Du 2011"/> Antimalarial drugs using [[Organometallic chemistry|synthetic metal-based]] [[coordination complex|complexes]] are attracting research interest.<ref name="Biot 2012"/><ref name="Roux 2012"/>
* (+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called [[spiroindolone]]. It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells. This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model. As of 2014, a [[Phases of clinical research#Phase 1|Phase 1 clinical trial]] to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].<ref name=atp4>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/new-malaria-drug-unleashes-immune-system-assault-infected-cells/2014-12-08|title=New malaria drug unleashes an immune system assault on infected cells| first  = Carroll | last = John | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=8 December 2014|access-date=16 December 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404040409/http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/new-malaria-drug-unleashes-immune-system-assault-infected-cells/2014-12-08|archive-date=4 April 2016}}</ref>

===Other===
A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in [[genetic engineering]] technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. [[Sterile insect technique]] is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.<ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/>

[[Genomics]] is central to malaria research. With the [[whole genome sequencing|sequencing]] of ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'', one of its vectors ''Anopheles gambiae'', and the [[human genome]], the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied.<ref name="Aultman 2002"/> Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing [[biological control]] of malaria transmission.<ref name="Ito 2002"/>

In one study, a genetically-modified strain of ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'' was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gantz VM, Jasinskiene N, Tatarenkova O, Fazekas A, Macias VM, Bier E, James AA | title = Highly efficient Cas9-mediated gene drive for population modification of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 49 | pages = E6736-43 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26598698 | pmc = 4679060 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1521077112 }}</ref>

Nearly 200 parasitic ''Plasmodium'' species have been identified that infect [[Plasmodium species infecting birds|birds]], [[Plasmodium species infecting reptiles|reptiles]], and [[Plasmodium species infecting mammals other than primates|other mammals]],<ref name="Rich 2006"/> and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates.<ref name="Baird 2009"/> Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as [[model organism]]s for human malarial parasites, such as ''[[Plasmodium coatneyi|P.&nbsp;coatneyi]]'' (a model for ''P.&nbsp;falciparum'') and ''[[Plasmodium cynomolgi|P.&nbsp;cynomolgi]]'' (''P.&nbsp;vivax''). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans.<ref name="Ameri 2010"/> Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as ''[[Plasmodium berghei|P.&nbsp;berghei]]''.<ref name="Mlambo 2008"/> [[Avian malaria]] primarily affects species of the order [[Passeriformes]], and poses a substantial threat to birds of [[Hawaii]], the [[Galapagos]], and other [[archipelago]]es. The parasite ''[[Plasmodium relictum|P.&nbsp;relictum]]'' is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of [[endemic birds of Hawaii|endemic Hawaiian birds]]. [[Global warming]] is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of [[avian malaria]], as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.<ref name="LaPointe 2012"/>
