Williamson attended [[Houston Independent School District|Houston ISD]]'s [[Bellaire High School (Texas)|Bellaire High School]]. After graduating, she spent two years studying theater and philosophy at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], where she was a roommate of eventual film producer [[Lynda Obst]].<ref name="People92" /> In 1973, Williamson—an active antiwar protester—dropped out of college and lived "a nomadic existence" during what she calls "her wasted decade."<ref name="People92"/><ref name=JTA/><ref name=Greensboro>{{cite news|last=Capuzzo|first=Mike|title=THE PROPHET, MARIANNE ''HOLLYWOOD'S ANSWER TO GOD'|url=https://www.greensboro.com/the-prophet-marianne-hollywood-s-answer-to-god/article_84db671f-f4ad-53fc-8080-b37a82c295ee.html|newspaper=Greensboro News & Record|date=May 29, 1993}}</ref> She moved to New Mexico, where she took classes at the [[University of New Mexico]] and lived in a [[geodesic dome]] with her boyfriend.<ref name=Greensboro/><ref name=KQED/> She broke up with her boyfriend a year later and moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where she took classes at the [[University of Texas]].<ref name=KQED/> After leaving Texas, she went to New York City, intending to pursue a career as a cabaret singer, but got distracted by "bad boys and good dope."<ref name=People92/><ref name=LAMag>{{cite web|author=Monica Corcoran Harel|title=The New Age of Marianne Williamson|magazine=Los Angeles Magazine|url=https://www.lamag.com/longform/the-new-age-of-marianne-williamson/|date=May 27, 2014}}</ref> [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] wrote that Williamson "spent her twenties in a growing state of existential despair".<ref name=VanityFair/> In New York, Williamson suffered from [[Depression (mood)|deep depression]] following the end of a relationship.<ref name=LATimes92/> She has said that this experience gave rise to a desire to spend the rest of her life helping people.<ref name=VanityFair/>

==''A Course in Miracles''==
[[File:ACIM3COVER.jpg|thumb|''A Course in Miracles'']]
In 1975, [[Helen Schucman]] published ''A Course in Miracles,'' a curriculum for spiritual transformation. Schucman was a clinical psychologist and research psychologist who was a professor of medical psychology at [[Columbia University]] from 1958 to 1976. After being in a long-term "stressful professional environment," and seeking a way to address the contention, Schucman began to have a series of inner experiences that she understood as visions, dreams, heightened imagery, and an "inner voice" that reportedly revealed itself to her as [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]].<ref name=VanityFair/>

A year after the book was published, Williamson (who was experiencing confusion about God and wondering why He allowed so much pain in the world) was at a party in New York and picked up a copy of ''A Course in Miracles'' from a coffee table.<ref name=DailyRecord>{{cite news|last=Lett|first=Alexsandra|title=Marianne Williamson Spreads Message Of Unity|publisher=The Daily Record|url=http://mydailyrecord.com/stories/marianne-williamson-spreads-message-of-unity,4174|date=January 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Elle>{{cite news|last=Fortini|first=Amanda|title=Marianne Williamson is Campaigning for a Miracle|magazine=Elle|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/interviews/a12708/marianne-williamson-profile/|date=April 25, 2014}}</ref> She dismissed the book because, being Jewish, she was put off by its Christian terminology.<ref name=JTA/> Williamson then moved to San Francisco. While there, she developed an interest in spirituality, [[metaphysics]], and meditation. She began reading the ''Course'' "passionately" and doing its 365 daily exercises.<ref name=LAMag/> She also reconciled it with her Jewishness; in her view, "A conversion to Christ is not a conversion to Christianity. It is a conversion to a conviction of the heart. [[Messiah|The Messiah]] is not a person but a point of view".<ref name=VanityFair/>

Williamson said that the book was her "path out of hell," as she had been "mired in a series of unhappy love affairs, alcohol and drug abuse, a nervous breakdown, and endless sessions with therapists."<ref name=CBS>{{cite news|last=Weig|first=Nick|title=PROFILE: Marianne Williamson|publisher=CBS|url=https://cbs2iowa.com/news/beyond-the-podium/profile-marianne-williamson|date=February 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name=ChiTrib>{{cite news|last=Micucci|first=Dana|title=Anytime you try to be a loving...|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-03-29-9201280964-story.html|date=March 29, 1992}}</ref><ref name=HouChron>{{cite news|last=Tolson|first=Mike|title=Houston-raised Marianne Williamson eyes a California congressional seat|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/features/article/Houston-raised-Marianne-Williamson-eyes-a-5413597.php|date=April 18, 2014}}</ref><ref name=DailyRecord/> She was captivated by the book's message on forgiveness, specifically the notion that one cannot find peace in life without forgiving others. Williamson said that made her realize "how many of my problems stemmed from my fear of other people."<ref name=LATimes92/>

The Course has often been described as a [[religion]] or [[pseudoreligion]].<ref name=Dream>{{cite news|author=James D. Davis|title=LIFE IS BUT A DREAM THERE IS NO PROBLEM A LITTLE "SPIRITUAL AWAKENING" CAN'T SOLVE, SAY PROPONENTS OF A NEW AGE PHILOSOPHY CALLED A COURSE IN MIRACLES.|publisher=South Florida Sun Sentinel|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1993-03-07-9301130978-story.html|date=March 7, 1993}}</ref><ref name=Themselves>{{cite news|author=James D.

{{quote|''A Course in Miracles'' [is] a self-study program in spiritual [[psychotherapy]]. It is a book that is based on universal spiritual themes. It is ''not'' a religion. It does not claim any kind of monopoly on truth. It has no dogma. It has no doctrine. It talks about love and [[forgiveness]] and I think that many of the people who are students of ''A Course in Miracles'' come from all religions and even no religion. The book says nothing about [Jesus]. The book does not get us to try to believe in [[God]].

==Teaching==
[[File:Marianne Williamson (46644115172).jpg|thumb|right|Williamson, 2019]]
In 1979, Williamson returned to Houston, where she ran a [[metaphysical]] bookstore coffeeshop, sang [[George Gershwin|Gershwin standards]] in a nightclub, got married and divorced "almost immediately," and underwent a "spiritual surrender".<ref name=People92/><ref name=LAMag/><ref name=WaPost>{{cite news|last=Leiby|first=Richard|title=Marianne Williamson, Hollywood self-help guru, wants to heal Washington|newspaper=Washington Post|url=http://mydailyrecord.com/stories/marianne-williamson-spreads-message-of-unity,4174|date=May 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Greensboro/>

In 1983, Williamson had what she has called a "flash" to close the coffeeshop and move to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=LAMag/> She said she felt the city would be welcoming to her because of its willingness to "start new conversations."<ref name=LAMag/> She made the move with $1,000 in her pocket.<ref name=VanityFair/> She got an apartment in Hollywood. Her roommate was 17-year-old [[Laura Dern]], who noted that Williamson "held prayer groups in our living room."<ref name=Elle/> Williamson got a job at the [[Philosophical Research Society]]. As part of their lecture series, she started speaking about ''A Course in Miracles'' as "a self-study program of spiritual psychotherapy."<ref name=JTA/> Her lectures were grounded in her belief that by consulting the ''Course'', every problem can be solved, and that miracles are possible through a change in perspective.<ref name=LATimes92/> According to Williamson, "All that a miracle is<!--not a mistake--> is a shift in perception from fear to love.  It’s simply the notion that when your world view changes, your behavior changes".<ref name=WaPost/>

Williamson's teachings stemmed from an inspirational message: "Divine love is the core and essence of every human mind."<ref name=Keswick>{{cite news|last= Remsen|first= Jim|title=New Age Star Marianne Williamson Speaking at Keswick|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=April 2, 2000}}</ref> She saw this message as a remedy to misinterpretations of the Bible that, through an emphasis on sin and guilt, could lead to harm (e.g. slavery, depression, self-loathing).<ref name=Keswick/><ref name=VanityFair/> Initially, only a few people attended her lectures. But as word spread about "the young woman talking about a God who loves you, no matter what", she had to rent church space to accommodate the demand to see her.<ref name=VanityFair/><ref name=LAMag/> Four years later, she began lecturing monthly in New York. Eventually she was invited to speak throughout the U.S. and Europe. Williamson did not charge for her lectures, but had a "suggested donation" of $7 ($15 as of 2014) and a policy of not turning people away for lack of money.<ref name=LAMag/>

Williamson's style was called a "trendy amalgam of Christianity, Buddhism, pop psychology and 12-step recovery wisdom".<ref name=People92/><ref name=LAMag/> The attraction of her teaching was said to have been "its focus on the power of the individual to conquer all without the help of stodgy institutions that are out of touch with modern generations."<ref name=NeedHer>{{cite web|author=Simon Sebag Montefiore|title=Marianne Williamson: Who Is She & Why Do We Need Her Now?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199207/marianne-williamson-who-is-she-why-do-we-need-her-now|website=Psychology Today|date=July 1, 1992}}</ref> People were said to have been drawn to her relatability (given her struggles in her own life) and to her [[Eloquence|oratory]].<ref name=NeedHer/> Williamson "filled a void left by the isolationism of established Christianity and [[Judaism]], maintained an open-door policy with her teaching, but did not engage in actively evangelizing the ''Course,'' saying that she believed doing so would devalue the spirit of the teaching".<ref name=People92/>

==Pastor==
At the height of her popularity, in 1998, Williamson sold her $2.7 million home. She decided to stop teaching and join the ministry. She said, "I had a lot going on in my life. I just felt I had to leave. I had a baby."<ref name= LAMag />{{failed verification|date=September 2019}} Williamson said that becoming a pastor was a way "to get dirt in her fingers again"—"to experience the day-to-day lives of hundreds of people"—and would be helpful in her work as a spiritual guide.<ref name=BowsOut>{{cite web |title=Marianne Williamson Bows Out as Pastor|publisher= Belief Net|url= https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2002/09/marianne-williamson-bows-out-as-pastor.aspx}}</ref>

Williamson became the "spiritual leader" for the Church of Today, a [[Unity Church]] in [[Warren, Michigan]], where she had 2,300 congregants and 50,000 television viewers.<ref name=DailyRecord/> She booked high-profile musical guests such as [[Aerosmith|Aerosmith's]] [[Steven Tyler]], expanded the bookstore, more than tripled declining church membership, increased the congregation's racial and sexual orientation diversity, brought the church out of mounting debt, and grew the church into one of the country's biggest Unity churches.<ref name=Keswick/><ref name=LAMag/><ref name= Restored>{{cite news| first = Alex | last = Capeloto|title= Warren Church is restoring calm, in the name of Unity| work = [[Detroit Free Press]]|date= January 8, 2003}}</ref><ref name= Upheaval>{{cite news| first = Alex | last = Capeloto|title= Upheaval of church surprises members| work =Detroit Free Press |date=November 1, 2001}}</ref><ref name= Unrest>{{cite news| first = Alexa | last = Capeloto|title= Unrest lurks as Unity church faces changes| work =Detroit Free Press|date=November 4, 2002}}</ref>

Williamson was said to be well-liked among the congregation, with 90 percent voting to approve her proposal to dissolve the church's formal affiliation with Unity Church and make it an [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] spiritual center with a broader mission.  But board members were reportedly "alienated" by and staff members "fearful" of her temper.<ref name= Restored/> Williamson scoffed at accusations that she was overly intimidating, and rebuffed them with a [[Marlo Thomas]] quote: "For a man to be considered ruthless, he has to bomb Cambodia.  For a woman to be considered ruthless she has to put you on hold".<ref name=Unrest /> A small group of longtime congregants, led by an attorney, threatened a lawsuit against her in order to prevent her from severing ties with the Unity Church.<ref name=Unrest/>

Additional internal disagreements between Williamson and the board over the direction of the church—stemming from her teachings on social justice, her not getting ordained, the board questioning church finances and firings under her leadership, and her renaming the church the "[[Renaissance Unity Interfaith Spiritual Fellowship]]"—led over half of the church's 62 staff members to take steps to unionize, saying they didn't feel "respected" by Williamson, that they wanted more money, and they wanted a bigger voice in the direction of the church.<ref name=Belief/><ref name= Restored/><ref name= Pushed>{{cite news| via = [[Associated Press]]|title= Chruch Split Over Leader's Departure: Some say critics pushed author out in Warren | work =Lansing State Journal |date= November 5, 2002}}</ref>

Williamson resigned from the Church Renaissance Unity Interfaith Spiritual Fellowship in 2003 amid speculation that she otherwise would have been fired.<ref name= Belief/> Upon leaving the church, Williamson said of the experience:
{{quote|I touched a nerve that I didn't know was there. [...] When I was just writing books and giving lectures, if people disagreed, they just didn't buy your book or attend your lectures. But, if you're leading a congregation, people feel they have the right to tell you what you should or shouldn't talk about. And that hasn't always been easy for me.<ref name=Belief/>}}

Following her departure, congregation members wrote to local newspapers voicing their support of Williamson.<ref name=Upheld>{{cite news |title=Pastor upheld service, diversity| work = [[Detroit Free Press]]|date= February 8, 2002}}</ref> Williamson remained a guest minister at the church.<ref name= LAMag /> She moved back to Los Angeles in 2009.

{{quote|Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.}}

Williamson has said that she often wonders why "so many people in the richest country in the world have to constantly transcend material conditions that are so unnecessary."<ref name=Reason>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Jesse|title=Marianne Williamson Wants To Win the Presidency With the Power of Love and Miracles|magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]]|url=https://reason.com/2019/07/13/marianne-williamson-wants-to-win-the-presidency-with-the-power-of-love-and-miracles/|date=July 13, 2019|author-link=Jesse Walker}}</ref>

In the 1980s Williamson began founding charities based on the principles in the ''Course''.<ref name=Elle/>

===Centers for Living===
In 1987, during lunch with a close friend who was struggling with breast cancer, Williamson's friend expressed a need for help: "She said that for years she had been looking for someone to help her heal and now she needed someone to help her die."<ref name=VanityFair/> This request inspired Williamson to create the Center for Living.

After [[David Geffen]] contributed $50,000, Williamson co-founded the organization with Louise Hay—a minister of the [[Religious Science|New Thought Church of Religious Science]] who claimed to have healed herself of cancer—as a refuge from, and to offer non-medical support for, people with "life-challenging illnesses."<ref name=People92/><ref name=VanityFair/> Williamson took no salary from the organization.

The Center for Living began helping many patients afflicted with [[HIV/AIDS]], particularly gay men, whom it welcomed and accepted when other places shunned them.<ref name=LAMag/> The Center provided services such as house-cleaning, meditation, massage and community/psychological/emotional support throughout Los Angeles.<ref name=People92/>

In 1989, with another $50,000 from Geffen, Williamson opened another Center for Living in New York,<ref name=VanityFair/> but it was hampered by conflict between staff and the board over Williamson's management style, which an unnamed former associate described as "very controlling."<ref name=LATimes92/> There was also a rift because, while the Los Angeles Center welcomed Williamson's use of prayer in her teachings and the use of the word "God", the more secular New York Center rebuked it.<ref name=VanityFair/>

{{quote|Someone said you would hear checkbooks slamming shut all over Sotheby’s (site of a fund-raising auction) if Marianne got up and led everyone in prayer.<ref name=LATimes92/>|Jean Halberstam, ''Journalist''}}

Williamson grew frustrated with being asked to not pray:<ref name=Prophet>{{cite news|last=Servin|first=James|title=Prophet of Love Has the Timing Of a Comedian|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/garden/prophet-of-love-has-the-timing-of-a-comedian.html|date=February 19, 1992}}</ref>

{{quote|God is definitely out of the closet. I refuse to pretend we don't pray here. One of the reasons the political right-wing in this country has had such an upsurge in popularity is because they have at least acknowledged the idea of God, and the so-called liberals have lost by default. The left-wing is too cool to even mention God, so -- [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] thinks, 'Well, I guess God's in the Republican Party.'<ref name=VanityFair/>}}

A few months later, after two of her board members told ''Vanity Fair'' that she wanted "to be famous", Williamson deemed that she was being treated as "expendable" and purged the board of several members, including film director [[Mike Nichols]], and the head of the New York Center.<ref name=LATimes92/> Some people believed Williamson was losing trust in several board members and preemptively fired them before they fired her. She disputed that, claiming that she intended to step down as president and wanted to give her successor a clean slate.<ref name=LATimes92/>

The two coastal Centers ended up parting ways, with Nichols going on to create a rival AIDS support organization.

Williamson's defenders said that, as the founder and president of the board, she was within her rights to want a staff aligned with her vision, and that it was "unfair to charge her with a mania for control simply because she didn't want her creation usurped by hostile rivals":<ref name=VanityFair/>

Williamson stepped down from the Center in the summer of 1992. The New York Center was able to remain open following a donation from Cher.<ref name=Prophet/> Williamson gave the organization a $50,000 check and "graciously walked away."<ref name=LAMag/> She remained an advisor to the organization.

===Project Angel Food===
In 1989, Williamson launched [[Project Angel Food]] to support HIV/AIDS patients. The program was operated by The Centers for Living, but became so successful that its name recognition outgrew its parent company.<ref name=Fueds>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Scott|title=Project Angel Food Rocked by Feuds|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 26, 1992}}</ref> By 1992 it had raised over $1.5 million and was delivering nearly 400 hot meals a day to home-bound AIDS patients in Los Angeles.<ref name=People92/> Williamson deemed the demand for the organization's services to be a positive sign about HIV/AIDS:

{{quote|It means that more and more people are ''living'' with AIDS, not ''dying'' of AIDS. It means we're getting closer and closer to making AIDS a chronic, manageable disease.<ref name=Auction>{{cite news|last=Allman|first=Kevin|title=Fantasy Auction Going, Going, Gone...|newspaper=LA Times|date=1 Oct 1991}}</ref>}}

Williamson resigned from Project Angel Food in March 1992 amid infighting, two months after the board fired executive director and gay activist Steve Schulte, with some speculating that Williamson—who had been open about her wanting him gone—was responsible for the firing.<ref name=LATimes92/><ref name=Fueds/> Schulte, who had been the Center's third executive director in five years, was well-liked among the employees because he lobbied for salary increases, but clashed with Williamson over the operational approach to running the organization. His firing led a majority of the remaining employees to call for Williamson's resignation, his reinstatement, the replacement of the entire board, and unionization if Williamson remained.<ref name=Fueds/> Stephen Bennett, a consultant hired to assess the situation, determined that there were more paid staff on hand than needed, but with a union vote pending, Bennett refused to lay employees off. It was determined that the best option was for Williamson to resign.<ref name=Fueds/>

Williamson was reportedly torn about stepping down and "very opposed to the unionization of volunteer organizations."<ref name=Fueds/>

The organization made no announcement about Williamson's departure, and following her resignation, the employees decided not to unionize.<ref name=Fueds/> The organization initially struggled in her absence, as she had been its most effective fundraiser.<ref name=Fueds/> Within six months of her departure, the organization was restructured. Over 35 percent of the staff was laid off and counseling services were ceased to over 200 clients, which staff who had been loyal to her called "karmic payback for pushing Marianne out of the picture."<ref name="Fueds" /><ref name="Revamp">{{cite news|title=Los Angeles: Agency Revamps it AIDS Services|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 28, 1998}}</ref>

Project Angel Food was able to remain operational after Williamson's departure. By 1998 it had over 1,500 volunteers and nearly 1,000 clients.<ref name="Solace">{{cite news|author=John M.

====AIDS work====
Williamson has been credited with helping thousands of gay men who "were told that they weren't loved by their family and friends, employers, politicians, hospitals. [...] It was more about that feeling of hope that she gave to all these people, and they all died."<ref name=Enter>{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Emily|title=Marianne Williamson Wants Politics to Enter The New Age|magazine=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/marianne-williamson-wants-politics-to-enter-the-new-age|date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> Calling herself a "midwife to the dying", Williamson officiated at funerals, drove men to the doctor, and paid for patients' AIDS medication.<ref name=MotherJones/><ref name=GayDivide>{{cite web|last=Cauterucci|first=Christina|title=The Gay Divide Over Marianne Williamson|magazine=Slate Magazine|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/marianne-williamson-aids-crisis-history-gay-community.html|date=August 14, 2019}}</ref> Some who worked with her said that Williamson was "at the center" of the tragedy, assisting patients without regard.<ref name=Enter/>

During her 2020 presidential campaign, Williamson has often been accused of telling gay men not to take medication for AIDS, of implying that they were "not positive enough" to counter the disease, of telling them that they "deserved" the disease, and of telling them to "pray the AIDS away".<ref name=GayDivide/> She has repeatedly denied these accusations, as have several gay men who worked with her at the time.<ref name=GayDivide/><ref name=Cooper>{{cite video|date=August 1, 2019|title=Cooper presses Williamson on her mental health views|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m7WgSP-RqE|publisher=CNN|time=0m00s}}</ref>  Most of the accusations stem from excerpts or paraphrases of her 1992 book ''[[A Return to Love]]''.<ref name=Time>{{cite news|last=Abrams|first=Abagail|title=Experts Criticize Marianne Williamson's Views on Vaccines, Depression and Illness|magazine=Time|url=https://time.com/5644331/marianne-williamson-health-science-skepticism/}}</ref><ref name=TNR>{{cite news|title=Marianne Williamson's Spiritualism Has Deep, Liberal Roots|website=The New Republic|date=August 7, 2019|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/154690/marianne-williamson-liberal-spiritualism|access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref> But she says that the excerpts and paraphrases distort her meaning.

* '''Full quote''': "Love changes the way we think about our disease. Illness comes from separation, says ''A Course in Miracles'', and healing comes from joining. Of course people hate their cancer, or hate their AIDS, but the last thing a sick person needs is something else to hate about themselves. Healing results from a transformed perception of our relationship to illness, one in which we respond to the problem with love instead of fear. When a child presents a cut finger to his or her mother, the woman doesn’t say, 'Bad cut.' Rather, she kisses the finger, showers it with love in an unconscious, instinctive activation of the healing process. Why should we think differently about critical illness? Cancer and AIDS and other serious illnesses are physical manifestations of a psychic scream, and their message is not 'Hate me,' but 'Love me.'"<ref name=Return/>

A miracle worker’s job is not to attack illness, but rather to stimulate the natural forces of healing. We turn our eyes away from sickness to the love that lies beyond it. No sickness can diminish our capacity to love. Does that mean that it is a mistake to take medicine? Absolutely not."<ref name=Return/>

As we said before, a scream responds best to love. That is when it calms down. That is when it stops."<ref name=Return/>

Detractors accuse Williamson of being a [[Confidence trick|grifter]] who "deluded dying men to concentrate on their spiritual well-being rather than on activism."<ref name="GayDivide"/> Supporters say she is being maligned for a book written nearly 30 years ago, when the understanding of HIV/AIDS was in its infancy, which provided "solace to gay men when they were afflicted with paranoia, loneliness, and grief." She is said to have emphasized the [[Efficacy of prayer|healing power of prayer]], believing that God can respond to prayers through medicine and science, and would lead prayers for a medical solution to AIDS.<ref name="GayDivide"/>

Williamson has said that at that time, when the medical industry had no cure or treatment for the disease—contracting it "was a death sentence"—and there was a "weird silence" from organized religion, gay men came to her because she was "talking about a God who loves you no matter what and miracles."<ref name="KQED" /> She credits gay men in Los Angeles for her career,<ref name="KQED"/> saying that they were living through a traumatic experience, dealing with the stress of guilt, shame, dying, and, in many cases, telling unsupportive family, and that they began coming to her lectures because:

{{quote|I was talking every week about how love worked miracles and how, as long as we loved each other, everything was going to be ok.<ref name=KQED/>}}

Williamson's viewpoint of healing—of prayer and medicine—has been called unscientific, but also regarded as no different than the viewpoint of [[organized religion|other religions]].<ref name=Skeptic>{{cite news|last=Flam|first=Faye|title=Marianne Williamson Isn't Anti-Science; She's a Skeptic|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-31/marianne-williamson-isn-t-anti-science-she-s-a-skeptic|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=July 31, 2019}}</ref>

===The Peace Alliance===
[[File:Peace Alliance wordmark.png|thumb|right]]
In 1998 Williamson co-founded the non-profit Global Renaissance Alliance (GSA) with ''[[Conversations with God]]'' author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].<ref name=Keswick/> The organization established a network of "citizen salons" to pray for national growth, peace and liberal causes.

According to Williamson, the GSA sat in small groups, "Peace Circles", of fewer than 12 people every other week and prayed together to articulate a vision for what they want, rather than what others don't want.<ref name=GSA>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Marianne|title=A New Movement for Peace|publisher=The Conversation|url=http://theconversation.org/archive/movement.html|date=April 2, 2002}}</ref>

In 2004 the GSA's name was changed to [[Peace Alliance|The Peace Alliance]] and given a new mandate focused on grassroots education and advocacy organization with the intent of increasing U.S. government support for peace-building approaches to domestic and international conflicts. The Peace Alliance taught peace activists how to lobby their congressional representatives.<ref name=Kucinich>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Kucinich finds support in peace activists|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 31, 2003}}</ref> Williamson said of the need for this work:

{{quote|You don't just wait until there is a violent eruption and then just try to throw people in jail or just wait until there is a violent eruption and then try to bomb an entire country, there's just a limit past which this is not workable. Rather, you proactively seek to cultivate the conditions of peace.

The Peace Alliance seeks the establishment of a [[Department of Peace|U.S. Department of Peace]]. In 2005 Williamson traveled to Washington to help Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich|Dennis Kucinich's]] effort to establish the department.

The Alliance has raised over $100 million in funding for international peace-building. It has also helped get provisions of the [[Youth PROMISE Act]], embedded in the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], passed into law.<ref name=Alliance>{{cite web|title=About Us|website=The Peace Alliance|url=https://peacealliance.org/about-us/history/}}</ref> The California Democratic Party adopted key Peace Alliance priorities into its platform.

===RESULTS===
For several years until 2017, Williamson was a board member of [[Results (organisation)|Results Educational Fund (RESULTS)]], a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity dedicated to finding long-term solutions to [[poverty]] by focusing on its root causes, and its sister organization, Results Inc., a 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organization that encourages "grassroots advocates to lobby their elected officials" and works "directly with Congress and other U.S. policymakers to shape and advance" anti-poverty policies. The organization has 100 U.S. local chapters and works in six other countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Tony |date=2006 |title=Changing The Face of Hunger |publisher=Thomas Nelson |page=194 |isbn=0-8499-1869-3  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcrUf-r2ZYkC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Turning Compassion into a Political Force |url=https://www.results.org/events/IC_2012_Marianne_Williamson |website=Results.org |access-date=November 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106092934/https://www.results.org/events/IC_2012_Marianne_Williamson |archive-date=November 6, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Huffington Post"/>

Williamson continues to serve on a "Council of Advisors," providing informal advice to the organizations.<ref name=Integrity/>

===Love America Tour===
In the winter of 2018, Williamson began touring the United States as part of her ''Love America Tour'', two-hour sessions discussing her belief that "a revolution in consciousness paves the way to both personal and national renewal." She used the slogan "Ignite the Change" to propel the tour along with the message:

{{quote|Our own disconnection from the political process, lack of knowledge of how our system operates, lack of understanding of our history, and confusion about many of the issues that confront us now, have led in too many cases to a dangerous emotional disconnection between our country and ourselves.<ref name=Belief>{{cite news |title=Marianne Williamson bringing her 'Love America' tour to Detroit |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/05/15/marianne-williamson-bringing-love-america-tour-detroit/610713002/ |publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>}}

Williamson likened her message to that of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] when he said:

{{quote|Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.<ref name=DailyRecord/>}}

In 2014 Williamson ran as an [[Independent politician#Congress – House of Representatives and Senate|Independent]] for [[California's 33rd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2014|U.S. House of Representatives]].  She was praised as a "tireless" campaigner but criticized for not articulating specifics in her plans. Her supporters deemed her lack of plans a strength and said she was not a "made-to-order candidate" who gave "lip service."<ref name=LAMag/>

Prominent elected and public officials endorsed her campaign, including Ben Cohen (of [[Ben & Jerry's|Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream]]); former governors [[Jennifer Granholm]] and [[Jesse Ventura]]; former representatives [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Grayson]]; and [[Van Jones]].<ref name=Integrity/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mwfc-timwayne.nationbuilder.com/endorsements|title=Endorsements|website=Marianne Williamson for Congress}}</ref> [[Alanis Morissette]] wrote and performed Williamson's [[campaign song]], "Today".<ref>{{cite news |title=Alanis Morissette cuts campaign song for Calif. candidate |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/205332-alanis-morissette-cuts-campaign-ad-for-long-shot-candidate |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 6, 2014}}</ref>

====Qualifications====
[[File:Marianne Williamson- "Twas always thus".webm|thumb|right|Marianne Williamson –– "Twas always thus", Nov. 2011]]
Williamson said that her lack of elective office experience does not disqualify her from being president. She implies that not having held office before is, in part, what makes her uniquely qualified.<ref name=WhoWhatWhy/> She stated that the belief that only experienced politicians can lead the U.S. is "preposterous", arguing that experienced politicians led the U.S. into unfounded wars, extreme [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] and environmental harm.<ref name=WhoWhatWhy/> She has called for her expertise in empathy, differentiated thinking, and political vision to be valued on par with elected experience and cited President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1932 statement that "The Presidency is not merely an administrative office. That's the least of it... It is preeminently a place of moral leadership":<ref name=WhoWhatWhy/>

{{quote|Throughout her campaign, Williamson talks more about ideas than plans. Some people might see that as an inability to lead, but when inciting the darkest parts of humanity helped win the previous election, trying to appeal to the light side doesn’t sound like such a bad idea. [...] She's doing her best to move the conversation to one of peace and love instead of anger and division. What is so laughable about that? [...] Campaign promises – plans for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], plans for how to curb climate change – are great. But promises without a fundamental shift in thinking will simply become empty promises. Williamson is trying to teach us that our mind-set needs a new baseline, one of true [[empathy]], so that it becomes impossible to deny people basic health care, so that Americans would never for one second think that separating breastfeeding mothers from their infants at the border is in any way acceptable.<ref name=Harpers>{{cite news|last=Pieri|first=Kerry|title=You Don't Have to Vote for Marianne Williamson — Just Don't Call Her Crazy|publisher=Harpers' Basaar|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a28579623/marianne-williamson-debate-presidential-candidate/|date=2 Aug 2019}}</ref>|Kerry Pieri, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''}}

Williamson has also stressed that she meets all the requirements to be president as laid out by the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], and has implied that those who dismiss candidates without elective office experience are [[Elitism|elitists]] impeding the country's democratic process and values.<ref name=WhoWhatWhy/><ref name="Noah">{{cite video|date=August 11, 2019|title=Marianne Williamson – Running for President on a Morality-Driven Platform: The Daily Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTO-BsdRO1w|publisher=Comedy Central|time=8m54s}}</ref> She has appealed for a process that excludes [[Media bias|media favoritism]] in favor of bringing forth candidates to voters, allowing those candidates to "do their best," and then "allowing voters to decide for themselves through their own intelligent analysis."<ref name=WhoWhatWhy/><ref name=Overtime>{{cite video|title=Overtime with Bill Maher: Marianne Williamson, Jennifer Granholm, Buck Sexton, Josh Barro|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndJXe1u5fbs|format=Television production|publisher=HBO|time=8m33s}}</ref>

Williamson, who first expressed her support of reparations in her 1993 book, ''Illuminata'' –– advocating that the U.S. will not reconcile its racial and economic divide without them has said of the policy proposal –– states that her policy on reparations is not part of "a black agenda,"<ref name=March>{{cite news|last=Bluestone|first=Gabrielle|title=Marianne Williamson Marches On|work=New York Times|date=June 28, 2019 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/style/marianne-williamson-debate-president.html}}</ref>

{{quote|Where I'm coming from is not that I have a 'Black agenda.' I have an ''American'' agenda". [...] The reason I want reparations, as opposed to simple [[Racial politics|race-based policies]], [is because] race-based policies leave open the question whose fault it is that this gap even exists. And race-based policies provide justice, but it doesn't provide the power that capital provides, and that is really what we're talking about here. We're talking about an economic gap that existed in 1865, that was actually increased with another 100 years. So after 200 years of slavery, you had another 100 years of [[Structural violence|institutionalized violence]] against black people in America. My point –– reparations carry more than the power of purely financial restitution. They carry moral force. We need to deal with these things on a deeper, more transformative level. This should not be considered "cuckoo." This should not be considered "wacky."<ref name=KQED/><ref name=Breakfast/>}}

Williamson supports rescinding [[Donald Trump|President Trump's]] recognition of the [[United States recognition of the Golan Heights as part of Israel|Golan Heights as part of Israel]].<ref name=CFR/>  She has also stated her belief that [[Israeli settlement#West Bank|settlements on the West Bank]] are illegal and does not support the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]].

====North Korea====
Williamson supports principled diplomacy, including citizen diplomacy and family reunification.<ref name=CFR/> She has said she would declare a formal end to [[Korean War|the Korean War]], replace the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] with a peace regime and back [[South Korea]]n efforts to improve inter-Korean relations through confidence-building and tension reduction measures.<ref name=CFR/> Williamson also supports the creation of inter-Korean economic, cultural and civic projects, humanitarian relief efforts, and the inclusion of women, youth, and civil society in negotiations.

===Religion===
[[File:Marianne Williamson (39732023).jpg|thumb|right|New Hampshire, 2019]]
Williamson is indifferent about religion, having called it a map in which "the route isn't important. It's the destination that matters."<ref name=NeedHer/> She has said that "organized dogmatic religion" has been harmful, creating "absurd" divisions among people.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Williamson has expressed a deep belief in forgiveness based on the notion that nothing is real, or exists, but love: "If a person behaves unlovingly, then that means that, regardless if their negativity—anger or whatever—their behavior was derived from fear and doesn’t actually exist. They’re hallucinating. You forgive them, then, because there’s nothing to forgive."<ref name="Return"/>

Williamson believes a peaceful life is attainable by thinking with God, while thinking without God creates pain. She has said, "Asking God for help doesn’t seem very comforting if we think of Him as something outside of ourselves, or capricious, or judgmental. But God is love and He dwells within us. We were created in His image, or mind, which means that we are extensions of His love, or Sons of God."<ref name=Return/>

Williamson's beliefs on forgiveness and God influence her belief that [[sin]] is impossible: "A sin would mean we did something so bad that God is angry with us. But since we cannot do anything that changes our essential nature, God has nothing to be angry at. Only love is real. Nothing else exists. The Son of God cannot sin."<ref name=Return/>

Williamson, who believes that "the [[soul|spirit]] is impervious to illness," confirmed this belief when she said that "people who are prayed for get out of the emergency room faster" and "people who have been diagnosed with a life-challenging illness, who attend spiritual support groups, live, on average, twice as long after diagnosis."<ref name=LATimes92/><ref name="Maher2015">{{cite video|date=February 6, 2015 |title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Vaccination|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7yvI0tu3Ho|publisher=HBO|time=6m34s}}</ref><ref name=PowerToHeal>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Darla|title=Does prayer have the power to heal?|newspaper=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/07/power-of-prayer/70943182/|date=May 7, 2015}}</ref> She maintains that prayer is complementary to medicine, not a substitute for it.<ref name=Tweet>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Marianne|title=God is BIG, swine flu SMALL.

At the same time I think that [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|the government earned our distrust]]. [...] This is the problem when institutions lose their moral authority [...], even when they say something that we should listen to, people have a skepticism –– and that's the real problem.
