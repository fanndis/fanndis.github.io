The '''ARIA Charts''', stylised as the '''AR1A CHARTS''' since November 2018, are the main Australian [[record chart|music sales chart]]s, issued weekly by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]. The charts are a record of the highest selling songs and albums in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the [[Kent Music Report]] which had been Australia's national music sales charts since 1974.

==History==
The ''[[Go-Set]]'' charts were Australia's first national singles and albums charts, published from 5 October 1966 until 24 August 1974. Succeeding ''Go-Set'', the Kent Music Report began issuing the national top 100 charts in Australia from May 1974. The compiler, [[David Kent (historian)|David Kent]], also published Australia's national charts from 1940 to 1974 in a retrospective fashion using state based data. In mid 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association commenced licensing the Kent Music Report chart.<ref name=process>{{cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/RSOvsNY.png|title=The ARIA Chart Process (from The ARIA Report Issue No. 29)|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|via=Imgur.com|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> The first printed national top 50 chart available in record stores, branded the ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' chart, was dated the week ending 10 July 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7OxWO4I2NY|title=The first ARIA top 50 singles chart (Countdown, 3rd July 1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>
