'''The Gatorade Company, Inc.''' is an American manufacturer of sports-themed beverage and food products, built around its signature line of [[sports drink]]s. Gatorade is currently manufactured by [[PepsiCo]] and is distributed in over 80 countries.<ref name=factsheetGatorade>{{cite web|title=Gatorade Fact Sheet |url=http://www.pepsico.com/Download/Gatorade_Company_Fact_Sheet.pdf |publisher=PepsiCo, Inc. |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221172620/http://pepsico.com/Download/Gatorade_Company_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=December 21, 2010 }}</ref> The beverage was first developed in 1965 by a team of researchers led by [[Robert Cade]]. It was originally made for the [[Florida Gators|Gators]] at the [[University of Florida]] to replenish the [[carbohydrates]] that the school's student-athletes burned and the combination of water and [[electrolytes]] that they lost in sweat during rigorous sports activities.

Originally produced and marketed by [[Stokely-Van Camp]], the Gatorade brand was purchased by the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 1983, which, in turn, was bought by PepsiCo in 2000.<ref name="abcnews.go.com">{{Cite web|title = Gatorade ready to pump up marketing efforts|url = https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=3929315&page=1|website = ABC News|date = 2007-11-30|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}</ref> As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo's fourth-largest [[brand]], on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales.<ref name=annrpt2010>{{cite web|title=2010 Annual Report |url=http://pepsico.com/annual10/downloads/PepsiCo_Annual_Report_2010_Full_Annual_Report.pdf |work=PepsiCo, Inc. |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |page=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906155910/http://www.pepsico.com/annual10/downloads/PepsiCo_Annual_Report_2010_Full_Annual_Report.pdf |archivedate=September 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> It competes with [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]]'s [[Powerade]] and [[Vitaminwater]] brands worldwide, and with [[Lucozade]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
[[File:Gatorade Early Testing Photo.jpg|thumb|right|University of Florida football player Chip Hinton testing Gatorade in 1965, pictured next to the leader of its team of inventors, [[Robert Cade]].]]  

Gatorade was created in 1965, by a team of scientists at the [[University of Florida|University of Florida College of Medicine]], including [[Robert Cade]], [[Dana Shires]], Harry James Free, and Alejandro de Quesada.<ref name=born>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatorade.com/history/default.aspx|title=History|publisher=Gatorade|accessdate=April 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415161147/http://www.gatorade.com/history/default.aspx|archivedate=April 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Following a request from [[Florida Gators football]] head coach [[Ray Graves]], Gatorade was created to help athletes by acting as a replacement for body fluids lost during physical exertion. The earliest version of the beverage consisted of a mixture of water, [[sodium]], [[sugar]], [[potassium]], [[phosphate]], and lemon juice.<ref name=gatoradehistprofile>{{cite web|last=Kays|first=Joe|title=Gatorade - The Idea that Launched an Industry|url=http://www.research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v08n1/gatorade.html|publisher=University of Florida Research|accessdate=January 24, 2011|year=2003}}</ref> Ten players on the University of Florida football team tested the first version of Gatorade during practices and games in 1965, and the tests were deemed successful. On the other hand, star [[quarterback]] [[Steve Spurrier]] said, "I don’t have any answer for whether the Gatorade helped us be a better second-half team or not. . . . We drank it, but whether it helped us in the second half, who knows?"<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=28}}</ref> Nonetheless, the football team credited Gatorade as having contributed to their first [[Orange Bowl]] win over the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] in 1967, at which point the drink gained traction within the athletic community. Yellow Jackets coach [[Bobby Dodd]], when asked why his team lost, replied: "We didn't have Gatorade. That made the difference."<ref name="inventions">{{cite web|title=Football Inventions That Shaped the Modern Game|url=http://www.inventhelp.com/Football_Inventions.asp|date=September 6, 2007|accessdate=September 6, 2007}}</ref>

The University of Florida researchers initially considered naming their product "Gator-Aid". They settled on the name Gatorade, however, since the researchers wanted to create a commercial product, not a scientifically-validated one. [[Darren Rovell]] notes his history of Gatorade, ''First in Thirst'', "the doctors realized that they probably shouldn't use the 'Aid' suffix, since that would mean that if the drink were ever marketed, they would have to prove that it had a clear medicinal use and perform clinical tests on thousands of people."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=24}}</ref> Gatorade co-inventor [[Dana Shires]] explained, "We were told that you couldn't use that because the Food and Drug Administration prohibited that. That would classify it as something other than a cola or soft drink, so we changed it to ade."<ref>{{cite web|last=Shires|first=Dana|title=Dana Leroy Shires, Jr.|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00006306/00001/17x?search=gatorade|publisher=University of Florida Digital Collection|accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

For example, some were skeptical that the product's effect was anything more than a placebo effect. Cade mentioned, "If you told a football player that you were giving him [[Demerol]] to relieve pain and you gave him a placebo instead, there's about a 30% chance that the placebo will relieve the pain as much as taking Demerol would have."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=50}}</ref>

Shortly after the 1969 Orange Bowl, Robert Cade entered into an agreement providing [[Van Camp's|Stokely-Van Camp, Inc.]] (SVC), a canned-food packaging company, with the U.S. rights to production and sale of Gatorade as a commercial product.<ref name="gatoradehistprofile"/> In the same year, a licensing arrangement made Gatorade the official sports drink of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), representing the first in a history of professional sports sponsorship for the Gatorade brand. A year after its commercial introduction, S-VC tested multiple variations of the original Gatorade recipe, finally settling on more palatable variants in lemon-lime and orange flavors. This reformulation also removed the sweetener [[sodium cyclamate|cyclamate]]—which was banned by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1969 - replacing it with additional [[fructose]].<ref name="chemcases">{{cite web|title='Gatorade 21.

The [[Quaker Oats Company]] purchased SVC and Gatorade in 1983 for $220 million, following a bidding war with rival [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]]. In its first two decades of production, Gatorade was primarily sold and distributed within the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, the company expanded distribution of Gatorade, venturing into Canada in 1984, regions of Asia in 1987, South America and parts of Europe in 1988, and Australia in 1993. In 1990, Gatorade introduced Gatorade Light, a lower-calorie version sweetened with [[saccharin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=176|date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> International expansion came at the cost of $20 million in 1996 alone; however, the resulting efforts produced worldwide sales of $283 million in more than 45 countries during the same year.<ref name=galehist>{{cite journal|title=The Gatorade Company Profile|journal=International Directory of Company Histories, Gale Group|year=2007|volume=82}}</ref> In 1997, distribution of Gatorade in an additional 10 countries prompted an 18.7% growth in annual sales.<ref name=rovellbook>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in thirst: how Gatorade turned the science of sweat into a cultural phenomenon|year=2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=978-0-8144-7299-6|page=256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNJIXCE7cSkC&q=david%20whitford%20AND%20gatorade&pg=PP1}}</ref>

In 2001, the multinational food and beverage company [[PepsiCo]] acquired Gatorade's parent company, the Quaker Oats Company, for $13 billion in order to add Gatorade to its portfolio of brands. PepsiCo had also recently developed [[All Sport]], which it divested of shortly following the Quaker acquisition to satisfy [[antitrust]] regulations. Worldwide development of Gatorade continued into the 2000s, including expansion into India in 2004, and the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 2008.<ref name=rovellbook /> As of 2010, Gatorade products were made available for sale in more than 80 countries.<ref name=factsheetGatorade /> As the number-one sports drink by annual retail sales in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gatorade is also among the leading sports drink brands in [[Korea]] and Australia.<ref name=fundinguniv>{{cite web|title=PepsiCo Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/PepsiCo-Inc-Company-History.html|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref>

As the distribution of Gatorade expanded outside of the U.S., localized flavors were introduced to conform to regional tastes and cultural preferences, among other factors. For example, Blueberry is available in [[Colombia]], and in [[Brazil]], a Pineapple flavor of Gatorade is sold. In Australia,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} flavors include Antarctic Freeze and Wild Water Rush. Some flavors that have been discontinued in the U.S., such as Alpine Snow and Starfruit, have since been made available in other countries.<ref name=rovellbook/>

In 2011, Gatorade was re-introduced to [[New Zealand]] by [[Bluebird Foods]], a [[PepsiCo]] subsidiary in New Zealand. The product is made in Australia by Schweppes Australia, and imported to New Zealand and distributed along with Bluebird potato chips.

In its early years, the Gatorade brand consisted of a single product line, '''Gatorade Thirst Quencher,''' which was produced in liquid and [[drink mix|powder form]] under two flavor variants: ''Lemon Lime'' and ''Orange''.<ref name=backpacker>{{cite journal|title=Gatorade Thirst Quencher|journal=Backpacker Magazine|date=June 1977|volume=5|issue=21|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_98DAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Gatorade%20Thirst%20Quencher%22%20orange%20lemon-lime&pg=PA26 |access-date=January 24, 2011 |author1=Active Interest Media, Inc}}</ref> These remained as the only two flavor options for nearly 20 years, until the addition of the ''fruit punch'' flavor in 1983.<ref name=fruitpunchinv>{{cite book |last=McLain|first=Bill|title=What Makes Flamingos Pink?: A Colorful Collection of Q & A's for the Unquenchably Curious|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-000024-0|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haHxWc1vllwC&q=Gatorade%20%22fruit%20punch%22%201983&pg=PA144}}</ref> In 1988 a ''Citrus Cooler'' flavor was introduced. The rise to popularity of this flavor was largely a result of Michael Jordan, who, at the height of his NBA career in the early 1990s, stated that it was his favorite flavor.

The product, manufactured by [[Fleer|Fleer Corporation]], was available in both of Gatorade's original flavors (lemon-lime and orange). In the late 1970s, Stokely-Van Camp (owner of Gatorade before 1983) negotiated a long-term licensing deal with [[Philadelphia Gum|Swell]] and Vicks to market Gator Gum. The gum was discontinued in 1989 after the contract expired.<ref name=galehist /><ref name=rovellbook/>

It was not until the mid and late 1990s that Gatorade beverages became available in a broader range of flavor variations. Among these initial flavor extensions were ''Watermelon'', introduced in 1995, and ''Cherry Rush'', ''Strawberry Kiwi'', and ''Mandarina'' flavors, added in 1996.<ref name=galehist /><ref name=rovellbook />{{rp|171}}<ref name=mandarina1>{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Douglas J.

Three initial flavors under the Frost product line were introduced at this time: ''Alpine Snow'', ''Glacier Freeze'', and ''Whitewater Splash''.<ref name=frostinvented>{{cite journal |title=Gatorade Frost Introduced |journal=Creative, the Magazine of Promotion and Marketing |date=April 21, 1997 |url=http://www.creativemag.com/onlweekly042197.html |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708203826/http://www.creativemag.com/onlweekly042197.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Aimed at what the company described as the 'active thirst' category—a market 10 times the size of the sports drink segment—Gatorade Frost proved to be successful, far surpassing the company's initial expectations. Flavors in the Frost line were the first from Gatorade to divert from fruit names; it was described as consisting of "light-tasting fruit-flavor blends".<ref name=galehist />

Gatorade revealed the '''Gatorade Energy Bar''' in 2001. This bar was Gatorade's first foray into solid foods and was introduced to compete with [[PowerBar]] and [[Clif Bar]]. Gatorade Energy Bars contained a large proportion of protein, in addition to carbohydrates. The bar was primarily made up of puffed grains and corn syrup, common components of other energy bars.<ref name=rovellbook /> In 2001, Gatorade introduced the '''Gatorade Performance Series''', a special line of sports nutrition products. These products include ''Gatorade Carbohydrate Energy Drink'', ''Gatorade Protein Recovery Shake'', the ''Gatorade Nutrition Shake'', and the ''Gatorade Nutrition Bar''. The ''Endurance Formula'', introduced in 2004, contained twice the sodium and three times the potassium of the typical Gatorade formula as well as [[chloride]], [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]], to better replace what athletes lose while training and competing.<ref name=timelinehist>{{cite web |title=U.S. History of Gatorade Products -Timeline |url=http://www.gatorade.com/Content/pdf/2006_Gatorade_Innovation.pdf |publisher=The Gatorade Company |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711080336/http://www.gatorade.com/Content/pdf/2006_Gatorade_Innovation.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Introduced in 2002, '''Gatorade Ice''' was marketed as a lighter flavored Gatorade and came in Strawberry, Lime, Orange, and Watermelon. All of these flavors were colorless and [[transparency and translucency|transparent]]. Ice was re-branded in 2006 as '''Gatorade Rain''' and the flavor selections altered.

'''Gatorade Tiger''' was a Gatorade Thirst Quencher sports drink formed as the result of a sponsorship arrangement with [[Tiger Woods]]. Debuting in March 2008, Gatorade Tiger was available in ''Red Drive'' (cherry), ''Cool Fusion'' (lemon-lime), and ''Quiet Storm'' (grape). Gatorade Tiger contained 25% more electrolytes than Gatorade Thirst Quencher.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tiger endorsement firsts: U.S. beverage deal, licensing agreement | publisher=ESPN Golf | date=October 17, 2007 | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=3066280}}</ref> As part of the 2009 rebranding, Gatorade Tiger was re-labeled as '''Focus'''.

Focus contained about 25&nbsp;mg per {{convert|8|USfloz|ml}} serving or 50&nbsp;mg per {{convert|16.9|USfloz|ml}} bottle. On November 25, 2009, it was reported by ''[[Beverage Digest]]'', and later confirmed by PepsiCo, that they had made a decision, several months before November 2009, to discontinue some products to make room for the Prime and Recover products as part of a then-upcoming G Series re-branding.<ref name="focus">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8403418.stm|title=Gatorade drops Tiger Woods sponsorship |date=December 9, 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> In 2015, the Gatorade Energy gummies made their debut along with the Gatorade energy bar.

The original Gatorade is based on [[oral rehydration therapy]], a mixture of salt, sugar, and water, with the citrus-based flavoring and added food coloring. The composition of individual Gatorade products varies depending upon the product in question, as well as the country in which it is sold. Gatorade Thirst Quencher contains water, [[sucrose]] (table sugar), [[dextrose]], [[citric acid]], natural flavor, [[sodium chloride]] (table salt), [[Trisodium citrate|sodium citrate]], [[monopotassium phosphate]], and flavoring/coloring ingredients. Some Gatorade flavor variations used to contain [[brominated vegetable oil]] as a stabilizer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=gatorade.com|publisher=Gatorade|date=January 5, 2005|url=http://www.gatorade.com/frequently_asked_questions/|accessdate=May 28, 2007}}</ref> Brominated vegetable oil was discontinued in 2013, and has been replaced with sucrose acetate isobutyrate.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gatorade to remove controversial ingredient|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/gatorade-remove-controversial-ingredient-article-1.1247929|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}</ref> An {{convert|8|USfloz|ml}} serving of Gatorade Perform 02 (Gatorade Thirst Quencher) contains 50 calories, 14 grams of carbohydrates, 110&nbsp;mg sodium and 30&nbsp;mg potassium.<ref name=gatoradenutritioninf>{{cite web|title=Gatorade Ingredients and Nutrition Content|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/9233/2}}</ref>

Gatorade Thirst Quencher is sweetened using a [[sucrose]]-[[dextrose]] mix. For a period of time in the 1990s and early 2000s, [[high fructose corn syrup]] was used to sweeten Gatorade distributed in North America, but as of 2011, the drink once again sweetened with a sucrose-dextrose combination, which the company describes as being "preferred by consumers". G2 and G2 Natural, labeled as being "lower calorie" variants, are sweetened in part with [[PureVia]], an extract of the [[Stevia]] plant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=gatorade.com|publisher=Gatorade|date=January 1, 2010|url=http://www.gatorade.com/frequently_asked_questions/|accessdate=May 13, 2010}}</ref>

The presence of calories, sugar, and sodium in Gatorade products has drawn attention from public school constituents, who have raised question over whether the sale of Gatorade beverages should be permitted in such schools. In 2010, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] sponsored a bill ({{USBill|110|SB|1295}}) which proposed a ban on the sale of sports drinks in [[California]] schools. In 2015, the [[University of California, San Francisco]] began to phase out the sale of sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks in its cafeterias, [[vending machine]]s, and campus catering and retail locations, and began to "sell only zero-calorie beverages or non-sweetened drinks with nutritional value, such as milk and 100% juice".<ref>Kristen Bole, [https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2015/05/129901/ucsf-launches-health-beverage-initiative UCSF Launches Healthy Beverage Initiative: Health Sciences Campus Will Focus Sales on Zero-Calorie and Nutritious Drinks] (press release), University of California, San Francisco (May 29, 2015).</ref>

There are 34&nbsp;g of sugar (8 teaspoons) in one 20&nbsp;oz bottle of regular Gatorade. The USDA's recommended daily maximum of added sugars per person is about 50 grams.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|date=2020-05-13|title=Added Sugars on the New Nutrition Facts Label|url=https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/added-sugars-new-nutrition-facts-label|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> According to the [[American Heart Association]], the recommended maximum amount of sugar for women is about 6 teaspoons and about 9 teaspoons for men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Encyclopedia/Heart-Encyclopedia_UCM_445084_Encyclopedia.jsp?levelSelected=19&title=sugar%2520intake|title=Heart-Encyclopedia - sugar%20intake|website=www.heart.org|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> Family Education says the AHA states that children should consume even less sugar, no more than only about 3 to 4 teaspoons each day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://life.familyeducation.com/nutritional-information/obesity/64270.html|title=AHA Guidelines and Recommended Sugar Intake for Kids - FamilyEducation.com|website=life.familyeducation.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>

In 2012, a study on nearly 11,000 teens reported that "teens put on even more weight if they drank a bottle of sports drink each day, averaging 3.5 pounds for every sports drinks consumed per day". The researchers concluded, "We need to educate parents and clinicians about what constitutes a sugary drink... Sports drinks are promoted by professional athletes as a healthy drink, but they really don't need to be used by kids unless they are continually exercising for long periods or they're in hot climates."<ref>{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Ron|title=Sports drinks, not just sodas, drive up weight in teens|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/791326|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>

The USDA states that the average American will consume 160 pounds of sugar each year; almost a half-pound of sugar per day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bamboocorefitness.com/not-so-sweet-the-average-american-consumes-150-170-pounds-of-sugar-each-year/|title=Not So Sweet - The Average American Consumes 150-170 Pounds Of Sugar Each Year - Bamboo Core Fitness|website=Bamboo Core Fitness|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> One of the most prevalent ways that sugar is consumed is through drinks. Most people do not notice the amount of sugar that one given drink can have.

In January 2013, the Gatorade manufacturer (PepsiCo) agreed to remove [[brominated vegetable oil]] from its Gatorade products in the USA amidst health concerns.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eng|first=Monica|title=Gatorade to drop BVO after consumer complaints|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-26/news/ct-nw-gatorade-bvo-20130126_1_bvo-gatorade-sarah-kavanagh|accessdate=January 29, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>
The composition of Gatorade in Europe, Japan and India remain unaffected as [[brominated vegetable oil|BVO]] was outlawed there 23 years earlier.

==Research and development==
[[File:Gatorade Sports Science Institute.jpg|thumb|left|The Gatorade Sports Science Institute on West Main Street in [[Barrington, Illinois]].]]
Gatorade's inventors went on to develop new sports drinks. Gatorade's owners sued to acquire rights to these new products, but they never made them available publicly. First, Shires and Cade developed Go!, a drink that, unlike Gatorade, contained protein to stimulate muscular recovery. Stokley-Van Camp paid "a fee to have the exclusive rights for some period of time, but they never did develop it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shires|first=Dana|title=Dana Leroy Shires, Jr.|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00006306/00001/19j?search=chocolate+milk|publisher=University of Florida Digital Collection|accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>

In 1989, Dr. Cade created a new sports drink that he claimed was more effective than Gatorade. The new product was called TQ2, shorthand for Thirst Quencher 2. The patent application read:

"The invention described here is a novel fluid composition which surprisingly and advantageously maintains blood volume at levels well above those observed in the absence of fluids or even with Gatorade."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|page=191}}</ref>

In an experiment with cyclists, Cade found that TQ2 allowed athletes to endure for 30% longer than Gatorade.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=Barbara|title=Gatorade Challenged|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/24/news/gatorade-challenged.html|accessdate=2014-03-21|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1990-12-24}}</ref>

Cade pitched the TQ2 product to Pepsi and other beverage companies. Meanwhile, Gatorade's owner Quaker sued Cade. After years of legal proceedings, Cade was forced to sell TQ2 to Quaker in 1993. Quaker "bagged" TQ2, never releasing it to the public.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shires|first=Dana|title=Dana Leroy Shires Jr.|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00006306/00001/20?search=tq2|publisher=University of Florida Digital Collections|accessdate=2014-03-21}}</ref>  Gatorade claimed that its research found that TQ2 was not an improvement over the original Gatorade formula. Cade, on the other hand, continued to stand by his product. He accused Quaker and Gatorade of stifling the publication of the research behind TQ2.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|page=194}}</ref>

The Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI), a research facility operated in [[Barrington, Illinois]], has been featured in a number of the company's commercials.<ref name="GSSI">[http://www.gssiweb.com/Histroy_GSSI.aspx?ExpandMenu=6 Gatorade Sports Science Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708090316/http://www.gssiweb.com/Histroy_GSSI.aspx?ExpandMenu=6 |date=July 8, 2009 }}</ref> Established in 1985,<ref name=factsheetGatorade /> this organization consists of scientists studying the correlation and effects of exercise, environmental variables, and nutrition on the human body.

In 2001, the GSSI observed that professional race car drivers were not maintaining adequate levels of hydration during races, attributable to the nature of drivers enduring multiple-hour races in high temperatures. As a result, it developed a product called the "Gatorade In-Car Drinking System", which has since been implemented in the vehicles of many professional race car drivers.<ref name=racecardr>{{cite news |last=Circelli |first=Deborah |title=Race drivers struggle to stay cool |url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/east-volusia/2010/07/02/race-drivers-struggle-to-stay-cool.html |accessdate=January 19, 2011 |newspaper=The Daytona Beach News-Journal |date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111014751/http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/local/east-volusia/2010/07/02/race-drivers-struggle-to-stay-cool.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In addition to the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, Gatorade sponsors external health and fitness research. In 1992, Gatorade paid the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) $250,000. A year later, Gatorade and the American College of Sports Medicine held a roundtable meeting on "exercise and fluid replacement".<ref>{{cite web|last=Thring|first=Oliver|title=Do sports drinks and hydration theory hold any water?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/aug/07/sports-drinks-hydration-theory-water|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> The ACSM published the meeting's results in 1996, advising athletes to drink "at a rate sufficient to replace all the water lost through sweating" or "the maximal amount that can be tolerated".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Convertino|first=VA|title=American College of Sports Medicine position stand.

==Advertising and publicity==
Early Gatorade advertisements claimed that the drink moved through the body 12 times faster than water. Research found that this was not true - Gatorade moves through the body at the same speed as water. Gatorade removed the claim from its advertisements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into a Cultural Phenomenon|date=September 2, 2005|publisher=AMACOM|isbn=0814410952|pages=155–156}}</ref> Gatorade advertisements have claimed that athletes need to consume at least "40 oz. per hour or your performance could suffer".<ref>http://i0.wp.com/www.sportsscientists.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/Gatorade_ad.jpg</ref> South African exercise physiologist Dr. [[Tim Noakes]] found that Cynthia Lucero died from [[Exercise-associated hyponatremia|exercise-associated hyponatremic]] [[encephalopathy]] drinking Gatorade at "the rate recommended by the advertisements".<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Timothy |title=Waterlogged: The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports |date=May 1, 2012| publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-1450424974 |pages=8 }}</ref>

== The Gatorade shower ==
Gatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the [[Gatorade shower]], originally called the "Gatorade Dunk", where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an [[American football]] game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when [[Harry Carson]] and [[Jim Burt (American football)|Jim Burt]], of the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], doused head coach [[Bill Parcells]] during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986–87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports, including [[Canadian football]].<ref name=gatoradeshower>{{cite news|last=Trex|first=Ethan|title=Who invented the Gatorade shower?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/01/07/mf.gatorade.shower.inventors/index.html#cnnSTCText|accessdate=January 24, 2011|publisher=CNN|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> The name is often used even when non-Gatorade drinks such as water or [[Powerade]] are substituted.

<blockquote>But while Gatorade might be good for athletes, it is not good for cholera, said Dr. Michael Toole, an [[epidemiologist]] at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]]. Gatorade does not have all the essential ingredients that an [[Intravenous therapy|I.V.]] has, and people who were given it might have taken more appropriate solutions, Dr. Toole said.<ref>Edward Bonner, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/weekinreview/the-world-post-mortem-for-charities-compassion-wasn-t-enough-in-rwanda.html "The World: Post-Mortem for Charities; Compassion Wasn't Enough in Rwanda"], ''The New York Times'', December 18, 1994.</ref></blockquote>

AmeriCares' president responded: "We stand by our decision to ship Gatorade to Rwandan refugees. In the absence of [[drinking water|potable water]], Gatorade, with its electrolytes and water, saved countless lives in a true [[triage]] situation."<ref>Steven M.
