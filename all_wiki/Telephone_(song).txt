"'''Telephone'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] for her third [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009), the reissue of her debut studio album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). The song features American singer [[Beyoncé]]. The song was written by Gaga, [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[LaShawn Daniels]], Lazonate Franklin and Beyoncé. Inspired by her fear of [[Asphyxia|suffocation]], Gaga explained that the lyrics preferring relaxing on the dance floor to answering her lover's phone call are a metaphor, the phone calling her representing the fear of not having worked hard enough to succeed. With the track succeeding her fourth single from ''[[The Fame]]'', "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]", the duet additionally embodies a fear of being suffocated and trapped by the media. Originally, Gaga wrote the song for [[Britney Spears]], who recorded a demo. Musically, "Telephone" consists of an expanded [[bridge (music)|bridge]], [[verse (popular music)|verse-rap]] and a sampled voice of an operator announcing that the phone line is unreachable. Beyoncé appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.

The song received positive reviews from critics who frequently noted "Telephone" as a stand-out track from ''The Fame Monster''. It was [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] in 2011. "Telephone" charted in a number of countries due to digital sales following the album's release, namely in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and Hungary. The song was particularly successful in Europe where it reached the top of the charts in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], the single sold 7.4&nbsp;million [[Music download|digital copies]] worldwide in 2010, making it one of Gaga's best-selling singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.com/content/section_resources/dmr2011.html|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2011|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|date=January 20, 2011|access-date=February 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/636Sb7TCl?url=http://www.ifpi.com/content/section_resources/dmr2011.html|archive-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref>

The accompanying music video is a continuation of the video for her 2009 song, "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]", and is also shot as a short film. After Gaga gets bailed out of prison by Beyoncé, they go to a diner and poison the guests having breakfast. After the homicide they escape and end up in a high-speed police chase. The video referenced [[Quentin Tarantino]] and his films ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) and ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'' (2003). The video received generally positive reviews and was nominated for three awards at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], including one for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]]. In January 2015 ''Billboard'' named it the best video of the first half of the decade. In memory of [[Alexander McQueen]], Gaga performed an acoustic rendition of "Telephone" mixed with "[[Dance in the Dark]]" at the [[2010 BRIT Awards]]. It was also performed during the [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]], and many of the singer’s later tours, the most recent being the [[Joanne World Tour]] (2017–2018).

Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear is never being able to enjoy myself,&nbsp;... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard to go out and have a good time.&nbsp;... I don't go to nightclubs,&nbsp;... You don't see pictures of me falling out of a club drunk.

</blockquote>
In May 2011, Gaga said her "emotional connection" with the song was difficult. When she was asked if it was because the song was originally written for Britney Spears, she answered: "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song it has nothing to do with the song, just my emotional connection to it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5456&Itemid=9|title=Lady Gaga Interview|date=May 24, 2011|access-date=May 24, 2011|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526022231/http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5456&Itemid=9|archive-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref>

One of the guards comments: "I told you she didn't have a [[Human penis|dick]]", referring to the rumors that Gaga is [[intersex]].<ref name="mtvrev"/><ref name="nymag"/> For the video's first three minutes, it shows Gaga's activities in the prison—including kissing a lesbian prisoner ([[Heather Cassils|Cassils]]) in the exercise yard while secretly stealing the prisoner's cell phone, wearing sunglasses made out of half-smoked [[cigarette]]s, and watching catfights in the commissary.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.out.com/entertainment/interviews/2010/03/15/heather-cassils-lady-gagas-prison-yard-girlfriend |title= Heather Cassils, Lady Gaga's Prison Yard Girlfriend|work=Out|publisher=Out Magazine Inc|access-date=February 18, 2014|date=March 15, 2010|url-status=live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140331035119/http://www.out.com/entertainment/interviews/2010/03/15/heather-cassils-lady-gagas-prison-yard-girlfriend |archive-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> Gaga's sister, [[Natali Germanotta]], makes a cameo in the commissary scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b171698_lady_gagas_sis_makes_cameo_in_telephone.html|title=Lady Gaga's Sis Makes Cameo in Telephone |last =Candy|first=Jennifer|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=E!|access-date=March 17, 2010|url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323003907/http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b171698_lady_gagas_sis_makes_cameo_in_telephone.html|archive-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref> After that, Gaga answers a call from Beyoncé, and begins to sing the song.

Gaga is bailed out from prison and exits to find Beyoncé waiting for her in the "[[Kill Bill: Volume 1|Pussy Wagon]]".

Beyoncé sits opposite to her boyfriend, Bobo (Gibson), and after a quip of silent dialogue, she puts poison in his drink, but it does not kill him like she had hoped.<ref name="nymag"/> The video later shifts to an intermediate sequence called "Let's Make a Sandwich", where Gaga stands in a kitchen, wearing a folded-up telephone on her head, while dancers cavort behind her, holding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. Ultimately, Gaga prepares a sandwich and eats it, after a dance sequence.<ref name="mtvrev"/> In the meantime, Gaga mixes poison into all of the dishes she is preparing for the unsuspecting customers causing Bobo and everybody else, including characters played by [[Semi Precious Weapons]] and her [[Great Dane]], Lava, to die. Gaga and Beyoncé perform another dance sequence, wearing [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] inspired garments and shredded denims, while strutting around the dead bodies.<ref name="nymag"/> Gaga and Beyoncé leave the diner in the "Pussy Wagon" and travel on a highway as a news reporter ([[Jai Rodriguez]]) reports the horrifying murders at the diner. The final shots shows Gaga and Beyoncé travelling through the desert with police sirens wailing in the background. The video ends with the line "To Be Continued&nbsp;..." followed by end credits.<ref name="mtvrev"/>

Gaga and Beyoncé have never sung "Telephone" together on any live show, but both of them performed it individually. Gaga first performed "Telephone" at the [[2010 BRIT Awards|BRIT Awards]] on {{Nowrap|February 16}}, 2010, at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]]. The act was inspired by the recent death of her friend, fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]]. Initially she had planned a different version of the performance, but changed the concept at the last minute, since she wanted to pay tribute to McQueen.<ref name="wsjt"/> Hence she chose an acoustic version of "Telephone" and a remix of "[[Dance in the Dark]]". Before the show, she posted a message on her [[Twitter]] account: "Tonight's performance is inspired by our friend. Mask by Phillip Treacy, Sculpture by Nick Knight, Music by Lady Gaga. We miss you." She started the performance by announcing "This is for Alexander McQueen." Gaga was dressed in a complete white outfit with a huge [[Marie Antoinette]]-style wig.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1631990/20100216/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Pays Tribute To Alexander McQueen At Brit Awards| last= Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=February 16, 2010|publisher=MTV |access-date=February 17, 2010|url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100219070442/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1631990/20100216/lady_gaga.jhtml|archive-date=February 19, 2010}}</ref> The whole performance was low-key in comparison to her previous ones.<ref name="wsjt">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/02/16/lady-gaga-performs-telephone-dance-in-the-dark-as-tribute-to-alexander-mcqueen-at-brit-awards/|title=Lady Gaga Performs "Telephone," "Dance in the Dark" As Tribute to Alexander McQueen at Brit Awards|date=February 16, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=February 17, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218215139/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/02/16/lady-gaga-performs-telephone-dance-in-the-dark-as-tribute-to-alexander-mcqueen-at-brit-awards/|archive-date=February 18, 2010}}</ref>
