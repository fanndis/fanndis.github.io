"'''Bootylicious'''" is a song by American [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]] from their third [[studio album]] ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001). It was written and produced by [[Rob Fusari]], [[Beyoncé]] and Falonte Moore. The song contains a prominent [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from the [[Stevie Nicks]] song "[[Edge of Seventeen]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x26m1b_stevie-nicks-edge-of-seventeen_music|title=Stevie Nicks - Edge Of Seventeen - Video Dailymotion|date=June 6, 2007|website=Dailymotion}}</ref>

The song was released as the album's second [[Single (music)|single]] from the album in 2001 and became the group's fourth US number-one single. It also reached the top five in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. A [[Rockwilder]] remix of the song featured [[Missy Elliott]] and appeared on the soundtrack of the 2001 musical ''[[Carmen: A Hip Hopera]]'' and the 2002 compilation ''[[This Is the Remix (Destiny's Child album)|This Is the Remix]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|title=MTV's Hip Hopera: Carmen – Original TV Soundtrack|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mtvs-hip-hopera-carmen-mw0000006261|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Music – This Is the Remix by Destiny's Child|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/this-is-the-remix/id217365648|work=[[iTunes]]|publisher=[[Apple.com]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref>

Although the term "bootylicious" was first used in song by rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] in 1992 (in the [[Dr. Dre]] song [[Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')|Dre Day]]), the popularity of this song caused the slang word to become widespread and it was added to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (defined as "(of a woman) sexually attractive") in 2004.

== Background and composition ==
"Bootylicious" was written and produced by [[Beyoncé]], [[Rob Fusari]] and Falonte Moore, and was recorded at Sugarhill Studios, [[Houston]], and Sound on Sound Studios, [[New York City]].<ref name="Nones"/> There are conflicting stories about the song's origins. According to Knowles, she was inspired to write the song on a flight to either [[London]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/d/destiny01_2/index.jhtml#have |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723115535/http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/d/destiny01_2/index.jhtml#have |archive-date=July 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or [[Japan]] as she was listening to the [[guitar riff]] of [[Stevie Nicks]]' song "[[Edge of Seventeen]]", which reminded her of a "voluptuous woman".<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Beyoncé Knowles]] |date=August 2, 2009 |title=[[I Am...

Unable to locate the song, he chose to sample "Edge of Seventeen" instead. He wanted to replay the guitar riff himself in the studio so as not to lose publishing royalties, but group manager [[Mathew Knowles]] (father of Beyoncé Knowles) would not let him do this. He reportedly later told Fusari in response to Beyoncé's claims of coming up with the idea to use the Stevie Nicks sample for the song, "People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, NJ. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959293/producer-rob-fusari-dishes-on-lady-gaga-beyonce|title=Producer Rob Fusari Dishes on Lady Gaga, Beyoncé|last=Marks|first=Craig|date=February 24, 2010|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref> [[Kelly Rowland]] has mentioned that "Bootylicious" is the most irritating [[Destiny's Child]] song for her since she has heard it too many times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/rowland%20cant%20stand%20bootylicious_1057096|title=ContactMusic.com 2008|website=contactmusic.com}}</ref> Rowland sings the majority of the [[lead vocals]] on the track, with her leading both verses, Knowles leading choruses, and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] leading the bridge.

According to the sheet music published by [[EMI Music Publishing]] at Musicnotes.com, "Bootylicious" is a [[Pop music|pop]] song set in [[common time]] with a medium funk [[tempo]] of 104 beats per minute. It is written in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[E minor]] (recorded in [[D-sharp minor|D{{sharp}} minor]]), and Destiny's Child's vocals span from G<sub>3</sub> to B<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0075647 |title=Destiny's Child – Bootylicious Sheet Music |publisher=Musicnotes.com. [[EMI Music Publishing]] |accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref>

== Chart performance ==
"Bootylicious" debuted at number 66 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on June 9, 2001 and climbed to its peak position nine weeks later, though it remained on the chart for a further nineteen weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/300824/destinys-child/chart|title=Destiny's Child - Chart history - Billboard|website=www.billboard.com}}</ref> To date, this remains the last song by a girl group to top the U.S. charts. The song peaked at number five on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and number two on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, behind [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Loverboy (Mariah Carey song)|Loverboy]]".

In the United Kingdom, "Bootylicious" was released on July 23, 2001 and debuted and peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] behind the [[Atomic Kitten]] cover single "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]". It sold over 169,000 copies and propelled ''Survivor'' back to the top of the [[UK Album Chart]].

== Remixes ==
A [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-styled [[remix]] (the "Rockwilder Remix") was produced by [[Rockwilder]], Knowles, and [[Missy Elliott]]. This version was issued to [[urban contemporary|urban]] markets, and had a [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]] culture-based [[music video]] to accompany it, in which [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] wears a belt that has the word "Bootylicious" misspelled as "Bootyliciuos", as pointed out by [[Carson Daly]] on an episode of ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]''.

A combination of the [[R&B]] vocals from this song and the [[grunge rock]] music of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]"<ref>{{YouTube|hrpB4VOUuc8|"Nirvana Vs Destiny's Child"}}</ref> is one of the best-known examples of the "[[bastard pop]]" or "mashup" genre, where elements from seemingly incompatible songs are mixed together. A later mashup used the music of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" with the "Bootylicious" vocals.<ref>{{YouTube|XSZ2hyjEAoM|"Destiny's Child vs Stevie Wonder – Bootystition"}}</ref>

== Music video ==
The [[music video]] for "Bootylicious", directed by [[Matthew Rolston]] and filmed from May 7–9, 2001, showed Destiny's Child performing dance steps from [[Michael Jackson]]'s famous "[[Billie Jean]]" performance from the special ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]''. During the video, moves from several other Michael Jackson videos can be seen such as parts of the choreography from "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", and "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]". Dance moves that were used by Jackson during live performances of "[[They Don't Care About Us]]" can be seen as well.

As the group is dancing, the members appear in several different costumes. These scenes are interloped with the group dancing in front of a dance troupe made of all boys. The dance sequence ends with a diamond-shaped stage where the group appears wearing pink crop-tops, while the all-male dance troupe appears shirtless, wearing Michael Jackson's signature one glove and sagging pants that showed their underwear with "Destiny" at the back. [[Stevie Nicks]] makes an appearance in the beginning of the song's video. [[Solange Knowles]], Beyoncé's sister, also makes a brief cameo in the video.

The version of the song featured in the music video is slightly different from the album version, removing the synth strings and DJ scratching and percussion fills in favour of a drier mix, with the bass guitar cut out part-way through the final choruses and a fade-out of the instrumental leaving only the vocals near the end. This version was never commercially released.

The music clip is featured on the DualDisc edition of the album ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'' and as an enhanced video on the UK and French editions of the Single. The video for the "[[Rockwilder]] Remix" featuring [[Missy Elliott]] is available on the Single "Emotion Bootylicious Survivor – The Urban Remixes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordrunnerusa.com/destinys-child-emotion-bootylicious-survivor-urban-remixes-smash-singles-wbootylicious-video-p-14065.html?osCsid=ar8gfnaghmn8nrlb1vtr4nsp37 |accessdate=May 9, 2010 }}{{dead link |date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

== Live performances ==
Destiny's Child opened the 1st Annual [[BET Awards]] with a performance of "Bootylicious".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=217 |title=BET Networks PR Website – News Releases |publisher=Bet.mediaroom.com |date=June 22, 2001 |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001091824/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=217 |archive-date=October 1, 2011 }}</ref>
They performed it on both [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concerts. According with Kelly Rowland, he liked this song so much, and when he saw them for the first time, he started to sing it, and they got very surprised. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song along with Kelly and Michelle during the [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl XLVII halftime show]]. They also performed Beyonce's "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/02/beyonce_halftime_show_super_bo.html|title=Beyonce halftime show at Super Bowl 2013: Plenty to prove|publisher=[[New Jersey On-Line|New Jersey On-Line LLC]].|date=February 3, 2013|accessdate=February 3, 2013|first=Tris|last=McCall|author-link=Tris McCall}}</ref>

== Cultural impact==
The song created moderate controversy, in a time when late 1990s and early 2000s music was pushing the boundaries of female sexuality. [[Destiny's Child]] was claiming "G-rated fun" and confidence in body image through the lyrics, yet the music video suggested much more with the group wearing much make-up, form-fitting clothes, performing sexually suggestive dancing, and the video featuring close-ups on several dancers' buttocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpyu.org/Page_p.aspx?id=76738|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116200806/http://cpyu.org/Page_p.aspx?id=76738|url-status=dead|title=The Center for Parent/Youth Understanding – Destiny's Child: Pop Music Pied Pipers|archive-date=November 16, 2010}}</ref>

The group later performed the song in front of Jackson for his 30th Anniversary concert, complete with their rendition of his dance moves. Before the premiere of the video on MTV's ''Making the Video'', the girls dedicated the video to Michael Jackson.

The song popularized the [[portmanteau]] term "bootylicious", a combination of the words [[wikt:booty|booty]] and delicious, although the term had already been used by [[Snoop Dogg]] in the song "[[Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')]]" (aka "Dre Day" from [[Dr. Dre]]'s 1992 album ''[[The Chronic]]'') as a pejorative. Bootylicious is also mentioned by a character named Champ in the 1993 "Homey, Don't Ya Know Me?" episode of ''[[A Different World]]''. The term was also used previously in the 1999 video game ''[[Duke Nukem: Time to Kill]]'' as the name of a strip club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=PC&id=cw4d961eba91806&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=9 |title=Regreso al Pasado: Duke Nukem – Artículo en MERISTATION |publisher=Meristation.com |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> The success of the song came after the rise in media visibility of voluptuous personalities like  [[Jennifer Lopez]]. There was a media perception that the appearance of these women corresponded to an appreciation of the supposedly neglected larger hips and thighs common in the figures of black and Latina women. The approving neologism "bootylicious" has entered the mainstream English language<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA475536.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012145611/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA475536.html|url-status=dead|title=Library Journal|archive-date=October 12, 2008|website=www.schoollibraryjournal.com}}</ref> as part of the crossover of African-American popular culture, fashion, and sexual politics.

In September 2011, [[VH1]] ranked "Bootylicious" number 19 on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/09/29/vh1-100-greatest-songs-of-2000s-list/|title=U2, Rihanna, Amy Winehouse, Foo Fighters fill out VH1's '100 Greatest Songs of the '00s'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>
