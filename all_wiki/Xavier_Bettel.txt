==Political life==

===Municipal politics===
In the [[1999 Luxembourg communal election|1999 communal elections]], Bettel was elected to Luxembourg City's communal council, finishing sixth on the DP's list. Two years after his election to the local Council, on 12 July 2001, he was certified as a [[lawyer]].<ref name=CV /> By the time of the [[2004 Luxembourg legislative election|2004 legislative election]], Bettel had significantly consolidated his position, and finished fourth (of the five DP members elected), assuring him a seat in the Chamber of Deputies.<ref>{{cite web|title=2004: Circonscription Centre |url=http://www.elections.public.lu/fr/elections-legislatives/2004/resultats/circonscriptions/centre/index.html |date=7 April 2009 |publisher=Service Information et Presse |access-date=2009-04-10 }}</ref> On 28 November 2005, after the [[2005 Luxembourg communal election|communal elections]] in which he was placed fourth on the DP list, Bettel was appointed ''[[Échevin (Luxembourg)|échevin]]'' in the Council of Luxembourg City.<ref name=CV />

Following municipal elections on 9 October 2011, Bettel was sworn in as Mayor of Luxembourg on 24 November 2011.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120918042337/http://www.wort.lu/wort/web/en/luxembourg/articles/2011/10/164137/index.php "Xavier Bettel - Luxembourg City's new Mayor"], ''Wort.lu'', 10 October 2011. Retrieved 30 October 2011.</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20130111194116/http://www.wort.lu/wort/web/en/luxembourg/articles/2011/11/168555/index.php "Xavier Bettel sworn in as capital's mayor"], ''Wort.lu'', 24 November 2011. Retrieved 29 November 2011</ref>

===National politics===
Bettel ran for the Chamber of Deputies in the [[1999 Luxembourgian legislative election|1999 legislative election]], and finished 10th amongst DP candidates in the [[Circonscription Centre (Luxembourg)|Centre]] constituency, with the top seven being elected.<ref>{{cite web|title= 1999: Circonscription Centre|url=http://www.elections.public.lu/fr/elections-legislatives/1999/resultats/circonscriptions/centre/index.html|date=7 April 2009|publisher= Service Information et Presse|access-date = 10 April 2009}}</ref> However, the DP overtook the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]] (LSAP) as the second-largest party, and its members formed the majority of the [[Juncker-Polfer Ministry|new government]] as the [[Christian Social People's Party]]'s (CSV) coalition partners. Thus, with [[Lydie Polfer]] and [[Anne Brasseur]] vacating their seats to take roles in the government, and [[Colette Flesch]] not taking her seat so as to focus on her role as [[Member of the European Parliament]], Bettel was appointed to the Chamber, starting 12 August 1999.<ref name=CV />

===Prime Minister===
===First term===
In 2013, Bettel was elected leader of the Democratic Party, and in the [[2013 Luxembourgian general election|2013 election]], led the party to a third-ranked position in parliamentary seats. On 25 October, Bettel was designated by [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Henri]] as the [[formateur]] for the next government.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/xavier-bettel-officially-in-charge-of-forming-new-luxembourg-government-526a6eb1e4b0e4d54907baea|title = Xavier Bettel officially in charge of forming new Luxembourg government|date = 25 October 2013|work = Luxemburger Wort|access-date = 7 December 2015}}</ref> He assumed his post as Luxembourg's Prime Minister on 4 December 2013. In the government's coalition of the Democratic Party, [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]] and [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|The Greens]], he leads the cabinet with Co-Deputy Prime Ministers [[Étienne Schneider]] and [[Félix Braz]]. In his first term, he also holds the functions of Minister of State, Minister for Communications and the Media, Minister for Culture and Minister for Religious Affairs.<ref name=CV/>

===Second term===
Following the [[2018 Luxembourg general election]], he became the [[list of openly LGBT heads of government|first openly gay prime minister in the world]] to be re-elected for a second term. He began his second term when his government was formed on 5 December 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luxembourg-government/luxembourg-pm-bettel-begins-second-term-of-coalition-government-idUSKBN1O41XI|title=Luxembourg PM Bettel begins second term of coalition government|publisher=Reuters|date=December 5, 2018|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref>, which he currently leads with Co-Deputy Prime Ministers [[François Bausch]] <nowiki/>and Dan Kersch.  The government is a continuation between the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]] (DP), the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]] (LSAP), and [[The Greens (Luxembourg)|The Greens]] from the [[Bettel–Schneider Ministry I|Bettel I government]], with minor changes.

On 16 September 2019, following a short bilateral meeting on the status of [[Brexit]] negotiations, Bettel continued a press conference without British Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]], after Johnson abruptly pulled out due to an anti-Brexit protest held by British citizens living in Luxembourg.<ref name="JohnsonGuardian">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/16/johnson-humiliated-by-luxembourg-pm-at-empty-chair-press-conference |title=Boris Johnson humiliated by Luxembourg PM at 'empty chair' press conference |last=Boffey |first=Daniel |date=17 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date= 17 September 2019}}</ref> Bettel gestured towards Johnson's empty podium and confirmed that the UK government had not tabled any concrete proposals for amendments to the UK's [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|Withdrawal Agreement]], particularly the "[[Irish backstop]]" that Johnson wishes to replace.<ref name="JohnsonNoDetail">{{cite news |last1=Fleming |first1=Sam |last2=Brunsden |first2=Jim |last3=Parker |first3=George |title=Boris Johnson frustrates EU with dearth of fresh Brexit detail |url=https://www.ft.com/content/695b5e04-d87e-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17 |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=Financial Times |date=16 September 2019}}</ref> This being despite the public pronouncements of Prime Minister Johnson and the UK's departure date from the EU fast approaching.<ref name="JohnsonNoDetail" /> Pro-Brexit UK media reported the matter as an ambush,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rayner |first1=Gordon |last2=Yorke |first2=Harry |last3=Rothwell |first3=James |title=Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson walks into ambush as Luxembourg's PM holds press conference next to empty podium |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/16/brexit-news-latest-deal-boris-johnson-jean-claude-juncker/ |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph |date=16 September 2019}}</ref> whilst other UK and international media outlets largely saw the incident, and the reaction of pro-Brexit UK media outlets to it, as confirming the empty bravado and rhetoric of Johnson's premiership, the reduced status of the UK post-Brexit, and the increasing hypersensitivity and aversion of pro-Brexit pundits and politicians to criticism.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smyth |first1=Patrick |title=What the Boris-Bettel show said about European discourse {{!}} Europe Letter: To the British, last week's podium moment was a humiliation – but they misread the signals |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/what-the-boris-bettel-show-said-about-european-discourse-1.4030460 |access-date=29 September 2019 |work=The Irish Times |date=25 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="JohnsonGuardian" /><ref name="JohnsonNoDetail" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fuentes |first1=Ángel Gómez |title=Johnson forzado a huir de los abucheos en Luxemburgo |url=https://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-johnson-y-juncker-acuerdan-intensificar-conversaciones-brexit-201909161856_noticia.html |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=abc |date=16 September 2019 |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Peeperkorn |first1=Marc |title=Brexitlunch met Juncker loopt uit op koude douche voor Boris Johnson |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/brexitlunch-met-juncker-loopt-uit-op-koude-douche-voor-boris-johnson~b6d56450/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fboris-johnson-xavier-bettel-luxembourg-brexit-europe-newspapers-a9108131.html |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=de Volkskrant |date=16 September 2019 |language=nl-NL}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Skarżyński |first1=Stanisław |title=Premier Luksemburga brutalnie zadrwił z Borisa Johnsona [BREXIT Z BLISKA] |url=http://wyborcza.pl/7,75399,25201123,premier-luksemburga-brutalnie-zadrwil-borisa-johnsona-brexit.html?disableRedirects=true#S.main_topic-K.C-B.1-L.2.duzy |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=wyborcza.pl |language=pl |date=17 September 2019}}</ref>
