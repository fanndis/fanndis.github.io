The '''Lord High Admiral''' (of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and then the [[United Kingdom]], beginning in the 14th century)<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord High Admiral's Divisions takes place at BRNC {{!}} Royal Navy|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2014/may/02/140502-brnc-divisions|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk|publisher=Ministry of Defence, 2 May 2014|accessdate=24 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> is the titular head of the [[Royal Navy]]. Most have been courtiers or members of [[British Royal Family|the Royal Family]], and not professional naval officers. The office of Lord High Admiral is one of the nine English [[Great Officers of State]].

==History==
The office was created in England late 14th century sometime between 1405/06 and 1412 the two existing older naval commands that of the [[Admiral of the North]] and [[Admiral of the West]] were unified with this office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Durston|first1=Gregory|title=The Admiralty Sessions, 1536-1834: Maritime Crime and the Silver Oar|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443873611|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVwpDwAAQBAJ&q=Admiral+of+the+North+and+Admiral+of+the+West+were+unified+with+Lord+High+Admiral&pg=PA4|language=en}}</ref>

During the reign of Henry VIII (1509–47) the [[English Navy]] had expanded to a point where it could not be managed by a single Lord High Admiral alone, therefore day-to-day management of the navy was handed over to a committee that later became known as the [[Navy Board]]. The navy board had [[Samuel Pepys]] as one of its members during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660–85), and it ran side-by-side with the [[Board of Admiralty]].<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book|last1=Dear|first1=edited by I.C.B.|last2=Kemp|first2=Peter|title=The Oxford companion to ships and the sea|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205684|edition= 2nd|chapter=Lord High Admiral}}</ref>

From the early 17th century onwards, when an individual Lord High Admiral was appointed, there was also a [[Lord High Admirals Council|Council of the Lord High Admiral]] which assisted him to perform some of the duties of the [[Admiralty]]. When this office was not occupied by an individual, it was "put into commission" and exercised by a [[Board of Admiralty]] headed by a [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]; this was the usual arrangement from 1709 until it was merged with the [[Admiralty]] in 1832.

However, the office of Lord High Admiral, which, except for brief periods during its long history, had remained extant, and was not abolished as an official naval post until 1964.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> In 1964, the office of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] was also abolished and the functions of the [[Lords Commissioners of Admiralty]] were transferred to the new [[Admiralty Board]] becoming a sub-committee (Navy) of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]]. At the same time, the ancient title of Lord High Admiral was then resumed by the [[British Monarch|sovereign]] personally.

[[Elizabeth II]] held the title for the next 47 years, until in 2011 she conferred the office upon her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] as part of the celebrations for his 90th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duke of Edinburgh Appointed Lord High Admiral|url=https://www.royal.uk/duke-edinburgh-appointed-lord-high-admiral|website=royal.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The Queen chose this title to honour her husband with as he served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and gave up a promising naval career to support her as consort.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15860155 |title=Prince Philip receives Navy title for 90th birthday |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>
