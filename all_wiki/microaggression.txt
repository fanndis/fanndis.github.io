{{short description|Behavioral term}}
'''Microaggression''' is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes toward stigmatized or culturally marginalized groups.<ref name=":1" /> The term was coined by [[Harvard University]] psychiatrist [[Chester Middlebrook Pierce|Chester M. Pierce]] in 1970 to describe insults and dismissals which he regularly witnessed non-black Americans inflicting on [[African Americans]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation| first = Derald Wing | last = Sue | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-49140-9|pages=xvi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title="Multiplication Is for White People": Raising Expectations for Other People's Children|last=Delpit|first=Lisa|name-list-style=vanc|publisher=[[The New Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59558-046-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/multiplicationis0000delp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Stereotypes in Black and White: How Everyday Leaders Can Build Healthier Opportunities for African American Boys and Men|last=Treadwell |first=Henrie M. |publisher=[[Praeger Publishing]]| name-list-style = vanc |year=2013|isbn=978-1-4408-0399-4|pages=47}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Counseling and Psychotherapy Theories in Context and Practice: Skills, Strategies, and Techniques |last=Sommers-Flanagan|first=Rita | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-470-61793-9 |pages=294}}</ref> By the early 21st century, use of the term was applied to the casual degradation of any [[social exclusion|socially marginalized]] group, including [[LGBT]] people, people living in [[poverty]], and people who are [[disability|disabled]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele A.| name-list-style = vanc | year = 2010 | title = Victims of Sexual Assault and Abuse: Resources and Responses for Individuals and Families (Women's Psychology). | publisher = [[Praeger Publishing]] | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-313-37970-3 }}</ref> Psychologist [[Derald Wing Sue]] defines microaggressions as "brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership".

A number of scholars and social commentators have criticised the microaggression concept for its lack of scientific basis, over-reliance on [[subjectivity|subjective]] evidence, and promotion of psychological fragility. Critics argue that avoiding behaviours that one interprets as microaggressions restricts one's own freedom and causes emotional self-harm, and that employing authority figures to address microaggressions (i.e [[call-out culture]]) can lead to an atrophy of those skills needed to mediate one's own disputes.<ref>{{cite journal |last2=Haidt |first1=Greg |last1=Lukianoff |first2=Jonathan |title=How Trigger Warnings Are Hurting Mental Health on Campus |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/ |journal=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 September 2018|date=September 2015 }}</ref> Some argue that, because the term "microaggression" uses language connoting violence to describe verbal conduct, it can be (and is) abused to exaggerate harm, resulting in retribution and the elevation of [[Victim mentality|victimhood]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |title=Why Critics of the 'Microaggressions' Framework Are Skeptical |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-critics-of-the-microaggressions-framework-are-skeptical/405106/ |website=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]] |accessdate=2 September 2018 |date=14 September 2015}}</ref>

== Description ==
Microaggressions are common, everyday slights and comments that relate to various intersections of one’s identity such as gender, sex, race, ethnicity, and age, among other aspects. They are thought to spring from unconsciously held prejudices and beliefs which may be demonstrated consciously or unconsciously through daily verbal interactions.<ref>Sue, D. W., & Capodilupo, C. M. (2008). Racial, gender, and sexual orientation microaggressions: Implications for counseling and psychotherapy. In D.W. Sue & D. Sue (Eds.), Counseling the culturally diverse: Theory and practice. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> Although these communications typically appear harmless to observers, they are considered a form of covert racism or everyday discrimination.<ref name="Kanter 2017" /> Microaggressions differ from what Pierce referred to as “macroaggressions”, which are more extreme forms of racism (such as lynchings or beatings) due to their ambiguity, size and commonality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pierce |first1=C. |editor1-last=Barbour |editor1-first=F.  | name-list-style = vanc |title=In the Black Seventies |date=1970 |publisher=Porter Sargent |location=Boston, MA |pages=265–282 |ref=Pierce |chapter=Offensive mechanisms}}</ref> Microaggressions are experienced by most stigmatized individuals and occur on a regular basis. These can be particularly stressful for people on the receiving end as they are easily denied by those committing them. They are also harder to detect by members of the [[dominant culture]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alabi |first1=J. |date=2015 |title=Racial microaggressions in academic libraries: results of a survey of minority and non-minority librarians. |journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=47–53|url=http://aurora.auburn.edu/bitstream/handle/11200/48541/racial%20microaggressions%20in%20the%20academic%20library%20environment_for%20aurora.pdf?sequence=1 |doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2014.10.008}}</ref> as they are often unaware they are causing harm.<ref name="Sue, D. 2007" /> Sue describes microaggressions as including statements that repeat or affirm [[stereotype]]s about the minority group or subtly demean its members. Such comments also position the dominant culture as normal and the minority one as aberrant or pathological, express disapproval of or discomfort with the minority group, assume that all minority group members are the same, minimize the existence of discrimination against the minority group, seek to deny the perpetrator's own bias, or minimize real conflict between the minority group and the dominant culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In conducting two focus groups with [[Asian-Americans]], for instance, Sue proposed eight distinct themes of racial microaggression:<ref name="Sue, D. 2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sue DW, Capodilupo CM, Torino GC, Bucceri JM, Holder AM, Nadal KL, Esquilin M | title = Racial microaggressions in everyday life: implications for clinical practice | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–86 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17516773 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.4.271 }}</ref>

*[[Perpetual foreigner|Alien in own land]]: When people assume [[person of color|people of color]] (POC) are foreigners or from a different country.
** E.g.: "So where are you really from?" or "Why don't you have an accent?"
* Ascription of intelligence: When POC are stereotyped as being intelligent or assumed to be at a certain level of intelligence based on their race.
** E.g.: "You people always do well in school." or "If I see a lot of Asian students in my class, I know it's going to be a hard class."
* Denial of racial reality: This is when a person emphasizes that a POC does not suffer any discrimination, thus implying they do not face inequality. It correlates to the idea of [[model minority]].
* Exoticization of non-white women: It stereotypes these Americans as being in the "exotic" category. They are stereotyped by their physical appearance and their gender, based on media and literature. One example is Asian-American women portrayed as the submissive or obedient type; alternatively, they may be portrayed or described as Dragon Lady, Tiger Mom, or Lotus Blossom, using symbols from their cultures. On the other hand, Asian-American men are portrayed as being emasculated or weak.
* Refusal to acknowledge intra-ethnic differences: The homogeneity of broad ethnic groups is emphasized and assumed; the speaker ignores intra-ethnic differences. The focus groups identified the statement that "all Asian-Americans look alike" as a main assumption for this theme. Similarly, thinking that all members of an ethnic minority group speak the same language or have the same values or culture falls under this theme.
* Pathologizing cultural values/communication styles: When Asian Americans' cultures and values are viewed as less desirable. For example, many people from the focus groups felt disadvantaged by the expectation of verbal participation in school and college classes, when Asian cultural norms value silence. Because of this discrepancy, many Asian-Americans felt that they were being forced to conform to Western cultural norms in order to succeed academically.
* Second-class citizenship: This theme emphasizes the idea that people of color are being treated as lesser beings, and are not treated with equal rights or presented as a first priority.
** E.g.: A Korean man walks into a bar and asks for a drink, but the bartender ignores the man when he serves a white man first.
* Invisibility: This theme focuses on the idea that Asian Americans are considered invisible or outside discussions of race and racism. According to some focus group members, recent dialogues on race in the United States have often focused only on issues between whites and blacks, excluding Asian-Americans.

In a 2017 peer-reviewed review of the literature, [[Scott Lilienfeld]] critiqued microaggression research for hardly having advanced beyond taxonomies such as the above, which was proposed by Sue nearly ten years earlier.<ref name="Lilienfeld">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lilienfeld SO | title = Microaggressions | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–169 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28073337 | doi = 10.1177/1745691616659391 | author-link = Scott Lilienfeld }}</ref> While acknowledging the reality of "subtle slights and insults directed toward minorities", Lilienfeld concluded that the concept and programs for its scientific assessment are "far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts to warrant real-world application".<ref name="Lilienfeld" /> He recommended abandonment of the term ''microaggression'' since "the use of the root word 'aggression' in 'microaggression' is conceptually confusing and misleading". In addition, he called for a moratorium on microaggression training programs until further research can develop the field.<ref name="Lilienfeld" />

In 2017 Althea Nagai, who works as a research fellow at the conservative [[Center for Equal Opportunity]], published an article criticizing microaggression research as [[pseudoscience]].<ref name="nagai">{{cite journal|last=Nagai|first=Althea|date=9 February 2017|title=The Pseudo-Science of Microaggressions|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/the_pseudo_science_of_microaggressions|journal=Academic Questions|volume=30|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1007/s12129-016-9613-5|issn=0895-4852|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> Nagai said that the prominent [[Critical race theory|critical race]] researchers behind microaggression theory "reject the methodology and standards of modern science."<ref name="nagai" /> She lists various technical shortcomings of microaggression research, including "biased interview questions, reliance on narrative and small numbers of respondents, problems of reliability, issues of replicability, and ignoring alternative explanations."<ref name="nagai" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2017/08/02/rutgers-orders-freshmen-to-add-microagre|title=Rutgers Orders Freshmen to Add Microaggression to Their Course Lists|last=Marchello|first=Lindsay|date=August 2, 2017|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|access-date=August 4, 2017|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

=== Race or ethnicity ===
{{Main|Racism}}
Social scientists Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, and Torino (2007) described microaggressions as "the new face of racism", saying that the nature of racism has shifted over time from overt expressions of [[racial hatred]] and [[hate crime]]s, toward expressions of [[aversive racism]], such as microaggressions, that are more subtle, ambiguous, and often unintentional. Sue says this has led some Americans to believe wrongly that non-white Americans no longer suffer from racism.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://library.standrews-de.org/lists/courseguides/sas-specific_topic-research/diversity-readings/microaggressions_black.pdf|title = Racial Microaggressions Against Black Americans: Implications for Counseling|first = Derald Wing|last = Sue|name-list-style = vanc|date = Summer 2008|journal = Journal of Counseling & Development|volume = 86|issue = 3|pages = 330–338|access-date = 11 September 2014|doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6678.2008.tb00517.x|display-authors = etal|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912082517/http://library.standrews-de.org/lists/courseguides/sas-specific_topic-research/diversity-readings/microaggressions_black.pdf|archive-date = 12 September 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> One example of such subtle expressions of racism is Asian students being either pathologized or penalized as too passive or quiet.<ref name="Sue, D. 2007"/> Another is a teacher correcting a student's use of "indigenous" in a paper by changing it from upper- to lowercase.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/25/ucla-grad-students-stage-sit-during-class-protest-what-they-see-racially-hostile|title=UCLA grad students stage sit-in during a class to protest what they see as racially hostile climate|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}</ref>

According to Sue ''et al''.,<ref name="Sue, D. 2007"/> microaggressions seem to appear in three forms:
* Microassault: an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal; e.g. name-calling, avoidant behavior, purposeful discriminatory actions.
* Microinsult: communications that convey rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity; subtle snubs; unknown to the perpetrator; hidden insulting message to the recipient.
* Microinvalidation: communications that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group.

Some psychologists have criticized microaggression theory for assuming that all verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities are necessarily due to bias.<ref name="Lilienfeld" /><ref name="Thomas">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas KR | title = Macrononsense in multiculturalism | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 274–5; discussion 277–9 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18473616 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.63.4.274 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris RS | title = Racial microaggression?

Other examples of sexist microaggressions are "[addressing someone by using] a sexist name, a man refusing to wash dishes because it is 'women's work,' displaying nude pin-ups of women at places of employment, someone making unwanted sexual advances toward another person".<ref>{{cite book |last=Wing |first=D.

=== Sexuality and sexual orientation ===
{{Further|Biphobia|Homophobia}}

In focus groups, individuals identifying as [[bisexual]] report such microaggressions as others denying or dismissing their self-narratives or identity claims, being unable to understand or accept bisexuality as a possibility, pressuring them to change their bisexual identity, expecting them to be sexually promiscuous, and questioning their ability to maintain monogamous relationships.<ref name="Bostwick">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bostwick W, Hequembourg A | title = 'Just a little hint': bisexual-specific microaggressions and their connection to epistemic injustices | journal = Culture, Health & Sexuality | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 488–503 | pmid = 24666221 | doi = 10.1080/13691058.2014.889754 | year = 2014 }}</ref>

Some LGBT individuals report receiving expressions of microaggression from people even within the [[LGBT community]].<ref name="Roffee Waling pp. 190–201"/> They say that being excluded, or not being made welcome or understood within the gay and lesbian community is a microaggression.<ref name="Bostwick"/> Roffee and Waling suggest that the issue arises, as occurs among many groups of people, because a person often makes assumptions based on individual experience, and when they communicate such assumptions, the recipient may feel that it lacks taking the second individual into account and is a form of microaggression.<ref name="Roffee Waling pp. 190–201">{{cite journal | last=Roffee | first=James A. | last2=Waling | first2=Andrea | name-list-style = vanc | year=2016 | title=Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ youth | journal=Safer Communities | volume=15 | issue=4 | issn=1757-8043 | pages=190–201 | doi=10.1108/sc-02-2016-0004}}</ref>

People who are members of overlapping marginal groups (e.g., a gay Asian American man or a trans woman) experience microaggressions based in correspondingly varied forms of marginalization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and College Student Wellbeing |date=July 25, 2013 | last = Zesiger | first = Heather | name-list-style = vanc  | url = http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hp/documents/pdfs/Racial%20Microaggressions%20and%20College%20Student%20Wellbeing.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014170818/http://studenthealth.emory.edu/hp/documents/pdfs/Racial%20Microaggressions%20and%20College%20Student%20Wellbeing.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2016 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}

{{Further|Disability abuse}}
People with mental illness report receiving more overt forms of microaggression than subtle ones, coming from family and friends as well as from authority figures.<ref name=Gonzales/> In a study involving college students and adults who were being treated in community care, five themes were identified: invalidation, assumption of inferiority, fear of mental illness, shaming of mental illness, and being treated as a second-class citizen.<ref name=Gonzales>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzales L, Davidoff KC, Nadal KL, Yanos PT | title = Microaggressions experienced by persons with mental illnesses: An exploratory study | journal = Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–41 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25402611 | doi = 10.1037/prj0000096 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268450566 }}</ref>

=== Media ===
Members of marginalized groups have also described microaggressions committed by performers or artists associated with various forms of media, such as television, film, photography, music, and books. Some researchers believe that such cultural content reflects but also molds society,<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Chester M.|last2=Carew|first2=Jean V.|last3=Pierce-Gonzalez|first3=Diane|last4=Wills|first4=Deborah| name-list-style = vanc |title=An Experiment in Racism|journal=Education and Urban Society|volume=10|issue=1|pages=61–87|doi=10.1177/001312457701000105|year=1977}}</ref> allowing for unintentional bias to be absorbed by individuals based on their [[media consumption]], as if it were expressed by someone with whom they had an encounter.

The personification of these attitudes through media can also be applied to microaggressive behaviors towards other marginalized groups.

=== Ageism and intolerance ===
Microaggression can target and marginalize any definable group, including those who share an age grouping or belief system.

Because microaggressions are subtle and perpetrators may be well-meaning, the recipients often experience [[attributional ambiguity]], which may lead them to dismiss the event and blame themselves as overly sensitive to the encounter.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Internalized Oppression: The Psychology of Marginalized Groups|last = David|first = E.J.R. | name-list-style = vanc |publisher = Springer Publishing Company|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-8261-9925-6|pages = 5}}</ref> 

If challenged by the minority person or an observer, perpetrators will often defend their microaggression as a misunderstanding, a joke, or something small that should not be blown out of proportion.<ref name="Love" />

A 2020 study involving American college students found a correlation between likelihood to commit microaggressions, and racial bias.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kanter |first=Jonathan |title=Microaggressions aren't just innocent blunders – new research links them with racial bias |url=http://theconversation.com/microaggressions-arent-just-innocent-blunders-new-research-links-them-with-racial-bias-145894 |access-date=2020-09-27 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref>

== Effects ==
A 2013 scholarly review of the literature on microaggressions concluded that "the negative impact of racial microaggressions on psychological and physical health is beginning to be documented; however, these studies have been largely correlational and based on recall and self-report, making it difficult to determine whether racial microaggressions actually cause negative health outcomes and, if so, through what mechanisms".<ref name="wong">{{cite journal|vauthors=Wong G, Derthick AO, David EJ, Saw A, Okazaki S|date=June 2014|title=How: A Review of Racial Microaggressions Research in Psychology|journal=Race and Social Problems|volume=6|issue=2|pages=181–200|doi=10.1007/s12552-013-9107-9|pmc=4762607|pmid=26913088}}</ref>  A 2017 review of microaggression research pointed out that as scholars try to understand the possible harm caused by microaggressions, they have not conducted much cognitive or behavioural research, nor much experimental testing, and they have overly relied on small collections of anecdotal testimonies from samples who are not representative of any particular population.<ref name="Lilienfeld" />

==Criticism==
=== Public discourse and harm to speakers ===
<!-- This paragraph needs a good opening line to summarize; it's a bit of a hodge-podge -->
Kenneth R. Thomas wrote in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' that recommendations inspired by microaggression theory, if "implemented, could have a [[chilling effect]] on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and on the willingness of [[White people]], including some psychologists, to interact with people of color."<ref name="Thomas"/> Sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning have written in the academic journal ''Comparative Sociology'' that the microaggression concept "fits into a larger class of conflict tactics in which the aggrieved seek to attract and mobilize the support of third parties" that sometimes involves "building a case for action by documenting, exaggerating, or even falsifying offenses".<ref name="campbell">{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Bradley |last2=Manning |first2=Jason | name-list-style = vanc |date=2014 |title=Microaggression and Moral Cultures |journal=Comparative Sociology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=692–726 |doi=10.1163/15691330-12341332 }}</ref> The concept of microaggressions has been described as a symptom of the breakdown in [[civil discourse]], and that microaggressions are "yesterday's well-meaning faux pas".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Demetriou |first1=Dan |chapter=Fighting Together: Civil Discourse and Agonistic Honor|title= Honor in the Modern World: Interdisciplinary Perspectives |editor-first1 = Laurie | editor-last1 = Johnson | editor-first2 = Dan | editor-last2 = Demetriou | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Lexington Books |year=<!-- unpublished --> |chapter-url=http://philpapers.org/rec/DEMFTC|access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>

One suggested type of microaggression by an [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] newsletter was avoiding eye contact or not speaking directly to people. This spurred a controversy when it was pointed out that such assumptions are insensitive to [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] people who may have trouble making eye contact.<ref name=eye1>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-39742670|title=Oxford sorry for eye contact racism claim|date=2017-04-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=eye2>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/04/29/oxford-university-apologises-everyday-racism-advice-offended/|title=Oxford University apologises for 'everyday racism' advice which offended autistic people|last=Turner|first=Camilla|date=2017-04-29|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

=== Culture of victimhood ===
In their article "[[Microaggression and Moral Cultures]]", sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning<ref name="campbell"/> say that the discourse of microaggression leads to a [[Victim mentality|culture of victimhood]]. Social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] states that this culture of victimhood lessens an individual's "ability to handle small interpersonal matters on one's own" and "creates a society of constant and intense [[moral conflict]] as people compete for status as victims or as defenders of victims".<ref name="Haidtblog1">{{Cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Haidt | name-list-style = vanc | work = Righteous Mind  |title=Where microaggressions really come from: A sociological account|url=http://righteousmind.com/where-microaggressions-really-come-from/|access-date=20 September 2015|quote=The key idea is that the new moral culture of victimhood fosters 'moral dependence' and an atrophying of the ability to handle small interpersonal matters on one's own. At the same time that it weakens individuals, it creates a society of constant and intense moral conflict as people compete for status as victims or as defenders of victims.| date = 2015-09-07 }}</ref> Similarly, the linguist and social commentator [[John McWhorter]] says that "it infantilizes black people to be taught that microaggressions, and even ones a tad more macro, hold us back, permanently damage our psychology, or render us exempt from genuine competition."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/07/26/starbucks-and-the-swimming-pool/|title=Starbucks and the Swimming Pool - The American Interest|date=2018-07-26|work=The American Interest|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}</ref> McWhorter does not disagree that microaggressions exist. However, he worries that too much societal focus on microaggressions will cause other problems and has stated that the term should be confined to "when people belittle us on the basis of stereotypes."<ref>{{Cite web|title='Microaggression' Is the New Racism on Campus|url=http://time.com/32618/microaggression-is-the-new-racism-on-campus/|access-date=2018-08-14|website=Time|language=en}}</ref>

=== Emotional distress ===
In ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Greg Lukianoff]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] expressed concern that the focus on microaggressions can cause more emotional trauma than the experience of the microaggressions at the time of occurrence. They believe that self-policing by an individual of thoughts or actions in order to avoid committing microaggressions may cause emotional harm as a person seeks to avoid becoming a microaggressor, as such extreme self-policing may share some characteristics of pathological thinking.<ref name="atlantic">{{Citation|last=Lukianoff|first=Greg|title=The Coddling of the American Mind|date=September 2015|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/|last2=Haidt|first2=Jonathan| name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref> Referring especially to prevention programs at schools or universities, they say that the element of protectiveness, of which identifying microaggression allegations are a part, prepares students "poorly for professional life, which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong".<ref name=atlantic/> They also said that it has become "unacceptable to question the reasonableness (let alone the sincerity) of someone's emotional state", resulting in adjudication of alleged microaggressions having characteristics of [[witch trials]].<ref name="atlantic"/>

Writing for ''[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]'', Paul Rowan Brian argued that microaggression theory pools trivial and ignorable instances of racism with real, genuine prejudice and exclusion.<ref name="Rowan">{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2013/12/16/unmasking-mustachioed-menace-microaggression/|title=Unmasking The Mustachioed Menace Of Microaggression | first = Paul Rowan | last = Brian | name-list-style = vanc |date=December 16, 2013|work=The Federalist}}</ref> [[Amitai Etzioni]], writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', suggested that attention to microaggressions distracts individuals and groups from dealing with much more serious acts.<ref name="Etzioni">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/dont-sweat-the-microaggressions/360278/|work=The Atlantic|title=Don't Sweat the Microaggressions|date=April 8, 2014|first=Amitai|last=Etzioni | name-list-style = vanc }}</ref>

=== Political correctness ===
Viv Regan, writing for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked Online]]'', wondered whether the comfort provided by having a convenient label for alleged rudeness outweighs the damage caused by overreaction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Regan|first1=Viv | name-list-style = vanc |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/microaggression-desperately-seeking-discrimination1/16407#.VKISZemA8|publisher=Spiked|title= Microaggression: desperately seeking discrimination |date=29 December 2014}}</ref>

According to Derald Wing Sue, whose works popularized the term, many critiques are based on the term being misunderstood or misused. He said that his purpose in identifying such comments or actions was to educate people and not to silence or shame them. He further notes that, for instance, identifying that someone has used racial microaggressions is not intended to imply that they are racist.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda | name-list-style = vanc |title=What Happens When Your Research Is Featured on 'Fox & Friends' |url=http://chronicle.com/article/What-Happens-When-Your/236949|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=30 June 2016|date=2016-06-29 }}</ref>

=== Mind reading ===
According to Lilienfeld, a possible harmful effect of microaggression programs is to increase an individual's tendency to over-interpret the words of others in a negative way. He says:
{{Quote|...many of the implicit messages posited by Sue and colleagues appear to reflect quintessential examples of what cognitive-behavioral therapists...term...''mind-reading'', in which individuals assume—without attempts at verification—that others are reacting negatively to them.... For example, Sue et al...regarded the question "Where were you born?" directed at Asian Americans as a microaggression.... Yet most cognitive-behavioral therapists would maintain that leaping to this inference without attempting to check it out constitutes mind reading, as the intent of this question is compatible with a host of interpretations.<ref name="Lilienfeld"/>{{rp|147}}
