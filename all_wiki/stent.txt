In [[medicine]], a '''stent''' is a metal or plastic tube inserted into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open, and '''stenting''' is the placement of a stent. There is a wide variety of stents used for different purposes, from expandable [[coronary stent|coronary]], [[endovascular surgery|vascular]] and [[bile duct|biliary]] stents, to simple plastic stents used to allow the flow of [[urine]] between [[kidney]] and [[bladder]]. "Stent" is also used as a [[verb]] to describe the placement of such a device, particularly when a disease such as [[atherosclerosis]] has [[pathology|pathologically]] narrowed a structure such as an [[artery]].

A stent is slightly different from a [[shunt (medical)|shunt]]. A shunt is a tube that connects two previously unconnected parts of the body to allow fluid to flow between them. Stents and shunts can be made of similar materials but perform two different tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/CerebralSpinalFluidCSFShuntSystems/default.htm|title=Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Shunt Systems|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>

| [[Coronary stent]]s are placed during a [[angioplasty|coronary angioplasty]]. The most common use for coronary stents is in the [[Coronary artery|coronary arteries]], into which a [[bare-metal stent]], a [[drug-eluting stent]], a bioabsorbable stent, <!-- abbreviation not explained a BVS or --> a [[Genous|dual-therapy stent]] (combination of both drug and bioengineered stent), or occasionally a covered stent is inserted.

| Vascular stents are a common treatment for advanced [[peripheral artery disease|peripheral]] and [[cerebrovascular disease]].  Common sites treated with vascular stents include the [[carotid artery|carotid]], [[Common iliac artery|iliac]], and [[femoral artery|femoral]] arteries.  Because of the external compression and mechanical forces subjected to these locations, flexible stent materials such as [[nitinol]] are used in a majority of peripheral stent placements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vogel|first=T|author2=Shindelman, L. |author3=Nackman, G. |author4=Graham, A. |title=Efficacious Use of Nitinol Stents in the Femoral and Popliteal Arteries.|journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|date=2003|volume=38|issue=6|pages=1178–1183 |doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2003.09.011}}</ref>

Vascular stents made of metals can lead to thrombosis at the site of treatment or to inflammation scarring. [[Drug-eluting_stent|Drug-eluting stents]] with pharmacologic agents or as drug delivery vehicles have been developed as an alternative to decrease the chances of restenosis.

| A stent graft or covered stent is type of vascular stent with a fabric coating that creates a contained tube but is expandable like a [[Bare-metal stent|bare metal stent]]. Covered stents are used in [[endovascular surgery|endovascular surgical]] procedures such as [[endovascular aneurysm repair]]. Stent grafts are also used to treat [[stenosis|stenoses]] in [[vascular graft]]s and [[fistula]]s used for [[Hemodialysis#Access|hemodialysis]].
Fenestrated stent grafts are now commonly used in open and endovascular aortic procedures to supply the body's vital organs the necessary oxygenated blood supply.

|-
| [[Ureteric stent|Ureteral stents]] are used to ensure the patency of a [[ureter]], which may be compromised, for example, by a [[kidney stone]]. This method is sometimes used as a temporary measure to prevent damage to a blocked kidney until a procedure to remove the stone can be performed.

==Etymology==
As Ariel Roguin describes in his paper "Stent: The Man and Word Behind the Coronary Metal Prosthesis", the current acceptable origin of the word stent is that it derives from the name of a dentist, [[Charles Stent|Charles Thomas Stent]], notable for his advances in the field of denture-making. He was born in Brighton, England, on October 17, 1807, was a dentist in London, and is most famous for improving and modifying the denture base of the [[gutta-percha]], creating the Stent's compounding that made it practical as a material for dental impressions.

The verb form "stenting" was used for centuries to describe the process of stiffening garments (a usage long obsolete, per the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') and some believe this to be the origin. According to the Merriam Webster Third New International Dictionary, the noun evolved from the Middle English verb ''stenten'', shortened from ''extenten'', meaning to stretch, which in turn came from Latin ''extentus'', past participle of ''extendere'', to stretch out. Others attribute the noun "stent" to [[Jan F. Esser]], a Dutch plastic surgeon who in 1916 used the word to describe a dental impression compound invented in 1856 by the English [[dentist]] [[Charles Stent]] (1807&ndash;1885), whom Esser employed to craft a form for facial reconstruction. The full account is described in the ''Journal of the History of Dentistry''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=How a Dentist's Name Became a Synonym for a Life-saving Device: The Story of Dr. Charles Stent|journal=Journal of the History of Dentistry|year=2001|first=Malvin|last=Ring|volume=49|issue=2|pages=77–80|url=http://www.fauchard.org/publications/34-the-story-of-dr-charles-stent|pmid=11484317|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>  According to the author, from the use of Stent's compound as a support for facial tissues evolved the use of a stent to hold open various body structures.

The first (self-expanding) "stents" used in medical practice in 1986 by [[Ulrich Sigwart]] in Lausanne were initially called "Wallstents" after its inventor, Hans Wallstén.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rorsman|first1=Birgitta|title=His invention saves millions of lives     {{!}} Chalmers|url=http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/alumni/chalmersprofiles/Pages/His-invention-saves-millions-of-lives.aspx|website=www.chalmers.se|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invivomagazine.com/en/in_situ/health_valley/article/75/hans-wallsten-inventor-of-the-stent|title=Hans Wallsten, inventor of the stent|website=Invivo Magazine|author=Céline Bilardo|access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref>
[[Julio Palmaz]] ''et al.'' created a balloon-expandable stent that is currently used.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Palmaz JC, Sibbitt RR, Reuter SR, Tio FO, Rice WJ | date = Jul 1985 | title = Expandable intraluminal graft: a preliminary study.

== History ==
The first use of a coronary stent is typically attributed to {{Ill|Jacques Puel|fr}} and [[Ulrich Sigwart]] when they implanted a stent into a patient in Toulouse, France, in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roguin|first1=Ariel|title=Historical Perspectives in Cardiology|journal=Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions|date=2011|volume=4|pages=206–209|doi=10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.110.960872|url=http://circinterventions.ahajournals.org/content/4/2/206.full|accessdate=6 April 2015|pmid=21505167|doi-access=free}}</ref> It was used as a scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid [[restenosis]] in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter, in 1987, [[Julio Palmaz]] (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent <ref>{{cite web|url=https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthscsa/00022/hscsa-00022.html|title=Guide to the Julio Palmaz Papers|access-date=2018-08-24}}</ref>) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in Germany. 

Though several doctors have been credited with the creation of  the stent, the first FDA-approved stent in the USA was created by Richard Schatz and coworkers. Named the Palmaz-Schatz (Johnson & Johnson) it was developed in 1987. <ref>{{cite journal|journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | author = Garg S, Serruys PW| date = 2010 | title = Coronary Stents: current status | volume = 56 | doi= 10.1016/j.jcc.2010.06.007}}</ref>

To further reduce the incidence of restenosis, the [[drug-eluting stent]] was introduced in 2003. <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Puranek AS, Dawson ER, Peppas NA | date = Jan 2013 | title = Recent Advances in Drug Eluting Stents | journal = Int J Pharm | volume = 441 | issue = 1–2 | doi=  10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.10.029 | pmid=23117022| pmc = 3567608 | pages=665–679}}</ref>
