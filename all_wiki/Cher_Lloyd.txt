Her debut single, "[[Swagger Jagger]]", was released in July 2011 and entered at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Lloyd’s second single, "[[With Ur Love]]" featuring [[Mike Posner]], was released on 31 October 2011, and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart. Her debut album, ''[[Sticks and Stones (Cher Lloyd album)|Sticks and Stones]],'' had two releases: its standard edition and a US version. The album peaked at number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]] while the latter version debuted at number nine in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Lloyd signed to US record label [[Epic Records]] in 2011.

Lloyd achieved mainstream success in the US with the solo version of her single "[[Want U Back]]", which reached the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Her next song "[[Oath (song)|Oath]]", featuring American rapper [[Becky G]], failed to match the success, peaking at 73. She released her second album, ''[[Sorry I'm Late]]'' in May 2014, preceded by the lead single, "[[I Wish (Cher Lloyd song)|I Wish]]". The album failed to match the success of its predecessor, peaking at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the ''Billboard'' 200. After a [[Really Don't Care|collaboration]] with singer [[Demi Lovato]], Lloyd had a two-year absence from the music industry.

In July 2016, Lloyd released the single "[[Activated]]". The song was described as a "memo of Cher to her fans to say she is back and she is stronger than ever".<ref name="UnrealityTV UK">{{cite web|url = http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/showbiz/review-cher-lloyds-activated-like-prologue-book-fantastic-introduction-just-not-lead-single/|title = REVIEW: Cher Lloyd's Activated is a fantastic reintroduction!|last1 = Barnes|first1 = Nick|access-date = 11 September 2016|date = 24 July 2016|work = UnrealityTV UK|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911143722/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/showbiz/review-cher-lloyds-activated-like-prologue-book-fantastic-introduction-just-not-lead-single/|archive-date = 11 September 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> She released the singles "[[None of My Business]]" and "M.I.A." in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

==Career==
===2010–2011: ''The X Factor''===
[[File:Cher Lloyd X Factor Live Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|Lloyd performing at The X Factor Live in Glasgow on 1 April 2011]]
Lloyd had previously auditioned for ''The X Factor'' before (when the minimum age was lower), singing ballads, but did not make it through.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} She had previously performed at holiday camps and said she received a mixed reaction to her music, but was a big hit with ''X Factor'' judges at the time. She auditioned singing the [[Keri Hilson]] version of "[[Turn My Swag On]]" by [[Soulja Boy]].<ref name="ds0310">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/gameon/view/156601/X-Factor-starlet-Cher-Lloyd-to-fight-on/ |title=X Factor Starlet Cher Lloyd to Fight on |date=3 October 2010 |author=Gleave, Ed |newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]}}</ref> At bootcamp she sang a rap version of "[[Viva La Vida]]".

Lloyd sang a rendition of "[[Just Be Good to Me]]" in the first of the live shows. In the second live show, she performed "[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]." In the third live show, she sang a mashup of "[[No Diggity]]" and "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]", and in the fourth live show, she sang "[[Stay (Shakespears Sister song)|Stay]]." This was the first time Lloyd did not rap in her performance, and Cowell even called it "the performance of the series." In week five, Lloyd sang "[[Empire State of Mind]]", but the judges stated that after the previous week they were disappointed. However, they agreed that she redeemed herself with her rendition of "[[Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word]]" mixed with "[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]", by [[Elton John]] and [[Eminem]], respectively, in week 6. In the seventh week, Lloyd was in the bottom two for the first time after her rendition of "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]", but Cowell, Cole and Walsh all saved her in the final showdown. In the following week, Lloyd performed "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]", followed by "[[Walk This Way]]". Both performances were credited by the judges, and she was saved by the public vote the following night, securing her position in the semifinal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/200816-the-x-factor-2010-the-acts-who-made-it-to-the-live-shows/ |title=The X Factor 2010: the 12 acts who made it to the Live Shows|publisher=STV Entertainment|date=3 October 2010 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> In the semifinal, Lloyd performed "[[Nothin' on You]]" and "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" and was in the bottom two with [[Mary Byrne (singer)|Mary Byrne]]. She was saved by the judges again and put through to the final.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} In the final, she performed a mashup of "[[The Clapping Song]]" and "[[Get Ur Freak On]]", followed by a duet with [[will.i.am]], which was a mashup of "[[Where Is the Love?]]" and "[[I Gotta Feeling]]." Lloyd was then eliminated in fourth place, having received the fewest public votes.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Lloyd and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour from February 2011 to April 2011. The tour saw Lloyd performing for 500,000 people throughout the UK.

As a musical artist, Lloyd has been described as an "expressive, playful R&B" artist, with a "unique blend of pop smarts and urban attitude." She stated in a ''[[BBC]]'' article that, "I feel like I've finally entered this new phase of my career where it's totally authentic" in regards to her music career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50763782|title=Cher Lloyd: 'I'm Not on the Conveyor Belt Any More'|access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref>
<blockquote><p>"When you enter the music industry at such a young age [...] I had to grow up and discover who I was and how I want to be heard. I've got nothing to hide any more. My music is 100% me. It's been me going into sessions and me writing the songs. I'm not from a big machine, and I'm not stuck on the conveyor belt that I used to be on. I've jumped off, and that's really scary. But at the same time, super empowering"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50763782|title=Cher Lloyd: 'I'm Not on the Conveyor Belt Any More'|access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref></p></blockquote>
Early in her career, Lloyd was known for her "infectious pop-rap, charting hits," ranging from songs such as "[[Swagger Jagger]]" and "[[Want U Back]]" to her collaborations "[[Really Don't Care]]" with [[Demi Lovato]] and "[[Oath (song)|Oath]]" with [[Becky G]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-cher-lloyd-get-activated-for-new-album-121310/|title=Hear Cher Lloyd Get 'Activated' for New Album|access-date=August 27, 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> With the release of "[[None of My Business]]" and "M.I.A", she began to take a more mature approach to her work in what ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described as a "mature phase."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-cher-lloyd-get-activated-for-new-album-121310/|title=Hear Cher Lloyd Get 'Activated' for New Album|access-date=August 27, 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> She is often described as [[pop-rap]] artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8532778/cher-lloyd-mia|title=Cher Lloyd Returns With 'M.I.A.,' an Anthem For Your Post-Party Plans|access-date=August 27, 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-cher-lloyd-get-activated-for-new-album-121310/|title=Hear Cher Lloyd Get 'Activated' for New Album|access-date=August 27, 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> 

===Influences ===
Lloyd revealed in an interview that she is a fan of [[Dolly Parton]].<ref name=Influences1>{{cite web|last=Galyes|first=Contessa|title=Cher Lloyd: 'X Factor UK' at 16, Engaged at 18, and Still Never Growing Up (In House)|url=http://blog.music.aol.com/2012/05/22/cher-lloyd-x-factor-uk/|publisher=Blogmusic|access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref> Lloyd has cited rapper [[Nicki Minaj]] as an influence and said that she looks up to Minaj for her "attitude" around "doing what you feel like doing and be who you are." Lloyd went on to say that Minaj "has helped change pop music ... and there's no denying it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/cher-lloyd/news/nicki-minaj-changed-pop/|title=Cher Lloyd Says Nicki Minaj Helped Change Pop Music: "I Admire How Brave She Is"|website=Captial FM|access-date=13 August 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In January 2012, Lloyd announced her engagement to her boyfriend of less than a year, Craig Monk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cher Lloyd announces engagement|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/cher-lloyd-announces-engagement-535406.html|publisher=Breakingnews|date=11 January 2012}}</ref> In May 2018, they had their first child, daughter Delilah-Rae.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jess|title=Cher Lloyd Gives Birth, Welcomes Baby Girl Delilah-Rae|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/939490/cher-lloyd-gives-birth-welcomes-baby-girl-delilah-rae|access-date=28 May 2018|date=28 May 2018}}</ref>

===Tattoos===
Lloyd has several different types of tattoos, expressing different emotions, such as an eye on her inner forearm.<ref name=Influences1 /> She has a collection of 21 total tattoos ranging from a cage holding a bird to represent her deceased uncle to the heart in her ring finger as a tribute to her husband Craig.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/cher-lloyd-strips-show-tattoos-2047907|title=Cher Lloyd strips off to show us her tattoos on Inked magazine|first=Issy|last=Sampson|date=12 July 2013|website=Mirror.co.uk|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> {{Quotation |I have many of them now. I really cannot stand some people when they say to me, "Oh it's going to look horrible when you're 60." Who cares? Then it's going to be like a piece of artwork that people can look at and see all the crazy things I did in my life. It's expressing me. This one's quite depressing (points to a tattoo of an eye on her inner forearm). This is a crying eye for all the sadness and poo that I've been through already at the age of 18. And trust me, it's been crazy—like learning the strange things about life, when people pass away. You have to adapt to things that you've never been through before. And then having the kind of life where you can do anything you want, 'cause you're just the average Joe, to being pushed in front of a bunch of cameras. I haven't adapted to it yet, and I never will. And I don't want to adapt to it, either. [Laughs] I'm like, "Yeah, whatever!"|Lloyd talking about one of her tattoos<ref name=Influences1/> }}
