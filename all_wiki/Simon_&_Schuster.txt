==History==
===Early years===
In 1924, [[Richard L. Simon|Richard Simon]]'s aunt, a [[crossword puzzle]] enthusiast, asked whether there was a book of ''[[New York World]]'' crossword puzzles, which were very popular at the time. After discovering that none had been published, Simon and [[M. Lincoln Schuster|Max Schuster]] decided to launch a company to exploit the opportunity.<ref name=allen>Frederick Lewis Allen, ''Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s'', p. 165. {{ISBN|0-06-095665-8}}.</ref> At the time, Simon was a piano salesman and Schuster was editor of an automotive trade magazine.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Supreme City: How Jazz Age Manhattan Gave Birth to Modern America.|last=Miller|first=Donald L.|publisher=Simon & Scuster|year=2014|isbn=9781416550198|location=|pages=}}</ref> They pooled {{USD|8,000}}, equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|8000|1924|r=-3}}}} today,{{Inflation-fn|US}} to start a company that published crossword puzzles.<ref name=Another>{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life: a memoir of other people|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord|url-access=registration|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st}}</ref><ref name="allen" />

The new publishing house used "fad" publishing to publish books that exploited current fads and trends. Simon called this "planned publishing".<ref name=":3" /> Instead of signing authors with a planned manuscript, they came up with their own ideas, and then hired writers to carry them out.<ref name=":3" />

In the 1930s, the publisher moved to what has been referred to as "Publisher's Row" on Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York.<ref name=":3" />

===Expansion===
In 1939, Simon & Schuster financially backed Robert Fair de Graff to found [[Pocket Books]], America's first paperback publisher.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/obituaries/robert-f-de-graff-dies-at-86-was-pocket-books-founder.html|title=ROBERT F.

In 1944, [[Marshall Field III]], owner of the ''Chicago Sun'', purchased Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UiYPjevXzsC&q=In+1944%2C+Marshall+Field+III%2C+owner+of+the+Chicago+Sun%2C+purchased+Simon+&pg=PT47|title=The Fortune Builders: Chicago's Famous Families|last=Darby|first=Edwin|date=November 6, 2011|publisher=Garrett County Press|isbn=9781891053177|language=en}}</ref> The company was sold back to Simon and Schuster following his death for $1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/simon-schuster-inc-history/|title=History of Simon & Schuster Inc|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=September 1, 2020}}</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s, many publishers including Simon & Schuster turned toward educational publishing due to the [[baby boom]] market.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/06/publishers-hope-wider-market-will-mean-better-profit-margins.html|title=Publishers Hope Wider Market Will Mean Better Profit Margins|last=Gilroy|first=Harry|date=January 6, 1964|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|quote="There is no doubt that expansion is coming.

===1980s===

After the 1983 death of [[Charles Bluhdorn]], head of [[Gulf+Western]] who acquired Simon & Schuster in 1976,<ref name="Another" /> the company made the decision to diversify. Bluhdorn's successor Martin Davis told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Society was undergoing dramatic changes so that there was a greater need for textbooks, maps, and educational information. We saw the opportunity to diversify into those areas, which are more stable and more profitable than trade publishing."<ref name=":1" />

In 1984, Simon & Schuster with CEO [[Richard E. Snyder]] acquired educational publisher Esquire Corporation, owner of companies including [[Allyn & Bacon]] (and former owner of [[Esquire (magazine)|the magazine]]), for $180&nbsp;million.<ref name=":1" /> [[Prentice Hall]] was brought into the company fold in 1985 for over $700&nbsp;million and was viewed by some executives to be a catalyst for change for the company as a whole.<ref name="Another" /><ref name=":1" /> This acquisition was followed by Silver Burdett in 1986,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/30/business/profits-dick-snyder-s-ugly-word.html|title=Profits – Dick Snyder's Ugly Word|last=Cohen|first=Roger|date=June 30, 1991|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref> mapmaker [[Gousha]] in 1987 and Charles E. Simon in 1988.<ref name=":0" /> Part of the acquisition included educational publisher Allyn & Bacon which, according to then editor and chief [[Michael Korda]], became the "nucleus of S&S's educational and informational business."<ref name="Another" /> Three California educational companies were also purchased between 1988 and 1990—Quercus, Fearon Education and Janus Book Publishers.<ref name=":1" /> In all, Simon & Schuster spent more than $1&nbsp;billion in acquisitions between 1983 and 1991.<ref name=":0" /> 

In the 1980s, Snyder also made an unsuccessful bid toward video publishing which was believed to have led to the company's success in the audiobook business. Snyder was dismayed to realize that Simon & Schuster did not own the video rights to ''[[Jane Fonda's Workout Book]]'', a huge bestseller at the time and that the video company producing the VHS was making more money on the video. This prompted Snyder to ask editors to obtain video rights for every new book. Agents were often reluctant to give these up—which meant the S&S Video division never took off. According to Korda, the audio rights expanded into the audio division which by the 1990s would be a major business for Simon & Schuster.<ref name="Another" />

In 1989, Gulf and Western Inc., owner of Simon & Schuster, changed its name to Paramount Communications Inc.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/business/gulf-and-western-switch.html|title=Gulf and Western Switch|access-date=September 12, 2018}}</ref>

In addition, the group would also serve as a platform and set of services for authors that go beyond what a traditional book publisher offers to find their audience.<ref name=":10" /> The services include helping authors expand their reach through online courses, seminars, workshops, mobile applications, video and audiobooks, sponsorships and business partnerships, and podcasts. North Star Way sits within the [[Gallery Publishing Group]] division.<ref name=":10" /> According to Michele Martin, publisher and founder, the name North Star reflects their mission, "to publish books that will help readers find the path to a better life, and to be a guide for our authors, not only through publication of their books but also in the many other activities that can help their message find the widest possible audience."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/ss-launches-audience-building-unit-authors-us|title=S&S launches audience-building unit for authors in US {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', Michele Martin expanded that North Star Way, "aims to meet consumers where they are, in whatever form of media they consume. We expand the ideas in the books into a variety of platforms."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/michele-martin-north-star/|title=Q&A: MICHELE MARTIN OF NORTH STAR WAY/SIMON & SCHUSTER|newspaper=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> The name prompted [[Marvel Comics]] to attempt to register the name of their superhero [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] in February 2015. The application was denied as Simon & Schuster had already made a trademark application for North Star Way in January.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/05/trademark-office-suspends-marvels-registration-of-northstar/|title=Trademark Office Suspends Marvel's Registration Of 'Northstar'|date=August 5, 2015|website=Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref>

Simon & Schuster launched SimonSays.com a portal for online video courses in 2016, along with Scout Press, a new literary fiction imprint under Gallery Books Group. They also launched North Star Way, a platform-based program to provide authors with services beyond publishing including brand management, online courses, sponsorship, and business partnerships.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/71336-global-publishing-leaders-2016-simon-schuster.html|title=Global Publishing Leaders 2016: Simon & Schuster|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|access-date=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Also as of 2016, Simon & Schuster had more than 18k e-books available for sale and signed a deal to distribute Start Publishing LLC, a catalog of 7,000 e-book titles.<ref name=":5" />

In 2019, CBS and Viacom reunited to form [[ViacomCBS]].

In September 2020, German media group [[Bertelsmann]] (which owns [[Penguin Random House]]) announced that they were interested in acquiring Simon & Schuster. According to Bertelsmann chief executive and chairman [[Thomas Rabe (manager) |Thomas Rabe]], "We've been the most active player on the consolidation of the book publishing market in the last 10 years. We combined [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] and [[Random House]] very successfully to create by far the largest book publisher in the world, actually the only global book publisher. Given this position we would, of course, be interested in Simon & Schuster."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/21ab70c7-4a12-44ff-acaa-acf87ea6edaf|title= Bertelsmann joins race to acquire Simon & Schuster |work=[[Financial Times]]|last1=Barker|first1=Alex|last2=Solomon|first2=Erika|date=September 1, 2020|accessdate=September 1, 2020}}</ref>
