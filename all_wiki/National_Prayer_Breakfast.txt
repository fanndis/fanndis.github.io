The '''National Prayer Breakfast''' is a yearly event held in [[Washington, D.C.]], usually on the first Thursday in February. The founder of this event was [[Abraham Vereide]].<ref name= "latimes">{{Citation |first = Lisa |last = Getter |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/27/nation/na-prayer27 |title = Showing Faith in Discretion |newspaper = Los Angeles Times |date = September 27, 2002 }}.</ref> The event—which is actually a series of meetings, luncheons, and dinners—has taken place since 1953 and has been held at least since the 1980s at the [[Washington Hilton]] on Connecticut Avenue NW.

The National Prayer Breakfast, held in the Hilton's International Ballroom, is yearly attended by some 3,500 guests, including international invitees from over 100 countries. It is hosted by members of the [[United States Congress]] and is organized on their behalf by [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|The Fellowship Foundation]], a Christian organization. It is designed to be a forum for the political, social, and business elite to assemble and [[prayer|pray]] together. Since the inception of the National Prayer Breakfast, several U.S. states and cities and other countries have established their own annual prayer breakfast events.

== History ==
The origin of the National Prayer Breakfast is traced back to prayer groups with business and civic leaders in [[Seattle]], organized by [[Abraham Vereide]] in the 1930s. When he moved to Washington, DC, he established similar groups with members of Congress. In 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended a meeting by invitation of Congressmen, Vereide, and [[Billy Graham]]. Vereide's successor [[Douglas Coe]] and Rev. [[Richard C. Halverson]] have also carried leadership roles in organizing the event. A government leader was quoted as saying that the Breakfast and Coe's influence offers foreign leaders access to the President that "circumvents the [[State Department]] and usual vetting... that such a meeting would require," and other participants indicated that their purpose for attending was political.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=D.

Initially called the Presidential Prayer Breakfast, the name was changed in 1970 to the National Prayer Breakfast. Every American president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] has participated in the annual event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/todd-j-gillman/20130209-todd-j.-gillman-tylers-louie-gohmert-puts-obama-criticism-on-pause-at-national-prayer-breakfast.ece| title=Tyler's Louie Gohmert puts Obama criticism on pause at National Prayer Breakfast |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |author=Todd J.

Many of the past addresses by U.S. Presidents to the National Prayer Breakfast are available online.

==Guests==
While Members of the [[U.S. Congress]], of the [[Cabinet of the United States|U.S. Cabinet]], and of the diplomatic corps in Washington are typically invited to participate in the National Prayer Breakfast, the other more than 3,000 guests come from a variety of walks of life. Six heads of state attended the 2008 breakfast, along with Members of the [[European Parliament]]; United Nations diplomats; European, Asian, African and Latin American politicians; religious leaders; missionaries working in various countries; U.S. and foreign business leaders; and students. [[Benazir Bhutto]], former prime minister of [[Pakistan]], participated on more than one occasion, and a video interview of her speaking about the National Prayer Breakfast, its meaning and its impact on her faith, was featured at the 2008 closing dinner. In 2006, King [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] addressed the Thursday lunch. [[Ricardo Maduro]], president of Honduras, addressed the same lunch in 2005. Musical guests have included [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Wintley Phipps]], [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Point of Grace]], and [[CeCe Winans]]. In 2014, for the first time since Ukraine's Independence, The Patriarch of The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], Patriarch [[Filaret (Denysenko)|Philaret]] was present.  In 2015, the [[Dalai Lama]] addressed the International Lunch, one of the annual National Prayer Breakfast-related events.

==Reaction==
Rev. [[Jim Wallis]], founder and president of the Christian social change group [[Sojourners]] and a regular attendee of the National Prayer Breakfast, said of the event "it's sort of a time to — where people want to acknowledge the importance of prayer and faith.  And that can be kind of a civil religion, civic faith kind of common denominator thing. Or it can be much too sectarian where some people feel left out of it. I remember my favorite ones are when Bono spoke at the prayer breakfast and talked about every faith tradition calls us to stand with those who are left out, left behind. I remember Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] spoke years ago when I was in seminary and he called the war in Vietnam a national sin and shame in front of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Kissinger]].  I saw their faces and they weren't happy with that. So when it can raise up issues that we ought to be accountable to, whether we are religious or not, I think that's when it's probably at its best."<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/2011/02/04/133497426/President-Obama-Gets-Personal-At-National-Prayer-Breakfast |title = President Gets Personal at National Prayer Breakfast|publisher=NPR|date=February 4, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] asked President [[Barack Obama]] and Congressional leaders to refrain from attending the National Prayer Breakfast. Executive Director [[Melanie Sloan]] criticized the organizing group, [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|The Fellowship]], for being what she described as intolerant and secretive.<ref name="nytimes_20100204">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/us/politics/04prayer.html |title= National prayer breakfast draws controversy | accessdate= 2012-02-22 | last = Goodstein | first = Laurie |date=2010-02-04 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

On Thursday, February 6, 2020, President [[Donald Trump|Donald J. Trump]] addressed the gathering, including these statements encouraging freedom of religion and appreciation for those attending, citing their bravery, brilliance, and fortitude: "But I’ll tell you what we are doing: We’re restoring hope and spreading faith.  We’re helping citizens of every background take part in the great rebuilding of our nation.  We’re declaring that America will always shine as a land of liberty and light unto all nations of the world.  We want every nation to look up to us like they are right now." <ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-68th-annual-national-prayer-breakfast/</ref>

Also in 2020, the event marked the highest level state visit by a [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]] official since 1979 when Vice-President William Lai Ching-te attended the National Prayer Breakfast.<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/3d08a0d8-4623-11ea-aee2-9ddbdc86190d</ref>
