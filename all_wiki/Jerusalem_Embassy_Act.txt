The '''Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995'''<ref>Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USPL|104|45}}, November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398.</ref> is a public law of the [[United States]] passed by the post-[[Republican Revolution]] [[104th United States Congress|104th Congress]] on October 23, 1995. The proposed law was adopted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] (93–5),<ref>On the passage of {{USBill |104|S.|1322}}, the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USSRollCall |104|1|496}}</ref> and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] (374–37).<ref>On the passage of {{USBill |104|S.|1322}}, the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USHRollCall|1995|734}}</ref> The Act became law without a presidential signature on November 8, 1995.

The Act recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel and called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city. Its purpose was to set aside funds for the relocation of the [[Embassy of the United States, Jerusalem|Embassy of the United States in Israel]] from [[Tel Aviv Branch Office of the Embassy of the United States|its location]] in [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]], by May 31, 1999. For this purpose it withheld 50% of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for "Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad" as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened.<ref name= "BergGamb">{{cite journal |first1=Marshall J. |last1=Breger |title=Jerusalem Gambit: How We Should Treat Jerusalem Is a Matter of U.S. Constitutional Law as Well as Middle Eastern Politics |journal=National Review |date=October 23, 1995 |volume=47 |issue=20 |pages=41–4}}</ref>

Despite passage, the law allowed the President to invoke a six-month waiver of the application of the law, and reissue the waiver every six months on "national security" grounds. The waiver was repeatedly  renewed by Presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[George W.

{{Jerusalem large}}
{{main|Positions on Jerusalem#United States|l1=United States positions on Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem holds unique spiritual and religious interests, such as [[Holy Places]] and religious buildings or sites, among the world's [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Following World War I, the victorious Principal Allied Powers recognized these as "a sacred trust of civilization", and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with them should be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.<ref>{{citation | at = Article 28 | title = League of Nations Mandate for Palestine | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp#art28}}.</ref><ref>{{citation | publisher = ICJ | title = Reports | year = 2004 | contribution = Construction of a wall (advisory opinion) | pages = 165 para. 70, 188 para. 129}}</ref><ref>{{citation | first = Paul JIM | last = de Waart | quote = The Court ascertained the legal significance of the 'sacred trust of civilization' of the League of Nations (LoN) in respect of the 1922 Palestine Mandate as the origin of the present responsibility of the United Nations | title = International Court of Justice Firmly Walled in the Law of Power in the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process | journal = Leiden Journal of International Law | volume = 18 |issue=3 | year = 2005 | pages = 467–87 |doi=10.1017/S0922156505002839}}.</ref> The terms of the British [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] were included in the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate for Palestine]] by the [[League of Nations]].

These competing nationalist claims led to increasing civil violence during the inter-war period; following World War II, the "Question of Palestine" was placed before the [[United Nations]], as the League's successor agency.

On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]; it contained a recommendation that Jerusalem be placed under a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|special international regime, a corpus separatum, administered by the United Nations and be separate from both the Jewish and Arab states envisioned]]. Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|conflict that ensued]], cease-fires and the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] were negotiated and accepted by both sides. One of these resulted, in part, in a temporary division of Jerusalem. The relevant Armistice Agreement with Jordan was signed on April 3, 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arm03.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Jordanian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement, April 3, 1949|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> but it was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalization of Jerusalem.<ref name="Corpus Separatum">See "Corpus Separatum §33 Jerusalem" Marjorie M.

On December 5, 1949 the Israeli Cabinet, meeting in [[Tel Aviv]], declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and on January 23, 1950, the [[First Knesset]] proclaimed that "Jerusalem was, and had always been, the capital of Israel."<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century'' (New York, 1996), pp. 243-244.</ref> Moreover, on April 24, 1950, the Jordan House of Deputies and House of Notables, in a joint session, adopted a resolution annexing the West Bank and Jerusalem.

The United States has stated that its policy on Jerusalem refers specifically to the geographic boundaries of the area that were set out for the "City of Jerusalem", or Corpus Separatum, in Resolution 181, but since 1950, US diplomats have traveled regularly to Jerusalem from the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to conduct business with Israeli officials.<ref>Gilbert, p. 253.</ref> The United States has also stated that Jerusalem was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a de jure sense, has not since become part of any other sovereignty.<ref>Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961-1963: Near East, 1962-1963, V.

==Details==
The Act asserted that every country has a right to designate the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of its choice, and that Israel has designated Jerusalem. The act notes that "the city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government ministries and social and cultural institutions." Jerusalem is defined as the spiritual center of [[Judaism]]. Furthermore, it stipulates that since the [[reunification of Jerusalem]] in 1967, religious freedom has been guaranteed to all.

S.3(a)(2) and (3) also stated that ''"[[Jerusalem]] should be recognized as the capital of the State of [[Israel]]; and the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999"''.

Although the Senate and House votes preceded visits by then Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Jerusalem Mayor [[Ehud Olmert]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to celebrate the 3000th anniversary of [[King David]]'s declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jews,<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/2261/edition_id/37/format/html/displaystory.html | title = Jewish SF}}.</ref> little to no progress was achieved in the physical relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem until December 2017.

===Timetable===
Section 3 of the Act outlined the U.S. policy and set the initial parameters for the Secretary of State to report in order to receive the full funding — again, with a May 1999 target deadline for the appropriations. The section also briefly stated U.S. policy concerning the matter.

{{quote|
{{sm|Sec. 3. Timetable}}.
: (a) {{sm|Statement of the Policy of the United States}}.—
::: (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected.
::: (2) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel; and
::: (3) the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.
: (b) {{sm|Opening Determination}}.—
:: Not more than 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for "Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad" may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy In Jerusalem has officially opened.}}

The major roadblock has been the question of what effect, if any, the relocation may symbolize for other interested parties or neighboring nations involved in the ongoing and sometimes quite contentious Mid-East diplomacy and foreign relations. For this reason, since the legislation's introduction, the consensus has been that this action poses considerable risk to United States national security at home and abroad.

===Constitutional separation of powers===
Under the Constitution of the United States the President has exclusive authority to recognize foreign sovereignty over territory.<ref>See Restatement (3rd) Foreign Relations Law of the United States, American Law Institute, 1986, §§ 203 Recognition or Acceptance of Governments and §§ 204 Recognition and Maintaining Diplomatic Relations Law of the United States.</ref> The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the Embassy Relocation Act "invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/olc/s770.16.htm |title=Bill to Relocate United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem: Memorandum Opinion for the Counsel to the President |publisher=United States Department of Justice |date=May 16, 1995 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209074518/http://www.justice.gov/olc/s770.16.htm |archive-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

Former U.S. presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] have alluded to or explicitly stated the belief that Congressional resolutions attempting to legislate foreign policy infringe upon the Executive's authority and responsibility to carry out sound and effective U.S. foreign relations.

Regarding the status of Jerusalem specifically, President Bush had deemed Congress' role as merely "advisory", stating that it "impermissibly interferes with the President's constitutional authority".<ref>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/print/20020930-8.html Signing Statement by the President on H.R. 1646], the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY 2003, September 30, 2002, [[NARA]] Archives.</ref> The [[U.S. Constitution]] reserves the conduct of foreign policy to the President; resolutions of Congress, such as the ones found in the Authorization Act of 2003 that included the Jerusalem Embassy Act's provisions, makes the arguments in favor of legislating foreign policy from Congress extremely problematic if not arguably invalid for that Constitutional reason.

Even from the Embassy Act's legislative beginnings, the question of Congress' over-reach, and whether it somehow usurped the Executive's authority or power over matters of foreign affairs, had played a subtle role in shaping the debate at the time. President Clinton took the unusual step of not signing the Embassy Act into law once Congress presented it to him, but instead, to show his disapproval, let 10 days of inaction pass, allowing the bill to return to Congress and automatically become law by Constitutional "default". Clinton's non-action reinforced this sticking point between the branches of the Federal government, without the potential public fallout from taking a "negative stand" on what appeared to be favorable, veto-proof legislation on the surface at the time.<ref>[http://clinton6.nara.gov/1995/10/1995-10-24-press-briefing-by-mike-mccurry.html Press Secretary Briefing, October 24, 1995], White House, National Archives and Records Administration.</ref><ref>[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html#1.7 Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution of the United States].</ref><ref>Congressional Record, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:SN01322:@@@R Notes & Major Actions on the Embassy Act], S. 1322, [[104th Congress]], [[Office of the Federal Register|OFR]] [[Archivist of the United States]].</ref>

===Presidential waiver===
This constitutional question was apparent while the legislation was working its way through both chambers; Sen. Dole's amendment adopted into the introduced language included a provision that, in part, returned to the Executive Branch the power over foreign affairs that it already had.

<blockquote>
{{sm|Sec. 7. Presidential Waiver}}.
: (a) {{sm|Waiver Authority}}.—
::: (1) Beginning on October 1, 1998, the President may suspend the limitations set forth in section 3(b) for a period of six months if he determines and reports to Congress in advance that such suspension is necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States.
::: (2) The President may suspend such limitations for an additional six-month period at the end of any period during which the suspension is in effect under this subsections if the President determines and reports to Congress in advance of the additional suspension that the additional suspension is necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States.
::: (3) A report under paragraph (1) or (2) shall include—
::::: (A) a statement of the interests affected by the limitation that the President seeks to suspend; and
::::: (B) a discussion of the manner in which the limitation affects the interests.
: (b) {{sm|Applicability of Waiver to Availability of Funds}}.—
:: If the President exercises the authority set forth in subsection (a) in a fiscal year for the purpose set forth in such section 3(b) except to the extent that the limitation is suspended in such following fiscal year by reason of the exercise of the authority in subsection (a).
</blockquote>

Every six months from 1998 to 2018, every president invoked the waiver provision under section 7 of the Act, based on national security grounds, to defer the relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv. The last waiver was signed by President Trump on December 7, 2018.<ref>https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-27/pdf/2018-28364.pdf</ref>

Since this provision went into effect in late 1998, all the presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. However, a re-assessment has to take place every six months. In response, members of Congress have begun to include language to do away with the President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-2737&version=is&nid=t0%3Ais%3A31 |title=Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 2009 |access-date=December 7, 2009 |author=111th Congress (2009) |date=November 5, 2009 |work=S. 2737 |publisher=GovTrack.us }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-3412&version=ih&nid=t0%3Aih%3A23 |title=Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2009 |access-date=December 7, 2009 |author=111th Congress (2009) |date=July 30, 2009 |work=H.R. 3412 |publisher=GovTrack.us }}</ref>

==Developments==
Noteworthy developments since the passage of the Act and well past the initial May 31, 1999 deadline's expiration:

* Of the 22 Presidential Determinations to suspend the limitations that were issued between 1998 and the fall of 2009, only the Bush era issuances included the wording:

{{quote|[The current] Administration remains committed to beginning the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem;<ref name = "PresDet">[[s:Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995#Legislative History|Compiled List of Presidential Determinations]], Addendum to Public Law 104–45, Office of the Federal Register (FR pp compilation)</ref>}}

: ... while President Obama's issuances mirror the wording first used by President Clinton.

* Section 214 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY 2003 states:

{{quote|The Congress maintains its commitment to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and urges the President ... to immediately begin the process of relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h107-1646&version=enr&nid=t0:enr:449

:The U.S. Congress, however, has the "[[power of the purse]]", and could prohibit the expenditure of funds on any embassy located outside Jerusalem. The U.S. Congress has not managed to repeat the incorporation or passage of language similar to that in Section 214, needed for any attempt to force a foreign policy change by withholding funding.<ref name = "BergPurse">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jerusalem%20gambit:%20how%20we%20should%20treat%20Jerusalem%20is%20a%20matter%20of%20U.S....-a017443652

|quote=But in the end, using the spending power to curtail the President's Article II authority won't work. Congress cannot use the power of the purse to seize a power textually committed to the Executive alone. While Congress can probably appropriate money for the construction of a building in West Jerusalem (and create a financial penalty if no construction takes place) it cannot use the "spending power" to order the Executive either in 1996 or 1999 to make that building an embassy rather than a consulate or cultural center. Nor can it order the President to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.}}

* Claims have arisen that as a result of the Embassy Act, official U.S. documents and web sites refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, although this has been the case in many instances before the Act became law. The [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] has carried the typical Federal citation concerning Israel's capital and the absence of the usual concentration of foreign embassies being within its boundaries or proximity.<ref>{{citation | chapter-url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html |chapter= Israel → Government → Capital | publisher = Central Ingelligence Agency | place = USA | year = 2011 |title= World FactBook}}.</ref>
* A potential site for a future US Embassy office building in Jerusalem has been demarcated by Israel and the US, and is maintained in the neighborhood of [[Talpiot]]. Currently, the United States has three diplomatic office facilities in Jerusalem: [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|a consulate on Agron Road in West Jerusalem]], a consular annex on [[Nablus Road]] in East Jerusalem, and a new office annex in the neighborhood of [[Arnona]], located in an area of "[[no man's land]]" between East and West Jerusalem, which opened in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/21990/Default.aspx|title=New US consulate to open in Jerusalem, but where's the embassy?|website=Israeltoday.co.il|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2011 a new bill, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2011 ([[United States House of Representatives|H.R.]] [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1006 1006]), was introduced.

President [[Donald Trump]] signed the embassy waiver on June 1, 2017. The [[White House]] meanwhile stated that it did not represent a weakening of his support for Israel. It added that he stood by his promise of moving the embassy.<ref name=signswaiver/> On June 5, 2017, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of reunification of Jerusalem by 90–0. The resolution reaffirmed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and called upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions.<ref name="timesofisrael.com"/>

On December 6, 2017, President Trump officially [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and ordered the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to begin planning for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.<ref name="auto"/> However, following the announcement, Trump signed an embassy waiver again, delaying the funding cuts as mandated by the Act, by at least six months.<ref name=FR61127/><ref name="toi">{{cite news|title=After Jerusalem recognition, Trump signs waiver delaying embassy move|date=December 7, 2017|author=Staff|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=December 18, 2017|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-jerusalem-recognition-trump-signs-waiver-delaying-embassy-move/}}</ref> [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] stated that the relocation process will begin immediately, but that the relocation itself however could take years to complete.<ref name="toi"/>  Legally, however, the U.S. embassy can be moved at any time outside of the scope of the Act.

On February 23, 2018, Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen at the [[Arnona]] consular services site of the current US Consulate-General in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]].<ref name="State Department Feb 2018" /><ref name="TIME 23 Feb 2018" /> This announcement was welcomed by the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and other Israeli government officials.<ref name="JPost 23 Feb 2018">{{cite news|last1=Hacohen|first1=Hagay|title=Israeli leaders embrace US decision to open Embassy in Jerusalem in May|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-leaders-embrace-US-decision-to-open-embassy-in-Jerusalem-in-May-14-543474|access-date=February 26, 2018|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the announcement was condemned by Palestinian officials, including [[Hanan Ashrawi]] and chief negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]], as the Embassy's reopening will also coincide with the 70th anniversary of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|"Nakba"]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tarnopolsky|first1=Noga|title=Date of U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem shows how even the calendar is complicated in the Middle East|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-israel-independence-day-20180224-story.html|access-date=February 26, 2018|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>

However, despite the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, President Trump signed on June 4, 2018 an executive order postponing the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, although it had already physically moved to that city. He was required to sign the order since the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires the US Ambassador to have a permanent residence in Jerusalem, a condition already fulfilled as of May 8, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Trump again signs embassy waiver despite move to Jerusalem |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/politics/trump-us-embassy-jerusalem/index.html |access-date=October 21, 2018 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 5, 2018}}</ref>

On October 18, 2018, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] announced that the US Embassy and Consulate-General in Jerusalem would be merged into a single diplomatic mission.<ref name="State Department Oct 2018">{{cite web |last1=Pompeo |first1=Mike |title=On the Merging of U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem |url=https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/ |publisher=U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem |access-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211211903/https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/|archive-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In early March 2019, the Consulate-General was formally merged into the US Embassy in Jerusalem; ending the US practice of accrediting separate diplomatic missions to the Israelis and Palestinians.

===Public opinion===
A poll, taken in November 2017, by the [[Brookings Institution]] found that, of a national sample of 2,000 adults, 63% of Americans polled opposed the move of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while 31% supported it.<ref name=BrookingsInst>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-middle-east-and-russia-american-attitudes-on-trumps-foreign-policy/|title=The Middle East and Russia: American attitudes on Trump's foreign policy|author=Shibley Telhami|date=December 1, 2017|access-date=January 22, 2017|agency=[[Brookings Institution]]}}</ref> Among Democrats, 81% opposed the move and 15% were in support, while among Republicans, 44% opposed the move and 49% supported it.<ref name=BrookingsInst/>

In the 2017 AJC Survey of American Jewish Opinion, done in September 2017, it was found that 16% of American Jews polled supported an immediate move of the embassy to Jerusalem, 36% wanted to move the embassy at a later date in conjunction with Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, 44% opposed moving the embassy, and 4% said they weren't sure.<ref name=AJCSurvey>{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.org/survey2017|title=AJC Survey of American Jewish Opinion 2017|agency=AJC|date=September 13, 2017|access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>
