The '''Société de Chimie Industrielle (American Section)''' is an independent [[learned society]] inspired by the creation of the Société de Chimie Industrielle in Paris in 1917. The American Section was formed on January 18, 1918, and held its first meeting on  April 4, 1918.

The Société de Chimie Industrielle (American Section) hosts speakers, grants scholarships, and gives awards.  It has given the [[International Palladium Medal]]   roughly every second year since 1961, and helps to award the [[Othmer Gold Medal]] and the [[Winthrop-Sears Medal]] every year. The Société also hosts monthly talks, and presents scholarships to writers, educators, and historians of science.

==History==
One of the first societies for chemists was the [[Society of Chemical Industry]], founded in London in 1881. This inspired a number of other groups, including the Société de Chimie Industrielle in Paris, France.  The French Société was modeled on the British organization in 1917.<ref name="Fauque">{{cite journal|last1=Fauque|first1=Danielle M.

vice-presidents [[Albin Haller]] and [[Henry Louis Le Châtelier]], and 
[[Jean Gérard]]  as general secretary.<ref name="Nature">{{cite journal|title=A French society of chemical industry|journal=Nature|date=April 11, 1918|volume=2528|number=101|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEs-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA116|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>

Creation of the French Société in turn inspired creation of a related American  association in New York in 1918. This was part of an effort to rebuild international connections between individuals and institutions that had been disrupted during the [[First World War]].<ref name="Fauque"/><ref name="Schroeder-Gudehus">{{cite book|last1=Schroeder-Gudehus|first1=Brigitte|title=Les scientifiques et la paix : la communauté scientifique internationale au cours des années 20|date=2014|publisher=Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal|location=Montreal, Quebec|isbn=9782760633643}}</ref>
[[René Laurent Engel]] encouraged the re-establishment of ties between chemists in the two countries in his position as the scientific representative in a French Mission to the United States.<ref name="St. Amand">{{cite news|last1=St. Amand|first1=Pierre|title=Memorial to René Laurent Engel 1887-1980|url=ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v15/Engel-RL.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=The Geological Society of America|date=1980}}</ref>
[[Victor Grignard]] of the [[Nancy-Université|University of Nancy]] also encouraged the creation of an American organization. A circular appealed to the Chemists and Manufacturers of America to "extend to our French fellow chemists and manufacturers our moral and financial support and the right hand of good fellowship."<ref name="Proposal">{{cite journal|title=Société de Chimie Industrielle|journal=Metallurgical & Chemical Engineering|date=October 15, 1917|volume=17|issue=8|page=454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJ4qAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA454|accessdate=23 June 2016|last1=Roeber|first1=Eugene Franz|last2=Parmelee|first2=Howard Coon}}</ref>

The American section of the Société de Chimie Industrielle was formed on January 18, 1918, following the presentation of the [[Perkin Medal]] by the [[Society of Chemical Industry (American Section)]] at [[The Chemists' Club]] in New York.  Engel, as secretary of the parent organization, addressed the meeting.  Officers of the newly created American section of the Société de Chimie Industrielle included [[Leo Baekeland]] as president, [[Jerome Alexander]] as vice-president, [[Charles Avery Doremus]] as secretary, and [[George Frederick Kunz]] as treasurer.<ref name="Established">{{cite journal|title=New York Section|journal=The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry|date=1918|volume=10|issue=2|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlpGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA154|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="Perfumer">{{cite journal|title=Trade Notes|journal=The American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review|date=1918|volume=12|issue=12|page=363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvY1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA363|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> A report describes the Société's purpose as follows:

{{quote|The outstanding objects of the new society are to aid the development of all branches of chemical industry, to co-ordinate the labours of all workers in pure and applied chemistry for their mutual advantage, and to assist the progress of industrial chemistry not only by means of science, but also from the economic and commercial points of view.<ref name="Nature"/>}}

The first official meeting of the American section of the Société de Chimie Industrielle was held on April 4, 1918 at The Chemists' Club in New York.  [[William H. Nichols]], president of the [[American Chemical Society]], welcomed the new organization.  Frederick J. LeMaistre reported on "Conditions in the French chemical industries during 1916".<ref name="First">{{cite journal|title=Société de Chimie Industrielle|journal=The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry|date=1918|volume=10|issue=6|pages=421–423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlpGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA421|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>
