====Political recognition====
According to former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], those MPs first elected in 2010 "are the best new MPs for over thirty years", and he identified Javid as one of six Conservative MPs that he believed had "already made an impact in the first term".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article2665792.ece|title=These are the best new MPs for over 30 years|work=The Times|access-date=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015224902/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article2665792.ece|archive-date=15 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Javid was also one of six new MPs profiled by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and was named as the Newcomer of 2010 by the [[ConservativeHome]] blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93221fb6-a638-11df-8767-00144feabdc0.html|title=New MPs set out with confidence|work=Financial Times|access-date=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608062732/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93221fb6-a638-11df-8767-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date=8 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/12/newcomer-of-2010.html|title=Newcomer of 2010|work=Conservative Home|access-date=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209123224/http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2010/12/newcomer-of-2010.html|archive-date=9 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Campaign against anti-Semitism====

His appointment as Home Secretary was welcomed by a number of Jewish organisations, including the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] and the [[Jewish Leadership Council]].<ref name=javidjewish>{{cite news|date=30 April 2018|title=Community ally Sajid Javid replaces Amber Rudd as Home Secretary|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/community-ally-sajid-javid-replaces-amber-rudd-as-home-secretary/|newspaper=The Jewish News|access-date=17 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818021122/https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/community-ally-sajid-javid-replaces-amber-rudd-as-home-secretary/|archive-date=18 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2018, Javid suggested [[Jeremy Corbyn]] should quit as Labour leader following his decision to attend a 2014 wreath-laying at a cemetery which contained the graves of many Palestinian activists; including [[Salah Khalaf]] and [[Atef Bseiso]], members of the [[Black September Organization]].<ref name=javidcorbyn>{{cite web|date=12 August 2018|title=Sajid Javid calls for Corbyn to quit over Munich wreath-laying|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/sajid-javid-calls-for-corbyn-to-quit-over-munich-wreath-laying/|newspaper=[[Jewish News]]|access-date=3 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014725/https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/sajid-javid-calls-for-corbyn-to-quit-over-munich-wreath-laying/|archive-date=4 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Criticism====
In March 2018, Javid called [[Momentum (organisation)|Momentum]] "neo-fascist" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] chamber. Momentum threatened legal action if he repeated the comment outside [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] where [[parliamentary privilege]] does not protect him against a lawsuit. MPs including [[John Mann, Baron Mann|John Mann]], [[Jon Trickett]], [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]], [[Alex Sobel]], [[Clive Lewis (politician)|Clive Lewis]] and [[Caroline Lucas]] demanded Javid withdraw the statement and apologise.<ref name="independent">{{cite news|last=Kentish|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sajid-javid-momentum-neo-facist-labour-party-antisemitisim-jewish-a8280601.html|title=Sajid Javid threatened with legal action after calling Momentum 'neo-fascist'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=29 March 2018|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004210/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sajid-javid-momentum-neo-facist-labour-party-antisemitisim-jewish-a8280601.html|archive-date=1 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2018, Javid back-tracked after [[Jeremy Corbyn]] had threatened legal action for linking Corbyn with [[Holocaust denial]]. Labour MPs accused Javid of "peddling a lie" and called on [[Theresa May]] to intervene.<ref>{{cite news|last=Merrick|first=Rob|date=21 May 2018|title=Sajid javid backtracks on Jeremy Corbyn 'Holocaust denier' tweet following backlash|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sajid-javid-jeremy-corbyn-holocaust-denier-twitter-backlash-a8457706.html|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=22 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721135333/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sajid-javid-jeremy-corbyn-holocaust-denier-twitter-backlash-a8457706.html|archive-date=21 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Warsi]] has criticised Javid for [[Dog-whistle politics|dog-whistling]]: "he should read what these people are saying, because however much he dog-whistles, however much he panders to the right of our party, sadly the right of our party still believe he's far too Muslim to be leader of the party".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Albert|title=Baroness Warsi warns Sajid Javid the right wing of Tory Party think 'he's far too Muslim to be the leader' |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/sajid-javid-baroness-warsi-tory-party-leader-right-wing-muslim-islamophobia/|access-date=8 March 2019|work=iNews|date=6 March 2019}}</ref>

In August 2019, [[John McDonnell]] questioned Javid's suitability for the office of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], citing his background in sales of [[Collateralized debt obligation|collateralised debt obligations]] (CDOs) and alleged links to tax avoidance schemes. Javid held several senior executive positions in investment banking, including a role with responsibility for sale of CDOs, and during his time [[Deutsche Bank]] had operated a tax avoidance scheme known as 'dark blue' that channelled bankers' bonus payments through the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Partington|first1=Richard|title=John McDonnell questions chancellor's suitability for office'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/john-mcdonnell-questions-chancellors-suitability-for-office|access-date=5 August 2019|work=The Guardian|date=5 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805012620/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/john-mcdonnell-questions-chancellors-suitability-for-office|archive-date=5 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was at this time described as "the most robust right-winger in the cabinet", and a "true [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]]".<ref>{{Cite news|title = Conservatives: the party of business?|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70295a84-c4f4-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45.html|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 3 February 2016|access-date = 8 February 2016|first = Jim|last = Pickard|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160204192302/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70295a84-c4f4-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45.html|archive-date = 4 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

After being appointed as Business Secretary, Javid said that there would be "significant changes" to strike laws under the new Conservative government, announcing that strikes affecting essential public services will need the backing of 40% of eligible union members under new government plans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32702585|title=Sajid Javid: Significant changes to strike law|access-date=12 May 2015|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512095118/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32702585|archive-date=12 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Javid is a supporter of remaining in the [[European Union]]. He described himself as a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] with "no time for ever-closer union", but he wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "Just like Bank of England Governor [[Mark Carney]] and IMF head [[Christine Lagarde]], I still believe that Britain is better off in. And that’s all because of the [[European Single Market|Single Market]]. It’s a great invention, one that even Lady Thatcher campaigned enthusiastically to create."<ref name="telegraph_2016-05-14">{{cite news |last=Javid |first=Sajid |date=14 May 2016 |title=The only thing leaving the EU guarantees is a lost decade for British business |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/sajid-javid-the-only-thing-leaving-the-eu-guarantees-is-a-lost-d/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=26 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723200831/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/sajid-javid-the-only-thing-leaving-the-eu-guarantees-is-a-lost-d/ |archive-date=23 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In February 2017, it was revealed in court that Javid had ignored the advice of a senior civil servant in order to keep granting export licences for weapons to [[Saudi Arabia]], despite allegations of war crimes in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]]. A February 2016 email from Edward Bell, head of the Export Control Organisation, was read out as part of a judicial review into British arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The email said: "To be honest, and I was very direct and honest with [Sajid Javid], my gut tells me we should suspend [weapon exports to Saudi Arabia]". In a later email, he said: "[Sajid Javid] decided not to take a decision about this last night and the matter has now been raised with [the prime minister]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/official-advised-uk-minister-to-suspend-saudi-weapons-exports-court-hears|title=UK minister ignored official warning over Saudi weapons exports, court hears|first1=Alice|last1=Ross|first2=Rob|last2=Evans|date=7 February 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208133601/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/official-advised-uk-minister-to-suspend-saudi-weapons-exports-court-hears|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Pub tenants were denied an opportunity to use their rights for months as the statutory deadline had been broken. This unlawful delay also pushed forward the pubs code review till 2019 when the code review could have happened a year earlier in 2018, no reason has ever been supplied by the minister for breaking the Act.

In 2017, a judge ruled that Javid acted unlawfully in issuing guidance to restrict local councils from pursuing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]]) against Israel through their pension schemes. The Chair of the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] called it a "victory for Palestine, for local democracy, and for the rule of law".<ref name=javid-COUNCIL-BDS>{{cite news|last=Osborn|first=Samuel|date=22 June 2017|title=Government acted unlawfully by restricting 'ethical' boycotts of Israel, High Court rules|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-acted-unlawfully-israeli-pension-funds-investment-boycott-restrictions-high-court-a7803146.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=25 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026083016/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-acted-unlawfully-israeli-pension-funds-investment-boycott-restrictions-high-court-a7803146.html|archive-date=26 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

As Communities Secretary, Javid launched a wide-ranging programme of leasehold and commonhold reform. This began with a forthright speech at the 2017 conference for the main leasehold property managers trade body ARMA (Association of Residential Managing Agents), where Javid targeted rogue managing agents as well as the exorbitant service charges faced by many leaseholders across England and Wales. This was well received by the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leaseholdknowledge.com/sajid-javid-thought-leasehold-property-management-not-like-sees|title=Sajid Javid has thought about leasehold property management and does not like what he sees|website=leaseholdknowledge.com|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622140447/https://www.leaseholdknowledge.com/sajid-javid-thought-leasehold-property-management-not-like-sees|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2017, Javid championed innovation collaborative efforts between the UK and Commonwealth Nations by awarding the first Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship in Innovation to Joshua Cheong and Dr Khoo Hsien Hui respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/commonwealth-scholarships-award-presentation|title=Commonwealth Scholarships Award Presentation|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622140241/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/commonwealth-scholarships-award-presentation|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2018, his first speech to the Police Federation, Javid insisted "I'm listening and I get it".<ref name=javidpolicefed/> He then promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review. In his speech, Javid backed calls for [[spit hood]]s across all forces in England and Wales and leant his support to [[stop and search]] powers.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
[[File:Chancellor Javid and Gladstone.jpg|thumb|right|Chancellor Javid and [[Gladstone (cat)|Gladstone]] (right), ''Chief Mouser'' of [[HM Treasury]]]]
On 24 July 2019, Javid was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the new [[Boris Johnson]] cabinet. Upon his appointment, he tweeted that he was looking forward to working at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to prepare the United Kingdom for leaving the [[EU]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/sajid-javid-appointed-chancellor-as-boris-johnson-names-new-cabinet-a4197671.html|title=New PM Boris begins forming new government with Javid as chancellor|date=24 July 2019|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=24 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724210203/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/sajid-javid-appointed-chancellor-as-boris-johnson-names-new-cabinet-a4197671.html|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In his first media intervention after becoming Chancellor, Javid pledged in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' to overhaul the Treasury's approach to Brexit, beginning with "significant extra funding" to get Britain ready to leave with or without a deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/27/watch-treasury-ready-play-full-role-delivering-brexit/|title=On my watch, the Treasury is ready to play a full role in delivering Brexit|date=27 July 2019|website=The Sunday Telegraph|language=en|access-date=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728023753/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/27/watch-treasury-ready-play-full-role-delivering-brexit/|archive-date=28 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2019, Javid stood by Johnson's statement to suspend parliament and leave the EU. He confirmed that though Johnson would be looking for a new deal in the 17 October Council in Brussels, he would not ask for extension of [[Article 50]] and hence the UK would leave the EU come 31 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neweurope.eu/article/johnson-defies-opposition-vowing-not-to-call-for-brexit-delay/|title=Johnson defies opposition vowing not to call for Brexit delay|access-date=9 September 2019|website=New Europe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190912215848/https://www.neweurope.eu/article/johnson-defies-opposition-vowing-not-to-call-for-brexit-delay/|archive-date=12 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 26 January 2020, a [[Fifty pence (British coin)|50p coin]] to mark Brexit was unveiled by Javid, bearing the inscription 'Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations' and the new leaving date of 31 January.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51250753|title=Brexit day 50p coin unveiled by Chancellor Sajid Javid|date=26 January 2020|work=BBC News |access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref> Javid helped raise thousands of pounds at the [[Jewish Care]] business breakfast by auctioning a Brexit 50p coin, co-signed by himself and Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/sajid-javid-helps-jewish-care-raise-more-than-70000-with-50p-auction/|title=Sajid Javid helps Jewish Care raise more than £70,000 with 50p auction|date=9 February 2020|work=Jewish News |access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>

Javid intervened to ensure [[Andrew Bailey (banker)|Andrew Bailey]] was appointed as [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. Dominic Cummings had lobbied for appointment of [[Andy Haldane]] to take over from [[Mark Carney]] as Governor.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/revealed-sajid-javid-scored-victory-over-rival-dominic-cummings-when-it-came-to-appointing-new-bank-a4354451.html|title=Revealed: Sajid Javid scored victory over rival Dominic Cummings when it came to appointing new Bank of England Governor|date=5 February 2020|work=Evening Standard |access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref> Javid also endorsed [[George Osborne]] to be the British nomination for managing director of the [[IMF]], though [[Kristalina Georgieva]] was put forward as the EU's nominee.

==== Resignation as Chancellor ====
Tensions between [[10 Downing Street]] and Treasury had come to a head during August 2019, when the Prime Minister's Chief Special Adviser [[Dominic Cummings]] relieved one of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] Javid's aides, Sonia Khan, of her employment, without Javid's permission and without informing him. It was alleged that, during her dismissal, Cummings "went outside No 10 and asked an armed officer to enter the building and escort Khan off the premises."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/31/boris-johnson-must-launch-inquiry-dominic-cummings-reign-of-terror |title=PM 'must launch urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings's reign of terror'|author1=Helm, Toby|author2=Townsend,Mark|date=1 September 2019|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Javid "voiced anger" to Johnson over the dismissal of Khan<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49532243|title=Javid 'voiced anger' to PM over adviser sacking|date=31 August 2019|access-date=1 September 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901052624/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49532243|archive-date=1 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and Cummings faced the prospect of a probe by a governmental ethics watchdog following the dismissal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sajid-javid-aide-sonia-khan-fired-in-mafia-style-hit-056gn0z3r|title=Sajid Javid aide Sonia Khan fired in 'mafia-style hit'|last=Shipman|first=Tim|date=1 September 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=1 September 2019|language=en|issn=0956-1382|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901144544/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sajid-javid-aide-sonia-khan-fired-in-mafia-style-hit-056gn0z3r|archive-date=1 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2019, following questions of a rift between Johnson and Javid, Johnson gave his assurance that he would retain Javid as Chancellor after the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/507d7144-0a13-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67|title=Boris Johnson vows to retain Sajid Javid as chancellor|author1=Parker, George|author2=Payne, Sebastian|date=18 November 2019|newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref>

However, in the weeks leading up to the reshuffle, a number of briefings in the press had suggested that a new economic ministry led by [[Rishi Sunak]] might be established, to reduce the power and political influence of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Sunak was considered to be a Johnson loyalist, seen as the "rising star" minister who had ably represented the Prime Minister during the 2019 election debates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/35e7bf74-1521-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385|title=Johnson's 'favourite minister' tipped to run super-ministry|date=25 December 2019|newspaper=Financial Times|author=Parker, George}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2020/02/is-sajid-javid-at-war-with-no-10/|title=Is Sajid Javid at war with No. 10?|author=Balls, Katy|newspaper=The Spectator|date=13 February 2020}}</ref> By February 2020, it was reported that Javid would remain in his role as Chancellor and that Sunak would stay on as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], in order to "keep an eye" on Javid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/05/johnson-loyalists-to-be-rewarded-in-long-awaited-reshuffle|title=Ministers jostle as Johnson plans long-awaited reshuffle|date=5 February 2020|author=Mason, Rowena|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

On 13 February 2020, the day of the reshuffle, Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer, following a meeting with the Prime Minister. During the meeting, Johnson had offered to keep his position on the condition that he fire all of his advisers at the Treasury, to be replaced with individuals selected by 10 Downing Street. Upon resigning, Javid told the [[PA Media|Press Association]] that "no self-respecting minister would accept those terms".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle|title=Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor amid Johnson reshuffle|author=Mason, Rowena|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2020/0213/1115043-sajid-javid-quits-as-british-chancellor/|title=Sajid Javid quits as British Chancellor|date=13 February 2020|website= RTÉ}}</ref>

The Chancellor's resignation was unexpected, given Johnson's commitment to retain Javid within the Cabinet, and recent reports that an alternative finance ministry would not be made. Robert Shrimsley, chief political commentator of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', stated that the Prime Minister's choices at the time risked damaging the government, that "good government often depends on senior ministers – and the Chancellor in particular – being able to fight bad ideas".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f1e8b996-4e59-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5|title=Johnson has backed Cummings over his chancellor — and there will be a cost|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=Financial Times|author= Shrimsley, Robert}} (source is subscription viewing - (not necessarily verifiable))</ref>

Javid was due to deliver his first budget on 11 March 2020, which was expected to include increased spending on infrastructure, public services and the environment, with a higher level of investment in [[Northern England|the north]] and the [[Midlands]]. On the day of his resignation, he was immediately replaced by<ref name=a2020-02-14/> his deputy,<ref>Rowena Mason, Heather Stewart Peter Walker (13 February 2020) — [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle Rishi Sunak replaces Javid, who refused the PM's request to sack all his advisers], published by [[The Guardian]] February 2020, - accessed 2020-02-14</ref> Rishi Sunak. Javid became the first Chancellor in 50 years to not have delivered any budget, since [[Iain Macleod]].

===Backbencher (2020–present)===
Javid returned to becoming a backbench MP after resigning as Chancellor. In his first speech as a backbencher, after [[Prime Minister's Questions]], he said that he felt he still had "more to give" in regards to his political future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/sajid-javid-offers-a-parting-shot-in-resignation-statement|title=Sajid Javid offers a parting shot in resignation statement|work=The Spectator|last=Balls|first=Katy|date=26 February 2020|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

In June 2020, Javid announced he would be working with the [[Centre for Social Justice]] think tank to lead an inquiry into [[Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom|child sexual abuse in the UK]]. He wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of his concern that the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]] lockdown was leading to a surge in child sexual abuse cases.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52876226|title=Coronavirus lockdown 'perfect storm' for abused children - Sajid Javid|work=BBC News|date=1 June 2020|access-date=1 June 2020}}</ref>

Javid was discussed in the media as an alternative candidate for the Conservative Party in the [[2021 London mayoral election]], to take the place of [[Shaun Bailey (London politician)|Shaun Bailey]], before reports of a plot to replace Bailey were dismissed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/shaun-bailey-london-mayor-election-tory-sajid-javid-sadiq-khan-polls-latest-a9558286.html|title=Shaun Bailey will not be replaced as Tory London mayor candidate despite flagging in polls, says minister|work=The Independent|last=Buchan|first=Lizzy|date=11 June 2020|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref>

In August 2020, Javid began in a paid role as a senior adviser to [[JPMorgan Chase]]. He joined on the bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa advisory council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/08/17/former-chancellor-sajid-javid-takes-new-job-adviser-jpmorgan/|title=Former Chancellor Sajid Javid takes new role as adviser at JPMorgan|work=The Telegraph|last=Sheridan|first=Danielle|date=17 August 2020|access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref> His appointment was criticised by Labour MP [[Zarah Sultana]] as "undermining democracy" and she advocated for MPs to be banned from taking second jobs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/19/mps-advising-big-business-democracy-second-jobs-sajid-javid|title=MPs 'advising' big business undermines democracy.

==Political positions==
===Brexit===
In 2016, Javid became a prominent supporter of remaining in the [[European Union]] in the unsuccessful [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] which resulted in [[Brexit]], the United Kingdom's [[withdrawal from the European Union#United Kingdom|withdrawal]] from the [[European Union]]. Javid was a strong supporter of the [[European Single Market|Single Market]]; describing it as a "great invention, one that even [[Lady Thatcher]] campaigned enthusiastically to create."<ref name="telegraph_2016-05-14"/>

Javid is known to have historically held Eurosceptic views; as a student in 1990 he was thrown out of the Conservative Party conference for handing out leaflets opposing Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], the forerunner of the single currency.<ref name=JavidERM/>

In 2015, Javid was an advocate for holding an EU referendum,<ref name= javid-telegraph-2015int/> whilst pro-Brexit Conservatives had long assumed he would join the Leave campaign, but in the end he backed Remain. He was not often seen as very committed to that cause and has since become a Leave supporter.<ref name = JavidEUBloomberg/> Whilst Javid insisted this was not as a result of pressure from either [[David Cameron]] or [[George Osborne]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' revealed that Osborne "got the thumbscrews out" because it would have been completely unacceptable for a Conservative Business Secretary to have advocated Brexit.<ref name=javidmayft/>

Javid has maintained his position that politicians should respect the result of the referendum, and when judges ruled that the PM could not trigger the formal Brexit process without Parliament's backing, Javid accused British High Court judges of attempting to thwart the will of the British people.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Peck|first=Tom|title=Lord Patten: Sajid Javid should have been sacked|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/lord-patten-sajid-javid-should-have-been-sacked-a7400801.html|work=The Independent|date=6 November 2016|access-date=9 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209232235/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/lord-patten-sajid-javid-should-have-been-sacked-a7400801.html|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Javid has made it clear since the referendum that he is sceptical of softer Brexit options such as remaining in the customs union, saying the free trade area was an “intrinsic” part of the European Union and that voters had given “clear instructions” when they voted to Leave.<ref name = JavidEUBloomberg>{{Cite news|title=May Promotes Anti-EU Former Banker, Shifting the Brexit Balance|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-30/javid-a-brexit-remainer-turned-leaver-is-new-home-secretary|work=Bloomberg|date=30 April 2018|access-date=23 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223184804/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-30/javid-a-brexit-remainer-turned-leaver-is-new-home-secretary|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Javid's comments drew criticism from the [[Confederation of British Industry|CBI]].<ref name = JavidEUCBI>{{Cite news|title=CBI chief slaps down Sajid Javid over call to abandon the customs union with the EU|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/94581/cbi-chief-slaps-down-sajid-javid-over-call-abandon-customs|work=PoliticsHome|date=23 April 2018|access-date=23 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224001708/https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/94581/cbi-chief-slaps-down-sajid-javid-over-call-abandon-customs|archive-date=24 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2019, Javid said he considered the [[Brexit Party]] not to be extremist and praised [[Nigel Farage]]: "I applaud Nigel Farage for walking away, calling [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] thugs and extremists." The move was seen by some as an effort by the Conservative Party to "extend an olive branch" to the Brexit Party.<ref name = JavidFaragepraise>{{Cite news|title=Sajid Javid praises Nigel Farage in speech on extremism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/sajid-javid-praises-nigel-farage-in-speech-on-extremism-boris-johnson|work=The Guardian|date=19 July 2019|access-date=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720060442/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/19/sajid-javid-praises-nigel-farage-in-speech-on-extremism-boris-johnson|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

As Chancellor, Javid drew up plans for millions of 50p Brexit coins to be minted in time for Britain's departure from the EU. Javid's proposal for the coins to be produced for mass circulation was portrayed as a statement of intent that the Treasury is fully behind Brexit, in contrast to previous Chancellor Philip Hammond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/11/sajid-javids-plan-to-flood-tills-with-brexit-50p-coins|title=Sajid Javid's plan to flood tills with Brexit 50p coins|date=11 August 2019|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=11 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811113419/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/11/sajid-javids-plan-to-flood-tills-with-brexit-50p-coins|archive-date=11 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the Conservative Friends of Israel Conference of 2018, Javid explained how a school trip to Israel by his brother forty years ago set off his lifelong support for Israel and added, "my dad explained the history, how it came about and why it is such a special place.

====Visit to the Western Wall====
In 2019, Javid become the first British minister in 19 years to visit [[Western Wall]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]. Visits to the Western Wall by foreign dignitaries are opposed by Palestinians, who say they legitimize Israeli claims to the eastern half of the city, which they claim for the capital of a future Palestinian state.<ref name=javidwall>{{cite news|date=1 July 2019|title=Sajid Javid becomes first British minister in 19 years to visit Jerusalem's Western Wall|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/sajid-javid-becomes-first-british-minister-in-19-years-to-visit-jerusalem-s-western-wall-1.485972|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|access-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701184432/https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/sajid-javid-becomes-first-british-minister-in-19-years-to-visit-jerusalem-s-western-wall-1.485972|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=javidwall2>{{cite news|date=1 July 2019|title=UK minister Sajid Javid makes rare visit to Western Wall, Temple Mount|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-minister-sajid-javid-makes-rare-visit-to-western-wall-temple-mount/|newspaper=The Times of Israel|access-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701184432/https://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-minister-sajid-javid-makes-rare-visit-to-western-wall-temple-mount/|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Javid was advised by officials not to visit the Western Wall during a visit to Israel because of "long-standing policy of over two-decades". In January 2020, at the reception of ''Conservative Friends of Israel'', he told the audience that his response was  - "You know what?

====Campaign against BDS====
{{see also|Boycotts of Israel}}
Javid has a history of campaigning against [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS). In 2014, he told attendees at the [[Union of Jewish Students]] conference that he will "always be proud to stand up and resist calls for boycotts of Israel".<ref name=javidujs14>{{cite news|date=18 December 2014|title=Javid denounces 'smokescreen' arts censorship|url=https://www.thejc.com/javid-denounces-smokescreen-arts-censorship-1.63818|newspaper=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|access-date=20 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320201238/https://www.thejc.com/javid-denounces-smokescreen-arts-censorship-1.63818|archive-date=20 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, as [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]], Javid advised Board of Deputies that he had "no tolerance for cultural boycotts of Israel".<ref name=javid-kilburn-israel/>

==Political influence==
{{Thatcherism|expanded=people}}

===Thatcherism===
Javid's father had inspired a devotion to [[Margaret Thatcher]]: "My dad lived through the [[winter of discontent]] and used to vote Labour, but switched to Thatcher, saying, 'look how she’s sorting out the country'. I agreed".<ref name="itvjavthatcher">{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-30/sajid-javids-journey-from-bus-drivers-son-to-home-secretary/|title=Sajid Javid's journey from bus driver's son to Home Secretary|date=30 April 2018|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617115621/http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-30/sajid-javids-journey-from-bus-drivers-son-to-home-secretary/|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]}}</ref>

Javid has spoken of Thatcher's handling of the [[Falklands Conflict]] as a defining moment, saying: "That was a big moment for me in understanding war and how it happens, and admiring Margaret Thatcher and her decisiveness. That’s how my political awareness really took off."<ref name="javid-telegraph-2015int" />

===Objectivism===
One of Javid's heroines is [[Ayn Rand]],<ref name="Montgomeriejavids" /> who is the proponent of a philosophical system known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]; he recounted once that he regularly rereads the courtroom scene from her novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', telling ''[[The Spectator]]'' he admired its description of "the power of the individual … sticking up for your beliefs, against popular opinion".<ref name="guardiansjrand" /> Furthermore, at a Crossbench Film Society event, Javid chose to introduce [[The Fountainhead (film)|the film version of ''The Fountainhead'']]<ref name="javidaei">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/sajid-javid-combative-capitalist-and-courtier-of-us-neocons|title=Sajid Javid: combative capitalist and courtier of US neocons|last=Sabbah|first=Dan|date=4 May 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701164857/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/sajid-javid-combative-capitalist-and-courtier-of-us-neocons|archive-date=1 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and described the profound effect it had on him after watching it as a 12-year-old.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2015/01/javid-i-read-the-courtroom-scene-from-the-fountainhead-to-my-future-wife.html|title=Javid: "I read the courtroom scene from 'The Fountainhead' to my future wife!" - Conservative Home|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163721/https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2015/01/javid-i-read-the-courtroom-scene-from-the-fountainhead-to-my-future-wife.html|archive-date=19 June 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> Javid's wife once threatened to divorce him if he did not stop reading ''The Fountainhead'' aloud to her.<ref name="prospectjavid">{{cite news|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/both-sides-now-inside-the-rise-of-sajid-javid|title=Both sides now: inside the rise of Sajid Javid|last=Sylvester|first=Rachel|date=27 January 2019|newspaper=[[Prospect Magazine]]|access-date=1 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201172447/https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/both-sides-now-inside-the-rise-of-sajid-javid|archive-date=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Javid has subsequently rejected core principles of ''Objectivism'', stating he is instead motivated by [[altruism]] and went on to clarify he appreciates ''The Fountainhead'' because he identifies with the main protagonist: "It’s about the underdog. Whatever [[Howard Roark]] wanted to do there were people lining up against him and saying—‘no, you will fail’—and he kept going right to the end".<ref name="prospectjavid" />

Philosopher and theologian [[John Milbank]] commented, "It is extraordinarily disturbing that any mainstream politician should express any admiration for Ayn Rand. We should be concerned that someone like Sajid Javid can now hold high office within the United Kingdom."<ref name="ransocffee">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/why-do-tories-love-ayn-rand/|title=Why do Tories love Ayn Rand?|last=Benn|first=Alastair|date=4 May 2018|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|access-date=22 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722172521/https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/why-do-tories-love-ayn-rand/|archive-date=22 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
