Initially ''Kristeligt Dagblad'' was an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] newspaper.<ref name=hhen/> The paper was [[apolitical]], publishing articles on religious and moral topics as well as on cultural topics.<ref name=hhen/> In 1909 it published [[anti-evolution]]ary articles, strongly opposing to the views of [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name=hhen/> From 1914 the paper took a wider approach and in 1935 broke away from the Inner Mission, presenting general news but without any political association. It gained popularity under the leadership of Gunnar Helweg-Larsen, but lost ground in the 1950s. From 1950 it adopted a new approach, adopting a more lively style with more emphasis on foreign news. The paper does not have any sports section and covers sports-related news occasionally.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Horky|author2=Jörg-Uwe Nieland|title=International Sports Press Survey 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVpBAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|accessdate=17 December 2014|date=8 October 2013|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7322-7886-2|page=63}}</ref>
