Music"/><ref name="Digital Spy"/> Lyrically, the song is about the experiences of anguish, anxiety, and confusion. The song received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who generally praised its dark musical tone, lyrics and beat, and noted that it is reminiscent of Rihanna's previous single, "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" (2007). "Disturbia" earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 [[NRJ Music Awards]] and a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]].

"Disturbia" was a commercial success, and peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in more than twenty countries including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The song topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number-one single from ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' and fourth overall on the Hot 100.

"Disturbia" was written by American recording artist [[Chris Brown]] and his team which included [[Brian Kennedy (record producer)|Brian Kennedy]], [[Rob.

However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, "[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled ''Exclusive: The Forever Edition'' (2008). He felt that "Disturbia" would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired "to go totally left and kind of weird".<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2008-08-14-chris-brown_N.htm|last=Fekadu|first=Mesfin|title=Chris Brown upset over leak of unfinished song|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett Company, Inc]]|date=August 14, 2008|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> Speaking to ''[[USA Today]]'', Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have."<ref name="USA Today"/>

"Disturbia" was recorded in April 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].<ref name="Notes"/> Speaking to Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]], Rihanna explained: "I went into the studio making music my way.

She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say.

===Synopsis and reception===
[[File:Rihanna disturbia.JPG|thumb|left|150px|A shot from the music video where Rihanna is seen imprisoned. She is wearing lenses that make her look as if her eyes have rolled into the back of her head.]]
The music video for "Disturbia" begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys of a big dark piano and looks into the camera. As the song starts different images of Rihanna are shown. In one of the scenes, she is seen imprisoned wearing lenses that make it look as if her eyes have rolled into the back of her head. Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen [[Detox Icunt]]) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding her in front of a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]''-esque dance routine.<ref name="MTV RECEPTION">{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2008/07/24/new-video-rihanna-disturbia/|title=New Video: Rihanna,'Disturbia'|publisher=MTV|date=July 24, 2008|access-date=August 30, 2011|last=Anitai|first=Tamar}}</ref> As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus, she wears a metal spines corset while a [[tarantula]] is on her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna is in a very tiny room, with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.

According to Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy, "Disturbia" is "yin to the yang of Chris Brown's '[[Wall to Wall (song)|Wall to Wall]]' which features creepy-crawly chicks climbing the walls in latex."<ref name="MTV RECEPTION"/> He later, listed the video at number five on the "Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos" stating: "In Rihanna's 'Disturbia' video, obsession manifests itself in freaky-deaky tarantulas, wigs, wolves, and a creepy dude in an eye patch. And S&M-y corsets. Paranoia never looked so supernaturally sexy!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2009/05/22/buzzworthys-top-5-most-paranoid-music-videos/|title=Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos|publisher=MTV|date=July 24, 2008|access-date=August 30, 2011|last=Anitai|first=Tamar}}</ref> Simon Vozick-Levinson from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also reviewed the video commenting: "It looks like she accidentally wandered into [[Nine Inch Nails]]{{'}} '[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]' video, or else some sort of freaky Victorian mental hospital".
