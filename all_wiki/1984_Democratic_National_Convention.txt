The '''1984 National Convention''' of the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] was held at the [[Moscone Center]] in [[San Francisco, California]] from July 16 to July 19, 1984, to select candidates for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984 United States presidential election]].

Manatt]], led the convention.

==Logistics==
The convention was held at Moscone Center, a [[convention center]] in San Francisco, California. This marked the second time that a Democratic National Convention had been held in the city of San Francisco, with the [[1920 Democratic National Convention|1920 edition]] having been held at the city's [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]].<ref name="Niekerken">{{cite web |last1=Niekerken |first1=Bill Van |title=SF's 1984 Democratic convention: Historic, but not smooth |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/thetake/article/SF-s-1984-Democratic-convention-Historic-but-8476660.php#photo-10626789 |website=SFChronicle.com |accessdate=31 July 2020 |date=1 August 2016}}</ref>

==Events of the Convention==
[[Walter Mondale]] was nominated for President and [[Geraldine Ferraro]] was nominated for Vice President.

New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] gave [[A Tale of Two Cities (speech)|a well-received keynote speech]]. Mondale's major rivals for the presidential nomination, Senator [[Gary Hart]] and Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]], also gave speeches.

Jackson's speech referred to the nation as a "quilt" with places for "[t]he white, the Hispanic, the black, the Arab, the Jew, the woman, the Native American, the small farmer, the business person, the environmentalist, the peace activist, the young, the old, the lesbian, the gay, and the disabled".<ref>{{cite news|last1=House|first1=Ernest R.|title=Jesse in 1984: Whites Wept, Blacks Frowned|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-24/books/bk-10473_1_reverend-jesse-jackson|accessdate=2 January 2018|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=24 July 1988}}</ref> It was the first time anyone mentioned lesbians and gays in a national convention address.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Joy-Ann|title=Fracture: Barack Obama, the Clintons, and the Racial Divide|date=8 September 2015|publisher=William Morrow|page=50|asin= B00FJ3A98G|edition=Amazon Kindle}}</ref> Jackson also attempted to move the party's platform farther to the left at the Convention, but without much success.

===President===
Before the convention had convened, Mondale was widely regarded as having secured the prerequisite delegate support to clinch the nomination.<ref name="Niekerken"/> However, he only attained this amount of delegate support with the inclusion of [[superdelegates]] that supported his candidacy. His number of pledged delegates (those bound to him, and awarded through primaries) alone did not give him enough of the a lead to win the nomination without superdelegate support.<ref name="Niekerken"/> His number of pledged delegates heading into the convention was 40 shy of the 1,967 needed to win the nomination.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bomboy |first1=Scott |title=A primer about recent convention brawls over delegates |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/a-primer-about-recent-convention-brawls-over-delegates/ |publisher=National Constitution Center |accessdate=31 July 2020 |date=8 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=Hirschkorn>Phil Hirschkorn,  [http://www.salon.com/2015/02/15/exclusive_americas_last_great_convention_mondale_jackson_hart_dish_to_salon_about_wild_1984_dnc/ "America's Last Great Convention: Mondale, Jackson & Hart Dish To Salon About Wild 1984 DNC"], ''Salon''.

Jesse Jackson had unsuccessfully called for the suspension of the party's electoral rules to give him a number of delegates closer to the 20% average share of the vote he garnered during the primaries. The system tended to punish shallow showings as yielding no delegates at all, hence Jackson's smaller delegate count than would be expected (12%).<ref name="economist" />

===Vice President===
[[Geraldine Ferraro]] was nominated by acclamation on a voice vote. She became the first woman to receive a major party nomination in the US.
