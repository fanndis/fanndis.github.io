The '''leek''' is a [[vegetable]], a [[cultivar]] of ''[[Allium ampeloprasum]]'', the broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a [[plant stem|stem]] or stalk. The [[genus]] ''[[Allium]]'' also contains the [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[shallot]], [[scallion]], [[chive]],<ref name=Block2010>{{cite book|author=Block, E.|title=Garlic and Other Alliums: The Lore and the Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AB89RHV9ucC|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2010|isbn=978-0-85404-190-9}}</ref> and [[Allium chinense|Chinese onion]]. Three closely related vegetables, [[elephant garlic]], [[kurrat]] and [[Persian leek]] or ''tareh'', are also cultivars of ''A.&nbsp;ampeloprasum'', although different in their uses as food.<ref name="AN">{{cite web |url=http://www.allallergy.net/fapaidfind.cfm?cdeoc=684 |title=AllergyNet&nbsp;— Allergy Advisor Find |publisher=Allallergy.net |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615004222/http://allallergy.net/fapaidfind.cfm?cdeoc=684 |archivedate=June 15, 2010 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
Historically, many [[scientific name]]s were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of ''A. ampeloprasum''.<ref name="WCSP_294972">{{Citation |contribution=Allium ampeloprasum |title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url= http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=294972 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref> The name "leek" developed from the [[Old English]] word ''leac'', from which the modern English name for [[garlic]] also derives.<ref name="Foley2006">{{cite book |author=Caroline Foley|title=The A-Z of Allotment Vegetables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvn_5cnprUUC&pg=PA75 |year=2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers |isbn=978-1-84537-283-5 |pages=75}}</ref>

==Form==
Rather than forming a tight [[bulb]] like the onion, the leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths that are generally [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanched]] by pushing soil around them (trenching). They are often sold as small seedlings in flats that are started off early in [[greenhouse]]s, to be planted out as weather permits. Once established in the garden, leeks are hardy; many varieties can be left in the ground during the winter to be harvested as needed.

==Cultivars==
Leek [[cultivar]]s may be treated as a single [[cultivar group]], e.g. as ''A. ampeloprasum'' 'Leek Group'.<ref name=Brew08>{{Cite book |last=Brewster |first=James L. |year=2008 |title=Onions and other vegetable alliums |edition=2nd |location=Wallingford, UK |publisher=CABI International |isbn=978-1-84593-399-9 }} p. 30</ref> The cultivars can be subdivided in several ways, but the most common types are "summer leeks", intended for harvest in the season when planted, and overwintering leeks, meant to be harvested in the spring of the year following planting. Summer leek types are generally smaller than overwintering types; overwintering types are generally more strongly flavored. Cultivars include 'King Richard' and 'Tadorna Blue'.

==Growing==
Leeks are easy to grow from seed and tolerate standing in the field for an extended harvest, which takes place  up to 6 months from planting.<ref name="Iannotti2014">{{cite book|author=Marie Iannotti|title=The Timber Press Guide to Vegetable Gardening in the Northeast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaDxAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA186|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-1-60469-595-3|pages=186–}}</ref> The soil in which it is grown has to be loose and drained well; leek can be grown in the same regions where onions can be grown.<ref name="Peter2006"/> Leeks usually reach maturity in the autumn months. Leeks can be bunched and harvested early when they are about the size of a finger or pencil, or they can be thinned and allowed to grow to a much larger mature size. [[Hilling]] leeks can produce better specimens.

Leeks suffer from insect pests including the [[thrips]] species ''[[Thrips tabaci]]'' and the [[leek moth]].<ref name="TheunissenLegutowska1991">{{cite journal|last1=Theunissen|first1=J.|last2=Legutowska|first2=H.|title=Thrips tabaciLindeman (Thysanoptera, Thripidae) in leek: symptoms, distribution and population estimates|journal=Journal of Applied Entomology|volume=112|issue=1–5|year=1991|pages=163–170|issn=0931-2048|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0418.1991.tb01042.x|s2cid=83916407}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=P.g.|last2=Appleby|first2=M.|last3=Juneja|first3=S.|last4=Allen|first4=J.|last5=Landry|first5=J.-F.|date=2010-07-01|title=Biology and Development of Acrolepiopsis assectella (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae) in Eastern Ontario|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.4039/n10-026|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=142|issue=4|pages=393–404|doi=10.4039/n10-026|s2cid=85817953|issn=0008-347X}}</ref> Leeks are also susceptible to leek rust (''[[Puccinia allii]]'').<ref name="Peter2006">{{cite book|author=K.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Leek-Sauté.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Fresh leek sautéing]]

Leeks have a mild, onion-like taste. In its raw state, the vegetable is crunchy and firm. The edible portions of the leek are the white base of the leaves (above the roots and stem base), the light green parts, and to a lesser extent the dark green parts of the leaves. The dark green portion is usually discarded because it has a tough texture, but it can be sautéed, or more commonly added to stock for flavor.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Librarie Larousse|year=1984|title=Larousse Gastronomique: The World's Greatest Cooking Encyclopedia|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited}}</ref> A few leaves are sometimes tied with twine and other herbs to form a ''[[bouquet garni]]''.

Leeks are typically chopped into slices 5–10&nbsp;mm thick. The slices have a tendency to fall apart, due to the layered structure of the leek. The different ways of preparing the vegetable are:

* Boiling turns it soft and mild in taste. (Care should be taken to chop the vegetable, or else the intact fibers that run the length of the vegetable will tangle into a ball while chewing.) Whole boiled leeks, served cold with [[vinaigrette]] is the most popular way of eating leeks in France, where leeks are called "[[asperge du pauvre]]" ("Poor man's asparagus")
* Frying leaves it crunchier and preserves the taste.
* Raw leeks can be used in [[salad]]s, doing especially well when they are the prime ingredient.
* In [[Turkish cuisine]], leeks are chopped into thick <!--presumably, original word was "big"--> slices, then boiled and separated into leaves, and finally filled with a filling usually containing rice, herbs (generally parsley and dill), onion, and black pepper. For [[sarma (food)|''sarma'']] with [[olive oil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.takvim.com.tr/Yemek/Diger/2013/01/02/zeytinyagli-pirasa-sarmasi|title=Zeytinyağlı Pırasa Sarması|publisher=Tavkim}}</ref> currants, pine nuts, and cinnamon are added, and for ''sarma'' with meat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkish-media.com/yemektarifleri/viewrecipe.php?id=859&ord=id&asc=DESC|title=Etli Pırasa Sarması|publisher=Turkish Media}}</ref> minced meat is added to the filling. In Turkey, especially ''[[zeytinyağlı]] pırasa'' (leek with olive oil), ''ekşili pırasa'' (sour leek), ''etli pırasa'' (leek with meat), ''pırasa musakka'' (leek ''[[musakka]]''), ''pırasalı börek'' (''[[börek]]'' with leek), and ''pırasa köftesi'' leek meatball are also cooked.

Leeks are an ingredient of [[cock-a-leekie soup]], leek and [[potato]] soup, and ''[[vichyssoise]]'', as well as plain [[leek soup]].

Because of their symbolism in [[Wales]] (see below), they have come to be used extensively in that country’s cuisine. Elsewhere in Britain, leeks have come back into favor only in the last 50 years or so, having been overlooked for several centuries.<ref>[[Jane Grigson]], ''Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book'', (Penguin Books, 1978, {{ISBN|0-14-046859-5}}) p 291</ref>

==Historical consumption==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] talks of חציר, identified by commentators as leek, and says it is abundant in Egypt.<ref>Glantz, ''Animal and plant life in the Torah, חי וצומח בתורה'', p. 204</ref> Dried specimens from archaeological sites in [[ancient Egypt]], as well as wall carvings and drawings, indicate that the leek was a part of the Egyptian diet from at least the second millennium [[BCE]]. Texts also show that it was grown in [[Mesopotamia]] from the beginning of the second millennium BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zohary|first1=Daniel|last2=Hopf|first2=Maria|last3=Weiss|first3=Ehud|title=Domestication of plants in the Old World : the origin and spread of domesticated plants in Southwest Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199549061|page=195|edition=4th}}</ref> 

Leeks were eaten in [[ancient Rome]] and regarded as superior to [[garlic]] and [[onions]].<ref name="sanderson">{{cite book |editor1-last=Prance |editor1-first=Ghillean |editor2-last=Nesbitt |editor2-first=Mark |last1=Sanderson |first1=Helen |last2=Renfrew |first2=Jane M. |date=2005 |title=The Cultural History of Plants |publisher=Routledge |page=121 |isbn=0415927463}}</ref> The 1st century cookbook [[Apicius]] contains four recipes involving leeks.<ref name="sanderson"/> Raw leeks were the favorite vegetable of the Emperor [[Nero]], who consumed it in soup or in oil, believing it beneficial to the quality of his voice.<ref>Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', XIX, 33.</ref> This earned him the nickname "Porrophagus", or "Leek Eater".<ref name="sanderson"/>

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Schuch Still life.jpg|thumb|left|''Still life with leeks'' by [[Carl Schuch]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw]])]]

The leek is one of the [[National symbols of Wales|national emblems of Wales]], and it or the [[daffodil]] (in Welsh, the daffodil is known as "Peter's leek", ''Cenhinen Bedr'') is worn on [[St. David's Day]]. According to one [[Welsh mythology|legend]], [[Cadwaladr|King Cadwaladr]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] ordered his soldiers to identify themselves by wearing the vegetable on their helmets in an ancient battle against the [[Saxons]] that took place in a leek field.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The Elizabethan poet [[Michael Drayton]] stated, in contrast, that the tradition was a tribute to Saint David, who ate only leeks when he was fasting.<ref>Cumo, Christopher, ''Encyclopedia of Cultivated Plants: From Acacia to Zinnia'', ABC-CLIO, 2013, p.561.</ref> Whatever the case, the leek has been known to be a symbol of Wales for a long time; [[Shakespeare]], for example, refers to the custom of wearing a leek as an “ancient tradition” in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. In the play, [[Henry V of England|Henry]] tells the Welsh officer [[Fluellen]] that he, too, is wearing a leek "for I am Welsh, you know, good countryman." The 1985 and 1990 [[British one pound coin]]s bear the design of a leek in a coronet, representing Wales.

Alongside the other national floral emblems of countries currently and formerly in the Commonwealth or part of the United Kingdom (including the English [[Tudor Rose]], Scottish [[thistle]], Irish [[shamrock]], Canadian [[maple leaf]], and [[Indian lotus]]), the Welsh leek appeared on the [[coronation gown of Elizabeth II]]. It was designed by Norman Hartnell; when Hartnell asked if he could exchange the leek for the more aesthetically pleasing Welsh daffodil, he was told no.<ref name=Coronation>{{cite news|url=http://www.stgeorgesnews.org/1998/05f06.htm|title=SILVER AND GOLD|publisher=Waterlooville Parish Church|author=Rosemary Goulding|date=June 1998|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>

Perhaps the most visible use of the leek, however, is as the cap badge of the [[Welsh Guards]], a battalion within the [[Household Division]] of the British Army.<ref name="Storl2016">{{cite book|author=Wolf D. Storl|title=A Curious History of Vegetables: Aphrodisiacal and Healing Properties, Folk Tales, Garden Tips, and Recipes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpyTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA155|date=14 June 2016|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-62317-040-0|pages=155–}}</ref>

In Romania, the leek is also widely considered a symbol of [[Oltenia]], a historical region in the southwestern part of the country.<ref name="Mirodan1987">{{cite book|author=Vladimir Mirodan|title=The Balkan Cookbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7w0QngEACAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Pelican Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-88289-738-7|page=63}}</ref>

Buddhist monks of the [[Mahayana]] school do not consume leeks, as they are considered to "excite the senses".
