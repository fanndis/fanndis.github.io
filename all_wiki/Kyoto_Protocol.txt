The '''Kyoto Protocol''' is an [[international treaty]] which extends the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, based on the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that (part one) [[global warming]] is occurring and (part two) it is extremely likely that human-made [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> emissions]] have predominantly caused it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There are currently 192 parties ([[Canada]] withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012)<ref name=UNlist>{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-a&chapter=27&lang=en |title=7 .a Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |work=UN Treaty Database |accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> to the Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to "a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)]], [[Methane|Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)]], [[Nitrous oxide|nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)]], hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and [[Sulfur hexafluoride|sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)]].<ref>Report Of The Conference Of The Parties On Its Third Session, Held At Kyoto From 1 To 11 December 1997 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop3/07a01.pdf#page=28</ref>

The Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledges that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to [[economic development]], and therefore puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] helped reduce the emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries because the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] reduced their emissions in the early 1990s.<ref name="Shislov">{{cite journal |last1=Shishlov |first1=Igor |last2=Morel |first2=Romain |last3=Bellassen |first3=Valentin |date=2016 |title=Compliance of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in the first commitment period |journal=Climate Policy |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=768–782 |doi=10.1080/14693062.2016.1164658 |s2cid=156120010 }}</ref> Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.<ref name="GapReport">{{cite web |url=http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8526/-The%20emissions%20gap%20report%202012_%20a%20UNEP%20synthesis%20reportemissionGapReport2012.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y |title=The Emissions Gap Report 2012 |date=2012 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |page=2 |access-date=2019-12-07 }}</ref>

A second commitment period was agreed in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets: [[Australia]], the [[European Union]] (and its 28 [[Member states of the European Union|member states]]), [[Belarus]], [[Iceland]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Ukraine]]. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets.<ref name="figueres doha summary">{{citation | last=Figueres | first= C. | title=Environmental issues: Time to abandon blame-games and become proactive - Economic Times | work=The Economic Times / Indiatimes.com| publisher=Times Internet | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-12-15/news/35836633_1_emission-reduction-targets-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change | date=15 December 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Japan, [[New Zealand]], and [[Russia]] have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period.

It will enter into force as of 31 December 2020, following its acceptances by 144 states. Of the 37 parties with binding commitments, 34 have ratified.

Negotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ends in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the [[Paris Agreement]], which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.

'''1992''' – The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change [https://web.archive.org/web/20200528113835/https://unfccc.int/ ("FCCC" or "UNFCCC")] among other agreements.

'''1995''' – Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.

'''1997''' – In December the parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.

'''2004''' – Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005.

'''2011''' – Canada became the first signatory to announce its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.<ref>http://www.ec.gc.ca/Publications/default.asp?lang=En&n=EE4F06AE-1&xml=EE4F06AE-13EF-453B-B633-FCB3BAECEB4F&offset=3&toc=show {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211142508/http://www.ec.gc.ca/Publications/default.asp?lang=En&n=EE4F06AE-1&xml=EE4F06AE-13EF-453B-B633-FCB3BAECEB4F&offset=3&toc=show |date=11 February 2015 }} Canadian government official archives</ref>

* Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.
* Minimizing Impacts on Developing Countries by establishing an [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] fund for climate change.
* Accounting, Reporting and Review in order to ensure the integrity of the Protocol.
* Compliance. Establishing a Compliance Committee to enforce compliance with the commitments under the Protocol.

==First commitment period: 2008–2012==
Under the Kyoto Protocol, 37 [[industrialized countries]] and the [[European Community]] (the [[European Union]]-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions.<ref name="2011 unfccc kyoto protocol overview"/> The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases [[carbon dioxide]] ({{Chem|CO|2|}}), [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), [[sulphur hexafluoride]] ({{chem|S|F|6}}), and two groups of gases, [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) and [[perfluorocarbon]]s (PFCs).<ref name="grubb kyoto gases">

The benchmark 1990 emission levels accepted by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Conference of the parties]] of UNFCCC (decision 2/CP.3) were the values of "[[global warming potential]]" calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]]. These figures are used for converting the various greenhouse gas emissions into comparable [[Co2e|carbon dioxide equivalents]] (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) when computing overall sources and sinks.

Annex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated "flexibility" mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying [[emissions trading|emission allowances]] from other operators which have excess emissions credits.

==Flexibility mechanisms==
{{See also|Economics of climate change mitigation#Kyoto Protocol}}

The Protocol defines three "[[flexibility mechanisms]]" that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments.<ref>

The CDM and JI are called "project-based mechanisms," in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of "production" of emission reductions.<ref name="toth 2001 flexibility mechanisms"/> The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.

Only emission reduction projects that do not involve using nuclear energy are eligible for accreditation under the CDM, in order to prevent nuclear technology exports from becoming the default route for obtaining credits under the CDM.

Each Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a "designated national authority") to create and manage its [[greenhouse gas inventory]]. Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the "CDM process". This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.

====Clean Development Mechanism====
Between 2001, which was the first year [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5&nbsp;billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) in emission reductions.<ref name=wdr>{{cite web

By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in [[China]] (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.

==Stabilization of GHG concentrations==
As noted [[Kyoto Protocol#Objectives|earlier on]], the first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments are not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.<ref name="grubb commitments"/><ref name="ipcc kyoto stabilization">

Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions ([[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], [[East Asia]], and [[planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Asia]]) would need to be substantially reduced below [[Economics of climate change mitigation#Baselines|"business-as-usual"]].<ref name="450ppm scenarios"/> "Business-as-usual" are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below "business-as-usual".<ref name="450ppm scenarios"/>

==Details of the agreement==
The agreement is a protocol to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) adopted at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 3) in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.

National emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use [[land use]], land use change, and [[forestry]] (LULUCF) in meeting their targets.<ref name="Dessai 2001 3">{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=3}}</ref> LULUCF activities are also called "sink" activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate,<ref>{{citation

===Negotiations===

{{See also|Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations}}

Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing emissions.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=144}}
</ref> The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/> The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.<ref name="grubb original unfccc target"/>

At the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the [[Group of 77|G77]] was able to push for a mandate (the "Berlin mandate") where it was recognized that:<ref name="liverman berlin mandate">
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=290}}
</ref>
* developed nations had contributed most to the then-current concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere (see [[Greenhouse gas#Cumulative and historical emissions]]).
* developing country [[Greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions|emissions per-capita]] (i.e., average emissions per head of population)<ref>

}}, in {{harvnb|World Bank|2010|p=370}}
</ref> were still relatively low.
* and that the share of global emissions from developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.
During negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate.<ref>
{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=4}}
</ref> It has since become a member.<ref>
{{harvnb|G-77|2011}}
</ref>

The Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period.<ref name="liverman berlin mandate"/> However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|pp=145–146}}
</ref> In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/> The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.<ref name="grubb developing country emissions"/>

====Emissions cuts====
[[Views on the Kyoto Protocol#Commentaries on negotiations]] contains a list of the emissions cuts that were proposed by UNFCCC Parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world.<ref name="liverman negotiations">
{{harvnb|Liverman|2009|p=291}}
</ref> The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=148}}
</ref> In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/> Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can "bank" their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.<ref name="grubb second round negotiations"/>

The EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included – {{chem|CO|2}}, {{chem|CH|4}}, and {{chem|N|2|O}} – with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> The EU also wanted to have a "bubble" commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/>

The most vulnerable nations – the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS) – pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed.<ref name="grubb differentiation"/> Two examples include differentiation of targets based on [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and differentiation based on [[energy intensity]] (energy use per unit of economic output).<ref name="grubb differentiation">
{{harvnb|Grubb|2003|p=151}}
</ref>

The final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises.<ref name="liverman negotiations"/> The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the [[diplomat]] who chaired the negotiations.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=46}}
</ref> The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=44}}
</ref> The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.<ref>
{{harvnb|Depledge|2000|p=45}}
</ref>

===Financial commitments===

The Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in [[UNFCCC]]. One such project is [[The Adaptation Fund]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adaptation-fund.org/|title=AF - Adaptation Fund|website=www.adaptation-fund.org}}</ref> which has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

===Implementation provisions===
The protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties [[United Nations Climate Change conference#2000: COP 6, The Hague, Netherlands|COP6]] of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in [[the Hague]] in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).

In 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6-bis) was held in [[Bonn]],<ref>[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]], [https://enb.iisd.org/climate/cop6bis/ Sixth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: Resumed Session], accessed 27 May 2020</ref> where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the [[European Union]]) managed to secure the agreement of Japan and [[Russia]] by allowing more use of [[CO2 sink|carbon dioxide sinks]].

[[United Nations Climate Change conference#2001: COP 7, Marrakech, Morocco|COP7]] was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in [[Marrakech]] to establish the final details of the protocol.

The first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in [[Montreal]] from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

During COP13 in Bali, 36 developed [[Contact Group]] countries (plus the EU as a party in the [[European Union]]) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for [[Iceland]]; but, since the EU's member states each have individual obligations,<ref>{{cite web | title=The Kyoto protocol – A brief summary | work=European Commission | url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/kyoto.htm | accessdate=19 April 2007 }}</ref> much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below [[Kyoto Protocol#Increase in greenhouse gas emission since 1990]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/3145.php |title=Kyoto Protocol |publisher=UNFCCC |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> Reduction limitations expired in 2013.

===Mechanism of compliance===

The protocol defines a mechanism of "compliance" as a "monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance."<ref>{{cite web

</ref> the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law.<ref name="grubb compliance"/> Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.<ref name="grubb compliance"/>

===Enforcement===

If the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%. In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.<ref>

==Ratification process==
The Protocol was adopted by [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|COP 3]] of UNFCCC on 11 December 1997 in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to [[UNFCCC]], when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the [[European Community]] had signed. [[Ratification]] (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification by Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.<ref name=parties/>

Article 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force "on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in [[Annex I]] which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the [[Annex I]] countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Protocol full text (PDF)|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf|publisher=UNFCC Homepage}}</ref>

The EU and its Member States ratified the Protocol in May 2002.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/02/794&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |title=European Union ratifies the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=European Union|date=31 May 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2010 }}</ref> Of the two conditions, the "55 parties" clause was reached on 23 May 2002 when [[Iceland]] ratified the Protocol.<ref name=parties>{{cite web|title=Status of ratification|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/2613.php|publisher=UNFCC Homepage|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> The ratification by [[Russia]] on 18 November 2004 satisfied the "55%" clause and brought the treaty into force, effective 16 February 2005, after the required lapse of 90 days.<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Larry|title=What is the Kyoto Protocol|url=http://environment.about.com/od/kyotoprotocol/i/kyotoprotocol.htm|publisher=About.com (Part of NYT)|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref>

As of May 2013, [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|191 countries]] and one regional economic organization (the [[European Economic Community|EC]]) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from [[Annex I]] countries.<ref name = "Kyoto-PDF-unfccc">{{cite web | title=Kyoto Protocol: Status of Ratification | url=http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2009 | publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] }}</ref> One of the 191 ratifying states—Canada—has renounced the protocol.

===Non-ratification by the US===
The US signed the Protocol on 12 November 1998,<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Research Service Reports #98-349: Global Climate Change: Selected Legal Questions About the Kyoto Protocol|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/ern/01jul/98-349.php}}</ref> during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] presidency. To become binding in the US, however, the treaty had to be ratified by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which had already passed the 1997 non-binding [[Byrd-Hagel Resolution]], expressing disapproval of any international agreement that did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and "would seriously harm the economy of the United States". The resolution passed 95–0.<ref>Byrd-Hagel Resolution ({{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626110143/http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSenate.html |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }})</ref> Therefore, even though the [[Clinton administration]] signed the treaty,<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/11/kyoto/ "Clinton Hails Global Warming Pact"]. All Politics (CNN). 11 December 1997. Retrieved 5 November 2006.</ref> it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.

When [[George W. Bush]] was elected US president in 2000, he was asked by [[US Senator]] [[Chuck Hagel]] what his administration's position was on climate change. Bush replied that he took climate change "very seriously",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/George_W__Bush_Energy_+_Oil.htm#56|title=George W. Bush on Energy & Oil|website=www.ontheissues.org}}</ref> but that he opposed the Kyoto treaty because "it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy."<ref name="Dessai 2001 5">{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|p=5}}</ref> The [[Tyndall Centre]] for Climate Change Research reported in 2001:<blockquote>This policy reversal received a massive wave of criticism that was quickly picked up by the international media. Environmental groups blasted the White House, while Europeans and Japanese alike expressed deep concern and regret. [...] Almost all world leaders (e.g. China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific Islands, etc.) expressed their disappointment at Bush's decision.</blockquote>In response to this criticism, Bush stated: "I was responding to reality, and reality is the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy". The Tyndall Centre called this "an overstatement used to cover up the big benefactors of this policy reversal, i.e., the US oil and coal industry, which has a powerful lobby with the administration and conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressmen."<ref>{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|pp=5–6}}</ref>

As of 2020, the US is the only signatory that has not ratified the Protocol.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-a&chapter=27&lang=en |title=United Nations Treaty Collection }}</ref> The US accounted for 36% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty to go into legal effect without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.<ref>{{harvnb|Dessai|2001|pp=5–10}}</ref>

===Other states and territories where the treaty is not applicable===
Andorra, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[South Sudan]], the United States and, following their withdrawal on 15 December 2012, Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the Protocol. Furthermore, the Protocol is not applied to UNFCCC observer the [[Holy See]]. Although the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/key-topics/treaties/search-the-treaty-database/1997/12/008415.html|work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)]]|title=Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=30 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203014400/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/key-topics/treaties/search-the-treaty-database/1997/12/008415.html|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Compliance====
38 developed countries committed to limiting their greenhouse gas emissions. Because the United States did not ratify and Canada withdrew, the emission limits remained in force for 36 countries. All of them complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries (Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland) had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets.<ref name="Shislov" />

In total, the 36 countries that fully participated in the Protocol were committed to reducing their aggregate emissions by 4% from the 1990 base year. Their average annual emissions in 2008–2012 were 24.2% below the 1990 level. Hence, they surpassed their aggregate commitment by a large margin. If the United States and Canada are included, the emissions decreased by 11.8%. The large reductions were mainly thanks to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], which reduced the emissions of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by tens of percents in the early 1990s. In addition, the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] significantly reduced emissions during the first Kyoto commitment period.<ref name="Shislov" />

The 36 countries that were committed to emission reductions only accounted for 24% of the global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.<ref name="Shislov" /> Even though these countries significantly reduced their emissions during the Kyoto commitment period, other countries increased their emissions so much that the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.<ref name="GapReport" />

'''Emissions'''

GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7&nbsp;billion tonnes (billion&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000,000,000) of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. CO<sub>2</sub> was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by [[methane]] (26%) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O) (11%).

The [[energy sector]] was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8&nbsp;tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
* The Africa region's [[aggregate data|aggregate]] emissions were 1.6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4&nbsp;tonnes.
* The Asia and Pacific region's aggregate emissions were 7.9&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6&nbsp;tonnes.
* The Latin America and [[Caribbean]] region's aggregate emissions were 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6&nbsp;tonnes.
* The "other" region includes [[Albania]], Armenia, [[Azerbaijan]], Georgia, Malta, [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]], and [[North Macedonia]]. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1&nbsp;tonnes.

Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tonnes.

''Trends''

In several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009).<ref>{{cite web|title=Industrialised countries will collectively meet 2010 Kyoto target |author=PBL |date=16 October 2009 |publisher=Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) website |url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/COP13Bali/moreinfo/Industrialised-countries-will-collectively-meet-2010-Kyoto-target.html |accessdate=3 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409000327/http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/COP13Bali/moreinfo/Industrialised-countries-will-collectively-meet-2010-Kyoto-target.html |archivedate=9 April 2010 }}</ref> For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990–2005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.

Without the US participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP.  This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1–1.1%.  Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without the US participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2–2%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.

This has particularly centered on the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability of the developing world to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world. Another criticism of the Kyoto Protocol and other international conventions, is the right of indigenous peoples right to participate. Quoted here from The Declaration of the [[International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change|First International Forum of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change]], it says "Despite the recognition of our role in preventing global warming, when it comes time to sign international conventions like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, once again, our right to participate in national and international discussions that directly affect or Peoples and territories is denied."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Indigenous peoples and environmental issues : an encyclopedia|last=1950-|first=Johansen, Bruce E.

As mentioned earlier, a number of Annex I Parties have implemented emissions trading schemes (ETSs) as part of efforts to meet their Kyoto commitments. General commentaries on emissions trading are contained in [[emissions trading]] and [[carbon emission trading]]. Individual articles on the ETSs contain commentaries on these schemes (see [[Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading]] for a list of ETSs).

One of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments.<ref name="toth flexibility mechanisms"/> Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources,<ref>

=== Philosophy ===
As the Kyoto Protocol seeks to reduce environmental pollutants while at the same time altering the freedoms of some citizens.

As discussed by [[Milton Friedman]], one can achieve both economic and political freedom through capitalism; nonetheless, it is never guaranteed that one is going to have equality of wealth of those on top of the "food chain" of this capitalistic world. All these alterations come to what the leaders of the citizens choose to impose in means of improving ones lifestyle. In the case of the Kyoto Protocol, it seeks to impose regulations that will reduce production of pollutants towards the  environment. Furthermore, seeking to compromise the freedoms of both private and public citizens. In one side it imposes bigger regulations towards companies and reducing their profits as they need to fulfil such regulations with, which are oftentimes more expensive, alternatives for production. On the other hand, it seeks to reduce the emissions that cause the rapid environmental change called [[climate change]].

The conditions of the Kyoto Protocol consist of mandatory targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the world's leading economies. As provided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, "These targets range from −8 per cent to +10 per cent of the countries' individual 1990 emissions levels with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5 per cent below existing 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/2879.php|title=A Summary of the Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-03-03}}</ref> 

China, India, Indonesia and Brazil weren't required to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The remaining signatory countries weren't obliged to implement a common framework nor specific measures, but to reach an emission reduction target for which they can benefit of a [[secondary market]] for carbon credits multilaterally exchanged from each other.<ref name="OCLC 1027999644" /> The [[Emissions-trading]] Scheme (ETS) allowed countries to host polluting industries and to buy from other countries the property of their environmental merits and virtuous patterns.<ref name="OCLC 1027999644">{{cite book | author =Geoffrey Wells| author2 = Janet Ratnanunga | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V9K5XphOdukC&pg=PA89 | title = Sustainable Business: Theory and Practice of Business Under Sustainability Principles | page = 89 | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | date = January 1, 2013 | isbn = 9781781001868 | oclc =  1027999644 | chapter = 5 - Carbon accounting and carbon auditing for business}}</ref>

The Kyoto Protcol's goals are challenged, however, by climate change deniers, who condemn strong scientific evidence of the human impact on climate change. One prominent scholar opines that these climate change deniers "arguably" breach Rousseau's notion of the social contract, which is an implicit agreement among the members of a society to coordinate efforts in the name of overall social benefit. The climate change denial movement hinders efforts at coming to agreements as a collective global society on climate change.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFcdDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT93 |title=Remaking the Urban Social Contract: Health, Energy, and the Environment|last=Pagano|first=Michael A.|date=2016-08-30|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252099137|language=en}}</ref>

==Conference of the Parties==
{{further|United Nations Climate Change conference}}
The official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Climate Change conference (UNFCCC). It is held every year; it serves as the formal meeting of UNFCCC. Parties to the Convention may participate in Protocol-related meetings either as parties to the Protocol or as observers.

The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin. The first Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with COP 11. The 2013 conference was held in [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Warsaw]]. Later COPs were held in Lima, Peru in 2014 and in Paris, France in 2015. The 2015 event, COP 21, aimed to hold the global average rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius.<ref>{{Cite web|title=21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and 11th meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP 21/CMP 11) {{!}} PreventionWeb.net|url=https://www.preventionweb.net/events/view/30512?id=30512|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.preventionweb.net}}</ref> COP 22 was planned for Marrakesh, Morocco and COP 23 for Bonn, Germany.

==Amendment and successor==
{{Main|Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions}}

In the non-binding "[[G8+5|Washington Declaration]]" agreed on 16 February 2007, heads of governments from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]] and [[South Africa]] agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and [[developing country|developing countries]], and initially hoped that it would be in place by 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6364663.stm|title=Politicians sign new climate pact|publisher=BBC |date=16 February 2007|accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,2014683,00.html|title=Global leaders reach climate change agreement|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=16 February 2007|accessdate=28 May 2007}}</ref>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.<ref>{{cite news
