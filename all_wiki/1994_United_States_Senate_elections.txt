The '''1994 United States Senate elections''' were elections held November 8, 1994, in which the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was able to take control of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. In a midterm election, the opposition Republicans held the traditional advantage. Congressional Republicans campaigned against the early presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], including his unsuccessful [[1993 Clinton health care plan|health care plan]].{{citation needed | date=March 2013}}
The Republicans successfully defended all of their seats and won eight from the Democrats, defeating incumbent senators [[Harris Wofford]] ([[1994 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]) and [[Jim Sasser]] ([[1994 United States Senate election in Tennessee|Tennessee]]), in addition to picking up six open seats in [[1994 United States Senate election in Arizona|Arizona]], [[1994 United States Senate election in Maine|Maine]], [[1994 United States Senate election in Michigan|Michigan]], [[1994 United States Senate election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[1994 United States Senate special election in Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], and [[1994 United States Senate election in Tennessee|Tennessee]]. Notably, since Sasser's defeat coincided with a Republican victory in the special election to replace [[Al Gore]], Tennessee's Senate delegation switched from entirely Democratic to entirely Republican in a single election.

This election marked the first time Republicans controlled the Senate since [[1986 United States Senate elections|January 1987]], and coincided with the first [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|change of control in the House of Representatives]] since [[1954 United States House of Representatives elections|January 1955]] and a Republican [[1994 United States gubernatorial elections|net gain of ten governorships]]. Collectively, these Republican gains are known as the [[Republican Revolution]]. Minority leader [[Bob Dole|Robert J. Dole]] became [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]], while on the Democratic side, [[Tom Daschle]] became Minority Leader after the retirement of the previous Democratic leader, [[George J. Mitchell]].  This was also the first time since [[1980 United States Senate elections|1980]] that Republicans made net gains in the Senate, but the last time until [[2018 United States elections|2018]] the Republicans also made gains among class 1 senators.

Initially, the balance was 52–48 in favor of the Republicans, but after the power change, Democrats [[Richard Shelby]] and [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] switched parties, bringing the balance to 54–46. Democrat [[Ron Wyden]] won a [[1996 United States Senate special election in Oregon|1996 special election]] to replace Republican [[Bob Packwood]], leaving the balance at 53–47 before the next [[1996 United States Senate elections|election cycle]]. As of 2020, this is the last election cycle in which Republicans won Senate elections in [[1994 United States Senate election in Delaware|Delaware]], [[1994 United States Senate election in Michigan|Michigan]], and [[1994 United States Senate election in Washington|Washington]].

After one term in the House representing [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]] counties, Huffington spent $8 million by the end of August and a total of $28 million during the entire campaign. He became wealthy off oil and gas. The race saw personal attacks on Huffington's wife, [[Arianna Huffington]], who was very involved in the race (the media dubbed her the "Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing," according to ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'').

Huffington was called a hypocrite for supporting [[Proposition 187]] and then breaking the law for employing illegal aliens, a story which came out in the race's final days.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jr |first=B. DRUMMOND AYRES |date=October 27, 1994 |title=THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CALIFORNIA; Huffington Admits Hiring Illegal Alien |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/us/the-1994-campaign-california-huffington-admits-hiring-illegal-alien.html |access-date=December 20, 2017 |via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> A grand total of $44 million was spent in the election. At the time, it was the most expensive campaign in a non-presidential election in American history. [[Chris Cillizza]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' named the election one of the nastiest senate elections in modern history.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Fix - The 10 nastiest Senate races |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/the-10-nastiest-senate-races.html?wprss=thefix |access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>

On election day it was a very close race, but Feinstein won Los Angeles County, which may have pulled her ahead. Her sizable win in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area may also be credited to her slim statewide victory.

[[Ted Kennedy]] usually coasted to re-election, but in this election he faced an unusually tough challenge from Republican businessman [[Mitt Romney]]. Though the final result was a 17-point Kennedy victory, it marked the first time since his initial election in 1962 that Kennedy received less than 60% of the vote.

Romney defeated his closest competitor, [[John Lakian]], to win the Republican primary with over 80% of the vote. He campaigned as a political moderate and Washington outsider, and posed the greatest challenge ever made against Kennedy for the Senate seat since he first took office in 1962. Democratic congressmen across the country were struggling to maintain their seats, and Kennedy in particular was damaged by character concerns and an ongoing divorce controversy. The contest became very close.

Kennedy launched ads criticizing Romney's tenure as the leader of the company known as [[Bain Capital]], accusing him of treating workers unfairly and taking away jobs, while also criticizing what were widely considered to be Romney's shifting political views. Romney also performed inadequately in the debates between the two candidates, and made a number of poorly received statements that reduced his standing in the polls.

In the closest Senate election of his career since after 1962, Kennedy won by a reasonably comfortable margin, despite a series of losses for Democrats around the country.

Romney was initially behind businessman [[John Lakian]] in the battle to win the [[Massachusetts Republican Party]]'s nomination for the U.S. Senate.<ref name="hersh-126">Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 124, 126–127.</ref> However, after using his personal wealth to advertise heavily on television, he gained overwhelming support at the state party convention<!-- when was the convention? -->.<ref name="hersh-126" />

Romney then defeated Lakian easily in the September 1994 Republican Party primary with over 80&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 21, 1994 |title=Romney will oppose Sen.

In the general election, Kennedy faced the first serious re-election challenger of his career in the younger, telegenic, and very well-funded Romney.<ref name="bg-series-5">{{Cite news |last=Kahn, Joseph P. |date=February 19, 2009 |title=Chapter 5: Trials & Redemptions: An untidy private life, then a turn to stability |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/19/chapter_5_trials__redemption/ |access-date=April 11, 2009}}</ref> Romney ran as a successful entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues.<ref name="bg-series-5" />

Kennedy was more vulnerable than usual in 1994, in part because of the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole and also because this was Kennedy's first election since the [[William Kennedy Smith#Sexual assault accusations|William Kennedy Smith trial]] in Florida, in which Kennedy had taken some public relations hits regarding his character.<ref name="bg-series-5" /> Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of the [[Chappaquiddick incident]] and his first wife [[Joan Bennett Kennedy]] seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement.<ref name="bg-series-5" />

His challenger is Republican businessman Mitt Romney."</ref>

Religion became an issue for a while, after Kennedy's campaign said it was fair to ask Romney about his [[LDS Church]]'s past policy of not allowing blacks into the priesthood.<ref name="bgseries4" /> Romney accused Kennedy of having violated senator [[John F. Kennedy]]'s famous September 1960 pledge not to allow his own Catholic doctrine to inform policy, made during his ultimately victorious presidential campaign.<ref name="bgseries4" /> George Romney forcefully interjected during his son's press conference, "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture."<ref name="bgseries4" />

After Romney touted his business credentials and his record at creating jobs within his company, Kennedy ran campaign ads showing an Indiana company, [[Ampad]], bought out by Romney's firm, [[Bain Capital]]. They showed interviews with its union workers who had been fired and who criticized Romney for the loss of their jobs, with one saying, "I don't think Romney is creating jobs because he took every one of them away."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hall |first=Mike |date=May 31, 2007 |title=Romney's 'Business Experience': Firing Workers, Hiring Them Back at Lower Wages |work=AFL/CIO |publisher=AFL/CIO Blog |url=http://blog.aflcio.org/2007/05/31/romneys-business-experience-firing-workers-hiring-them-back-at-lower-wages/ |url-status=dead |access-date=June 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612051308/http://blog.aflcio.org/2007/05/31/romneys-business-experience-firing-workers-hiring-them-back-at-lower-wages/ |archive-date=June 12, 2007}}</ref> Romney claimed that 10,000 jobs were created because of his work at Bain, but private detectives hired by Kennedy found a factory bought by Bain Capital that had suffered a 350-worker strike after Bain had cut worker pay and benefits.<ref name="Barone772">{{Cite book |last1=Barone |first1=Michael |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/772 |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last2=Grant Ujifusa |work=National Journal |year=1999 |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |location=Washington, DC |page=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/772 772]}}</ref> Kennedy's charges were effective, as more voters decided that Romney was interested in profits more than people.<ref name="bgseries4" />

Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, he was forced to take out a [[second mortgage]] on his Virginia home.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hersh |first=Burton |url=https://archive.org/details/shadowpresidentt00hers |title=The Shadow President: Ted Kennedy in Opposition |publisher=Steerforth Press |year=1997 |isbn=1-883642-30-2 |url-access=registration}} pp. 137–139.</ref>
Romney spent over $7&nbsp;million of his own money, with Kennedy spending more than $10&nbsp;million from his campaign fund, mostly in the last weeks of the campaign (this was the second-most expensive race of the 1994 election cycle, after the [[Dianne Feinstein]]–[[Michael Huffington]] Senate race in [[California]]).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Jerry |date=April 24, 2000 |title=Record Fund raising |work=CNSNews |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Try=No&Page=\Politics\archive\200004\POL20000424d.html |url-status=dead |access-date=April 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212140325/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPolitics.asp?Try=No&Page=%5CPolitics%5Carchive%5C200004%5CPOL20000424d.html |archive-date=December 12, 2007 }} According to figures in ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]] 1996'', which relies on official campaign finance reports.</ref> Kennedy's new wife [[Victoria Reggie Kennedy|Vicki Reggie Kennedy]] proved to be a strong asset in campaigning.<ref name=NYT1994-bank-family/>

By early October, Kennedy was ahead by 49 to 44 percent in a poll by ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.<ref name="bgseries4" /> In their first televised debate, held at [[Faneuil Hall]] on October 25, Kennedy came out charging with his aging but still booming voice; regarding the [[Ampad]] deal, he said to Romney, "I don't know why you wouldn't meet with the strikers with that flimflam deal of yours out there in Indiana."<ref name="bgseries4" /> Romney charged that Kennedy had benefited from a real-estate deal that had been done on a no-bid basis, but Kennedy responded with a rehearsed line: "Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service of this country."<ref name="bgseries4" /> Each candidate was asked to discuss one of their own failings. In a dramatic moment, Kennedy indirectly referred to his personal problems and acknowledged that he was "painfully aware" that on such occasions he had let his supporters down. By contrast, Romney mentioned work for several local charities he was engaged with on a near daily basis. When the moderator reminded him of the question, Romney responded "I guess what I regret is that I'm not able to provide even more help for those less fortunate than myself.... I wish I could do even more." Kennedy won this key debate as he reconnected with his traditional bases of support:<ref name="bg-series-5" /> two polls of voters conducted afterwards both showed Kennedy as the victor in the debate.<ref name="nyt-debates">{{Cite news |last=Adam Clymer |author-link=Adam Clymer |date=October 28, 1994 |title=Kennedy and Romney Clash In Second and Final Debate |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/us/the-1994-campaign-massachusetts.html}}</ref> One post-debate October general election poll showed Kennedy leading 50 percent to 32,<ref name="Barone772" /> and another by 56 to 36 percent.<ref name="bgseries4" /> A second debate, held two days later at [[Holyoke Community College]], focused more on policy details and lacked the intensity of the first one; Romney failed to gain any traction from it.<ref name="nyt-debates" />

Veteran Democratic incumbent [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] easily defeated his Republican opponent, businesswoman [[Bernadette Castro]].

1994 was significant for the [[Republican Revolution]], mostly as a referendum against President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillarycare|his health care plan]], and was seen as a tough year for Democratic incumbents. Moynihan, however, was New York State's most popular politician at the time, and ran ahead of all other Democrats competing statewide.<ref name="nyt110994">{{Cite news |last=Finder, Alan |date=November 9, 1994 |title=Defying Anti-Incumbent Mood, Moynihan Wins Easily |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/nyregion/1994-elections-new-york-state-senate-defying-anti-incumbent-mood-moynihan-wins.html}}</ref>

Republican Castro was running for office for the first time and had trouble raising funds due to being seen as unlikely to win; at times during the race she trailed by up to 30 percentage points.<ref name="nyt110994" /> She portrayed herself as a fiscally conservative, socially moderate Republican in the mold of Governor of New Jersey [[Christie Todd Whitman]], and attempted to portray Moynihan as excessively liberal and prone to government spending.<ref name="nyt110994" /> But Moynihan repeated his past strong performance among upstate voters, in addition to the usual Democratic strongholds in New York City.<ref name="nyt110994" />

Democrat [[Harris Wofford]] was appointed to the Senate when three-term Republican [[H. John Heinz III]] died in a 1991 plane crash. He won a special election to hold that seat later that year. In his tough re-election against Republican Congressman [[Rick Santorum]], the pro-choice Wofford lost the endorsement of pro-life Democratic Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey]]. This contributed to his loss to Santorum by two percentage points.

Wofford's campaign was hurt from the outset by his strong connection with President [[Bill Clinton]]'s failed healthcare reform proposals; Wofford had made working toward universal healthcare a crucial issue in his prior campaign and was one of the executive's strongest allies on the issue. After this failure, however, the senator ran a relatively passive campaign. He instead attempted to focus attention on his challenger, an arch-conservative who did not attempt to moderate his views after the primary election. The polarizing Santorum took strong positions against abortion, gay rights, and affirmative action, and he even clashed with some of the traditional fixtures of the state's moderate Republican establishment. Early in the campaign and with little statewide name recognition, Santorum made a critical error by attacking [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and Wofford appeared to be in relatively safe position. However, Santorum ran an effective grassroots campaign and specifically targeted many union Democrats who had reservations about the liberal social values advocated by many of their party's leaders.[https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=santorum&f=false Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004]

In the closing weeks of the campaign, Santorum was greatly helped by strong Republican enthusiasm because of anger over Clinton's failed initiatives. He solidified his status by running a series of positive ads that attempted to define his character strengths and to contrast with Wofford's negative commercials. Santorum eventually received a close victory by performing well (and nearly winning) his home in the suburban [[Pittsburgh]] region and through particularly low turnout in Democratic strongholds, such as [[Philadelphia]], [[Scranton]], and Pittsburgh cities.[https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=1998+ridge+itkin&source=bl&ots=AK6b-Ut25d&sig=ln8QefiZodyBTkRiIzEYxTt21Ro&hl=en&ei=cPjETOLTOoOglAenj8EH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=santorum&f=false Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004]

One of the biggest upsets of the night was the defeat of three-term Democrat [[Jim Sasser]]. Sasser had been the influential Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Budget Committee]] and was among the leading candidates to replace Mitchell as Democratic [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Floor Leader]]. Sasser, however, would be defeated by prominent [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] heart surgeon [[Bill Frist]] by 14 points.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Campaigns - Race |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3451 |access-date=December 20, 2017 |website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

There were two unforeseen events that affected the campaign. One was the large scale of discontent that the American people seemed to have toward the first two years of the Clinton administration, especially the proposal for a national healthcare system largely put together and advocated by Clinton's wife, [[Hillary Clinton]]. The other was the somewhat unexpected nomination of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] [[heart transplant]] surgeon Bill Frist for the seat by the Republicans.

Frist, who had never voted until he was 36, was a political unknown and a total novice at campaigning, but was from one of Nashville's most prominent and wealthiest medical families, which gave him some name recognition, as well as adequate enough resources to match the campaign war chest built up by the three-term incumbent, a challenge most "insurgent" candidates find to be impossible. A further factor working to Frist's advantage was a simultaneous Republican campaign by [[actor]] and attorney [[Fred Thompson]] for the other Tennessee Senate seat, which was open due to [[Al Gore]] resigning to become [[Vice President of the United States]]. Another factor in Frist's favor was that Sasser was never seen as possessing much charisma of his own. During the campaign Nashville radio stations were derisive towards Sasser to the point of stating that he could only win "a Kermit The Frog lookalike contest." In one of the largest [[Upset (competition)|upset]]s in a night of political upsets in the [[1994 United States elections|November 1994 U.S. general elections]], Frist defeated the incumbent Sasser by approximately 14 percentage points.

Democrat [[Chuck Robb]] received over 70% of the vote when first elected in [[1988 United States Senate election in Virginia|1988]], but struggled to win re-election. Furor over Robb's alleged affair with model [[Tai Collins]] provided plenty of momentum for the Republican [[Iran-Contra]] figure [[Oliver North]]. A factor to Robb's advantage was the independent candidacy of attorney [[J. Marshall Coleman]]. North likely lost votes to Coleman especially when Virginia's other senator, Republican [[John Warner]], endorsed Coleman over North. Robb received 46% of the vote to North's 43% with Coleman garnering 11%.

Oliver North was a very controversial figure as he was involved in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], a scandal during [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidency. Marshall Coleman attempted to seize the middle ground between Robb and North. Republican senator [[John Warner]] of Virginia endorsed [[Marshall Coleman]]. On the eve of the election, former first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] told a reporter that North had lied to her husband when discussing Iran-Contra with the former president, effectively eviscerating him. North's candidacy was documented in the 1996 film ''[[A Perfect Candidate]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 19, 1996 |title=A Perfect Candidate |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117320/ |access-date=December 20, 2017 |via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>

In his failed bid to unseat Robb, North raised $20.3 million in a single year through nationwide direct mail solicitations, telemarketing, fundraising events, and contributions from major donors. About $16 million of that amount was from [[direct mail]] alone. This was the biggest accumulation of direct mail funds for a statewide campaign to that date, and it made North the top direct mail political fundraiser in the country in 1994.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ollie, Inc.: how Oliver North raised over $20 million in a losing U.S. Senate race |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v16/ai_17195256 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v16/ai_17195256 |archive-date=October 13, 2007}}</ref>

[[Douglas Wilder]], the first black Governor of Virginia, who served from 1990-1994, originally entered the Senate race as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] before dropping out.

Democratic incumbent [[Robert Byrd]], first elected in 1958, easily defeated his Republican opponent State Committee Finance Chairman [[Stanley L. Klos]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Campaigns - WV US Senate Race - Nov 08, 1994 |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3456 |access-date=December 20, 2017 |website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

Klos campaigned as a ''"sacrificial lamb"'' against Robert C. Byrd participating in the Republican U.S. Senatorial Committee's strategy to re-capture a majority in the United States Senate in 1994. Byrd spent $1,550,354 to Klos' $267,165.<ref>[http://election.nationaljournal.com/2006/senate/wv.htm US Senate 1994] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028185551/http://election.nationaljournal.com/2006/senate/wv.htm | date=October 28, 2010 }} Byrd (D) versus Klos (R)</ref> Additionally the Democratic Party invested over $1 million in that state's campaign to the Republican Party's $15,000. The GOP captured a majority in the U.S. Senate. The highlights of the campaign included the hiring of an actor to play [[Robert C. Byrd]] who toured in staged Statewide Debates when the incumbent refused Klos's invitation for a series of formal senate debates. The campaign also organized successful demonstrations against the Bill and [[Hillary Clinton]] National Health Care Bus as it traveled through West Virginia in the summer of 1994. Senator Byrd, while the bill was being debated on the Senate floor rose suggesting the brakes be put on approving [[National Health Care]] measure while the bus was completing its tour in WV. To Klos's credit, the campaign did not implement the "''Death by a Thousand Cuts''" plan proposed by strategists which was later acknowledged in speeches given and letters written by U.S. senator Byrd.<ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5R_T37ucvds/UYB5yWm1OUI/AAAAAAAAFYw/GN6ib79jLdo/s640/byrd.jpg Robert C.
