The events surrounding the [[Government formation|formation]] of the United Kingdom's government in 2010 took place between 7 May and 12 May 2010, following [[2010 United Kingdom general election|the 2010 general election]], which failed to produce an overall majority for any of the country's two main political parties. The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first [[hung parliament]] in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first [[coalition government]] since the [[World War I|Second World War]].

The governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration led by [[Gordon Brown]] was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[David Cameron]] won the largest number of seats in the [[List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election|new Parliament]], but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] led by [[Nick Clegg]], aimed at forming a coalition government.

As leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The [[Scottish National Party]] signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that [[Gordon Brown]]'s continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.

Although Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition government]] led by [[David Cameron]] took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been "approved overwhelmingly" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] was appointed as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

==Initial statements and negotiations==

[[File:David Cameron St Stephen's Club 2 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] seen leaving [[St Stephen's Club]] on the afternoon of 7 May 2010, the day his party began negotiations with the Liberal Democrats to form a government.]]

With no single party having achieved an overall majority, the 2010 general election resulted in the first hung parliament since [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8667071.stm|title= Election 2010: First hung parliament in UK for decades|work= BBC News|date= 7 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011}}</ref> When it became clear that no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] called on Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] to act "in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: "It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8667121.stm |title=Election 2010: Clegg 'disappointed' at Lib Dem results |work=BBC News |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314132803/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8667121.stm |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}</ref> Brown said he intended to play his part in securing "a stable, strong and principled government", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: "What we have seen are no ordinary election results."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8666569.stm |title=Election 2010: Brown 'would talk' to Cameron and Clegg |work=BBC News |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system."<ref name="BBCCameron07052010">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8667938.stm |title=Election: Cameron makes offer to Lib Dems on government |work=BBC News |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313133152/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8667938.stm |archivedate=13 March 2012  }}</ref>

Under the constitutional rules governing protocol in the event of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the [[State Opening of Parliament]], which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary [[Gus O'Donnell|Sir Gus O'Donnell]] had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/hung-parliament-david-cameron-momentum|title= Hung parliament: David Cameron has momentum, but Brown still has power|work= The Guardian|first= Alan|last= Travis|date= 7 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115708/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/hung-parliament-david-cameron-momentum|archivedate= 14 December 2013}}</ref>

Cameron's willingness to hold talks with the Liberal Democrats was interpreted by [[BBC News]] political editor [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] as hinting at the possibility that Liberal Democrat MPs could serve as part of a Cabinet.<ref name="BBCCameron07052010"/> On the afternoon of 7 May, Cameron and Clegg spoke by telephone and had what the BBC reported as a "very constructive" conversation. By that evening exploratory talks between teams of senior representatives from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives had begun. The Liberal Democrats team consisted of [[Chris Huhne]], [[Danny Alexander]], [[Andrew Stunell]] and [[David Laws]], while [[George Osborne]], [[William Hague]], [[Oliver Letwin]] and [[Edward Llewellyn, Baron Llewellyn of Steep|Ed Llewellyn]] made up the Conservative team.<ref name="BBCCameron07052010"/>

==Further talks==

By the morning of Saturday 8 May, talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were fully underway. A 70-minute meeting at [[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]] in Westminster was described by both parties as being "constructive and amicable", and another meeting was scheduled for the following day. At a private meeting that evening, Cameron and Clegg held the first of a series of talks to discuss the negotiations. Members of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party had earlier met at [[Transport House|Local Government House]] to discuss the coalition talks.<ref name=BBCElection08052010>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8669508.stm |title=Lib Dem leadership 'endorses' Clegg's Tory talks |work=BBC News |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511155626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8669508.stm |archivedate=11 May 2010  }}</ref><ref name=Telegraph08052010>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7696497/General-Election-2010-protests-at-Lib-Dem-meeting-over-proportional-representation.html|title= General Election 2010: protests at Lib Dem meeting over proportional representation|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 8 May 2010|accessdate= 19 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130216053130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7696497/General-Election-2010-protests-at-Lib-Dem-meeting-over-proportional-representation.html|archivedate= 16 February 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Nick Clegg by the 2009 budget cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] held face-to-face talks with his Conservative counterpart.]]

One of the chief issues that the Liberal Democrats wished to address in any coalition agreement was that of electoral reform, and as Party members debated the negotiations, a 1,000 strong crowd of protesters from the pressure group [[38 Degrees]] gathered outside. Amid chants of "Fair votes now" and "We want to speak to Nick",<ref name=Telegraph08052010/> Clegg briefly left the meeting to accept a petition and told the protesters, "Reforming politics is one of the reasons I went into politics." After the meeting, a Liberal Democrats negotiator, [[David Laws]], said members had "endorsed in full" the strategy outlined by Clegg that the Conservatives should have first choice in negotiations on forming a government. Clegg also met with the party's federal executive, which also endorsed Clegg's decision.<ref name=BBCElection08052010/><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/vote_2010/clegg+pledges+reform+as+protest+calls+for+aposfair+votesapos/3640987|title= No Tory/Lib Dem deal before Monday|publisher= Channel 4 Television|work= Channel 4 News|date= 8 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510230016/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/vote_2010/clegg+pledges+reform+as+protest+calls+for+aposfair+votesapos/3640987|archivedate= 10 May 2010}}</ref>

8 May 2010 was the 65th anniversary of [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]&nbsp;–&nbsp;which marked the victory of the Allied Forces over Nazi Germany and the end of the Second World War in Europe&nbsp;–&nbsp;and celebrations were held to mark the occasion. The leaders of all three parties attended a ceremony at the [[Cenotaph]] in Whitehall.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8669508.stm|title= Lib Dem leadership 'endorses' Clegg's Tory talks|work= BBC News|date= 8 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511155626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8669508.stm|archivedate= 11 May 2010}}</ref> After the ceremony, Brown flew to his family home in Scotland, but remained ready to negotiate with the Liberal Democrats if no deal with the Conservatives was reached. Labour denied reports of a heated telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, and support among Brown's Cabinet colleagues remained strong, but one backbencher, [[John Mann, Baron Mann|John Mann]], urged Brown to step aside as Labour leader before the party conference in September, arguing that Brown's continued leadership "rules out the credibility of a Lib/Lab pact".<ref name=BBCElection08052010/>

==Negotiations continue==
On Sunday 9 May, senior negotiators from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives embarked on six hours of talks at the [[Cabinet Office]], which were described as "very positive and productive". [[William Hague]] emerged from the discussions to say, "The issues that we have covered have included political reform, economic issues and reduction of the deficit, banking reform, civil liberties, environmental issues. So, we've had good discussions about all of those areas. We are agreed that a central part of any agreement that we make will be economic stability and the reduction of the budget deficit, but each negotiating team is now going to report to our party leaders."<ref name=BBC09052010>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8670559.stm |title=Tories and Lib Dems 'positive' after talks |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref>

As the negotiations were taking place, [[Gordon Brown]] returned to Downing Street and held a meeting with [[Nick Clegg]] at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] for talks. A Downing Street spokesman later confirmed the talks, together with the previous evening's telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, which was described as "an amicable discussion."<ref name=BBC09052010/> However, [[Paddy Ashdown]] – a previous Liberal Democrat leader – offered a different view of the Brown-Clegg conference call, telling the BBC it "was a diatribe, a rant, and that [[Gordon Brown]] was threatening in his approach to [[Nick Clegg]]."<ref name="Observer-2013-05-12"/> Following the success of the talks between their two parties, Clegg and Cameron held a second round of face-to-face discussions at Westminster that evening, lasting 45 minutes.<ref name=BBC09052010/>

While negotiations continued to form the next administration, the business of government continued with the previous incumbents.<ref name=BBC09052010/>{{efn|This included ministers who no longer held seats in Parliament; their government roles continued until a new administration could be formed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Joanna|last=Gosling|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8673509.stm |title=What role for ministers? |work=BBC News |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>}} In this respect [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Alistair Darling]] flew to [[Brussels]] to attend a meeting of European finance ministers. In London, Brown held meetings with [[Secretary of State for Business|Business Secretary]] [[Peter Mandelson]], his deputy leader [[Harriet Harman]], [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State for Energy]] [[Ed Miliband]] and [[Tony Blair]]'s former special adviser [[Alastair Campbell]]. Brown also sent an email to party activists in which he thanked them for their work during the election campaign. It concluded "The past few days have seen us enter a political landscape not considered possible a few short weeks ago - with the outcome of the election leading to no single party able to form a majority government. My duty as prime minister has been to seek to resolve this situation." Several senior Labour backbenchers, including MP [[George Howarth]] called on Brown to step down.<ref name=BBC09052010/>

==Labour enters the picture==
[[File:Gordon Brown Davos 2008 crop.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Labour leader [[Gordon Brown]] was seen as a major stumbling block to forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.]]

Monday 10 May saw another day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, [[Nick Clegg]] was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by [[David Cameron]]'s team. They also wished him to continue negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but that one of the barriers to this was the continued presence of [[Gordon Brown]] as Prime Minister.<ref name=BBC10052010>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8672859.stm |title=Gordon Brown 'stepping down as Labour leader' |work=BBC News |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513074419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8672859.stm |archivedate=13 May 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/10/labour-liberal-democrats-conservative-coalition|title= Labour prepares to pounce if Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition talks fail|work= The Guardian|first= Patrick|last= Wintour|date= 10 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140204043237/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/10/labour-liberal-democrats-conservative-coalition|archivedate= 4 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7709494/Liberal-Democrats-pave-way-for-Labour-coalition-as-recriminations-grow.html|title= Liberal Democrats pave way for Labour coalition as recriminations grow|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|first= Andrew|last= Porter|date= 10 May 2010|accessdate= 16 December 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100602230721/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7709494/Liberal-Democrats-pave-way-for-Labour-coalition-as-recriminations-grow.html|archivedate= 2 June 2010}}</ref> At 5:00&nbsp;pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September.

He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with Labour's negotiating team consisting of [[Peter Mandelson]], [[Harriet Harman]], [[Andrew Adonis, Baron Adonis|Andrew Adonis]], [[Ed Miliband]] and [[Ed Balls]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7708845/General-Election-2010-as-it-happened-10-May.html|title=General Election 2010 as it happened: 10 May|website=The Telegraph|last1=Moore|first1=Matthew|last2=Hutchison|first2=Peter|last3=Roberts|first3=Laura|last4=Hough|first4=Andrew|last5=Collins|first5=Nick|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=26 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514084642/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7708845/General-Election-2010-as-it-happened-10-May.html|archivedate=14 May 2010|url-status=live|quote=Reports have suggested that Labour's negotiating team has been meeting the Lib Dems {{sic|comprises |hide=y|of}} Lord Mandelson, Harriet Harman, Lord Adonis, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.}}</ref> However, many in Labour felt that a coalition with the Liberal Democrats was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306.

With Labour now attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (AV) system. In response Labour said that it would introduce AV then hold a public referendum to approve it. In a statement outlining his decision to negotiate with Labour, Clegg said that although his party had made progress with the Conservatives, they had not "reached a comprehensive partnership agreement for a full Parliament" and negotiating with Labour was the "responsible thing to do".<ref name=BBC10052010/>

The possibility of some SNP involvement in a Labour-led government materialised when [[Angus Robertson]], the SNP's leader in the House of Commons suggested its MPs would be willing to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and MPs from other smaller parties to form a rainbow coalition.<ref name="Press-and-Journal-2010-05-10"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Watt |first=Holly |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7707907/Rainbow-coalition-would-have-to-prop-up-the-coalition-of-losers.html |title=Rainbow coalition would have to prop up the 'coalition of losers' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=24 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424130142/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7707907/Rainbow-coalition-would-have-to-prop-up-the-coalition-of-losers.html |archivedate=24 April 2012  }}</ref> It was reported on 10 May that a meeting to discuss this scenario was held between Robertson, the SNP Chief Whip [[Stewart Hosie]] and Cabinet Office officials the previous evening.<ref name="Press-and-Journal-2010-05-10">{{cite news|last=Perry |first=David |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1729150 |title=Rainbow alliance 'could be solution' |publisher=Aberdeen Journals |newspaper=Aberdeen Press and Journal |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> However, Labour's [[Douglas Alexander]] said he could not foresee a situation in which Labour could enter into government with the SNP because the two parties had "fundamental differences",<ref name="BBC-Alexander-2010-05-11"/> and he made it clear that no senior Labour officials had been approached by anyone from the SNP.<ref name="BBC-Alexander-2010-05-11">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/scotland/8674214.stm |title=Labour MP Douglas Alexander rules out deal with SNP |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>

Cameron later told a BBC documentary that he had not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, ''Five Days That Changed Britain'', broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised.
