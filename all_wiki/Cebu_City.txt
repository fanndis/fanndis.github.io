==Etymology==
The name "Cebu" came from the old [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] word ''sibu'' or ''sibo'' ("trade"), a shortened form of ''sinibuayng hingpit'' ("the place for trading"). It was originally applied to the harbors of the town of Sugbu, the ancient name for Cebu City. Sugbu or Sugbo, in turn, was derived from the Old Cebuano term for "[[scorched earth]]" or "great fire".<ref name="macachor">{{Cite journal |last=Macachor |first=Celestino C. |year=2011 |title=Searching for Kali in the Indigenous Chronicles of Jovito Abellana |url=http://cebueskrima.s5.com/custom3.html |url-status=dead |journal=Rapid Journal |volume=10 |issue=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703210211/http://cebueskrima.s5.com/custom3.html |archive-date=2012-07-03}}</ref><ref name="marivir">{{Cite book |title=Retracing Our Roots – A Journey into Cebu's Pre-Colonial Past |last=Montebon |first=Marivir |page=15}}</ref>

{{See also|Lapu-Lapu|Rajahnate of Cebu}}

===Founding===
{{Main|Singhapala}}
Before the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|arrival of the Spaniards]], Cebu city was part of the island-[[rajahnate]] and trade center of Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya (literally "[the islands] which belong to Daya"), now better known as the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]]. It was founded by a prince of the Hindu [[Chola dynasty]] of [[Sumatra]], the half-Malay and half-Tamil, Sri Lumay. The name Sugbo (shortened form of ''Kang Sri Lumaying Sugbo'', literally "that of Sri Lumay's great fire") refers to Sri Lumay's [[scorched earth tactics]] against Muslim Pirates or [[Moro Pirates|Moro raiders]] (''Magalos'').<ref name="macachor" /><ref name="marivir" />

He was welcomed by [[Rajah Humabon]] (also known as Sri Humabon or Rajah Humabara), the grandson of Sri Lumay, together with his wife and about 700 native islanders. Magellan, however, was killed in the [[Battle of Mactan]], and the remaining members of his expedition left Cebu soon after several of them were poisoned by Humabon, who was fearful of foreign occupation. The last ruler of Sugbo, prior to Spanish colonization, was Rajah Humabon's nephew, [[Rajah Tupas]] (d. 1565).<ref name="macachor" /><ref name="marivir" />

On February 13, 1565, Spanish conquistadors led by [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] together with Augustinian friars whose prior was [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], arrived in Samar, taking possession of the island thereafter. They Christianized some natives and Spanish remnants in Cebu. Afterwards, the expedition visited [[Leyte]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|Cabalian]], Mazaua, [[Camiguin]] and [[Bohol]] where the famous ''[[Sandugo]]'' or blood compact was performed between López de Legazpi and [[Datu Sikatuna]], the chieftain of Bohol on March 16, 1565. The Spanish arrived in Cebu on April 15, 1565. They then attempted to parley with the local ruler, Rajah Tupas, but found that he and the local population had abandoned the town. Rajah Tupas presented himself at their camp on 8 May, feast of the [[Michael (archangel)|Apparition of Saint Michael the Archangel]], when the island was taken possession of on behalf of the Spanish King. The [[Treaty of Cebu (1565)|Treaty of Cebu]] was formalized on July 3, 1565. López de Legazpi's party named the new city "Villa de San Miguel de Cebú" (later renamed "Ciudad del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús)." In 1567 the Cebu garrison was reinforced with the arrival of 2,100 soldiers from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico).{{efn|1=On orders of the King Philip II, 2,100 men arrived from Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philippine-history.org/spanish-expeditions.htm |title=Spanish Expeditions to the Philippines |date=2005 |website=philippine-history.org}}</ref>}} The growing colony was then fortified by [[Fort San Pedro]].

By 1569, the Spanish settlement in Cebu had become important as a safe port for ships from [[Mexico]] and as a jumping-off point for further exploration of the archipelago. Small expeditions led by [[Juan de Salcedo]] went to [[Mindoro]] and [[Luzon]], where he and [[Martín de Goiti]] played a leading role in the subjugation of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tundun]] and [[Seludong]] in 1570. One year later, López de Legazpi departed Cebu to discuss a peace pact with the defeated Rajahs. An agreement between the conquistadors and the Rajahs to form a city council paved the way for the establishment of a new settlement and the construction of the Christian walled city of [[Intramuros]] on the razed remains of Islamic Manila, then a vassal-state of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]].

In 1571, the Spanish carried over infantry from Mexico, to raise an army of Christian Visayan warriors from [[Cebu]] and [[Iloilo]] as well as mercenaries from the Tagalog region, and assaulted the Sultanate of Brunei in what is known as the [[Castilian War]]. The war also started the [[Spanish–Moro Wars]] waged between the Christian Visayans and Muslim Mindanao, wherein Moros burned towns and conducted slave raids in the Visayas islands and selling the slaves to the Sultanates of the [[Malay Archipelago]] and the Visayans fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities in Mindanao, cities such as [[Zamboanga City]].

On August 14, 1595, [[Pope Clement VIII]] created the diocese of Cebu as a suffragan to the [[Archdiocese of Manila]].

On April 3, 1898, local revolutionaries led by the [[Negrense]] [[Leon Kilat]] rose up against the Spanish colonial authorities and took control of the urban center after three days of fighting. The uprising was only ended by the treacherous murder of Leon Kilat and the arrival of soldiers from Iloilo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cebu.gov.ph/?getid=2&getsubid=5&infolinkids=6&GetBodyName=History&rightpdisable=0 |title=Cebu Provincial Government |website=The Official Portal of the Province of Cebu |access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> On December 26, 1898, the Spanish Governor, General Montero, evacuated his troops to Zamboanga, turning over government property to Pablo Mejia.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=522}} The next day, a provincial government was formed under Luis Flores as president, General Juan Climaco as military chief of staff, and [[Julio A.

The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[Spanish–American War]] provided for the cession of Cebu along with the rest of the Philippine islands to the United States until the formation of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Era (1935–46)]]. On February 21, 1899, the [[USS Petrel (PG-2)]] deployed a landing party of 40 marines on the shores of Cebu.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=523}} Cebu's transfer to the American government was signed by Luis Flores although others, most notably General [[Arcadio Maxilom]] and Juan Climaco, offered resistance until 1901.{{sfn|Foreman|1906|p=524}} Governor [[W.

In 1934, the municipalities of Pardo, Mabolo, Talamban, Banilad, and San Nicolas were dissolved to be merged to the municipality of Cebu and become one of its barangays.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Letigio |first1=Delta Dyrecka |title=The crowning of Cebu City, the Queen City of the South |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/289880/the-crowning-of-cebu-city-the-queen-city-of-the-south |access-date=August 17, 2020 |work=CDN Digital |date=February 24, 2020}}</ref> After having remained a town since its original founding in 1565, Cebu became a chartered city on February 24, 1937. Many other Philippine cities such as Dansalan (now [[Marawi]]), [[Iloilo City]], and [[Bacolod]] were also incorporated at that time (see [[Cities of the Philippines]]).

Along with the rest of the country, Cebu came under Japanese occupation during [[World War II]]. The Japanese encountered some opposition there from guerrillas and irregular forces led by [[James M. Cushing|Col. James Cushing]] and the Cebu Area Command. It was finally liberated with the [[Battle for Cebu City]] in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, active from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946, was stationed in Cebu City during World War <span style="font-family:serif;">II</span>.

===Present day===
[[Colon Street]], the oldest national road in the Philippines, is the center of a dense and compact area in [[downtown]] Cebu City that was once the heart of Cebu City's shopping and business activity, with fashionable shops, restaurants and movie houses. In the early 1990s, much of this activity shifted to the more modern and more diverse business districts located in almost all of the urban areas of the city, including in what was considered residential and leisure neighborhoods. Colon also serves as a transit point for public utility [[jeepney]]s (PUJ) covering arterial routes within the city.

==Geography==
Cebu City has a land area of {{convert|315|km2}}. To the northeast of the city is [[Mandaue City]] and the town of [[Consolacion, Cebu|Consolacion]]; to the west is [[Toledo City, Cebu|Toledo City]] and the towns of [[Balamban, Cebu|Balamban]] and [[Asturias, Cebu|Asturias]]; to the south is [[Talisay City, Cebu|Talisay City]] and the town of [[Minglanilla, Cebu|Minglanilla]].

Across Mactan Strait to the east is Mactan island where Lapu-Lapu is located. Further east across the [[Cebu Strait]] is the [[Bohol (island)|island of Bohol]].

Being a highly urbanized city, Cebu City (along with neighboring [[Mandaue]] and [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu]]) is independent from Cebu province. Its electorate do not vote for provincial officials. There were proposals during the time of Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña]] to establish an "administrative district" that would be independent from Cebu City. This would mean carving out Cebu City's Capitol Site barangay, where the provincial capitol and other provincial offices are located. The plan, however, did not go through and was even followed by other proposals like the transfer of the capital to Balamban.

Cebu City is governed by a mayor, vice mayor and [[Cebu City Council|sixteen councilors]] (eight representing the north and eight representing the south districts). Each official is popularly elected to serve for a three-year term. The chief of the [[Association of Barangay Captains]] and the president of the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] Federation also serve in the city council. The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by a city administrator.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor |title=Davide is acting Cebu City mayor Osmeña in US, Rama off to Korea |date=10 October 2008 |work=Cebu Daily News (Inquirer.net) |access-date=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011011530/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081010-165704/Davide-is-acting-Cebu-City-mayor |archive-date=11 October 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers | title=Osmeñas leave for US amid prayer |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer| access-date=8 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011080249/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20081008-165293/Osmenas-leave-for-US-amid-prayers | archive-date=11 October 2008 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been erected by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cebú|volume=5|pages=592-593|noicon=yes}}</ref> It was encased in hollow [[Afzelia rhomboidea|tindalo wood]] in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at Magallanes Street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño. Revered by Filipinos, the Magellan's Cross is a symbol of Christianity in the Philippines.

A few steps away from Magellan's Cross is the [[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]] (Church of the Holy Child). This is an Augustinian church elevated to the rank of basilica in 1965 during the 400th anniversary celebrations of Christianity in the Philippines, held in Cebu. The church, which was the first to be established in the islands, is built of hewn stone and features the country's oldest relic, the figure of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] (Holy Child of Cebu), who is [[Jesus Christ]] as a [[Child Jesus|Child]].

This religious and cultural event is celebrated during the island's cultural festivities known as the [[Sinulog festival]]. Held every third Sunday of January, it celebrates the festival of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]], who was formerly considered to be the patron saint of Cebu. (This patronage was later changed to that of Our Lady of Guadalupe after it was realised that the Santo Niño could not be a patron saint because he was an image of Christ and not a saint.) The Sinulog is a dance prayer ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles somewhat the current (sulog) of the river. Thus, the Cebuanos called it Sinulog.

When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler [[Antonio Pigafetta]], sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon. She was later named Juana, the figure of the Santo Niño. The natives also honored the Santo Niño de Cebú in their indigenous sinulog ritual.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} This ritual was preserved but limited to honoring the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Christianized-[[Malay race|Austronesian natives]] started performing the sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting "Viva Pit Señor!"{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebú during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event.

The city joined [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network|Network of Creative Cities]] as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities’ Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities|title=UNESCO celebrates World Cities Day designating 66 new Creative Cities|date=2019-10-30|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>

===Music===
Cebu City is regarded as the birthplace of [[BisRock]], a term coined by Cebuano writer Januar E. Yap in 2002.<ref>{{ cite news |title=BISROCK: Where it all began |url=http://www.philstar.com/cebu-entertainment/377832/bisrock-where-it-all-began?nomobile=1 |work=The Philippine Star|date=August 31, 2006 |access-date=August 1, 2017 }}</ref> Notable BisRock bands include [[Missing Filemon]], [[Junior Kilat]], Phylum, and Scrambled Eggs, among others. Popular Filipino bands [[Urbandub]] and [[Cueshé]] also hail from Cebu, but mostly sing their songs in English, and in the latter's case, also in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

The [[Cebu Reggae Festival]] is a popular [[Filipino Reggae]] and Roots [[music festival]], it now has become one of the Philippines' largest annual Reggae Festivals.

Lifedance and Sinulog Invasion are rave music festivals held in the city in the days before the [[Sinulog]] Festival. These music festivals are regarded as among the biggest music festivals in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everythingcebu.com/attractions/festivals/top-sinulog-parties/|title=Top Sinulog Parties! – Everything Cebu|first=Pearl|last=Cabiluna|website=www.everythingcebu.com}}</ref>

The Cebu Pop Music Festival is an annual music festival, founded in 1980,<ref>{{ cite news |last=Costanilla |first=Sam |title=Costanilla: Cebu Pop Music Festival names top 12 songs |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/entertainment/2016/09/11/costanilla-cebu-pop-music-festival-names-top-12-songs-497036 |work=SunStar|date=September 11, 2016 |access-date=August 1, 2017 }}</ref> showcasing [[Cebuano language]] pop songs. Like Lifedance and Sinulog Invasion, the music festival is also held in the days before the [[Sinulog]] Festival.

On Cebuano musical heritage, the [[Jose R. Gullas Halad Museum]] in V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) corner D. Jakosalem St. in Cebu City, holds musical memorabilia of Cebuano composers in the early 20th century, the likes of Ben Zubiri (composer of Matud Nila), Inting Rubi (Kasadya Ning Taknaa) and Minggoy Lopez (Rosas Pandan).

Since 2013, Cebu has hosted the [[Visayan Pop Songwriting Campaign]], an annual songwriting competition that aimed to showcase songs written in the Cebuano language. Founded by multi-awarded artist [[Jude Gitamondoc]], Ian Zafra, Cattski Espina, and [[Missing Filemon|Missing Filemon's]] front-man Lorenzo Niñal through the Artists and Musicians Marketing Cooperative (ArtistKo) with the support of the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Vispop, or sometimes Visayan pop, later on evolved from being associated with the music festival to a genre of the new wave of Visayan pop songs that gained nationwide popularity, even those songs that were not exclusively produced for or presented in the contest.
