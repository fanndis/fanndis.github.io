"'''Fifteen'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Swift produced the song with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. The song was released on August 30, 2009 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the fourth [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). The song was inspired by Swift's [[freshman year]] of high school at [[Hendersonville High School (Tennessee)|Hendersonville High School]], where she first experienced heartbreak, along with her best friend Abigail Anderson. After writing it, Swift asked Anderson for authorization to record the song (due to personal references in the song); Anderson affirmed and it was ultimately included on ''Fearless''. "Fifteen" is a [[ballad]], which has Swift reminiscing on events that occurred to her and her best friend at the age of 15 and cautioning teenagers to not fall in love easily.

"Fifteen" peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 1.5 million digital downloads in the United States. The [[music video]] for "Fifteen" was directed by [[Roman White]]. It was filmed using a [[Chroma key|green screen]] and is heavily accentuated with special effects. The video features Swift walking through a garden, where she relives many memories with Anderson. It received a nomination for the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] category at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]], but lost to [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Bad Romance]]". "Fifteen" was promoted with live performances, including many that were part of Swift's first and second headlining tours, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009–10) and the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011–12). Swift partnered with electronics retailer [[Best Buy]] for @15, a program that allowed teens to help decide how funds would be distributed among various charities.

==Background==

Swift began writing "Fifteen" with the lyric "And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's [[bridge (music)|bridge]], and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner.<ref name="cutbycut">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |title=Cut By Cut |first=Taylor |last=Swift |authorlink=Taylor Swift |work=Bigmachinerecords.com |publisher=[[Big Machine Records]] |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |archivedate=April 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403025349/http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song was written about Swift's [[Student|freshman year]] of high school at Hendersonville High School,<ref name="cutbycut" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2009/11/09/taylor-swift-to-share-cma-spotlight-with-hendersonville-high-school-students/|title=Taylor Swift to share CMA spotlight with Hendersonville High School students|first=Teena|last=Lee|date=November 9, 2009|work=[[The Tennessean]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}</ref> where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson.<ref name="hotdish">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/hot-dish/1596320/hot-dish-taylor-swift-talks-about-songwriting-friends-and-good-manners.jhtml|title=HOT DISH: Taylor Swift Talks About Songwriting, Friends and Good Manners|first=Hazel|last=Smith|date=October 6, 2008|work=[[CMT News]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated.<ref name="cutbycut" /> The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered heartbreaks.<ref name="hotdish" /> Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger.<ref name="onsetfifteen">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'Fifteen'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.<ref name="hotdish" />

After the completion of composing "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for she did not know how her friend would respond. "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it."<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded "Fifteen" with producer [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]], ''Taylor Swift''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff.jhtml|title=When She Thinks "Tim McGraw," Taylor Swift Savors Payoff: Hardworking Teen to Open for George Strait Next Year|date=December 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Morris|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}</ref> Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to the fact that she is most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say "Fifteen" usually gets her every time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's fascination with Fairy Tales comes through on new album|first=Lindsey|last=Roznovsky|date=November 10, 2008|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT News]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref>

The lyrics of "Fifteen" have Swift narrating about multiple events. In the first [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]], Swift details first entering high school with intentions of merely staying out of her peers' way. The second verse bears Swift meeting Anderson and gossiping about the school's [[queen bee]]s with her. Successively, Swift describes first dates<ref name="paste" /> and falling in love for the first time.<ref name="villagevoice" /> However, Swift and Anderson become heartbroken, revealing that Anderson "gave everything she had" to someone who later changed his mind.<ref name="slant" /> The song's [[refrain]]s have Swift cautioning young girls to not fall in love easily<ref name="topabout" /> and acknowledging that she came to the realization of being able to accomplish more than dating a football team member.<ref name="villagevoice" />

==Critical reception==
The song was met with widespread critical acclaim. [[Jody Rosen]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' believed "Fifteen" was exemplary in that "Swift is a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track to that of producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]], who he referred to as "Swedish pop gods". He continued, "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted it sounds like it has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true."<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/fearless-20081113|title=Taylor Swift - Fearless|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=March 21, 2010|date=November 13, 2008|first=Jody|last=Rosen|authorlink=Jody Rosen}}</ref> Jonathon Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of ''Fearless'', but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro.<ref name="slant">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-fearless/1574|first=Jonathan|last=Keefe|date=November 16, 2008|title=Taylor Swift: Fearless|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] found "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed the role of a big sister instead of a big star, to be one of the best and the most personal song on ''Fearless''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1436466|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fearless - Taylor Swift|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref> Ken Tucker of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine believed "Fifteen" could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past.<ref name="billboardreview">{{cite journal|last=Ken|first=Tucker|date=November 15, 2008|title=Albums: Fearless|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|location=New York|volume=120|issue=45|pages=60|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBMEAAAAMBAJ&q=Billboard+Taylor+Swift+Fearless+review&pg=PA41|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}</ref> Leah Greenbelt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-[[Lolita (term)|Lolita]]".<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20237814,00.html|title=Fearless (2008)|date=November 5, 2008|first=Leah|last=Greenblatt|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref>

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Fifteen" was directed by [[Roman White]], who previously directed Swift's music video "[[You Belong with Me]]". White began with the intention of creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either."<ref name="mtvvideo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646390/taylor-swift-flashed-back-high-school-vmanominated-fifteen.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Flashed Back To High School For VMA-Nominated 'Fifteen'|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=August 28, 2010|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new.<ref name="mtvvideo" /> He conceptualized the setting to be a new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her.<ref name="romancmt">{{cite web |url=http://blog.cmt.com/2009-10-09/roman-white-makes-country-music-come-to-life/|title=Roman White Makes Country Music Come to Life|first=Alison|last=Bunaguro|date=October 9, 2009|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head.

The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Swift's best friend Abigail Anderson's broken heart.<ref name="framebyframe" />

Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed herself in the video. The love interests of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail.<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a [[green screen]].<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself.<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it "prolific".<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> On the second day, scenes at a high school were filmed; [[Rainmaking|artificial rain]] was made.<ref name="onsetfifteen" /> Afterward, White and a team of [[Visual effects|visual effect artist]]s created the setting. "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to think that every single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said.<ref name="recallskanye">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646416/taylor-swift-video-director-recalls-kanye-wests-2009-vma-rant.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Video Director Recalls Kanye West's 2009 VMA Rant|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=August 25, 2010|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video.<ref name="recallskanye" /> The direction was to make the video seem "magical".<ref name="framebyframe" /> Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and the desks.<ref name="mtvvideo" /><ref name="framebyframe" /> Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive.<ref name="framebyframe" /> White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.<ref name="romancmt" />

The video begins with Swift, barefoot and clad in a white sundress, approaching a tall, arched doorway which materializes in the middle of a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and the two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]] brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 150 million views on [[YouTube]].

Swift performed the song on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the [[Fearless Tour]].

==@15==
Swift partnered with electronics retailer [[Best Buy]] for @15, a program that allowed teens to help decide how Best Buy's "@15 Fund" would be distributed among various charities. Swift taped a [[Public service announcement|Public Service Announcement]] (PSA), called a "Teen Service Announcement" by Best Buy, for @15. Within the PSA, which was released on February 9, 2009, scenes of Swift reminiscing on high school and encouraging originality and uniqueness were inter-cut with scenes of her singing "Fifteen".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Taylor Swift Lends Support to @15|publisher=[[Best Buy]]|date=February 9, 2009|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS201229+09-Feb-2009+BW20090209|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref> In June 2009, @15 became a partner for Swift's Fearless Tour. The announcement was shown at each stop during the North American leg of the tour. In fifteen tour stops, @15 donated forty concert tickets and a guitar autographed by Swift to local teen-oriented charity groups, such as chapters of [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=@15 Named Official Charitable Partner of the Taylor Swift Fearless 2009 Tour|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS139716+22-Jun-2009+BW20090622|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630154035/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS139716+22-Jun-2009+BW20090622|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 30, 2012|publisher=[[Best Buy]]|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=March 17, 2011}} </ref>
