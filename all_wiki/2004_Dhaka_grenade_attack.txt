==Investigation==

===Initial investigation===
Bangladesh Police refused to register any criminal case filed by Bangladesh Awami League over the attack and only registered a general diary.<ref name=":1" /> The government initially refused to hand over the bodies of the victims.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/08/23/d4082301022.htm |title='I heard a bang and blood splashed on my body' |work=The Daily Star |date= |access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Interpol made repeated visits to Bangladesh to provide technical support.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2005/08/21/d5082101033.htm |title=One Year into Aug 21 Carnage |last=Manik |first=Julfikar Ali |last2=Ashraf |first2=Shamim |date= |work=The Daily Star |access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The Government also tried to implicate Mokhlesur Rahman, an Awami League activists, and Shaibal Saha Partha.

The government was also criticised for hurriedly burying two unidentified dead bodies from the terror attack in the middle of the night.<ref name=":2" />

In 2004, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led alliance government assigned Crime Investigation Department of Police to foresee the investigation. They came up with a story that some Joj Miah, also known as Jamal Ahmed from Noakhali district, along with 14 other criminals of Seven Star terrorist group of Subrata Bain attacked the Awami League rally. They met at Moghbazar before the attack, and rehearsed at a remote island before the attack.<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|title=Joj Mia gives deposition|url=https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/news/54443/Joj-Mia-gives-deposition |work=Prothom Alo |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> The government of Bangladesh formed a one-man judicial probe led by Justice Joynul Abedin. The Awami League rejected the commission which blamed the attack on a neighboring country. ''The Daily Star'' described Abedin as a "shame" for the judiciary in Bangladesh.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/one-man-shame-judiciary-1788154 |title=One man shame for judiciary |date=21 August 2019 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref>

On 26 June 2005 Joj Mia, a petty criminal, confessed his involvement in the crime under section 164, to the magistrate. The story collapsed following investigative journalism who discovered holes in the official story.<ref name=":0" />

===Fresh investigation===
In 2007, after the military-backed government assumed office, many of the BNP and Awami League leaders were rounded up by the government agencies, and fresh investigation into the case was launched.

After almost one year, in November 2007, Mufti Hannan, a militant leader from [[Gopalganj District, Bangladesh|Gopalganj]] who was arrested by the BNP-led government in 2005, revealed that the attack was operated by the militant outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami of which he was a leader. He also admitted that he got support from Maulana Tazuddin, brother of BNP leader and former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu while coordinating the attack.<ref name="bangladeshnews.com.bd">{{cite news|url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2007/11/02/huji-boss-hannan-admits-to-aug-21-grenade-attack/ |url-status=dead |title=Huji boss Hannan admits to Aug 21 grenade attack|newspaper=Bangladesh News|date=2 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064037/http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2007/11/02/huji-boss-hannan-admits-to-aug-21-grenade-attack/ |archive-date=16 March 2013 |access-date=20 March 2013}}</ref>

According to his statement, Abdus Salam Pintu had knowledge of the attack.

In 2008, after the detailed investigation, the then CID high official [[Mohammad Javed Patwary]] concluded that the attack was aimed at killing [[Sheikh Hasina]] and was guided by the common grievance of both Mufti Hannan and [[Abdus Salam Pintu]] against [[Sheikh Hasina]] for her role in "subduing" Islam. The investigation report mentioned that, Abdus Salam Pintu was personally responsible for the attack.

===Further investigation===

In 2009, Awami League came to office and decided to launch a further investigation into the incident and appointed a retired CID official Abdul Kahar Akhand as the person in charge.

In the same year, Abdul Majed Bhat alias Yusuf Bhat gave a confessional statement with the details regarding the source of grenade used in the attack. He claimed that Muzaffar Ahmad Shah of Tehrik-e-Jihad Islami (TEJI) gave the grenades to Maulana Tajuddin to send those to Indian militant groups. Tajuddin, instead of sending those to India, kept those with him. According to Yusuf Bhat, these grenades were later handed over to Mufti Hannan to carry out the attack.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dipu |first=Sarwar |title=Pakistani militant Yusuf Bhat's 'Bangladesh Mission' |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/militancy/2018/08/23/pakistani-militant-yusuf-bhat-s-bangladesh-mission |work=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>

After two years, in 2011, Mufti Hannan gave another confessional statement implicating many big names, mostly BNP leaders and some former officials of the government including the son of opposition leader and former prime minister [[Khaleda Zia]], [[Tarique Rahman]], former deputy minister [[Abdus Salam Pintu]], former member of parliament [[Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaikobad]] and some officials of the Home Ministry, [[Bangladesh Police|police]], [[Directorate General of Forces Intelligence]] (DGFI), [[National Security Intelligence]] (NSI) and Prime Minister's Office (PMO) with involvement in the planning of the bombing.

In the statement, Mufti Hannan claimed that the attack was aimed at destroying the top leadership of Awami League including Sheikh Hasina, and BNP leader Tarique Rahman along with Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and the then Home Minister Lutfuzzaman Babor assured them with government support.
