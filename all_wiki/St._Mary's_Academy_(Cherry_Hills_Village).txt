'''St. Mary's Academy''' (SMA) is a [[Catholic]], independent day school in the Loretto tradition located in [[Cherry Hills Village]], [[Colorado]].  Founded by the [[Sisters of Loretto]] in 1864, St. Mary's Academy educates boys and girls.  St. Mary's Academy is composed of a co-ed Lower School (co-ed pre-kindergarten through grade 5) and Middle School (co-ed grades 6-8), and continues its long tradition as a college preparatory high school for girls (grades 9-12).  Three times the U.S. Department of Education has honored St. Mary's Academy as a School of Excellence (a program initially titled Blue Ribbon Schools).  St. Mary's Academy High School offers 16 AP courses.

==History==

St. Mary's Academy is one of Denver's pioneer institutions.  It is the oldest continuously operating pre-collegiate school in Denver and has the distinction of awarding the first high school diploma in 1875, a year before Colorado became a state.  Originally situated at 14th and California Streets on the edge of the prairie, in 1911 the school moved and built next door to [[Margaret Brown|Margaret “Molly” Brown]] on Pennsylvania Avenue.  Needing additional space and recognizing that families were moving to the suburbs, St. Mary's Academy located to its current home in the early 1950s.  Begun as a school for girls, boys were welcomed into all Lower and Middle School grades in the mid-1970s.

==Activities==

*Numerous [[Destination Imagination]] teams form every year in Lower School.  In 2014 an all-boy team finished in first place in the Scientific Category at the Global Finals.
*Middle School students travel to a buffalo ranch in Northern Colorado, Keystone Science Center, the East Coast, and Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico for service.
*In its first year, the high school robotics team won awards in the 2013-2014 Denver and regional BEST Robotics Competition. They were the only all-girls team in that competition and are one of a handful of all-girl teams participating in the international FIRST Robotics Competition in 2014-2015.
*St. Mary's Academy offers opportunities to further engage with the Loretto Community: service work at Loretto Motherhouse in Kentucky, a trip to the United Nations and advocacy training at the El Paso/Juarez border.
