[[Queen Elizabeth II's coronation]] took place on 2 June 1953. Ordered in October 1952, the gown took eight months of research, design, workmanship, and intricate embroidery to complete. It featured the floral emblems of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] and those of the other states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including the [[United Kingdom|English]] [[Tudor rose]], Scots [[thistle]], [[Wales|Welsh]] [[leek]], [[Ireland|Irish]] [[shamrock]], [[Canada|Canadian]] [[maple leaf]], [[Australia]]n [[Acacia|wattle]], New Zealand [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]], South African [[protea]], [[Nelumbo nucifera|Indian lotus flower]] for [[India]], the [[Nymphaea stellata|Lotus flower of Ceylon]], and [[Pakistan]]'s [[wheat]], [[cotton]], and [[jute]].<ref name="America1958">{{cite book|author=Garden Club of America|title=Bulletin of the Garden Club of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKUhAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1958|publisher=The Club}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author1=Cotton, Belinda|author2=Ramsey, Ron|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/ByAppointment/|title=By appointment: Norman Hartnell's sample for the Coronation dress of Queen Elizabeth II|publisher=[[National Gallery of Australia]]|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530044811/http://www.nga.gov.au/ByAppointment/|archive-date=30 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The gown, like [[Wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth |Elizabeth's wedding dress]] and other notable royal dresses of this period, was designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].<ref name="Denney2005">{{cite book|last=Denney|first=Colleen|title=Representing Diana, Princess of Wales: cultural memory and fairy tales revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU7rpq8HFxYC&pg=PA117|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=April 2005|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4023-4|page=117}}</ref><ref name="Steele2010">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hemsvn9ZbRkC&pg=PA392|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=9 November 2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|page=392}}</ref>  It was the Queen's wish that the coronation dress should be made of satin, like her wedding dress, with accentuation of regal elegance, but with no undue emphasis on shape.<ref name="FE">{{cite web|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/coronation_dress.htm|title=Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Gown|publisher=Fashion Era|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>  The gown now forms part of the [[Royal Collection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?imgbuttonsearch=&radioAll=0&startYear=&searchText=dress&title=&rccode=&makerName=&category=&collector=&endYear=&pagesize=20&object=9999999&row=0&detail=feature|title=Royal Collection - Coronation Dress and Robe, 1953|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923052710/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?imgbuttonsearch=&radioAll=0&startYear=&searchText=dress&title=&rccode=&makerName=&category=&collector=&endYear=&pagesize=20&object=9999999&row=0&detail=feature|archivedate=23 September 2012}}</ref>

After the coronation, the dress was worn on several occasions such as when she opened the parliaments in New Zealand (1954), Australia (1954), [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] (1954), and Canada (1957).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2003/50factsaboutTheQueensCoronation.aspx|title=50 facts about The Queen's Coronation|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061131/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2003/50factsaboutTheQueensCoronation.aspx|archivedate=5 June 2011|publisher=The official website of the British monarchy }}</ref>

==Design==
The dress was to be a historic masterpiece befitting the occasion, consequently one that would stand out. Like her bridal gown, the costume was designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].  Hartnell proposed at least eight different designs; the first, very simple, similar to that worn by [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|her Coronation]]; the second, a modern slim-fitting [[sheath dress|sheath gown]], embroidered in gold; the third, a [[crinoline]] style dress of white satin, silver tissue and crusty silver lace; the fourth, white satin embroidered with [[Madonna lily|Madonna]] and [[arum lilies]] and encrusted with pendant [[pearls]]; the fifth, a colourful design of violets, roses and wheat, the sixth, white satin with gold, silver and copper embroideries featuring branches of oak leaves with acorns; the seventh, the [[Tudor Rose]] of England, appliqued in gold tissue against white satin; and the eighth, similar to the seventh, but incorporating the floral emblems of Great Britain and the Commonwealth.<ref name="FE"/> The Queen favoured the last option if Hartnell introduced some colour and made some adjustments; a ninth design was then drawn up and presented to Elizabeth at [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]].<ref name="FE"/> Later Hartnell secretly added an embroidered extra four-leaved shamrock on the left side of her dress as an omen for good fortune.<ref name="FE"/>

The final version featured a [[Tudor rose]], embroidered in very pale pink silk, with pearls, gold and silver bullion, and rose diamante; the [[leek (vegetable)|Welsh leek]], embroidered in white silk with leaves of very pale green silk; the [[Scottish thistle]], with pale mauve silk and amethysts and a calyx embroidered in [[reseda green]] silk, silver thread, and diamante dewdrops; the Irish [[shamrock]], like the thistle, was embroidered in soft green silk, silver thread, bullion, and diamante.<ref name="FE"/> the Canadian [[maple leaf]], made with green silk embroideries with a crystal vein and gold border; the [[Alsophila dealbata|silver fern of New Zealand]], embroidered in straight stitches using soft green silk and veined in silver and crystal; the [[Golden Wattle|Australian wattle flower]], made with a coarse mimosa yellow wool and green and gold foliage; the [[King protea|South African protea]], embroidered in shaded pink silk, with green silk leaves and silver outlined petals; the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower of India]], made with seed pearls and diamante and mother of pearl embroidered petals; the [[Nymphaea stellata|Lotus flower of Ceylon]], made with opals, [[mother of pearl]], diamante, and soft green silk; and the [[floral emblem#Pakistan|three emblems of Pakistan]]: wheat, in oat-shaped diamante and fronds of golden crystal, cotton, made in silver with leaves of green silk, and jute, embroidered in green silk and golden thread.<ref name="FE"/>

In addition to the gown, Hartnell also designed a plain white linen robe called a [[colobium sindonis]], which initially covered the short-sleeved, low-neck gown.<ref name="FE"/> Attached to the shoulders was a crimson [[velvet]] mantle edged with ermine and featuring two rows of delicately embroidered gold lace and gold filigree. On the Coronation Day, the six [[maid of honour|maids of honour]] carried this robe behind the Queen.<ref name="FE"/>

==Making==
The dress, which was  ordered in October 1952, took eight months of research, design and workmanship to make.<ref name="FisherFisher1964">{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Graham|last2=Fisher|first2=Heather|title=Elizabeth, Queen & mother: the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethqueenmo00fish|url-access=registration|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=1964|publisher=Hawthorn Books}}</ref>
Its intricate embroidery required many hours of diligent work by the dressmakers.<ref name="FisherFisher1964"/> The silk used to make the gown was obtained from [[Dyke baronets|Lady Hart Dyke]]'s silk farm at [[Lullingstone Castle]]. The dress required the efforts of at least three dressmakers, six embroideresses and the [[Royal School of Needlework]], responsible for the embroidery worked in gold bullion thread. The Robe of State of Crimson Velvet, which was attached to the shoulders of the gown, was hand-woven by Warners of [[Braintree, Essex]], using Lullingstone Castle silk and made by Messrs. [[Ede & Ravenscroft]] of [[Chancery Lane]], London.<ref name="FE"/>
