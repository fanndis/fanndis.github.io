'''Dillard's, Inc.''', is an American [[department store]] chain with approximately 282 stores in 29 states and headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Dillard's Investor Relations | publisher=Dillard's |url=http://www.shareholder.com/dillards/investor/index.cfm | accessdate=2007-03-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211191542/http://www.shareholder.com/dillards/investor/index.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-11}}</ref> Currently, the largest number of stores are located in [[Texas]] with 57 and [[Florida]] with 42. The company also has stores in 27 more states; however, it is absent from the Northeast (Washington, DC, and northward), most of the Upper Midwest (no stores in [[Michigan]], [[Chicago]], [[Wisconsin]], or [[Minnesota]]), the Northwest, and most of California, aside from three stores in smaller cities.<ref name="10-K" />

==Operations during 20th century==
===Early history===
Dillard's is the outgrowth of a department store founded in 1938 by [[William T. Dillard]]; its corporate headquarters remain located at the eastern edge of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]'s [[Riverdale, Little Rock, Arkansas|Riverdale]] area and many of its executives and directors are members of the Dillard family. The family still controls the company through its ownership of Class B Common Stock; the Class A common stock is publicly traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/28917/000104746917002402/a2231675zdef14a.htm|title=Dillard's Proxy statement|publisher=}}</ref>
Dillard began his first store in [[Mineral Springs, Arkansas]], in what was locally known as "the tater house". It was located across the street from the community's Methodist church. The building that housed the original store was torn down in the early 2000s. Dillard sold the original five and dime store in [[Nashville, Arkansas]], to develop a department store in [[Texarkana, Arkansas]], initially as the minority partner in Wooten & Dillard. In 1956, Dillard led an investment group that acquired the Mayer & Schmidt store in [[Tyler, Texas]]. This store eventually took on the name "Dillard's Mayer & Schmidt" until 1974, when it was replaced with a mall-based location south of downtown Tyler.

In 1960, Dillard acquired and turned around the failing Brown-Duncan store in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The success of this turnaround was followed in late 1963 by acquiring the Joseph Pfeifer store in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and in early 1964 acquiring the other main store in Little Rock, Gus Blass Co. Dillard used this as an opportunity to relocate his headquarters to Little Rock. In 1969, Dillard and his investors took Dillard Department Stores, Inc., public on the [[American Stock Exchange]].

===1970&ndash;1989===

Thereafter, the chain expanded rapidly as an anchor in [[suburban]] [[shopping mall]]s, and took advantage of market conditions to acquire smaller chains as well as its ability to turn around locations that other companies could not operate profitably. Expansion of the Dillard's chain increased rapidly during the 1970s, mainly through expanding into new malls being built in smaller cities in Texas. In 1971 five Texas units were acquired from Fedway, a division of [[Federated Department Stores]] (the stores were rebadged as Dillard's in 1972). In 1974 five Leonard's stores were acquired in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas, as well as a commitment to open a new downtown Fort Worth store at the [[Tandy Center]] (site of the original Leonard's). Also in 1974, the former Brown-Dunkin, Blass, Pfeifer and Mayer & Schmidt stores were fully renamed Dillard's.

The 1980s brought the purchase of many local chains. In 1982, Dillard's leased three units of the defunct Lowenstein's chain in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In early 1984, Dillard’s acquired 12 [[Stix, Baer & Fuller]] stores in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] from [[Associated Dry Goods Corp.]], while in fall 1984 two department store divisions were purchased from [[Dayton-Hudson Corporation]]: [[Diamond's]] and [[John A. Brown (department store)|John A. Brown]], with locations in [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]] and [[Oklahoma]]. Twelve stores in Kansas and Missouri belonging to [[Macy's|R. H. Macy & Co.]]'s Midwest Division, which was later dissolved in 2006, were acquired in early 1986, while the three-unit Hemphill-Wells company in West Texas was purchased in the summer. The stores at [[Sunset Mall]] in [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and [[South Plains Mall]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] were both converted, while the third in downtown Lubbock was closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4306684.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155142/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4306684.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|title=Hemphill-Wells, Dep't store chain, bought by Dillard's|last=Laughlin|first=Lee|date=16 July 1986|work=Daily News Record|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

In 1987, Dillard's purchased 26 of [[Joske's]] 27 stores in Texas and Arizona as well as the four-unit [[Cain-Sloan]] chain in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], from [[Allied Stores Corp.]]  This deal gave Dillard's two major anchor locations at several malls in Texas and Arizona with many of the second locations being converted to a separate, expanded home and men's stores, a format that Dillard's utilized greatly, both to grow its store size cost-effectively and to prevent competitors from gaining valuable real estate. Additionally, the Joske's acquisition gave Dillard's entry into the Houston market.

Dillard's in 1988 acquired the former [[Aaron Selber, Jr.|Selber Bros.]] clothing department store chain, founded in 1907 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana, which also had a few locations in Texas.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=aaron-selber&pid=166413338&fhid=10218#fbLoggedOut|title=Aaron Selber|newspaper=The Shreveport Times|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>

In 1988, Dillard's purchased the three-unit [[Miller & Paine]] chain in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], as well as more significantly, a half-interest and operational control of [[Higbee's|The Higbee Co.]], based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], with partner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.|Edward J. DeBartolo]] Corp. [[D. H. Holmes]] Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, was purchased in 1989, bringing 18 units primarily in Louisiana, as well two former [[Diamond's]] units in [[Tucson, Arizona]].

===1990&ndash;1999===

The [[Ivey's]] chain of 23 stores in Florida, [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] was acquired from BATUS in 1990. This was followed by [[Maison Blanche]] selling eight stores on Florida's Gulf Coast to them in 1991. The locations were at [[Tyrone Square Mall]], [[University Mall (Tampa, Florida)|University Square Mall]], [[WestShore Plaza]], [[Westfield Countryside|Countryside Mall]], [[Westfield Siesta Key|Southgate Plaza]], [[Edison Mall]], [[Coastland Center]], and [[Lakeland Square Mall]]. In 1992, the remaining interest in the Higbee's stores was acquired, as well as five Ohio stores from [[Horne's]] (as part of a legal settlement, Dillard's having canceled a 1988 deal to acquire the chain). Also in 1992, three stores from the [[Hess's]] chain liquidation (five other former Hess's were acquired in 1994), two E.M. Scarbrough's locations in [[Austin, Texas]], two  [[Thalhimer's]] in South Carolina and Tennessee, a former [[Lord & Taylor]] store at [[Oak Court Mall]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and three Belk-Lindsey stores in Florida (Gulf View, DeSoto, and Eastlake).  Except for two Belk of Columbia stores that were acquired in 1995, acquisitions were eschewed for a couple of years until early 1997 when ten buildings in Florida were sold from [[Mervyn's]], at [[Southland Mall (Miami)|Cutler Ridge Mall]], [[Miami International Mall]], [[Pembroke Lakes Mall]], [[Westfield Broward|Broward Mall]], [[Coral Square]], [[Pompano Citi Centre|Pompano Fashion Square]], [[Boynton Beach Mall]], [[Treasure Coast Square]], [[Melbourne Square (mall)|Melbourne Square]], and Lakeland Square Mall. At the same time, five southern Virginia stores were purchased from [[Proffitt's]] at [[Pembroke Mall]], [[Peninsula Town Center|Coliseum Mall]], [[Greenbrier Mall]], [[Patrick Henry Mall]], and [[Chesapeake Square]] whereas the suburban [[Macy's]] stores in [[Houston]] at [[Baybrook Mall]], [[Willowbrook Mall (Houston)|Willowbrook Mall]], and [[Deerbrook Mall (Texas)|Deerbrook Mall]] were absorbed while the location at [[The Galleria]] was not affected.

The deal-making culminated with the purchase of [[Mercantile Stores]] Co., Inc., in 1998. The purchase of this Fairfield, Ohio-based department store company brought several chains, including [[Bacon's]], [[Castner Knott]], de Lendrecie's, [[Gayfers]], Glass Block, [[Hennessy's]], [[J.B. White]], [[Joslins]], [[Lion Store]], [[Maison Blanche]], [[McAlpin's]], Root's and [[The Jones Store]]. Dillard's sold 26 stores of the former Mercantile Stores to [[May Department Stores]] Co. and [[Saks Incorporated]] and traded an additional seven stores to [[Belk]] for nine of theirs in southern Virginia and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Overall this deal enabled Dillard's to enhance its position in several markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain states.

Also in 1998, the chain entered [[California]], opening its first store in a former [[Weinstock's]] at [[Weberstown Mall]] in [[Stockton, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980420/A_BIZ/304209984|title=Dillard's settling in|last=Hood|first=Jeff|date=20 April 1998|work=RecordNet.com|accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> In 1999, Dillard's opened stores at [[Mall of Georgia]] and [[Arbor Place Mall]] near [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

==Operations during 21st century==
[[File:Dillards-Fairview.jpg|right|thumb|Dillard’s in [[Fairview, Texas]] opened on March 10, 2010.]]

After the acquisition of Mercantile, Dillard's ceased expanding through acquisitions, although eight locations of the defunct [[Montgomery Ward]] in the Midwest, and four locations from [[ZCMI]] in Utah and Idaho were acquired in 2001, when stores opened at [[Chandler Fashion Center]] in Chandler, Arizona, [[The Mall at Stonecrest]] in Lithonia, Georgia, [[The Mall at Wellington Green]] in Wellington, Florida, [[International Plaza and Bay Street]] in Tampa, Florida, and [[The Shops at Willow Bend]] in Plano, Texas.

In 2004, Dillard's store credit card operation, operated as Dillard's National Bank, was sold to [[GE Money|GE Money Bank]]. Customers can now be issued Dillard's/American Express cards as well the traditional Dillard's store charge. These cards can be used at any store that accepts the [[American Express]] brand.

In 2005, Dillard's opened stores at [[Perimeter Mall]] and [[Atlantic Station]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as well as [[St. Johns Town Center]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

In 2008, Dillard's closed their travel agency, Dillard's Travel, alongside all in-store locations due to economic conditions. Dillard's Travel previously operated in 43 of the 318 stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plainvanillashell.com/article.asp?ID=10583|title=Dilliard's Closes Travel Agency, To Affect 160 Employees|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015116/http://www.plainvanillashell.com/article.asp?ID=10583|archivedate=2009-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dillards.com/html/travel/travel.shtml|title=Dillard's Travel is closed|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20061015191407/http://www.dillards.com/html/travel/travel.shtml|archivedate=2006-10-15}}</ref> Also in 2008, stores opened at both [[The Shops at Wiregrass]] and [[Pier Park (Florida)|Pier Park]] in [[Florida]]. As of Tuesday December 4, 2018 [[Dillard’s]] has recently announced a brand new location coming in fall 2019 to Sioux Falls, SD to the former [[Younkers]] in [[Empire Mall]].

==Store formats==
[[File:Dillard's footprint.png|thumb|Map of Dillard's locations]]
The chain continues to expand and has recently added stores in non-traditional mall shopping centers. Currently, the largest Dillard's store at {{convert|365,000|sqft}} is located at [[Scottsdale Fashion Square]], an enclosed super-regional mall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Within the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the chain has two flagship stores with a {{convert|299000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} store at the [[Northpark Center]] in [[Dallas]] and a {{convert|310000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} store at the [[North East Mall]] in [[Hurst, Texas|Hurst]].<ref name="usabizdir">{{cite web|title=Dillard's - Tarrant, TX 76053 |url=http://www.usabizdir.com/dillards-hurst-tx-76053-1.html|website=USA BIZ DIR|publisher=USABIZDIR|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>  Its flagship store in the East Coast region, at {{convert|260000|sqft|m2}}, is located in the [[MacArthur Center]] in downtown [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. The home store for the chain is in [[Little Rock]]; the divided store is located in the trend-conscious [[Park Plaza Mall]], one of the city's oldest continuously operating shopping centers in its midtown section.

===Clearance Centers===
[[File:KennerEsplanadeMallDillards.JPG|alt=Dillard's Clearance Center in Kenner, Louisiana|thumb|This is a Dillard's Clearance Center in The Esplanade Mall in Kenner, Louisiana]]
Dillard’s Clearance Centers occupy 26 mall spaces throughout multiple states for the clearance stock of clothing from prior seasons.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/dillards-dds-q4-earnings-amp-sales-beat-estimates-stock-up-cm1106125|title=NASDAQ}}</ref> They are usually located within lower-income areas as the no longer high priced items are not as covetable for the general clientele Dillard’s procures. The 265 regular department stores ship the clearance clothing at already 60% off to these Clearance Centers where the clothing is then marked down further to liquidate the heaps of clothing and shoes.<ref name=":0" /> The Clearance Centers rival that of a [[Marshalls]] or [[TJ Maxx]] with unknown sizes or quantities of a specific item. However, all the clothing at Dillard’s Clearance Centers are direct from the normal Dillard’s Department Stores close to and surrounding the one outlet. The goods that are sent to these stores are including, but not limited to: overstocked, offseason, didn't sell well, or damaged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themonitor.com/2018/08/22/dillards-in-harlingen-to-downgrade-to-a-clearance-store/|title=Dillard's in Harlingen to Downgrade to a Clearance Store|website=The Monitor}}</ref> This is an easy way to buy all of the brand-specific items at a cheaper, more economical price.

The hours may vary a little bit by store or holiday; however, the generic hours of a Clearance Center are Tuesday through Saturday from 12 pm to 7 pm and Sunday from 12 pm to 6 pm. On Mondays, the Clearance Centers are closed for the restocking of the Clearance items.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dillards.com/stores|title=Store Locator|website=Dillard's}}</ref>

On a week-to-week basis, each Dillard’s Clearance Center receives further markdowns by each department, i. e. Ladies’ Shirts and Men’s Pants could be an extra 50% off the already reduced 60% off merchandise making the total be around 80% off the original market value.<ref name=":1" />
