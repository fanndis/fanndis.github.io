The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the [[decolonisation]] of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was originally created as the ''British Commonwealth of Nations''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth11_doc_1926.pdf|title=Imperial Conference 1926 Inter-Imperial Relations Committee Report, Proceedings and Memoranda|date=November 1926|access-date=14 June 2018|quote=Their position and mutual relation may be readily defined.

The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the [[London Declaration]] in 1949, which modernised the community and established the member states as "free and equal".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/181889/34293/35468/214257/londondeclaration.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706045924/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/181889/34293/35468/214257/londondeclaration.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2010|title=The London Declaration|publisher=The Commonwealth|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref>

The [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]];  the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018|2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] appointed [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] to be her designated successor, although the position is not hereditary. The Queen is the [[head of state]] of 16 member states, known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, while 33 other members are [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republics]] and 5 others have different monarchs.

Member states have no legal obligations to one another, but are connected through their use of the English language and historical ties. Their stated shared values of [[democracy]], [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]] are enshrined in the [[Charter of the Commonwealth|Commonwealth Charter]]<ref name="charter">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/181889/34293/35468/252053/charter.htm|title=Charter of the Commonwealth|publisher=The Commonwealth|access-date=30 June 2013}}{{dead link|date=October 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and promoted by the quadrennial [[Commonwealth Games]].

The countries of the Commonwealth cover more than {{convert|29958050|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, equivalent to 20 per cent of the world's land area. The total population is estimated to be 2,418,964,000 as of 2016, equivalent to nearly a third of the [[global population]], making it the second largest [[intergovernmental organisation]] by population behind the [[United Nations]].

==History==
===Origins of the concept and establishment of the term===
{{Main|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}

[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|The prime ministers of five members at the 1944 [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. (L-R) [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] ([[Canada]]), [[Jan Smuts]] ([[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]), [[Winston Churchill]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]] ([[New Zealand]]) and [[John Curtin]] ([[Australia]])]]

[[Queen Elizabeth II]], in her address to [[Canada]] on [[Canada Day|Dominion Day]] in 1959, pointed out that the [[Confederation of Canada]] on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the "first independent country within the British Empire". She declared: "So, it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations."<ref>{{cite video| title=Queen Elizabeth's 1959 Dominion Day Message| publisher=CBC| url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/queen-elizabeths-1959-dominion-day-message| date=1 July 1959| location=Government House (Rideau Hall), Ottawa| people=Queen Elizabeth II| accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> As long ago as 1884 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], while visiting Australia, had described the changing British Empire, as some of its colonies became more independent, as a "Commonwealth of Nations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/191086/34493/history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122654/http://thecommonwealth.org/Internal/191086/34493/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 June 2010|title=History – Though the modern Commonwealth is just 60 years old, the idea took root in the 19th century|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |work=thecommonwealth.org|access-date=29 July 2011}}</ref> Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from [[First Colonial Conference|the first one in 1887]], leading to the creation of the [[Imperial Conference]]s in 1911.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mole|first=Stuart|title=Seminars for statesmen': the evolution of the Commonwealth summit|journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]]|date=September 2004|volume=93|issue=376|pages=533–546 |doi=10.1080/0035853042000289128|s2cid=154616079}}</ref>

The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences. A specific proposal was presented by [[Jan Smuts]] in 1917 when he coined the term "the British Commonwealth of Nations" and envisioned the "future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence" at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], attended by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain.<ref>F.S. Crafford, ''Jan Smuts: A Biography'' (2005) p. 142</ref><ref>The Irish [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]], agreed in 1921, included the [[Irish Free State]]'s "adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations".</ref> The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, when the term ''British Commonwealth of Nations'' was substituted for ''British Empire'' in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State.<ref>{{cite book|title=Peace by ordeal: an account, from first-hand sources of the negotiation and signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty 1921|last=Pakenham|first=Frank|author-link=Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|year=1972|publisher=Sidgwick and Jackson|isbn=978-0283979088}}</ref>

===Adoption and formalisation of the Commonwealth===
In the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], Britain and its dominions agreed they were "equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations". The term "[[Commonwealth]]" was officially adopted to describe the community.<ref name=green>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0313262579|pages=297–298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&pg=PA297}}</ref>

These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, which applied to [[Canada]] without the need for ratification, but [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] had to ratify the statute for it to take effect. Newfoundland never did, as on 16 February 1934, with the consent of its parliament, the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London. Newfoundland later joined Canada as its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|10th province]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/commission_gov.html|title=The Commission of Government, 1934–1949|publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Website|work=heritage.nf.ca|date=January 2003|access-date=29 July 2011|author=Webb, Jeff A.}}</ref> Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|1942]] and [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|1947]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-96.html|title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 (Cth)|publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House |work=foundingdocs.gov.au (Documenting a Democracy)|access-date=29 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/9/1/8/00PLLawRP07041-New-Zealand-sovereignty-1857-1907-1947-or-1987.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522195038/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/9/1/8/00PLLawRP07041-New-Zealand-sovereignty-1857-1907-1947-or-1987.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 May 2011|title=New Zealand Sovereignty: 1857, 1907, 1947, or 1987?|publisher=[[Parliament of New Zealand]]|work=parliament.nz|date=August 2007|access-date=29 July 2011}}</ref>

Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect, two laws—the Status of the Union Act, 1934, and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934—were passed to confirm South Africa's status as a sovereign state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dugard|first1=John|last2=Bethlehem|first2=Daniel|last3=Plessis|first3=Max du|last4=Katz|first4=Anton|title=International law: a South African perspective|date=2005|publisher=Juta|location=Lansdowne, South Africa|isbn=9780702171215|page=19}}</ref>

===Decolonisation and self-governance===
{{Main list|List of countries that have gained independence from the United Kingdom}}

After the [[Second World War]] ended, the British Empire was gradually dismantled.  Most of its components have become independent countries, whether [[Commonwealth realm]]s or republics, and members of the Commonwealth. There remain the 14 mainly self-governing [[British overseas territories]] which retain some political association with the United Kingdom. In April 1949, following the [[London Declaration]], the word "British" was dropped from the title of the Commonwealth to reflect its changing nature.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/191086/34493/187367/celebrating_thecommonwealth_60 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090804012916/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/191086/34493/187367/celebrating_thecommonwealth_60/ |url-status=dead |archive-date = 4 August 2009 |title=Celebrating thecommonwealth@60 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |work=thecommonwealth.org |date=26 April 2009 |access-date = 29 July 2011 }}</ref>

[[Burma]] (also known as [[Myanmar]]) and [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] (now part of the Republic of Yemen) are the only states that were British colonies at the time of the war not to have joined the Commonwealth upon independence. Former British [[protectorate]]s and [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] that did not become members of the Commonwealth are [[Egypt]] (independent in 1922), [[Iraq]] (1932), [[Jordan|Transjordan]] (1946), [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (part of which became the state of [[Israel]] in 1948), [[Sudan]] (1956), [[British Somaliland]] (which united with the former [[Italian Somaliland]] in 1960 to form the [[Somali Republic]]), [[Kuwait]] (1961), [[Bahrain]] (1971), [[Oman]] (1971), [[Qatar]] (1971), and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (1971).<ref>Chris Cook and John Paxton, ''Commonwealth Political Facts'' (Macmillan, 1978).</ref>

===Declining roles===
The postwar Commonwealth was given a fresh mission by Queen Elizabeth in her Christmas Day 1953 broadcast, in which she envisioned the Commonwealth as "an entirely new conception – built on the highest qualities of the Spirit of Man: friendship, loyalty, and the desire for freedom and peace".<ref>Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951—1970'' (Oxford UP, 2009), p. 102.</ref> Hoped-for success was reinforced by such achievements as [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|climbing Mount Everest in 1953]], [[Roger Bannister|breaking the four-minute mile]] in 1954, and [[Francis Chichester|a solo circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1966.<ref>Theresa Walton and Susan Birrell. "Enduring Heroes: Hillary, Bannister, and the Epic Challenges of Human Exploration." ''Journal of Sport History'' 39.2 (2012): 211–226.</ref> However, the humiliation of the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 badly hurt the morale of Britain and of the Commonwealth as a whole. More broadly, there was the loss of a central role of the British Empire: the defence of the Empire. That role was no longer militarily or financially feasible, as [[Truman Doctrine|Britain's withdrawal from Greece in 1947]] had painfully demonstrated. Britain itself was now just one part of the [[NATO]] military alliance in which the Commonwealth had no role apart from Canada. The ANZUS treaty of 1955 linked Australia, New Zealand, and the [[United States of America|United States]] in a defensive alliance, with Britain and the Commonwealth left out. The second major function of the Empire made London the financial centre of the system. After the Second World War, the British treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the United States. The loss of defence and financial roles, furthermore, undermined [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph Chamberlain's]] early 20th-century vision of a world empire that could combine Imperial preference, mutual defence, and social growth. Furthermore, Britain's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly limited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore.<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951—1970'', p. 103.</ref> While British politicians at first hoped the Commonwealth would preserve and project British influence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues Krishnan Srinivasan. Early enthusiasm waned as British policies came under fire at Commonwealth meetings. Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-white member states became large-scale.<ref>Krishnan Srinivasan,  "Nobody's Commonwealth? The Commonwealth in Britain's post-imperial adjustment." ''Commonwealth & Comparative Politics'' 44.2 (2006): 257–269.</ref>

===Republics===
On 18 April 1949, Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]; in doing so, it also formally left the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whyte |first1=J. H. |authorlink1=John Henry Whyte |editor1-last=Hill |editor1-first=J. R. |title=A New History of Ireland |volume=Volume VII: Ireland, 1921–84 |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0191615597 |page=277 (footnote 20) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfFXarIhGqEC&pg=PA277 |access-date=6 August 2019 |chapter=Economic crisis and political cold war, 1949-57 |quote=The Republic of Ireland Act, 1948...repealed the external relations act, and provided for the declaration of a republic, which came into force on 18 Apr. 1949, when Ireland left the commonwealth.}}</ref> While Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth since the early 1930s, other dominions wished to become republics without losing Commonwealth ties. The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers' meeting in London. Under the [[London Declaration]], [[India]] agreed that, when it became a republic in January 1950, it would accept the British Sovereign as a "symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth". Upon hearing this, King [[George VI]] told the Indian politician [[Krishna Menon]]: "So, I've become 'as such'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/staying-loyal-to-george/581730/0|title=Staying loyal to George|work=indianexpress.com}}</ref> The other Commonwealth countries recognised India's continuing membership of the association. At Pakistan's insistence, India was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed that other states would be accorded the same treatment as India.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The London Declaration is often seen as marking the beginning of the modern Commonwealth. Following India's precedent, other nations became republics, or [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] with their own monarchs. While some countries retained the same monarch as the United Kingdom, their monarchies developed differently and soon became essentially independent of the British monarchy. The monarch is regarded as a separate [[legal personality]] in each realm, even though the same person is monarch of each realm.<ref name=Bogdanor>{{citation| last=Bogdanor| first=Vernon| author-link=Vernon Bogdanor| title=The Monarchy and the Constitution| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=12 February 1998| location=New York| page=288| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mN6SzMefot4C&q=%22overseas+realms%22&pg=PA289| isbn=978-0-19-829334-7}}</ref><ref name=HCUK>{{Cite journal|last=High Commissioner in United Kingdom |title=Royal Style and Titles |journal=Documents on Canadian External Relations > Royal Style and Titles |volume=18 |issue=2 |date=24 November 1952 |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=3498 |id=DEA/50121-B-40 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123050633/http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history-histoire/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=3498| archivedate=23 November 2011| df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last=Smy| first=William A.| title=Royal titles and styles| journal=The Loyalist Gazette| volume=XLVI| issue=1| year=2008| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1372/is_1_46/ai_n29437278/| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711172851/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1372/is_1_46/ai_n29437278/| url-status=dead| archive-date=11 July 2012| access-date=3 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=Toporoski>{{cite web| title=The Invisible Crown| publisher=Monarchy Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| author=Toporoski, Richard| access-date=20 April 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}</ref>

===New Commonwealth===
Planners in the interwar period, like [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|Lord Davies]], who had also taken "a prominent part in building up the League of Nations Union" in the United Kingdom, in 1932 founded the [[New Commonwealth Society]], of whose British section [[Winston Churchill]] became the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillbookcollector.com/pages/books/003235/winston-s-churchill/a-message-from-the-rt-hon-winston-s-churchill-c-h-m-p-president-british-section-new-commonwealth|title=A Message from the Rt.

The term '''New Commonwealth''' has been used in the UK (especially in the 1960s and 1970s) to refer to recently [[Decolonization|decolonised]] countries, predominantly non-[[White race|white]] and [[Developing country|developing]]. It was often used in debates about [[immigration]] from these countries.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1463759/Blair-calls-for-quotas-on-immigrants-from-New-Commonwealth.html |title = Blair calls for quotas on immigrants from 'New Commonwealth' |first = Patrick |last = Hennessy |date=5 June 2004 }}</ref> Britain and the pre-1945 dominions became informally known as the '''Old Commonwealth''', or more pointedly as the '''[[White people|white]] Commonwealth''',<ref>

===Plan G and inviting Europe to join===
At a time when Germany and France, together with Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, were planning what later became the [[European Union]], and newly independent African countries were joining the Commonwealth, new ideas were floated to prevent Britain from becoming isolated in economic affairs. British trade with the Commonwealth was four times larger than its trade with Europe. In 1956 and 1957 the British government under Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] considered a "Plan G" to create a European free trade zone while also protecting the favoured status of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last = Gowland |title = Britain and European Integration Since 1945: On the Sidelines |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dvt-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge|page=46|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781134354528 }}</ref><ref>James R.

===Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting===
{{Main|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting}}

The main decision-making forum of the organisation is the biennial [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), where Commonwealth [[Head of government|heads of government]], including (amongst others) prime ministers and presidents, assemble for several days to discuss matters of mutual interest. CHOGM is the successor to the Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers and, earlier, the [[Imperial Conference]]s and Colonial Conferences, dating back to 1887. There are also regular meetings of finance ministers, law ministers, health ministers, etc. Members in arrears, as special members before them, are not invited to send representatives to either ministerial meetings or CHOGMs.<ref name="Report of the CCM" />

The head of government hosting the CHOGM is called the [[Commonwealth Chair-in-Office|Chair-in-Office (CIO)]] and retains the position until the following CHOGM.  Since [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018|the most recent CHOGM]], in the United Kingdom in 2018, the Chair-in-Office has been the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/how-we-are-run|title=How we are run|website=The Commonwealth|accessdate=17 November 2020}}</ref>

The next (26th) CHOGM was to have been held in [[Kigali]], Rwanda, in June 2020.  Owing to the [[COVID-19]] epidemic, it is now scheduled to be held there in the week of 21 June 2021.  It will be accompanied by meetings of a Commonwealth Youth Forum, a Commonwealth Women's Forum and a Commonwealth People's Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecommonwealth.org/chogm|title=Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)|website=The Commonwealth|accessdate=17 November 2020}}</ref>

===Commonwealth Secretariat===
{{main|Commonwealth Secretariat}}
[[File:Marlborough House.jpg|thumb|[[Marlborough House]], London, the headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the Commonwealth's principal intergovernmental institution]]
The [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], established in 1965, is the main intergovernmental agency of the Commonwealth, facilitating consultation and co-operation among member governments and countries. It is responsible to member governments collectively. The Commonwealth of Nations is represented in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] by the secretariat as an [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer]]. The secretariat organises Commonwealth summits, meetings of ministers, consultative meetings and technical discussions; it assists policy development and provides policy advice, and facilitates multilateral communication among the member governments. It also provides technical assistance to help governments in the social and economic development of their countries and in support of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values.<ref name="Paxton, 1978">Cook and Paxton, ''Commonwealth Political Facts'' (1978) part 3.</ref>

The secretariat is headed by the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] who is elected by [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Commonwealth heads of government]] for no more than two four-year terms. The secretary-general and two deputy secretaries-general direct the divisions of the Secretariat. The present secretary-general is [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal]], from [[Dominica]], who took office on 1 April 2016, succeeding [[Kamalesh Sharma]] of [[India]] (2008–2016). The first secretary-general was [[Arnold Smith]] of [[Canada]] (1965–75), followed by Sir [[Shridath Ramphal]] of [[Guyana]] (1975–90), Chief [[Emeka Anyaoku]] of [[Nigeria]] (1990–99), and [[Don McKinnon]] of [[New Zealand]] (2000–2008).<ref name="Paxton, 1978" />

=== Commonwealth citizenship and high commissioners ===
{{Main|Commonwealth citizen|High commissioner (Commonwealth)}}

In recognition of their shared heritage and culture, Commonwealth countries are not considered to be "foreign" to each other,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=William|date=July 1982|title=Is the Commonwealth an International Organisation?|journal=[[International and Comparative Law Quarterly]]|volume=31|issue=3|pages=451–73|doi=10.1093/iclqaj/31.3.451}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Clute|first1=Robert E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Robert R.|date=July 1958|title=Commonwealth and Favored-Nation Usage|journal=[[American Journal of International Law]]|volume=52|issue=3|pages=455–468|doi=10.2307/2195461|jstor=2195461}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hedley|first=Bull|date=July 1959|title=What is the Commonwealth?|journal=[[World Politics]]|volume=11|issue=4|pages=577–87|doi=10.2307/2009593|jstor=2009593}}</ref> although the technical extent of this concept varies in different countries. For example, in Australia, for the purpose of considering certain constitutional and legal provisions no distinction is made between Commonwealth and foreign countries: in the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case of ''[[Sue v Hill]]'', other Commonwealth countries were held to be foreign powers; similarly, in ''Nolan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs'', the nationals of other Commonwealth realms were held to be 'aliens'. Nevertheless, the closer association amongst Commonwealth countries is reflected at least in the diplomatic protocols of the Commonwealth countries. For example, when engaging bilaterally with one another, Commonwealth governments exchange [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioners]] instead of [[ambassador]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Lorna |title=Diplomacy with a Difference: The Commonwealth Office of High Commissioner, 1880-2006 |date=2007 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=978-90-04-15497-1 |pages=119–120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4z5Qj-7HZ68C |access-date=18 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

In addition, some members treat resident citizens of other Commonwealth countries preferentially to citizens of non-Commonwealth countries. Britain and several others, mostly in the [[Caribbean]], grant [[Right of foreigners to vote|the right to vote]] to Commonwealth citizens who reside in those countries. In non-Commonwealth countries in which their own country is not represented, Commonwealth citizens may seek [[consular assistance]] at the British embassy although it is for the embassy to decide, in its discretion, whether to provide any.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224126/FCOBritsAbroadA4_0713xx.pdf |title=Support for British nationals abroad: a guide |publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office |page=5 |quote=We may also help Commonwealth nationals in non-Commonwealth countries where they do not have any diplomatic or consular representation, but will normally ask their nearest embassy to provide any ongoing assistance required. |year=2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019062503/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224126/FCOBritsAbroadA4_0713xx.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013  }}</ref> Other alternatives can also occur such as an emergency consular services agreement between Canada and Australia that began in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/consular/framework/canada-australia|title=Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement|work=Travel.gc.ca|access-date=25 September 2014|date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

==Membership==

===Criteria===
{{main| Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria}}
The criteria for membership of the Commonwealth of Nations have developed over time from a series of separate documents. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], as a fundamental founding document of the organisation, laid out that membership required dominionhood. The 1949 [[London Declaration]] ended this, allowing republican and indigenous monarchic members on the condition that they recognised the British monarch as "[[Head of the Commonwealth]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Smith|first=S.A.|date=July 1949|title=The London Declaration of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, 28 April 1949|journal=The Modern Law Review|volume=12|issue=3|pages=351–354|jstor=1090506|author-link=Stanley Alexander de Smith|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1949.tb00131.x}}</ref> In the wake of the wave of [[decolonisation]] in the 1960s, these constitutional principles were augmented by political, economic, and social principles. The first of these was set out in 1961, when it was decided that respect for [[racial equality]] would be a requirement for membership, leading directly to the withdrawal of South Africa's re-application (which they were required to make under the formula of the London Declaration upon becoming a republic). The 14 points of the 1971 [[Singapore Declaration]] dedicated all members to the principles of [[world peace]], [[liberty]], [[human rights]], [[egalitarianism|equality]], and [[free trade]].<ref name="Singapore Declaration text"/>

These criteria were unenforceable for two decades,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams |first=Paul D.|date=July 2005|title=Blair's Britain and the Commonwealth|journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]]|volume=94|issue=380|pages=381–391|doi=10.1080/00358530500174960|s2cid=154400556}}</ref> until, in 1991, the [[Harare Declaration]] was issued, dedicating the leaders to applying the Singapore principles to the completion of decolonisation, the end of the [[Cold War]], and the end of [[apartheid]] in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=34457 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207030954/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=34457 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 February 2004 |date=20 October 1991 |title=Harare Commonwealth Declaration |access-date=29 July 2007 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |df= }}</ref> The mechanisms by which these principles would be applied were created, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], which created the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether members meet the requirements for membership under the Harare Declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/38125/cmag|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930122424/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/38125/cmag/|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 September 2006|title=Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group|access-date=29 July 2007|publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]]}}</ref> Also in 1995, an Inter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full requirements for membership. Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under the [[Edinburgh Declaration]], the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future members would have to have a direct constitutional link with an existing member.<ref name="The future of the modern Commonwealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/future_aide.pdf|title=The future of the modern Commonwealth: Widening vs. deepening?|access-date=29 July 2007|date=10 October 2005|first=Victoria|last=te Velde-Ashworth|publisher=Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070722134850/http://www.cpsu.org.uk/downloads/future_aide.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2007}}</ref>

In addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single document. These requirements are that members must accept and comply with the [[Harare Declaration|Harare principles]], be fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states, recognise the monarch of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s as the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], accept the [[English language]] as the means of Commonwealth communication, and respect the wishes of the general population with regard to Commonwealth membership.<ref name="The future of the modern Commonwealth"/> These requirements had undergone review, and a report on potential amendments was presented by the [[Committee on Commonwealth Membership]] at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007|2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/157526/commonwealth_membership_in_focus_at_london_meeting.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313234502/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/157526/commonwealth_membership_in_focus_at_london_meeting.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 March 2007 |title=Commonwealth membership in focus at London meeting |access-date=29 July 2007 |date=6 December 2006 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |df= }}</ref> New members were not admitted at this meeting, though applications for admission were considered at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2009|2009 CHOGM]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Osike |first=Felix |title=Rwanda membership delayed |url=http://www.sundayvision.co.ug/detail.php?mainNewsCategoryId=7&newsCategoryId=123&newsId=598876 |newspaper=[[New Vision]] |date=24 November 2007 |access-date=29 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123172352/http://www.sundayvision.co.ug/detail.php?mainNewsCategoryId=7&newsCategoryId=123&newsId=598876 |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>

New members must "as a general rule" have a direct constitutional link to an existing member. In most cases, this is due to being a former colony of the United Kingdom, but some have links to other countries, either exclusively or more directly (e.g. [[Samoa]] to New Zealand, [[Papua New Guinea]] to Australia, and [[Namibia]] to South Africa). The first member to be admitted without having any constitutional link to the British Empire or a Commonwealth member was [[Mozambique]], a former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]], in 1995 following its first democratic elections and South Africa's re-admission in 1994. Mozambique's controversial entry led to the [[Edinburgh Declaration]] and the current membership guidelines.<ref name="New Times">{{cite news |title=Rwanda: Joining the Commonwealth|newspaper=[[The New Times (Rwanda)|The New Times]] |publisher=AllAfrica|date=27 November 2009}}</ref> In 2009, [[Rwanda]] became the second Commonwealth member admitted not to have any such constitutional links.

In 2019, the Commonwealth members had a combined [[gross domestic product]] of over $9&nbsp;trillion, 78% of which is accounted for by the four largest economies: [[India]] ($3.010&nbsp;trillion), [[United Kingdom]] ($2.743&nbsp;trillion),  [[Canada]] ($1.652&nbsp;trillion), and [[Australia]] ($1.379&nbsp;trillion).<ref name="GDP IMF">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=32&pr.y=19&sy=2015&ey=2016&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512%2C672%2C914%2C946%2C612%2C137%2C614%2C546%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C199%2C646%2C733%2C648%2C184%2C915%2C524%2C134%2C361%2C652%2C362%2C174%2C364%2C328%2C732%2C258%2C366%2C656%2C734%2C654%2C144%2C336%2C146%2C263%2C463%2C268%2C528%2C532%2C923%2C944%2C738%2C176%2C578%2C534%2C537%2C536%2C742%2C429%2C866%2C433%2C369%2C178%2C744%2C436%2C186%2C136%2C925%2C343%2C869%2C158%2C746%2C439%2C926%2C916%2C466%2C664%2C112%2C826%2C111%2C542%2C298%2C967%2C927%2C443%2C846%2C917%2C299%2C544%2C582%2C941%2C474%2C446%2C754%2C666%2C698%2C668&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a=|title=World Economic Outlook Database|date=18 April 2017|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}</ref>

===Applicants===
{{see also|Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria#Prospective members}}

In 1997 the Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed that, to become a member of the Commonwealth, an applicant country should, as a rule, have had a constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member; that it should comply with Commonwealth values, principles and priorities as set out in the [[Harare Declaration]]; and that it should accept Commonwealth norms and conventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/history-of-the-commonwealth/new-criteria-commonwealth-membership|title=New Criteria for Commonwealth Membership|work=thecommonwealth.org}}</ref>

At the time of the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, in the face of colonial unrest and international tensions, French Premier [[Guy Mollet]] proposed to British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] that their two countries be [[Franco-British Union#Suez Crisis (1956)|joined in a "union"]]. When that proposal was turned down, Mollet suggested that France join the Commonwealth, possibly with "a common citizenship arrangement [[British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland|on the Irish basis]]".

===Suspension===
{{Main|Suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations}}

In recent years, the Commonwealth has suspended several members "from the Councils of the Commonwealth" for "serious or persistent violations" of the [[Harare Declaration]], particularly in abrogating their responsibility to have democratic government.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Colvile |first=Robert |date=July 2004 |title=A Place to Stand: the Problems and Potential of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=375 |pages=343–53 |url= |access-date= |quote= |doi=10.1080/0035853042000249942|s2cid=153984328 }}</ref> This is done by the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] (CMAG), which meets regularly to address potential breaches of the Harare Declaration.

===Termination===
As membership is purely voluntary, member governments can choose at any time to leave the Commonwealth. [[Pakistan]] left on 30 January 1972 in protest at the Commonwealth's recognition of breakaway [[Bangladesh]], but rejoined on 2 August 1989. Zimbabwe's membership was suspended in 2002 on the grounds of [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|alleged human rights violations]] and deliberate misgovernment, and Zimbabwe's government terminated its membership in 2003.<ref>[http://www.thecommonwealth.org/press/31555/34582/35505/zimbabwes_withdrawal_from_the_commonwealth.htm Commonwealth website confirms Zimbabwe "terminated" its membership with effect from 7 December 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162909/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/press/31555/34582/35505/zimbabwes_withdrawal_from_the_commonwealth.htm |date=5 July 2008 }}</ref> [[The Gambia]] left the Commonwealth on 3 October 2013,<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/> and rejoined on 8 February 2018.<ref name=gambia>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/gambia-rejoins-commonwealth|title=The Gambia rejoins the Commonwealth|date=8 February 2018|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat}}</ref> The Maldives withdrew from the Commonwealth on 13 October 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/secretary-general-statement-maldives-decision-leave-commonwealth|title=The Commonwealth Secretariat|last=|first=|date=13 October 2016|website=|access-date=13 October 2016}}</ref> The [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Maldives)|Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] stated that "the Commonwealth has not recognised [...] the progress and achievements that the Maldives accomplished in cultivating a culture of democracy in the country and in building and strengthening democratic institutions".<ref name="mfa">{{cite web|url=http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v2/en/media-center/news/article/1999 |title=The Maldives decides to leave the Commonwealth; commits to continue with its international engagement |publisher=Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=13 October 2016 |access-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014060506/http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v2/en/media-center/news/article/1999 |archivedate=14 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> The Ministry also cited the Commonwealth's "punitive actions against the Maldives since 2012" after the allegedly forced resignation of Maldivian President [[Mohamed Nasheed]] among the reasons for withdrawal.<ref name="mfa"/> The Ministry characterized the decision to withdraw as "difficult, but inevitable".<ref name="mfa"/> Following the election of [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] as president in November 2018, the Maldives announced its intention to reapply to join the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/maldives-to-rejoin-commonwealth-of-former-british-colonies-1.793718|title=Maldives to rejoin Commonwealth of former British colonies|last=|first=|date=20 November 2018|work=The National|access-date=23 November 2018|language=en}}</ref> They rejoined on 1 February 2020.

Although heads of government have the power to suspend member states from active participation, the Commonwealth has no provision for the expulsion of members.

Until 1948, there was a consensus among the existing half-dozen Commonwealth members that [[Commonwealth realm]]s that became a republic would cease to be members but the situation changed in 1948 when newly independent India announced its intention to become a republic on 1 January 1950 although it wished to remain in the Commonwealth. This was granted. Now, the majority of the Commonwealth members, including all those from Africa, are republics or have their own native monarch.

[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] withdrew from participation in the Commonwealth in the 1930s, attending its last Commonwealth governmental heads' meeting in 1932. For some years Ireland considered itself to be a republic outside the Commonwealth but the Commonwealth considered Ireland to still be a Commonwealth member. Its treatment as a member ended on 18 April 1949 when Irish legislation that the Commonwealth chose to regard as having caused Ireland to become a republic became law. It is the only country whose membership terminated without any declaration withdrawing from the organisation. Instead, it was (with its own tacit support) excluded from the organisation.

[[South Africa]] was barred from continuing as a member after it became a republic in 1961, due to hostility from many members, particularly those in Africa and Asia as well as Canada, to its policy of racial [[apartheid]]. The South African government withdrew its application to remain in the organisation as a republic when it became clear at the [[1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] that any such application would be rejected. South Africa was re-admitted to the Commonwealth in 1994, following its [[1994 South African general election|first multiracial elections]] that year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Commonwealth Observer Group|title=The National and Provincial Elections in South Africa, 2 June 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vOVHuLGt-YwC&pg=PA7|year=1999|page=7|isbn=9780850926262}}</ref>

The [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997 ended the colony's status as a part of the Commonwealth through the United Kingdom. Non-sovereign states or regions are not permitted to become members of the Commonwealth. The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has not pursued membership. Hong Kong has nevertheless continued to participate in some of the organisations of the [[#Commonwealth Family|Commonwealth family]], such as the [[Commonwealth Lawyers Association]] (hosted the Commonwealth Lawyers Conference in 1983 and 2009), the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] (and the Westminster Seminar on Parliamentary Practice and Procedures), the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.gov.au/calc/constit.htm |title=Office of Parliamentary Counsel – CALC – Constitution & Membership |date=11 March 2011 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311223653/http://www.opc.gov.au/calc/constit.htm |archivedate=11 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.gov.au/calc/docs/LDOs.pdf |title=OPC.gov.au |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311234928/http://www.opc.gov.au/calc/docs/LDOs.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2011 }}</ref> as well as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC).

The Commonwealth's objectives were first outlined in the 1971 [[Singapore Declaration]], which committed the Commonwealth to the institution of [[world peace]]; promotion of [[representative democracy]] and [[individual liberty]]; the pursuit of equality and opposition to racism; the fight against poverty, ignorance, and disease; and [[free trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/sites/default/files/history-items/documents/Singapore%20Declaration.pdf|date=22 January 1971|title=Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles 1971|access-date=15 November 2013|work=thecommonwealth.org|publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]]}}</ref> To these were added opposition to discrimination on the basis of gender by the [[Lusaka Declaration]] of 1979,<ref name="Singapore Declaration text">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/35776/lusaka.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930123038/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/35776/lusaka.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 September 2006|title=Lusaka Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice|access-date=3 April 2008|date=7 August 1979|publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] }}</ref> and [[environmental sustainability]] by the [[Langkawi Declaration]] of 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpages.net.my/node/4|title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment|access-date=3 April 2008|date=21 October 1989 |publisher=USM Regional Center of Expertise in Education for Sustainable Development}}</ref> These objectives were reinforced by the [[Harare Declaration]] in 1991.<ref>Hasu Patel, "Southern Africa and democracy, in the light of the Harare declaration." ''The Round Table'' 89.357 (2000): 585–592.</ref>

The Commonwealth's current highest-priority aims are on the promotion of democracy and development, as outlined in the 2003 [[Aso Rock|Aso Rock Declaration]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150952/our_work |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820140553/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150952/our_work/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 August 2006 |title=Our Work |access-date=3 April 2008 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |df= }}</ref> which built on those in Singapore and Harare and clarified their terms of reference, stating, "We are committed to democracy, good governance, human rights, gender equality, and a more equitable sharing of the benefits of globalisation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7BE7A2A23D-FD9F-418B-B2D4-CC39FFD2FEF2%7D_Aso%20Rock%20Declaration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613105849/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7BE7A2A23D-FD9F-418B-B2D4-CC39FFD2FEF2%7D_Aso%20Rock%20Declaration.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 June 2006 |title=Aso Rock Commonwealth Declaration |access-date=3 April 2008 |date=8 December 2003 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |df= }}</ref> The Commonwealth website lists its areas of work as: democracy, economics, education, gender, governance, human rights, law, small states, sport, sustainability, and youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org|title=Commonwealth Secretariat|access-date=3 April 2008|date=7 August 1979|publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]]}}</ref>

Through a separate voluntary fund, Commonwealth governments support the [[Commonwealth Youth Programme]], a division of the Secretariat with offices in [[Gulu]] (Uganda), [[Lusaka]] (Zambia), [[Chandigarh]] (India), [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] (Guyana) and [[Honiara]] (Solomon Islands).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Competence===
In recent years, the Commonwealth has been accused of not being vocal enough on its core values. Allegations of a leaked memo from the Secretary General instructing staff not to speak out on human rights were published in October 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/oct/08/commonwealth-human-rights-leaked-document|title=Commonwealth has abandoned human rights commitment – leaked memo|first1=Julian|last1=Borger|first2=diplomatic|last2=editor|date=8 October 2010|publisher=|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011]] considered a report by a [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] (EPG) panel which asserted that the organisation had lost its relevance and was decaying due to the lack of a mechanism to censure member countries when they violated human rights or democratic norms.<ref name=star30/> The panel made 106 "urgent" recommendations including the adoption of a Charter of the Commonwealth, the creation of a new commissioner on the rule of law, democracy and human rights to track persistent human rights abuses and allegations of political repression by Commonwealth member states, recommendations for the repeal of [[LGBT rights by country or territory|laws against]] [[homosexuality]] in 41 Commonwealth states and a ban on [[forced marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Cheadle|first=Bruce|title=Commonwealth leaders still haggling over human rights reforms |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1078175--commonwealth-leaders-still-haggling-over-human-rights-reforms?bn=1|access-date=29 October 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=29 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=2011Meeting>{{cite news|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=Commonwealth leaders under fire for refusing to publish human rights report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/29/commonwealth-meeting-human-rights-disgrace |access-date=29 October 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 October 2011}}</ref> The failure to release the report, or accept its recommendations for reforms in the area of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, was decried as a "disgrace" by former British Foreign Secretary Sir [[Malcolm Rifkind]], a member of the EPG, who told a press conference: "The Commonwealth faces a very significant problem. It's not a problem of hostility or antagonism, it's more of a problem of indifference. Its purpose is being questioned, its relevance is being questioned and part of that is because its commitment to enforce the values for which it stands is becoming ambiguous in the eyes of many member states. The Commonwealth is not a private club of the governments or the secretariat. It belongs to the people of the Commonwealth."<ref name=2011Meeting/>

In the end, two-thirds of the EPG's 106 urgently recommended reforms were referred to study groups, an act described by one EPG member as having them "kicked into the long grass". There was no agreement to create the recommended position of human rights commissioner, instead a ministerial management group was empowered with enforcement: the group includes alleged human rights offenders. It was agreed to develop a charter of values for the Commonwealth without any decision on how compliance with its principles would be enforced.<ref name=star30>{{cite news|last=Cheadle|first=Bruce|title=Commonwealth leaders agree to develop charter of values and little else|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1078397--commonwealth-leaders-agree-to-develop-charter-of-values-and-little-else?bn=1|access-date=30 October 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star |date=30 October 2011}}</ref>

The result of the effort was that a new [[Charter of the Commonwealth]] was signed by Queen Elizabeth on 11 March 2013 at Marlborough House, which opposes "all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/queen-to-sign-new-charter-backing-equal-rights-for-gay-people-across-commonwealth-8528587.html|title=Queen to sign new charter backing equal rights for gay people across Commonwealth|publisher=Standard.co.uk|date=11 March 2013|access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-11/uk/37622297_1_gay-rights-equal-rights-commonwealth-secretary-general-kamalesh-sharma|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411035652/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-11/uk/37622297_1_gay-rights-equal-rights-commonwealth-secretary-general-kamalesh-sharma|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 April 2013|title=Commonwealth charter to focus on gay rights|publisher=The Times of India|date=11 March 2013|access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref>

===Postwar===
During the Second World War, the Commonwealth played a major role in helping British finances.  Foreign exchange reserves were pooled in London, to be used to fight the war.  In effect Britain procured £2.3&nbsp;billion, of which £1.3&nbsp;billion was from India.  The debt was held in the form of British government securities and became known as "sterling balances". By 1950, India, Pakistan and Ceylon had spent much of their sterling, while other countries accumulated more. The sterling area that included all of the Commonwealth except for Canada, together with some smaller countries especially in the Persian Gulf.  They held their foreign-exchange in sterling, protecting that currency from runs, and facilitating trade and investment inside the Commonwealth.  It was a formal relationship with fixed exchange rates, and periodic meetings at Commonwealth summits to coordinate trade policy, and domestic economic policies.  Britain ran a trade surplus, and the other countries were mostly producers of raw materials sold to Britain.  However the commercial rationale was gradually less attractive to the Commonwealth.  Access to the growing London capital market, however, remained an important advantage to the newly independent nations.  As Britain moved increasingly close to Europe, however, the long-term ties began to be in doubt.<ref>Catherine R. Schenk,  "Britain in the world economy." in Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds., ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939–2000'' (2005): 436–481, esp. 469-71.</ref>

====UK joins the European Economic Community====
Britain had focused on the Commonwealth after the war, and largely ignored links with Europe.  By the 1960s with a sluggish economy Britain tried repeatedly to join the [[European Economic Community]], but this was repeatedly vetoed by [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref>Alan S. Milward, ''The rise and fall of a national strategy, 1945–1963'' (2002).</ref> After his death, [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|entry was finally achieved in 1972.]] Queen Elizabeth was one of the few remaining links between the UK and the Commonwealth. She tried to reassure the other countries that the Commonwealth family was joining forces with the Europeans, and that the new links would not replace the old Commonwealth ties based on historical attachments, which were too sacred to break.  Historian [[Ben Pimlott]] argues that she was mistaken, for joining Europe, "constituted the most decisive step yet in the progress of severance of familial ties between Britain and its former Empire....It reduced the remaining links to sentimental and cultural ones, and legal niceties."<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben Pimlott|title=The Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkhSn5Fi7c4C|year=1998|page=416|isbn=9780471283300}}</ref>

The newly independent countries of Africa and Asia concentrated on their own internal political and economic development, and sometimes with their role in the [[Cold War]].  The United States, international agencies, and the Soviet Union became important players, and the British role receded. Indeed, the British considered them burdensome and were themselves alienated from traditional imperialism.

===Trade===

Although the Commonwealth does not have a multilateral trade agreement, research by the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] has shown that [[trade]] with another Commonwealth member is up to 50% more than with a non-member on average, with smaller and less wealthy states having a higher propensity to trade within the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thercs.org/assets/Uploads/Trading-Places-the-Commonwealth-effect-revisited.pdf|title=Trading Places: The "Commonwealth effect" revisited, p. 9.}}</ref> At the 2005 Summit in Malta, the heads of government endorsed pursuing free trade among Commonwealth members on a bilateral basis.<ref name=VallettaStatement>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/190628/163075/147476/valletta_statement_on_multilateral_trade.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415225827/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/190628/163075/147476/valletta_statement_on_multilateral_trade.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 April 2013 |title=Commonwealth Secretariat – Valletta Statement on Multilateral Trade |publisher=Thecommonwealth.org |date=26 November 2005 |access-date=27 September 2012 }}</ref>

==Commonwealth Family==
{{main|Commonwealth Family}}
Commonwealth countries share many links outside government, with over a hundred Commonwealth-wide non-governmental organisations, notably for sport, culture, education, law and charity. The [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] is an important vehicle for academic links, particularly through scholarships, principally the [[Commonwealth Scholarship]], for students to study in [[university|universities]] in other Commonwealth countries. There are also many non-official associations that bring together individuals who work within the spheres of law and government, such as the [[Commonwealth Lawyers Association]] and the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]].

===Commonwealth Foundation===
{{main|Commonwealth Foundation}}
The [[Commonwealth Foundation]] is an intergovernmental organisation, resourced by and reporting to Commonwealth governments, and guided by Commonwealth values and priorities. Its mandate is to strengthen civil society in the achievement of Commonwealth priorities: democracy and good governance, respect for human rights and gender equality, poverty eradication, people-centred and sustainable development, and to promote arts and culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Foundation was established in 1965 by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]]. Admittance is open to all members of the Commonwealth, and in December 2008, stood at 46 out of the 53 member countries. Associate Membership, which is open to associated states or overseas territories of member governments, has been granted to Gibraltar. 2005 saw celebrations for the Foundation's 40th Anniversary. The Foundation is headquartered in [[Marlborough House]], [[Pall Mall, London]]. Regular liaison and co-operation between the Secretariat and the Foundation is in place.

===Commonwealth Games===
{{main|Commonwealth Games}}
[[File:Rugby melbourne commonwealth games.jpg|thumb|The Commonwealth Games are the third-largest multi-sport event in the world, bringing together globally popular sports and peculiarly "Commonwealth" sports, such as [[rugby sevens]], shown here at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Games]].]]
The [[Commonwealth Games]], a [[multi-sport event]], is held every four years; the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] were held in [[Glasgow, Scotland]], and the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast, Australia]]. [[Birmingham]] is set to be the host for [[2022 Commonwealth Games]]. As well as the usual athletic disciplines, as at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], the games include sports particularly popular in the Commonwealth, such as [[bowls]], [[netball]], and [[rugby sevens]].

[[File:Azmak Cemetery, Gallipoli Peninsula.JPG|thumb|The [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] serves to commemorate 1.7&nbsp;million Commonwealth war dead and maintains 2,500 war cemeteries around the world, including this one in [[Gallipoli]].]]
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is responsible for maintaining the [[war grave]]s of 1.7&nbsp;million service personnel that died in the First and Second World Wars fighting for Commonwealth member states. Founded in 1917 (as the Imperial War Graves Commission), the commission has constructed 2,500 [[war cemetery|war cemeteries]], and maintains individual graves at another 20,000 sites around the world.<ref name="Ten Key Things About War Graves">{{cite news|title=Ten Key Things About War Graves|first=Annie|last=Dare|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 October 2000|page=29}}</ref> The vast majority of the latter are civilian cemeteries in Britain.

=== Commonwealth Local Government Forum ===
{{Main|Commonwealth Local Government Forum}}

The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) is a global local government organisation, bringing together local authorities, their national associations and the ministries responsible for local government in the member countries of the Commonwealth. CLGF works with national and [[local government]]s to support the development of [[Democracy|democratic values]] and good local governance and is the associated organisation officially recognised by [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] as the representative body for local government in the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/organisation/commonwealth-local-government-forum-clgf|title=Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) {{!}} The Commonwealth|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>

CLGF is unique in bringing together central, provincial and local spheres of government involved in local government policy and decision-making. CLGF members include local government associations, individual local authorities, ministries dealing with local government, and research and professional organisations who work with local government. Practitioner to practitioner support is at the core of CLGF's work across the Commonwealth and within the region, using CLGF's own members to support others both within and between regions. CLGF is a member of the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, the formal partner of the UN Major Group of Local Authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtf2016.org/about-us|title=Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments|last=|first=|date=|website=globaltaskforce|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>

==Culture==
Many Commonwealth nations possess traditions and customs that are elements of a shared Commonwealth culture. Examples include common sports such as [[cricket]] and [[rugby football|rugby]], [[driving on the left]], the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary democracy]], [[common law]], [[List of countries by English-speaking population|widespread use of the English language]], [[List of countries where English is an official language|designation of English as an official language]], [[Military rank|military and naval ranks]], and the use of British rather than American spelling conventions (see [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Sport===
Many Commonwealth nations play similar [[sports]] that are considered quintessentially British in character, rooted in and developed under British rule or hegemony, including [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[netball]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perkin|first=Harold|date=September 1989|title=Teaching the nations how to play: sport and society in the British Empire and Commonwealth |journal=International Journal of the History of Sport|volume=6|issue=2|pages=145–155|doi=10.1080/09523368908713685}}</ref> This has led to the development of friendly national rivalries between the main sporting nations that have often defined their relations with each other.

In 1987, the Commonwealth Foundation established the annual [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] "to encourage and reward the upsurge of new Commonwealth fiction and ensure that works of merit reach a wider audience outside their country of origin". Prizes are awarded for the best book and best first book in the Commonwealth; there are also regional prizes for the best book and best first book in each of four regions. Although not officially affiliated with the Commonwealth, the prestigious annual [[Booker Prize|Man Booker Prize]], one of the highest honours in literature,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Empire Writes Back|first=Pico|last=Iyer|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=12 February 1993|page=1}}</ref> used to be awarded only to authors from Commonwealth countries or former members such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

There had been a few important works in English prior to 1950 from the then [[British Empire]]. From 1950 on, a significant number of writers from the countries of the Commonwealth began gaining international recognition, including some who migrated to the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[South African literature|South African writer]] [[Olive Schreiner]]'s famous novel ''[[The Story of an African Farm]]'' was published in 1883 and [[New Zealand literature|New Zealander]] [[Katherine Mansfield]] published her first collection of short stories, ''In a German Pension'', in 1911. The first major novelist, writing in English, from the [[Indian English literature|Indian sub-continent]], [[R. K. Narayan]], began publishing in England in the 1930s, thanks to the encouragement of English novelist [[Graham Greene]].<ref>{{cite book| editor-last=Drabble|editor-first=Margaret|title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford U.P.|year=1996}}</ref> [[Caribbean literature|Caribbean writer]] [[Jean Rhys]]'s writing career began as early as 1928, though her most famous work, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'', was not published until 1966. South Africa's [[Alan Paton]]'s famous ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' dates from 1948. [[Doris Lessing]] from [[Southern Rhodesia]], now [[Zimbabwe]], was a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing from 1950 on throughout the 20th century. She won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2007/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2007|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref>

[[Salman Rushdie]] is another post-Second World War writer from the former British colonies who [[Migrant literature|permanently settled in Britain]]. Rushdie achieved fame with ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981). His most controversial novel, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. [[V. S. Naipaul]] (born 1932), born in [[Trinidad]], was another immigrant, who wrote among other things ''[[A Bend in the River]]'' (1979). Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001.<ref name="nobelweb">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2001/ | work = Literature | title = 2001 Laureates |publisher= The Nobel prize}}</ref>

Many other Commonwealth writers have achieved an international reputation for works in English, including [[Nigerian literature|Nigerian]] novelist [[Chinua Achebe]], and playwright [[Wole Soyinka]]. Soyinka won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, as did [[South Africa]]n novelist [[Nadine Gordimer]] in 1995. Other South African writers in English are novelist [[J. M. Coetzee]] (Nobel Prize 2003) and playwright [[Athol Fugard]]. [[Kenyan literature|Kenya]]'s most internationally renowned author is [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], who has written novels, plays and short stories in English. Poet [[Derek Walcott]], from [[Saint Lucia]] in the Caribbean, was another Nobel Prize winner in 1992. An [[Australian literature|Australian]], [[Patrick White]], a major novelist in this period, whose first work was published in 1939, won in 1973.

===Political system===
Due to their shared constitutional histories, several countries in the Commonwealth have similar legal and political systems. The Commonwealth requires its members to be functioning democracies that respect [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]. Most Commonwealth countries have the bicameral [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] facilitates co-operation between legislatures across the Commonwealth, and the [[Commonwealth Local Government Forum]] promotes [[good governance]] amongst [[local government]] officials. Most Commonwealth members use [[common law]], modelled on [[English law]]. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the [[supreme court]] of 14 Commonwealth members.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Statesman's Yearbook 2017: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBs9DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|page=46|isbn=9781349683987}}</ref>

===Symbols===
The Commonwealth has adopted a number of symbols that represent the association of its members. The English language is recognised as a symbol of the members' heritage; as well as being considered a symbol of the Commonwealth, recognition of it as "the means of Commonwealth communication" is a prerequisite for Commonwealth membership. The [[flag of the Commonwealth]] consists of the symbol of the Commonwealth Secretariat, a gold globe surrounded by emanating rays, on a dark blue field; it was designed for the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973|second CHOGM]] in 1973, and officially adopted on 26 March 1976. 1976 also saw the organisation agree to a common date on which to commemorate [[Commonwealth Day]], the second Monday in March, having developed separately on different dates from [[Empire Day]] celebrations.<ref>''Flags of All Nations: Flags of the British Commonwealth of Nations'' (Brown, Son & Ferguson, 1952)</ref>

===Recognition===
In 2009, to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Commonwealth, the [[Royal Commonwealth Society]] commissioned a poll of public opinion in seven of the member states: Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, South Africa and the United Kingdom.  It found that most people in these countries were largely ignorant of the Commonwealth's activities, aside from the [[Commonwealth Games]], and indifferent toward its future.  Support for the Commonwealth was twice as high in developing countries as in developed countries; it was lowest in Britain.<ref>[https://thercs.org/assets/Research-/Commonwealth-Conversation-Final-Report.pdf Royal Commonwealth Society, ''An Uncommon Association, a Wealth of Potential:  Final Report of the Commonwealth Conversation'' (London, Royal Commonwealth Society, 2010)]</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/canada-commonwealth-and-the-key-to-relevance/article4279734/ |title=Canada, Commonwealth and the key to relevance |publisher=The Globe and Mail |access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Renzetti |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/commonwealth-quaint-historical-relic-or-meaningful-bloc/article4279618/ |title=Commonwealth: quaint historical relic or meaningful bloc? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7931706.stm |title=Queen marks Commonwealth launch |work=BBC News |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Commonwealth Anthem===
Also to mark the 60th anniversary (Diamond Jubilee) of the Commonwealth in 2009, the Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned Paul Carroll to compose "The Commonwealth Anthem". The lyrics of the Anthem are taken from the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealth-music-council.net/sapphire-jubilee-celebration-cd.html|title=A Celebration of Her Majesty's Sapphire Jubilee|website=Commonwealth Music Council|date=2016}}</ref> The Commonwealth has published the Anthem, performed by the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra, with and without an introductory narrative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp4PCicIJl4|title=Commonwealth Anthem (with introductory narrative)|date=13 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rns3N4nfo7I|title=Windsor Suite Commonwealth Anthem|date=20 March 2018}}</ref><!--credit to [[User:Demelza381|Demelza381]]-->
