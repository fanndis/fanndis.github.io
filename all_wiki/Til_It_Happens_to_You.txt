"'''Til It Happens to You'''" is a song produced and performed by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. She co-wrote the song with [[Diane Warren]] for the 2015 documentary film ''[[The Hunting Ground]]'', which deals with [[campus rape]] in the United States. The song had leaked onto the Internet through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was later released by [[Interscope Records]] to [[Music download|digital retailers]] on September 18, 2015. The director and producer of the film had looked for someone influential to write a song for it, and music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg contacted Warren, who was interested. She wrote the song with Gaga and producer [[Nile Rodgers]] accompanied them during the recording, providing his suggestions.

A universal song about any kind of loss in life, "Til It Happens to You" was placed during two sequences in the film, highlighting the pain of [[sexual assault]]. The song consists of an orchestral production with strings and an emotional vocal delivery from Gaga. Lyrically, it asks listeners to stand in a victim's position and try to understand the turmoil they go through. "Til It Happens to You" was later included as part of a [[public service announcement]] video directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]]. The video depicts various instances of [[violence against women]] and sexual assaults. It ends with a cautionary note about the effects of such distress, and individuals finding solace with their close friends and relatives.

A portion of the proceeds from retail sales was donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault. Commercially, the song reached the top thirty in Finland, Greece, and Spain, and it peaked at number 95 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in March 2016. "Til It Happens to You" won an award at the [[68th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics]] and it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]], along with numerous other awards.

"Til It Happens to You" was written by Diane Warren and Lady Gaga, and recorded by the latter for ''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' (2015), a documentary film about campus rape in the United States.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=Diane Warren on Her Lady Gaga Collaboration for New Documentary 'The Hunting Ground'|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|accessdate=May 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428095535/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6451064/diane-warren-lady-gaga-song-till-it-happens-to-you-hunting-ground|archivedate=April 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Director [[Kirby Dick]] and producer [[Amy Ziering]] wanted someone with "major" influence to record a song for the film, believing it would generate publicity and promote the subject. They contacted executive producer Paul Blavin, explaining their idea and added that they did not have the resources to find someone. Blavin started searching and met with music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg, who introduced him to Warren.<ref name="mtvdev"/> Warren was moved by the idea saying: "I cannot not <!-- THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.  SHE MEANT, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO NOT WRITE THE SONG. IT IS NOT INCORRECT. SEE -- AGAIN, A DOUBLE NEGATIVE ("NOT INCORRECT") FORMS A MORE EMPHATIC POSITIVE. --> write a song for you. And not only can I not not <!-- AGAIN, THIS IS NOT AN ERROR. IT IS NOT INCORRECT. -->write a song for this movie, I'm going to gift it to you." She wrote the song after viewing scenes from the film almost a year before the track's release.<ref name=Billboard/> Warren then called Gaga and played her a rough [[demo (music)|demo]], but was unsure about her involvement. So she decided to fly to New York and try to work with Gaga; the latter accepted the song and decided to record it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/songwriter-diane-warren-on-oscar-chances-and-why-she-loves-lady-gaga-20160223|title=Songwriter Diane Warren on Oscar Chances and Why She Loves Lady Gaga|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225201829/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/songwriter-diane-warren-on-oscar-chances-and-why-she-loves-lady-gaga-20160223|archivedate=February 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Warren said of the song and Gaga's contributions:

<blockquote>
"I heard about [the film] and it just really touched me, and she had stuff in her life that she could relate to. Gaga is one of the most talented artists I have worked with in my life and I'm excited about doing more with her... There are a lot of levels to the song. There's something very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [Gaga] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. 'Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it happens to you...'"<ref name=Billboard/>
</blockquote>

Warren also added that the song's message was universal in nature and relatable to any loss faced in life.<ref name=Billboard/> Gaga, who herself is a victim of rape,<ref name="mtvdev">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2059242/lady-gaga-the-hunting-ground-sundance/|title=Here's How Lady Gaga's Song About Sexual Assault Ended Up At Sundance|last=Murphy|first=Shaunna|date=January 26, 2015|accessdate=May 17, 2015|publisher=[[MTV News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221155826/http://www.mtv.com/news/2059242/lady-gaga-the-hunting-ground-sundance/|archivedate=February 21, 2016 }}</ref> revealed during the [[Producers Guild of America Awards 2015]], that the song's theme was important to her family as well.

The documentary features two versions of the song, one during the body of the film and the second at its closing, and highlights the sequences of the pain of [[sexual assault]].<ref name=Billboard/> While the song played, the lead subject, an assault survivor, reminisced about the impact of rape while walking around a college campus. Ziering concluded that having Gaga sing the track fulfilled their need for publicity since she "[brought] a whole other demographic.

In an interview for a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[podcast]], [[Nile Rodgers]] spoke about the song's recording sessions and working with Gaga and Warren. He had met Gaga at a party and she invited him to join them in the studio. During recording, Gaga was singing in a [[D (musical note)|D]] note, over the [[F (musical note)|F]] note of the music that was being played. Rodgers suggested to Warren that since the D vocals made the song sound like a [[country music|country]] track, they could instead inverse the chords into [[thirteenth]] (an [[octave]] plus a sixth), thus serving a [[dominant (music)|dominant]] [[diatonic function|function]].

Warren explained that it was: "very emotional for her. She couldn't even talk through it at times".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/celebrities_gossip/20150921_WENN_Rape_survivor_Lady_Gaga_broke_down_recording_Til_It_Happens_to_You.html|title=Rape survivor Lady Gaga broke down recording Til It Happens to You|date=September 23, 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2015|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923134635/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/celebrities_gossip/20150921_WENN_Rape_survivor_Lady_Gaga_broke_down_recording_Til_It_Happens_to_You.html|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gaga told an interviewer with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that Warren had helped her feel comfortable about the song and its subject matter, allowing her to transcend the singing and put the correct emotional depth in her performance.
<blockquote>
"When Diane first played me what she had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We talked a lot about what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely emotional state, but that it was going to somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.'"<ref name="varrev"/>

===Development and synopsis===
[[File:Catherine Hardwicke & Madison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Director [[Catherine Hardwicke]] tried to portray sexual assaults realistically in the video.|alt=Catherine Hardwicke smiling while signing DVDs]]

In August 2015, it was announced that the song would be released as part of a [[public service announcement]] (PSA) video, directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]], to raise awareness about sexual assaults in college campuses. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described it as casting "an emotional spotlight on young women in vulnerable situations that college students will readily recognize".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/music/a15619/lady-gaga-till-it-happens-to-you/|title=Lady Gaga Has a Powerful Message for Sexual Assault Survivors|last=Real|first=Evan|date=August 22, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015|work=Marie Claire|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824092523/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/music/a15619/lady-gaga-till-it-happens-to-you/|archivedate=August 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hardwicke said of the PSA's important message: "You can't watch the documentary without screaming at the screen. We tried to capture those stories in a very visceral way and add another voice to this powerful call to action." Production costs were underwritten by the film's executive producers, Paul Blavin and Regina K.

<blockquote>
"It seems like it's all coming out of this dark closet it was in... It was secretive. It wasn't what you talked about. But now, people are saying, 'We're not going to be victims anymore, we're going to call you on it, whether it's on a campus or anywhere'.

The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the [[Facebook page]] for ''The Hunting Ground'' and Itsonus.org, the [[White House]] support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.<ref name="distress">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6700427/lady-gaga-til-it-happens-to-you|title=Lady Gaga Shares Distressing Video for Sexual Assault Song 'Til It Happens To You'|last=Brandle|first=Lars|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=Billboard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920172132/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6700427/lady-gaga-til-it-happens-to-you|archivedate=September 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Reception and analysis===
Kornhaber described the video as a "sombre, socially conscious curveball" but wondered why Gaga released the PSA-like video, adding that she has: "always been good at surprises, and unfortunately, no time is better than any other when it comes to discussing the issues she's singing about".<ref name="atlan"/> Christopher Rosen from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the clip as "powerful, disturbing and emotional".<ref name="ewr">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/18/lady-gaga-til-it-happens-to-you-video|title=Lady Gaga shines light on campus rape epidemic in powerful 'Til It Happens to You' video|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920234637/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/18/lady-gaga-til-it-happens-to-you-video|archivedate=September 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Radhika Sanghani declared that each scenario in the video appeared realistic and wrote: "by making sure the attacks differ in location, scenario and the appearances of both rapist and victim, Gaga is breaking the myth of there being a 'typical rape'".<ref name="tele">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11873732/Lady-Gaga-Campus-rape-video-shows-brutal-reality-for-many-students.html|title=Lady Gaga's powerful new video shows the brutal reality of campus rape|last=Sanghani|first=Radhika|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920020442/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11873732/Lady-Gaga-Campus-rape-video-shows-brutal-reality-for-many-students.html|archivedate=September 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Corinne Heller from [[E!]] believed that the "graphic, emotional and hard to watch" video was able to deliver a "powerful message", one that was close to Gaga due to her real-life rape experience.<ref name="eon">{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/697266/lady-gaga-releases-emotional-til-it-happens-to-you-psa-about-sexual-assault-nikki-reed-stars-watch|title=Lady Gaga Releases Emotional 'Til It Happens to You' PSA About Sexual Assault, Nikki Reed Stars|last=Heller|first=Corinne|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[E!]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919222815/http://www.eonline.com/news/697266/lady-gaga-releases-emotional-til-it-happens-to-you-psa-about-sexual-assault-nikki-reed-stars-watch|archivedate=September 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wright described the video for ''NME'' as a "brutal, monochrome rendering" of the subject matter, with "harrowing" depictions of the rapes. She added that the rape statistics at the end of the video were "horrifying" but complimented Gaga for using her popularity to promote awareness of the subject.<ref name="nme"/> Loretta Donelan from ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' believed that Gaga's previous music videos had political aspects but were open to interpretations. But with the music video of "Til It Happens to You", she showed maturity by featuring "chilling scenes of staged sexual assaults".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/111485-lady-gaga-releases-til-it-happens-to-you-video-to-raise-awareness-about-sexual-assault|title=Lady Gaga Releases 'Til It Happens To You' Video To Raise Awareness About Sexual Assault|last=Donelan|first=Loretta|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001174703/http://www.bustle.com/articles/111485-lady-gaga-releases-til-it-happens-to-you-video-to-raise-awareness-about-sexual-assault|archivedate=October 1, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Alex Rees from ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' felt that the video contained "uncomfortable footage", but added that the "emotionally unsettling" images were able to reflect on the actual reality of what happens on college campuses.<ref name="cos">{{cite news|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/news/a46479/lady-gaga-sexual-assault-music-video/|title=Lady Gaga Releases Powerful 'Til It Happens to You' Music Video|last=Rees|first=Alex|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921001837/http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/news/a46479/lady-gaga-sexual-assault-music-video/|archivedate=September 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible".<ref name="cosuk">{{cite news|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/entertainment/news/a38617/lady-gagas-video-rape-happens-to-you/|title=Lady Gaga's new video about rape is SO hard to watch but so important|last=Hodgson|first=Claire|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=Cosmopolitan|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921003758/http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/entertainment/news/a38617/lady-gagas-video-rape-happens-to-you/|archivedate=September 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Emily Shire from ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' was positive about the clip, calling it: "both chilling and beautiful. The overall effect is as much, if not more, a credit to acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke. The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect of the PSA – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones and that was enough to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape."<ref name="beast">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/18/what-lady-gaga-s-rape-awareness-video-should-have-said.html|title=What Lady Gaga’s Rape Awareness Video Should Have Said|last=Shire|first=Emily|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922072344/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/18/what-lady-gaga-s-rape-awareness-video-should-have-said.html|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Conversely, Dan Solomon of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' believed the video to be an "important statement" from Gaga and believed that it would direct further attention to ''The Hunting Ground''.<ref name="fast">{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3051292/lady-gagas-new-music-video-is-an-unflinching-depiction-of-campus-rape|title=Lady Gaga's New Music Video Is An Unflinching Depiction Of Campus Rape|last=Solomon|first=Dan|date=September 18, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923005124/http://www.fastcocreate.com/3051292/lady-gagas-new-music-video-is-an-unflinching-depiction-of-campus-rape|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
