{{Donald Trump series}}
On January 12, 2018, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that in October 2016, just before the [[2016 United States presidential election]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] had arranged payment of $130,000 to adult film actress [[Stormy Daniels]] to stop her disclosing an affair they had in 2006.<ref name="Rothfeld_Palazzolo_1/12/2018"/><ref name="Prokop_1/12/2018"/> Daniels had signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA). At first, Trump's then lawyer [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]] denied Trump had the alleged affair, and sought to suppress the allegation based on the NDA, but a month later publicly acknowledged making the payment. Besides other issues, questions were also raised as to whether the payment violated [[Campaign finance in the United States|federal campaign finance laws]], either because the payment was not duly disclosed as a campaign contribution or because campaign funds may have been used towards the payment.<ref name=bbc030518>{{cite news|website=[[BBC News]]|date=May 3, 2018|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43334326|title=Why the Stormy Daniels-Donald Trump story matters|first=Toby|last=Luckhurst|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref> On February 13, Cohen said he paid the money out of his own pocket, not as a campaign contribution, and that neither the Trump Organization nor the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Trump campaign]] reimbursed him for making it.<ref name=nyt130218/> On April 5, Trump said he had no knowledge of Cohen's payment, but admitted on April 26 that Cohen represented him in "the Stormy Daniels deal" for the first time. On May 2, Trump's new lawyer [[Rudy Giuliani]] said that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the payment. As a result of this disclosure, Cohen also faces discipline from the State Bar of New York under the New York Rules of Professional Conduct that prohibits lawyers making loans to clients.<ref name=usa260318>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/26/stormy-daniels-creates-more-legal-problems-donald-trump-column/457275002/|title=Flashback: Stormy Daniels on '60 Minutes' makes Donald Trump's legal problems even worse|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|first1=Norman|last1=Eisen|author-link1=Norm Eisen|first2=Virginia|last2=Canter|date=May 3, 2018}}</ref>

In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including a campaign finance violation for Daniels' payment. He stated under oath that he paid her "in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office." Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison on various charges.

Daniels filed three lawsuits against Trump and/or Cohen. In the first lawsuit she argued that the NDA was invalid. She won the lawsuit though it was dismissed, after Trump and Cohen agreed not to enforce the NDA.<ref> [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-08/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-hush-money-agreement-case-dismissed/10885350 US judge dismisses Stormy Daniels's lawsuit against President Donald Trump to end their NDA] </ref> A California court subsequently ordered Trump pay $44,100 to reimburse her legal fees.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/22/trump-must-pay-stormy-daniels-legal-fees/|title= Court orders Trump to pay Stormy Daniels $44,100 to cover her legal fees |last=Whalen |first=Jeanne|website=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=Aug 22, 2020|date=Aug 22, 2020}}</ref> She lost the second lawsuit, in which she argued she was defamed, and was ordered to pay almost $300,000 in legal fees and court sanctions<ref name="NYT Stevens">{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Matt |title=Stormy Daniels Ordered to Pay Trump $293,000 in Legal Fees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/stormy-daniels-donald-trump.html |accessdate=23 January 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 December 2018}}</ref> and was appealed {{as of|May 2019||df=|lc=y}}.

Daniels filed a lawsuit against Trump on March 6, 2018, claiming that the non-disclosure agreement she signed about the alleged affair was invalid since Trump never personally signed it despite acknowledging that she accepted the payment made in exchange for her silence in the matter.<ref name="60m-transcript"/><ref name="npr-graphic-details">{{cite news | url = https://www.npr.org/2018/03/25/596868354/stormy-daniels-shares-graphic-details-about-alleged-affair-with-trump | title = Stormy Daniels Shares Graphic Details About Alleged Affair With Trump | first = Miles | last = Parks | website = [[NPR]] | date = March 25, 2018 | accessdate = March 26, 2018 }}</ref> It also alleged that Trump's attorney tried to intimidate Daniels and "scare her into not talking".

In an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that aired March 25, 2018, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once. She also said that she was threatened in front of her infant daughter after a fitness class in [[Las Vegas]] in 2011.

A well established principle of contract law is the offer and acceptance of "consideration" or something of value, in exchange for a promise to do something (or not do something, as in the case of a non-disclosure agreement]. Legal experts argue that the $130,000 payment being accepted by one party is valid consideration and enforceable regardless of the unsigned state of the Daniels non-disclosure agreement, but other elements in the Daniels agreement make predicting the outcome difficult. Issues like the use of pseudonyms and the disclosure exception for law enforcement investigations may favor Daniels' position.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2018/04/02/would-the-stormy-daniels-nda-be-enforceable-under-pennsylvania-law/|title=Would the Stormy Daniels NDA Be Enforceable Under Pennsylvania Law?|work=[[The Legal Intelligencer]]|access-date=June 6, 2018|url-access=subscription|first=Jeffrey|last=Campolongo|date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>
