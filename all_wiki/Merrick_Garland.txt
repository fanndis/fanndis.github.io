===Notable cases===
Garland is considered a judicial moderate and a [[Centrism|centrist]].<ref name="ShearHarris"/> Garland has been described by [[Nina Totenberg]] and Carrie Johnson of [[NPR]] as "a moderate liberal, with a definite pro-prosecution bent in criminal cases".<ref name="ReputationCollegiality"/> [[Tom Goldstein]], the publisher of ''[[SCOTUSblog]]'', wrote in 2010 that "Judge Garland's record demonstrates that he is essentially the model, neutral judge. He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements."<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/> Garland has a reputation for collegiality, and his opinions rarely draw a dissent.<ref name=BNA>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Tom P.|title=Garland Brings Centrist Flair to D.C.

====Administrative and environmental law====
Garland has tended to favor deference to regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite news |first=David G. |last=Savage |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-garland-legal-analysis-20160318-story.html |title=Analysis: Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland has a record of restraint, not activism |work=Los Angeles Times |quote=Garland 'is almost always deferential to agency interpretations of statutes,' UCLA law professor Ann Carlson wrote |date=March 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}</ref> For example, in ''In re Aiken County'' (2013), Garland dissented when the court issued [[mandamus]] ordering the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to process the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] license.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rita Ann |last=Cicero |url=http://blog.thomsonreuters.com/index.php/d-c-circuit-orders-completion-of-yucca-mountain-nuclear-facility-review/ |title=D.C.

====Criminal law and whistleblower protection====
While on the [[bench (law)|bench]], Garland has shown a tendency to be deferential to the government in criminal cases, siding with prosecutors in ten of the fourteen criminal cases in which he disagreed with a colleague.<ref name=NYTcriminal>{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Charlie|title=In Criminal Rulings, Garland Has Usually Sided With Law Enforcement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/us/politics/merrick-garland-supreme-court-nominee.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 24, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2016|page=A13}}</ref> For example, in ''United States v. Watson'' (1999), Garland dissented when the court concluded a prosecutor's closing argument was unduly [[Harmless error|prejudicial]], objecting that a conviction should only be reversed for "the most egregious of these kind of errors."<ref name=NYTcriminal/>  In 2007, Garland dissented when the [[en banc]] D.C.

Garland has taken a broad view of [[whistleblower protection in the United States|whistleblower protection]] laws, such as the [[False Claims Act]] (FCA),<ref name="LoughranSwann">{{cite web |author1=Loughran, Matthew  |author2=Swann, James |url=http://www.bna.com/judge-garland-good-n57982068731/ |title=Judge Garland Would Be Good for HHS, CMS, Attorneys Say |work=Bloomberg BNA |date=March 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}</ref> which creates a private cause of action against those [[fraud|defrauding]] the federal government.<ref name="WashPo3/18"/> For example, in ''United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University'' (1998), Garland wrote for the court in holding that a plaintiff alleging he had been fired by [[Howard University]] for whistleblowing could sue under the FCA for retaliation.<ref name=Goldstein2010PotentialNom/> In ''United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp.'' (2004), Garland dissented when the court, in an opinion written by Judge John Roberts, held that the FCA did not apply to false claims submitted to Amtrak because Amtrak is not the government.<ref name="WashPo3/18"/><ref name="LoughranSwann"/>  Roberts justified his narrow reading by citing a book by Circuit Judge [[Henry Friendly]].<ref>{{cite court |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17401514961045059989&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 |litigants=US ex rel.

Friendly, ''Benchmarks'' (1967)).</ref> In dissent, Garland (who like Roberts had clerked for Friendly), cited Friendly's book as supporting the use of [[legislative intent]],<ref name="WashPo3/18"/> writing that Roberts was relying on "'canons' of [[statutory construction]], which serve here as 'cannons' of statutory destruction."<ref name="LoughranSwann"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Palazzolo|first1=Joe|title=Judge Garland's Career in Dissent|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/17/judge-garlands-career-in-dissent/|accessdate=March 23, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> Garland's dissent, expressing concerns that the court's ruling would impede the government's ability to pursue false claims cases against federal grantees, is credited with sparking the [[Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009]], which eliminated the loophole.<ref name="LoughranSwann"/> During confirmation hearings in 2005, Senator Chuck Grassley sharply questioned Roberts on why he hadn't adopted Garland's reading.<ref name="WashPo3/18"/>  Roberts replied, "Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area."<ref name="WashPo3/18"/>

====National security====
During Garland's tenure, the D.C. Circuit has reviewed cases arising from the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. In ''[[al Odah v. United States]]'' (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees.<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/> In July 2011, Garland wrote for the unanimous panel when it rejected Guantanamo detainee [[Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alawi]]'s petition for ''[[habeas corpus]]''.<ref>{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note|title=Recent Case: D.C.

(2009), Garland dissented from the court's holding that former Iraqi detainees at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] could not sue [[private military contractor]]s who participated in [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture and prisoner abuse]].  Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because "no act of Congress and no judicial precedent" immunized the contractors from [[tort]] liability, the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Warren |last=Richey |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0627/Supreme-Court-declines-to-take-up-Abu-Ghraib-detainee-lawsuit |title=Supreme Court declines to take up Abu Ghraib detainee lawsuit |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>Mark Gibney, "Litigating Transnational Human Rights Obligations" in ''Challenging Territoriality in Human Rights Law: Building Blocks for a Plural and Diverse Duty-Bearer Regime'' (Routledge, 2015: ed.

====First Amendment====
According to Goldstein, Garland has "tended to take a broader view" of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/> In cases involving the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and similar provisions related to [[government transparency]], "Judge Garland's rulings reflect a preference for open government."<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/> In ''ACLU v. CIA'' (2013), Garland wrote for a unanimous panel rejecting the agency's [[Glomar response]] and ordering it to process the ACLU's FOIA request regarding [[targeted killing]]s by CIA drones.<ref name=rcfp>{{cite web|title=Judge Merrick Garland's media law cases|url=https://www.rcfp.org/judge-garland|publisher=[[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]]|accessdate=June 8, 2016|date=March 18, 2016}}</ref>  In ''Cause of Action v.

U.S. Postal Service'' (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] regulation banning signature-gathering for [[petition]]s at post offices violated the First Amendment.<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/><ref name="AlmanancFedJudiciary"/> Garland found the regulation to be [[Facial challenge|facially]] overbroad and not [[Narrow tailoring|narrowly tailored]].<ref name="AlmanancFedJudiciary"/>

In cases involving [[campaign finance reform]] laws, Garland has applied ''[[Citizens United v.

====Second Amendment====
In 2007, Garland voted in favor of ''[[en banc]]'' review of the D.C. Circuit's panel decision in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller|Parker v. District of Columbia]]'' invalidating the [[Gun laws in the District of Columbia|D.C. handgun ban]]. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this invalidation 5‚Äì4 in an opinion by Justice Scalia.<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/> Goldstein commented, "Garland did not take a formal position on the merits of the case" and "even if he had concluded that the statute was constitutional, that view of the case would have conformed" to widespread views under the existing Supreme Court precedent.<ref name="Goldstein2010PotentialNom"/>

====Other cases====
In ''Alexander v. Daley'' (2003), Garland joined a decision (authored by Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]]), rejecting a challenge brought by District of Columbia residents seeking [[District of Columbia voting rights|D.C. congressional voting rights]].<ref name=wapo.voting/><ref name=cp.voting>{{cite news |last=Cavendish |first=Steve |date=March 16, 2016 |title=Obama to Nominate Merrick Garland, Who Wrote Decision Opposing D.C.

In ''Hutchins v. District of Columbia'' (1999), Garland agreed with four other D.C.

==Supreme Court nomination==
Garland was considered twice to fill vacated seats on the United States Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010 before finally being nominated in 2016 by President [[Barack Obama]] for the seat left vacant by the death of conservative Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Gardiner |last=Harris |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/obama-supreme-court-nomination/garland-had-been-on-obamas-short-list |title=For Garland, Third Time Was Charm |work=The New York Times |date=March 16, 2016 |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}</ref>

=== 2009 and 2010 considerations ===
In 2009, following the announcement by Justice [[David Souter]] that he would retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to [[Sonia Sotomayor]], then a judge of the Second Circuit.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Baker, Peter   |author2=Nagourney, Adam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/us/politics/28select.html |title=Sotomayor Pick a Product of Lessons From Past Battles |work = The New York Times |date=May 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2009 }}</ref>
