The '''2017 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday, 8 June 2017, two years after the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|previous general election in 2015]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/18/breaking-theresa-may-make-statement-downing-street-1115am1/ |title=Theresa May announces snap general election on June 8 to 'make a success of Brexit' |last=Boyle |first=Danny |date=18 April 2017 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=25 February 2018 |last2=Maidment |first2=Jack |issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] remained the largest single party in the House of Commons but lost its small overall majority, resulting in the formation of a Conservative-led [[minority government]] with a [[confidence-and-supply]] [[Conservative–DUP agreement|agreement]] with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) of Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/621794/Confidence_and_Supply_Agreement_between_the_Conservative_Party_and_the_DUP.pdf | title=Confidence and Supply Agreement between the Conservative Party and the DUP | website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk}}</ref>

The Conservative Party, which had governed as a senior [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition]] partner from [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] and as a single-party majority government from [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], was defending a working majority of 17 seats against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|official opposition]] [[Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn|led by]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. Under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] an election had not been due until May 2020, but a call by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] for a [[snap election]] was ratified by the necessary two-thirds vote in the House of Commons on 19 April 2017. May said that she hoped to secure a larger majority to "strengthen [her] hand" in the forthcoming [[Brexit]] negotiations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/after-british-vote-brexit-negotiations-could-be-delayed/2017/06/09/1a2fee88-4c9b-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html|title=After shocking British vote result, Europe ponders fate of Brexit negotiations|last=McAuley|first=James|date=9 June 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>

[[Opinion polling for the 2017 United Kingdom general election|Opinion polls]] had consistently shown strong leads for the Conservatives over Labour. From a 21-point lead, the Conservatives' lead began to diminish in the final weeks of the campaign. In a surprising result, the Conservative Party made a net loss of 13 seats despite winning 42.4% of the vote (its highest share of the vote since [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]), whereas Labour made a net gain of 30 seats with 40.0% (its highest vote share since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and the first time the party had gained seats since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]). This was the closest result between the two major parties since [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and their highest combined vote share since [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the third- and fourth-largest parties, both lost vote share; media coverage characterised the result as a return to [[Two-party system|two-party politics]].<ref name=":18">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/election-results-hung-parliament-two-party-politics-back-return-labour-conservative-tory-jeremy-a7781256.html |title=After three decades of splintering, two-party politics is back – sort of |date=9 June 2017 |first1=Andreas |last1=Whittam Smith |work=The Independent}}</ref> The SNP, which had won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at the previous general election in 2015, lost 21. The Liberal Democrats made a net gain of four seats.<!-- Note both the SNP and LD figures are in comparison to the last election --> [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]], the third-largest party in 2015 by number of votes, saw its share of the vote reduced from 12.6% to 1.8% and lost its only seat.

In Wales, [[Plaid Cymru]] gained one seat, giving it a total of four seats. The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] retained its sole seat, but saw its share of the vote reduced. In Northern Ireland, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) won 10 seats, [[Sinn Féin]] won seven, and [[Independent Unionist]] [[Sylvia Hermon]] retained her seat. The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) lost all their seats.

[[Brexit negotiations|Negotiation positions]] following the UK's [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] in March 2017 to [[Brexit|leave the EU]] were expected to feature significantly in the campaign, but did not. The campaign was interrupted by two major terrorist attacks: [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester]] and [[2017 London Bridge attack|London Bridge]]; thus national security became a prominent issue in its final weeks.

==Electoral system==
{{See also|Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011}}
Each [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] of the United Kingdom elects one MP to the House of Commons using the [[Plurality voting|"first past the post" system]]. If one party obtains a majority of seats, then that party is entitled to form the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]], with its leader as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. If the election results in no single party having a majority, there is a [[hung parliament]]. In this case, the options for forming the Government are either a [[minority government]] or a [[coalition government|coalition]].<ref>{{cite AV media |date=18 March 2015 |title=Another hung Parliament: what next? |medium=Video |publisher=[[University College London|uclpoliticalscience]] via YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epyl-5w1WBQ}}</ref>

===Cost===
The cost of organising the election was around £140&nbsp;million – slightly less than the EU referendum, of which £98&nbsp;million was spent on administrative costs, and £42.5&nbsp;million was spent on campaign costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41258026 |title=Snap general election cost over £140m |publisher=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |access-date=13 September 2017}}</ref>

==Parties and candidates==
[[File:Labour party campaigning June 2017 election.jpg|thumb|Campaigning on polling day, 8 June 2017]]
Most candidates were representatives of a political party registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]. Candidates not belonging to a registered party could use an "independent" label, or no label at all.

The leader of the party commanding a majority of support in the House of Commons is the person who is called on by the monarch to form a government as Prime Minister, while the leader of the largest party not in government becomes the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Other parties also form shadow ministerial teams. The leaders of the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the DUP are not MPs; hence, they appoint separate leaders in the House of Commons.

===Great Britain===
The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] have been the two biggest parties since [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], and have supplied all [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] since 1935. Both parties changed their leader after the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]]. [[David Cameron]], who had been the leader of the Conservative Party since [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election|2005]] and Prime Minister since [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], was [[2016 Conservative Party leadership election|replaced]] in July 2016 by [[Theresa May]] following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union]]. [[Jeremy Corbyn]] [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|replaced]] [[Ed Miliband]] as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in September 2015, and was [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|re-elected]] leader in September 2016.

While the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their predecessors had long been the third-largest party in British politics, they returned only 8 MPs in 2015 (having been part of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition from 2010 until 2015)—49 fewer than at the previous election and the fewest in their modern history.{{refn|group=n|name=libdemhistory|Following their re-formation in 1988, when the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Parties]] merged.}} [[Tim Farron]] [[2015 Liberal Democrats leadership election|became the Liberal Democrat leader]] in July 2015, following the resignation of [[Nick Clegg]]. Led by [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]], the SNP stands only in Scotland; it won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats in 2015. UKIP, then led by [[Nigel Farage]], who was later replaced by [[Diane James]] and then by [[Paul Nuttall]] in 2016, won 12.7% of the vote in 2015 but gained only one MP, [[Douglas Carswell]], who left the party in March 2017 to sit as an independent. After securing 3.8% of the vote and one MP in the previous general election, Green Party leader [[Natalie Bennett]] was succeeded by joint leaders [[Caroline Lucas]] and [[Jonathan Bartley]] in September 2016. Smaller parties that contested the 2015 election and chose not to put forward candidates in 2017 included [[Mebyon Kernow]], the [[Communist Party of Britain]], the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2017-05-11/cornish-party-mebyon-kernow-not-contesting-general-election/ |title=Cornish party Mebyon Kernow not contesting General Election |date=11 May 2017 |publisher=ITV News |access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-uk-communist-party-no-candidates-jeremy-corbyn-labour-support-first-1920-a7699761.html |title=British Communist party will not field any candidates and throws support behind Jeremy Corbyn |date=24 April 2017 |work=The Independent |access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39934756 |title=Election 2017: Where have all the politicians gone? |date=16 May 2017 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> The [[Respect Party]], which had previously held seats, was dissolved in 2016; its former MP [[George Galloway]] stood and lost in the 2017 election as an independent in [[Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Gorton]].<ref name="Fenton">{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Siobhan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-galloway-respect-party-deregisters-labour-jeremy-corbyn-member-a7202191.html |title=George Galloway's Respect Party deregisters, prompting speculation politician may rejoin Labour |work=The Independent |date=21 August 2016 |access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000808 |title=Manchester Gorton |publisher=BBC News |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

===Northern Ireland===
In [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), the [[Green Party of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] contested the 2017 election.

====Party selection processes====
Unlike in previous elections, the timetable of the snap election required parties to select candidates in just under three weeks, to meet the 11 May deadline.

For the Conservatives, [[Conservative Association|local associations]] in target seats were offered a choice of three candidates by the [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|party's headquarters]] from an existing list of candidates, without inviting applications; candidates in non-target seats were to be appointed directly by central party offices; and successful MPs were to be confirmed by a meeting of their local parties.<ref name=":1">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39658426 |title=General election 2017: Can parties select candidates in time? |date=22 April 2017 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> This was controversial with local associations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.conservativehome.com/majority_conservatism/2017/09/our-cchq-election-audit-the-rusty-machine-part-two-how-and-why-the-ground-campaign-failed.html |title=Our CCHQ election audit: the rusty machine, part two.

==Campaign==
===Background===
Prior to the calling of the general election, the Liberal Democrats gained Richmond Park from the Conservatives in a [[2016 Richmond Park by-election|by-election]], a seat characterised by its high Remain vote in the 2016 EU referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/02/lib-dems-unseat-zac-goldsmith-in-richmond-park-byelection |title=Richmond Park byelection: Tory Brexit voters switched to us, say Lib Dems |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=2 December 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref> The Conservatives held the [[safe seat]] of [[2016 Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election|Sleaford and North Hykeham]] in December 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bateman |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38258976 |title=Conservatives hold Sleaford as Labour pushed into fourth |date=9 December 2016 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref> In by-elections on 23 February 2017, Labour held [[2017 Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election|Stoke-on-Trent Central]] but lost [[2017 Copeland by-election|Copeland]] to the Conservatives, the first time a governing party had gained a seat in a by-election since the Tories took [[Mitcham and Morden (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitcham and Morden]] in [[1982 Mitcham and Morden by-election|1982]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39064149 |title=Tories in historic by-election Copeland win as Labour holds Stoke |date=24 February 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref>

The general election came soon after the Northern Ireland [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Assembly election]] on 2 March. Talks on power-sharing between the DUP and Sinn Féin had failed to reach a conclusion, with Northern Ireland thus facing either another Assembly election, or the imposition of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]. The deadline was subsequently extended to 29 June.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-39651071 |title=Stormont power-sharing talks deadline set for 29 June |date=21 April 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

[[2017 United Kingdom local elections|Local elections]] in England, Scotland and Wales took place on 4 May. These saw large gains by the Conservatives, and large losses by Labour and UKIP. Notably, the Conservatives won [[metro mayor]] elections in [[2017 Tees Valley mayoral election|Tees Valley]] and the [[2017 West Midlands mayoral election|West Midlands]], areas traditionally seen as Labour heartlands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39817224 |title=Elections 2017 results: Tories win four new mayors |date=5 May 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref> Initially scheduled for 4 May, a [[2017 Manchester Gorton by-election|by-election in Manchester Gorton]] was cancelled; the seat was contested on 8 June along with all the other seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-39635070 |title=Snap poll casts doubt over Manchester Gorton by-election |date=18 April 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=19 April 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-39646993 |title=Manchester Gorton by-election cancellation confirmed |date=19 April 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=20 April 2017 }}</ref>

Labour had supported Brexit in the previous parliament - Corbyn did not vote against the triggering of Article 50. Corbyn's actions in the previous parliament therefore dispelled the doubts of Labour voters who had voted to leave the EU.<ref>Eunice Goes, ‘Jez, We Can!’ Labour’s Campaign: Defeat with a Taste of Victory, Parliamentary Affairs, Volume 71, Issue suppl_1, March 2018, Pages 59–71, https://doi.org/10.1093/pa/gsx062</ref> However, his vision for Brexit prioritised different plans for the UK outside the EU.

The Conservative manifesto committed the party to leaving the single market and [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]], but sought a "deep and special partnership" through a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement. It proposed seeking to remain part of some EU programmes where it would "be reasonable that we make a contribution", staying as a signatory of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] over the next parliament, and maintaining the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] during Brexit negotiations. Parliament would be able to amend or repeal EU legislation once converted into UK law, and have a vote on the final agreement.<ref name=":14" />

====Scottish independence and the future of the UK====
{{Main|Proposed second Scottish independence referendum}}
The question of a proposed [[Scottish independence]] referendum was also thought likely to influence the campaign in [[Scotland]]. On 28 March 2017, the Scottish Parliament approved a motion requesting that Westminster pass a Section 30 order giving the Parliament the authority to hold a second independence referendum,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-votes-for-second-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon |title=Scottish parliament votes for second independence referendum |last=Carrel |first=Severin |date=28 March 2017 |work=The Guardian |access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref> suggesting that there had been a "material change of circumstances" since the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|independence referendum in 2014]] as a result of Britain's vote to leave the EU and Scotland's vote to remain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-13/scotlands-leader-seeks-new-independence-referendum/8350958 |title=Scotland's leader Sturgeon seeks independence referendum in bid to remain in EU |date=13 March 2017 |publisher=ABC News |access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref> The SNP hoped to hold a second independence referendum once the Brexit terms a

==Media coverage==
In contrast to the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], in which smaller parties received more media coverage than usual, coverage during the 2017 election focused on the two main political parties, Labour and the Conservatives<ref name="SC">S.

The Centre for the Study of Journalism, Culture and Community, [[Bournemouth University]]</ref> (84% of the politicians featured in newspapers, and 67% on TV, were Conservative or Labour), with Conservatives sources receiving the most coverage and quotation, particularly in the print media (the margin of difference between Conservative and Labour sources was 2.1 points on TV and 9.6 points in newspapers).<ref name="R4">D.

As during the 2015 election, although less than then (−12.5%), most media coverage (32.9%) was given to the workings of the electoral process itself (e.g., electoral events, [[Opinion polling for the 2017 United Kingdom general election|opinion polls]], [[Horse race journalism|'horse race' coverage]], campaign mishaps).<ref name="R4"/> During the first two weeks of campaigning, members of the public, interviewed in [[Vox populi|vox pops]],<ref>M.

===Predictions three weeks before the vote===
The [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system used in UK general elections means that the number of seats won is not directly related to vote share. Thus, several approaches are used to convert polling data and other information into seat predictions. The table below lists some of the predictions.

===Predictions on polling day===
The UK's [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] electoral system means that national shares of the vote do not give an exact indicator of how the various parties will be represented in Parliament. Different commentators and pollsters currently provide a number of predictions, based on polls and other data, as to how the parties will be represented in Parliament:

An [[exit poll]], conducted by [[GfK]] and [[Ipsos MORI]] on behalf of the [[BBC]], [[ITN|ITV]] and [[Sky News]], was published at the end of voting at 10&nbsp;pm, predicting the number of seats for each party, with the Conservatives being the largest party, but short of an overall majority:<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40208731 |title=Election 2017: Exit poll predicts Tories to be largest party |date=8 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=8 June 2017 }}</ref> Actual results were close to the prediction.

Results for all constituencies except [[Kensington (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington]] were reported by the morning after the election. The Conservatives remained the largest single party in terms of seats and votes, but were short of a parliamentary majority. The Conservatives won 317 seats with 42.4% of the vote while the Labour Party won 262 seats with 40.0% of the vote. The election resulted in the third [[hung parliament]] since the [[Second World War]], elections in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] having previously resulted in hung parliaments.

Twenty-nine seats that had changed parties at the 2015 election changed parties again in 2017. Nineteen of these seats returned the candidate from the party that had held the seat in 2010. A third party took ten of these seats: nine were Conservative gains from the SNP in seats that the SNP had won from Labour in 2015, whilst [[Portsmouth South (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth South]], which the Conservatives had gained from the Lib Dems in 2015, was then gained by Labour in 2017.

In England, Labour made a net gain of 21 seats, taking 25 constituencies from the Conservatives and two from the Liberal Democrats. Its gains were predominantly in university towns and cities and in London, most notably achieving victories in [[Battersea (UK Parliament constituency)|Battersea]], [[Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Canterbury]], [[Kensington (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington]] and [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] from the Conservatives by narrow margins;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40215512 |title=General Election 2017: The major political casualties |date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> it also lost five seats to the Conservatives, largely in [[the Midlands]], and did not regain [[Copeland (UK Parliament constituency)|Copeland]] which had been lost in a [[2017 Copeland by-election|February by-election]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/general-election-2017-results-analysis-theresa-may-lost-majority/ |title=General Election analysis: The maps and charts that show how Theresa May lost her majority |date=10 June 2017 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> The Conservatives experienced a net loss of 22 seats, the first time since 1997 that the party suffered a net loss of seats. They gained [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] from UKIP and [[Southport (UK Parliament constituency)|Southport]] from the Liberal Democrats in addition to the six gains from Labour. The Liberal Democrats took five seats from the Conservatives, including [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]], won back by [[Vince Cable]], and [[Kingston and Surbiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston and Surbiton]], won by [[Ed Davey]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/lib-dems-clegg-cable-tim-farron |title=Lib Dems' night of mixed fortunes as Clegg loses seat but Cable returns |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=9 June 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> but lost two seats to Labour: [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]] and [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]], the seat of former party leader [[Nick Clegg]]. [[Richmond Park (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond Park]], which the Liberal Democrats had won in a 2016 by-election, was narrowly lost to the Conservatives. [[Caroline Lucas]] remained the sole Green Party MP, retaining [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]].

In Scotland, the Conservatives, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats all gained seats from the SNP, whose losses were attributed to opposition to a [[proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second Scottish independence referendum]], contributing to tactical voting for unionist parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/07/snp-anti-independence-nicola-sturgeon-angus-robertson |title=SNP braced to lose up to 12 seats amid anti-independence backlash |first=Severin Carrell Scotland |last=editor |date=7 June 2017 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40216748 |title=General election 2017: Sturgeon says Indyref2 'a factor' in SNP losses |date=9 June 2017 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The Conservative Party placed second in Scotland for the first time since [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], won its largest number of seats in Scotland since [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/scotland-election-results-live-will-snp-nicola-sturgeon-do |title=Scotland election results: Alex Salmond defeated and SNP suffer huge losses as Tory chances boosted north of the border |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref> and recorded its highest share of the vote there since [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].

Labour gained six seats from the SNP, while the Liberal Democrats gained three. Having won 56 of 59 Scottish seats at the last general election, the SNP lost a total of 21 seats, and majorities in its remaining seats were greatly reduced.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40190856 |title=Election 2017: Which seats changed hands? |date=10 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> High-profile losses included SNP Commons leader [[Angus Robertson]] in [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]] and former party leader and ex-First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] in [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707 |title=General election 2017: SNP lose a third of seats amid Tory surge |date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>

In Wales, Labour held 25 seats and gained [[Cardiff North (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff North]], [[Gower (UK Parliament constituency)|Gower]] and [[Vale of Clwyd (UK Parliament constituency)|Vale of Clwyd]] from the Conservatives, leaving the Welsh Tories with eight seats. Plaid Cymru retained its three existing seats and gained [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]], the Liberal Democrats' only seat in Wales.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-40195154 |title=General Election 2017: Labour hails 'fantastic' results |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News}}</ref> This was the first ever election at which the Liberal Democrats or one of their ancestral parties failed to win a seat in Wales.

In Northern Ireland, the SDLP lost its three seats ([[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] and [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]] to Sinn Féin and [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]] to the DUP), while the UUP lost its two seats ([[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] to Sinn Féin and [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]] to the DUP). With the Alliance Party failing to win any seats or regain [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]], this left the DUP with ten seats (up from eight) and Sinn Féin with seven (up from four); independent unionist [[Sylvia Hermon]] retained [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40208320 |title=Election results 2017: DUP and Sinn Féin celebrate election gains |date=9 June 2017 |access-date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Recording its best result since [[Partition of Ireland|partition]], Sinn Féin confirmed it would continue [[Abstentionism#Sinn Féin|its abstentionist policy]], leaving no [[Irish nationalism#Northern Ireland|nationalist]] representation in the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/13/sinn-fein-mps-house-of-commons-theresa-may-dup |title=Unseated: the Sinn Féin MPs whose absence strengthens May's hand in Commons |last=Bowcott |first=Owen |date=13 June 2017 |work=The Guardian |access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>

UKIP failed to win any seats, its vote share falling from 12.6% at the previous general election to just 1.8%; party leader Paul Nuttall came third in [[Boston and Skegness (UK Parliament constituency)|Boston and Skegness]]. The Greens' vote share dropped from 3.8% to 1.6%.

===Analysis===
The result was noted for increased vote shares for Labour (up 9.6 percentage points) and the Conservatives (up 5.5 percentage points), with a combined 82.4% share of the vote, up from 67.3% in 2015. The highest combined share of the vote for the two main parties since [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]], it was suggested this indicated a return to [[Two-party system|two-party politics]]<ref name=":18" /> caused by tactical voting<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-voting-systems-elections-tactical-game-system-research-general-theresa-may-conservatives-reform-a7903961.html |title=22&nbsp;million votes didn't have any impact in the general election|date=21 August 2017}}</ref> which led to the Conservatives having a smaller share of seats despite an increased number of votes. The election was characterised by higher turnout, particularly among younger voters, which may have contributed to Labour's increased vote share.<ref name=":17">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/corbyn-may-young-voters-labour-surge |title=The youth for today: how the 2017 election changed the political landscape |last=Travis |first=Alan |date=9 June 2017 |work=The Guardian |access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=":19">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/ng-interactive/2017/jun/20/young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017 |title=Young voters, class and turnout: how Britain voted in 2017 |last=Holder |first=Josh |date=19 June 2017 |work=The Guardian |access-date=19 July 2017 |last2=Barr |first2=Caelainn |last3=Kommenda |first3=Niko}}</ref> Research company [[Ipsos MORI]] considered age to be one of the most significant factors behind the result; compared to the 2015 general election, under-45s tended to opt more for Labour and over-54s for the Conservatives.<ref name=":19" /> It found 60% of those aged 18–24 voted Labour while 61% of over-64s voted Conservative.<ref name=":19" /> The swing to Labour was high in those seats with large numbers of young people.<ref name=":20">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40219338 |title=UK election: Six key lessons from a surprise result |last=Curtice |first=John |date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref> In seats where the Remain vote was strong there was also evidence of tactical voting against the Conservatives to stop a "hard Brexit", with many voters opting for the non-Conservative candidate with the best chance of winning.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/june2017/2017/10/how-brexit-cost-conservatives-their-majority |title=How Brexit cost the Conservatives their majority |website=New Statesman}}</ref>

In terms of [[NRS social grade|social grade]], Labour increased its share of middle-class voters (defined as ABC1) by 12 percentage points compared to the previous election while the Conservatives increased their share of working-class voters (C2DE) by 12 percentage points.<ref name=":19" /> Political scientist [[John Curtice]] found that the Conservatives tended to experience a greater increase in vote share in seats with a higher proportion of working-class voters, particularly those that voted Leave in the EU referendum.<ref name=":20" /> Many of Labour's most successful results occurred in seats that voted Remain by a large margin in 2016.<ref name=":20" />

Compared to previous elections, turnout by [[Private rented sector|private renters]] increased (from 51% in 2010 to 65%) and favoured Labour to a greater degree, with the party achieving a 23-point lead over the Conservatives among private renters; the Conservatives maintained a 14-point lead among [[Owner-occupancy|homeowners]].<ref name=":21">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/6734cdde-550b-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f |title=Youth turnout at general election highest in 25 years, data show |last=Burn-Murdoch |first=John |date=20 June 2017 |work=Financial Times|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref> In terms of education, [[YouGov]] found that a one-point lead for the Conservatives among university graduates in 2015 had flipped to a 17-point lead for Labour in 2017.<ref name=":21" /><ref name=":22">{{cite web |url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election/ |title=How Britain voted at the 2017 general election |date=13 June 2017 |website=YouGov|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref> For those with low educational qualifications, the Conservatives led by 22 points, up from 8 points in 2015.<ref name=":21" /><ref name=":22" />

It was suggested that UKIP's decline boosted both main parties, but tended to help Labour retain seats in the North of England and the Midlands against the Conservatives, though it may have also benefited the Conservatives in predominantly working-class seats.<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":21" /> Ipsos Mori found that UKIP's collapse was consistent across all age groups.<ref name=":19" />

Published in August 2017, the [[British Election Study]] (BES), which surveyed 30,000 voters, found that despite a relatively low profile in the campaign, Brexit was considered to be the single most important issue facing the country by over a third of respondents.<ref name=":23">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40630242 |title=General election 2017: Brexit dominated voters' thoughts |last=Fieldhouse |first=Ed |date=1 August 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=2 August 2017 |last2=Prosser |first2=Chris}}</ref> It found more than half of UKIP voters in 2015 went to the Conservatives, while 18% went to Labour.<ref name=":23" /> Remain voters tended to favour Labour, with the party particularly gaining among Remain voters who previously supported other parties, despite perceived uncertainty over its position on the [[European Single Market|single market]].<ref name=":23" /> There was a strong correlation between those who prioritised controlling immigration and the Conservatives, while the same was true for supporting single market access and those who opted for Labour or the Liberal Democrats.<ref name=":23" />

The BES study indicated the importance of the campaign period. A pre-election survey found 41% for the Conservatives and 27% for Labour, but by the election 19% of voters had switched party.<ref name=":23" /> Unlike the previous election where both main parties achieved similar shares of late-switchers, Labour won 54% while the Conservatives won 19%.<ref name=":23" /> Likeability of party leaders also narrowed over the course of the campaign.<ref name=":23" />

In a post-election reshuffle carried out on 11 June, May promoted her close ally [[Damian Green]] to become [[First Secretary of State]] and brought [[Michael Gove]] into the cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]], making [[Andrea Leadsom]] [[Leader of the House of Commons]].

===Party leadership changes===
After achieving just 1.8% of the popular vote, down from 12.7% in 2015, and failing to win any seats, Paul Nuttall resigned as UKIP leader on 9 June.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40220074 |title=Election results 2017: Paul Nuttall quits as UKIP leader |date=9 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> A [[2017 UK Independence Party leadership election|leadership election]] followed.

Also on 14 June, [[Brian Paddick, Baron Paddick|Brian Paddick]] resigned as home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats over concerns about Farron's "views on various issues" during the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40277398 |title=Paddick quits Lib Dem frontbench over Tim Farron's 'views' |date=14 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> Later that day Farron announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democrats, citing conflict between his Christian faith and serving as leader.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40281300 |title=Tim Farron quits as Lib Dem leader |date=14 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> He remained as leader until Sir [[Vince Cable]] was [[2017 Liberal Democrats leadership election|elected unopposed]] on 20 July.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40662737 |title=Vince Cable is new Lib Dem leader |date=20 July 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref>

===Campaign post-mortems===
Figures inside and outside the Conservative Party criticised its campaign widely. Points of criticism included the initial decision to call the election (which [[Lynton Crosby]] had advised against); the control of the campaign by a small team of May's joint chiefs of staff [[Nick Timothy]] and [[Fiona McLeod Hill|Fiona Hill]], who were more experienced with policy work than campaigning; the presidential style of the campaign focusing on the figure of Theresa May, while most of the Cabinet were sidelined (particularly the exclusion of Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Philip Hammond]], with reports that May would sack him after the election);<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40318674 |title=Philip Hammond attacks Tory general election campaign |date=18 June 2017 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and a poorly designed manifesto that offered little hope and the contents of which were not shared with Cabinet members until shortly before its release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/revealed-how-theresa-mays-two-aides-seized-control-of-the-tory-campaign-to-calamitous-effect-a3566796.html |title=How May's aides seized control of the Tory election campaign to calamitous effect |date=16 June 2017 }}</ref> In July, Prime Minister Theresa May admitted she had "shed a tear" upon seeing the election [[exit poll]], and suggested the manifesto's lack of appeal to younger voters had played a part in Conservative shortcomings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40592808 |title=Theresa May 'shed a tear' at election exit poll |date=13 July 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=13 July 2017 }}</ref>

===Allegations of Russian interference===
In 2018, an investigation by [[Swansea University]] and ''The Sunday Times'' revealed that 6,500 Russian Twitter accounts, at least many of which were [[Twitterbot|bots]], supported Labour, denigrated Conservatives, and reached millions of voters. Their intention was to swing the elections for Labour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/exposed-russian-twitter-bots-tried-to-swing-general-election-for-jeremy-corbyn-zffv8652x |title=Exposed: Russian Twitter bots tried to swing general election for Jeremy Corbyn |date=29 April 2018 |work=The Sunday Times}}</ref> Labour's Shadow Chancellor [[John McDonnell]] dismissed the claims as "ludicrous", "farcical" and a "classic ''Sunday Times'' smear campaign" and further said: "If there's an issue here about anything with Russian influence in our society, it's about [[Russian oligarchs]] funding the Tory party – let's have an inquiry into that."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-russian-twitter-bots-election-sunday-times-labour-conservatives-hancock-a8328031.html |title=Researchers 'don't know' who was behind Russian Twitter bots that churned out pro-Corbyn posts, or how much difference it made |last=Dearden |first=Lizzie |date=29 May 2018 |work=The Independent |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/russia-twitter-bots-rallied-for-labour-during-general-election-report-claims-11351784 |title=Russia Twitter bots rallied for Labour during general election, report claims |date=29 April 2018 |publisher=Sky News |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

===Election turnout figures===
A January 2018 report in ''[[The Times]]'' reported that researchers at Oxford University and the University of Manchester have found that election turnout in June 2017 was actually in the high 70s and could have been as high as 80.3 per cent, partly because those with second homes and students are registered twice, and partly also because of entries there by mistake or because of voter fraud. By overestimating the number of registered voters, official sources underestimated the proportion of the electorate that voted. Turnout in the 2017 election is likely to have been roughly 78 per cent. A spokesman for the Election Commission said officials would "consider this report's findings on the calculation of election turnout figures". The commission "continues to work to improve the accuracy and completeness" of the electoral register, he added.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-turnout-far-higher-than-thought-jf3vtmwng |title=General election turnout 'far higher than thought' |date=11 January 2018 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |access-date=27 May 2018|last1=Hogarth |first1=Raphael |url-access=subscription}}</ref>
