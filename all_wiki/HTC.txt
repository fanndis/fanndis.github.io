'''HTC Corporation''' ({{lang-zh|t=宏達國際電子股份有限公司|s=宏达国际电子股份有限公司|p=Hóngdá Guójì Diànzǐ Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī|first=t|c=}}) (High Tech Computer Corporation, literally ''Hongda International Electronics Co., Ltd.''; trading as '''HTC''') is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[consumer electronics]] company headquartered in [[Xindian District]], [[New Taipei City]], Taiwan. Founded in 1997, HTC began as an [[original design manufacturer]] and [[original equipment manufacturer]], designing and manufacturing laptop computers.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/htc-desire-526-2786|title=HTC Desire 526 price, specifications, features, comparison|website=NDTV Gadgets360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>

After initially making smartphones based mostly on [[Windows Mobile]], HTC became a co-founding member of the [[Open Handset Alliance]], a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9810937-2.html|title=Google unveils cell phone software and alliance|publisher=CNET News|date=2007-11-05|access-date=2010-07-08}}</ref> The [[HTC Dream]] (marketed by [[T-Mobile]] in many countries as the T-Mobile G1) was the first phone on the market to run Android.

Although initially successful as a smartphone vendor, competition from [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Samsung Electronics]], among others, diluted its market share, which reached just 7.2% by April 2015, and the company has experienced consecutive net losses. In 2016, HTC began to diversify its business beyond smartphones, having partnered with [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to produce a [[virtual reality]] platform known as [[HTC Vive]]. After having collaborated with [[Google]] on its [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel smartphone]], HTC sold roughly half of its design and research talent, as well as non-exclusive rights to smartphone-related [[intellectual property]], to Google in 2017 for {{US$|1.1}} billion.
