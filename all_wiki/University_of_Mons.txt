The '''University of Mons''' ({{lang-fr|Université de Mons}}) is a Belgian university located in the city of [[Mons]], founded in 2009 by merging the [[Faculté polytechnique de Mons|Engineering Faculty of Mons]] (FPMs) and the [[University of Mons-Hainaut]]. The merging of the institutions was achieved following a geographical logic because of the high complementarity between them and their location in the same city.

This merger was accepted by the two universities on 6 July 2007 and confirmed by the Belgian French Community Parliament on 25 November 2008. From an administrative point of view the University of Mons was founded on 1 January 2009.

Prof. [[Calogero Conti]], former rector of the Engineering Faculty of Mons, became the first rector of the University of Mons.

The University of Mons is the fourth (and smallest) university of the French community of Belgium with about 5,700 students.
