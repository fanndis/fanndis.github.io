'''Sumner Murray Redstone''' ({{ne}} '''Rothstein'''; May 27, 1923&nbsp;– August 11, 2020) was an American billionaire businessman and [[media magnate]]. He was the [[majority owner]] and chairman of the [[National Amusements]] theater chain. Through National Amusements, Redstone, up until his death, was, and his family remain, majority voting shareholders of mass media conglomerate [[ViacomCBS]], in turn, the parent company of the [[Paramount Pictures]] film studio, the [[CBS]] television network, and [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks|various cable networks]]. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', as of April 2020, he was worth US$2.6&nbsp;billion.<ref name="forbes" />

After completing law school, Redstone served as special assistant to U.S. Attorney General [[Tom C.

In 1954, he joined his father's theater chain, [[National Amusements]] and in 1967, he became CEO of the company.<ref name=CNNRedstoneFacts /> As the company grew, Redstone came to believe that content would become more important than distribution mechanisms: channels of distribution (in varied forms) would always exist, but content would always be essential (Redstone coined the phrase, "Content is king!")<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/buniverse/videos/view/?dept=&id=128| archive-url= https://archive.today/20120722055829/http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/buniverse/videos/view/?dept=&id=128| url-status= dead| archive-date= July 22, 2012| title= A Conversation with Sumner Redstone| publisher= BU.edu}}</ref> He [[investment|invested]] in [[Columbia Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Orion Pictures]], and [[Paramount Pictures]] (Redstone's Viacom would buy Paramount in the 1990s), all of which turned over huge profits when he chose to sell their [[stock]] in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sumner Redstone Will Be 91 On Tuesday Now Selling Shares for Estate Planning |url=https://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/05/25/sumner-redstone-will-be-91-on-tuesday-now-selling-shares-for-estate-planning/ |website=Jewish Business News |accessdate=August 15, 2020 |date=May 25, 2014}}</ref>

==Career==

===Viacom===
Looking for a new business venture, Redstone set his sights on [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom International]], a company which he had already been buying stock in as an investment and was a spin-off of [[CBS]] in 1971 after the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] ruled at the time that [[television network]]s could not [[Television syndication|syndicate]] programs following their network run (a ruling that has since been repealed).<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Viacom Inc. – FundingUniverse |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/viacom-inc-history/ |website=www.fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=August 13, 2020}}</ref> Viacom syndicated most of CBS's in-house productions (such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', as well as the pre-1960 [[Desilu Productions]] library which CBS acquired in 1960, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' being among the acquired programs),<ref name="fortune">{{cite web |title=Sumner Redstone, Viacom founder and old-fashioned media mogul, dies at 97 |url=https://fortune.com/2020/08/12/sumner-redstone-obituary-viacom-cbs/ |website=Fortune |accessdate=August 13, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> but also found syndicating other programs highly lucrative, including most of [[Carsey-Werner Productions]]' shows (''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', and ''[[A Different World]]''), as well as syndicating shows for other companies ([[Columbia Pictures Television]]'s ''[[All in the Family]]'' was one example, as was [[MTM Enterprises]]' ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''), and cable channels ([[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' and ''[[Finders Keepers (1987 TV series)|Finders Keepers]]'', co-syndicated with [[20th Television]], were two examples).<ref name="fortune" />

Viacom also owned [[MTV Networks]] (formerly known as Warner-AMEX Satellite Entertainment), which owned [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]]. In addition, other properties included Showtime Networks (a pay-television network similar to [[HBO]] and [[Cinemax]]) and [[The Movie Channel]].<ref>{{cite web |title=CBS-Viacom merger reunites the storied network with Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount Pictures |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-08-13/cbs-merger-viacom-comedy-central-mtv-paramount-pictures |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 13, 2020 |date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> Viacom acquired MTV Networks in 1985 for $550&nbsp;million from [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]]' [[Warner Communications]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dreyfuss |first1=Joel |last2=Rogers |first2=Michael |title=Viacom buys MTV - September 30, 1985 |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1985/09/30/66485/index.htm |website=money.cnn.com |accessdate=August 13, 2020 |date=September 30, 1985}}</ref> (WCI bought [[American Express]]' share and then sold the entire entity to Viacom, as they felt that, in addition to losing money from the short-lived [[QUBE]] service, they could not make a lot of money from the venture and the bias of a studio owning cable channels would be a conflict of interest. The studio's stance changed in 1996, when as [[Time Warner]] it bought [[Turner Broadcasting]].)<ref>{{cite web |title=The Global Media Giants |url=https://www.lehigh.edu/~jl0d/J246-99/mcchesney.html |website=www.lehigh.edu |accessdate=August 15, 2020}}</ref>

After a four-month [[hostile takeover]] in 1987, Redstone won voting control of Viacom.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-05/business/fi-7618_1_takeover-battle |title=Viacom Accepts Redstone's $3.4-Billion Takeover Bid, Ending Four-Month Battle - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=March 5, 1987 |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |first=Paul |last=Richter}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-18/business/fi-25989_1_frank-biondi?pg=2 |title=SHAKE-UP AT VIACOM : PROFILE: A SURVIVOR : With Each Ouster, Biondi Bounces Back - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=January 18, 1996 |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |first=Karen |last=Kaplan}}</ref>

===Paramount Pictures===
Redstone's next acquisition was the purchase of Paramount Communications (previously [[Gulf+Western]]), parent of [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feeney |first1=Mark |title=Sumner M.

Some say that Redstone overpaid, but after he shed certain assets — the [[Madison Square Garden]] properties (which included the [[NBA]]'s [[New York Knicks]] and the [[NHL]]'s [[New York Rangers]]) to [[Charles Dolan]]'s [[Cablevision]] and [[Simon & Schuster]]'s educational publishing units to [[Pearson PLC]] — for almost $4&nbsp;billion, Redstone turned Viacom's expenditure into a substantial profit. Under Redstone's leadership, Paramount produced such films as ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (one of the highest-grossing films of all time and [[Best Picture Academy Award]] winner),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm |title=Titanic (1997) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=March 15, 1998 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Braveheart]]'' (Best Picture [[Academy Award]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=braveheart.htm |title=Braveheart - 1995 Academy Awards Profile |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=May 24, 1995 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (also a Best Picture winner)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=forrestgump.htm |title=Forrest Gump - 1994 Academy Awards Profile |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=July 6, 1994 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> and the creation of the hugely successful ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=missionimpossible.htm |title=Mission: Impossible (1996) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> series of pictures.

In December 2005, Redstone announced that Paramount had agreed to buy [[DreamWorks SKG]] for an estimated $1.6&nbsp;billion.<ref name="fortune"/> The acquisition was completed on February 1, 2006. Subsequent financing brought Viacom's investment down to $700&nbsp;million. The animation studio, [[DreamWorks Animation]], was not included in the deal as it has been its own company since late 2004. However, Paramount had the rights to distribute films by DreamWorks Animation until 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=DreamWorks Animation Inks Distribution Deal with Fox |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dreamworks-animation-inks-distribution-deal-364118 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=August 15, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

===CBS===
One of Redstone's largest acquisitions came in the form of Viacom's former parent, CBS. Former Viacom President and COO [[Mel Karmazin]] (who was then the president of CBS) proposed a merger to Redstone on favorable terms and after the merger completed in 2000,<ref>{{cite web |title=CBS And Viacom Complete Merger |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-and-viacom-complete-merger/ |website=www.cbsnews.com |accessdate=August 13, 2020}}</ref> Viacom had some of the most diversified businesses imaginable. Viacom had assets in the form of broadcast networks (CBS and [[UPN]]), [[cable television]] networks ([[MTV]], [[VH1]], [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], [[MTV2]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[Nick at Nite]], [[Noggin (TV channel)|Noggin]]/[[The N]], [[TV Land]], [[Country Music Television|CMT]], and [[Spike TV]]), [[pay television]] ([[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]]), [[Radio programming|radio]] ([[Infinity Broadcasting]], which produced the [[Howard Stern]] [[Talk radio|radio show]]s), [[outdoor advertising]], motion pictures ([[Paramount Pictures]]), [[television production]] ([[Spelling Entertainment]], [[Paramount Television]], [[Big Ticket Entertainment]], [[CBS Productions]], and [[Viacom Productions]]), and [[King World Productions]] (a syndication unit, which notably syndicates the runaway daytime hit, ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', as well as ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and ''[[Jeopardy!]]''), among others.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michael King dies at 67; TV's King World Productions launched 'Oprah' |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-michael-king-20150530-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 15, 2020 |date=May 30, 2015}}</ref>

After CBS and Viacom split in 2006, Redstone remained chairman of both companies but two separate CEOs were appointed for each company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/16/us/sumner-redstone-fast-facts/index.html|title=Sumner Redstone Fast Facts|website=CNN|access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref>

===Succession===
Redstone's trusts made it clear that his daughter, [[Shari Redstone]] (vice-chairwoman of the board of Viacom and CBS as well as president of National Amusements), was set to assume his role upon his death. However, a November 22, 2006, ''[[New York Times]]'' article indicated that Redstone was reconsidering his daughter's role. In 2007, they feuded publicly over issues of corporate governance and the future of the cinema chain.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/09/19/redstone_says_he_relies_on_his_instinct/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Jenn | last=Abelson | title=Redstone says he relies on his instinct | date=September 19, 2007}}</ref>

Documents were made public which verify that, as part of a settlement from Sumner's first divorce, all of Sumner's stock is in [[Trust Law|irrevocable trusts]] that will be left for his grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/business/la-fi-shari1oct01,1,4236064.story?coll=la-headlines-business-enter | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Claudia | last=Eller | title=Redstone family rift may not be healed | date=October 1, 2007}}</ref> On March 1, 2010, Sumner publicly confirmed that all of his stock would be left for his five grandchildren (Brandon Korff, Kimberlee Korff, Tyler Korff, Keryn Redstone, and Lauren Redstone).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1428207331&play=1 |title=Faber Exclusive: Sumner's Successor |publisher=CNBC |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}</ref>

Redstone made arrangements to step down as CEO of Viacom in 2006. After Mel Karmazin resigned in 2004, two heirs apparent were named: Co-President and Co-COO [[Les Moonves]] (who was number 2 to Karmazin at CBS; he was the former head of [[Warner Bros. Television]] and before that, [[Lorimar Television]]) and Co-President and Co-COO [[Tom Freston]] (who had been president and CEO of MTV Networks since 1987 and had been with the company since the formation of MTV Networks' precursor company, Warner-AMEX Satellite Entertainment). After the Viacom split was approved by the board on June 14, 2005, Les headed CBS Corporation, and Tom headed the second incarnation of Viacom, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |last2=Steinberg |first2=Brian |title=CBS-Viacom: 20 Years Later, a Look Back at the High Hopes and Eventual Collapse of That First Merger |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/cbs-viacom-merger-20-years-later-moonves-redstone-karmazin-freston-1203265965/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 12, 2020 |language=en |date=August 13, 2019}}</ref>

On September 5, 2006, Redstone removed Freston as president and CEO of Viacom and replaced him with director and former Viacom counsel [[Philippe Dauman]]. Redstone also brought back former CFO Tom Dooley. This was surprising to many, as Freston had been seen by many as Redstone's heir apparent, and Redstone had touted that Freston would run the company after he retired. Redstone publicly stated that he let Freston go because of Viacom's lack of aggressiveness in the digital/online arena, lack of contact with investors, and a lackluster upfront (coupled with falling viewership) at [[MTV Networks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80704186|title=03/16/2005 - Viacom Is Exploring The Division Of Its Business Into Separate Publicly-Traded Companies|date=April 5, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405235046/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80704186|archive-date=April 5, 2005}}</ref><ref name=NYPost-FrestonFiring-2006>{{cite news|last1=Arango|first1=Tim|title=Sumner's Fall: Freston's Firing Costs Him $113M|url=https://nypost.com/2006/09/07/sumners-fall-frestons-firing-costs-him-113m/|accessdate=December 7, 2015|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=September 7, 2006}}</ref>

===Holdings===
At the time of his death, Redstone owned over seventy percent of the [[voting interest]] of ViacomCBS. ViacomCBS was controlled by Redstone through National Amusements. Redstone sold his holdings of [[Midway Games]], of over 89 percent, in December 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10450507/1/redstone-to-sell-control-of-midway-games.html|title=Redstone to Sell Control of Midway Games|website=TheStreet|language=en-US|access-date=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

According to [[MarketWatch]], "Herzer agreed to pay back $3.25 million of the tens of millions of gifts that Redstone gave her", and "the wide-ranging agreement ends all litigation between the two sides, who have been battling in the courts since the fall of 2015 when Redstone kicked Herzer out of his [[Beverly Hills]] mansion, replaced her as his health-care agent and wrote her out of his estate planning."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sumner-redstone-family-settle-with-former-live-in-companion-manuela-herzer-2019-01-08|title=Sumner Redstone, family settle with former live-in companion Manuela Herzer|last=Hagey|first=Keach|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sumner-redstone-and-family-settle-legal-dispute-with-former-companion-manuela-herzer-11546964420|title=Sumner Redstone and Family Settle Legal Dispute With Former Companion Manuela Herzer|last=Hagey|first=Keach|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>
