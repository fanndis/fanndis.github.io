==Headquarters==
[[File:First-floor Treat Rotunda at NEHGS, 99-101 Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts.tif|thumb|First-floor Treat Rotunda at NEHGS.]]
NEHGS is headquartered at 99–101 Newbury Street in Boston's [[Back Bay]] neighborhood. NEHGS moved there in 1964 and it is the seventh location for the organization.

The first three floors of NEHGS' present location were built as the headquarters of The New England Trust Company in 1928, designed by Ralph Coolidge Henry and Henry P. Richmond, successors to noted American architect [[Guy Lowell]]. Henry and Richmond also designed buildings at [[Colby College]], Pine Manor, and [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts. When NEHGS moved into its new headquarters in 1964, it added five floors on top of the New England Trust Company building.

Prior headquarters included the City Building, Court Square, Room 9 during the years 1846 and 1847; the Massachusetts Block, Court Square for 1847 to 1851; 5 Tremont Street, 3rd floor for 1851 through 1858; 17 Bromfield Street, 3rd floor from 1858 to 1871; 18 Somerset Street – 1871 to 1913; 9 Ashburton Place from 1913 to 1964.[[File:Gwash1.jpg|thumb|upright|George Washington "porthole" portrait painted by Rembrandt Peale, 1853.]]

===Library===
The NEHGS research library holds materials related to genealogical research in the United States, as well as some materials relevant to the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada. NEHGS collections include 200,000 bound volumes; 5,000+ linear feet of original manuscripts; and 100,000 rolls of microfilm. NEHGS also holds a fine arts collection including works on canvas or paper by Joseph Badger, [[John Singleton Copley]], [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]], [[Jonathan Mason, Jr.]], [[Rembandt Peale]], and [[John Ritto Penniman]]. Items from its collection of American furniture were featured in ''Antiques and the Arts Weekly Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antiquesandthearts.com/web-1-24-14-lead-ne-hist/|title=New England Historic Genealogical Society|work=Antiques and the Arts Weekly|date=21 Jul 2014|last=McQueeney|first=Frances|access-date=4 Sep 2019}}</ref> In March 2008, NEHGS received a gift of the earliest known photograph of [[Helen Keller]] with her teacher [[Anne Sullivan]].

The photograph was subsequently given to the Brewster Historical Society in [[Brewster, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2015/03/01/keller-picture-perfect-for-museum/|title=Helen Keller picture proves perfect for Massachusetts museum|last=Times|first=K.

The Society's website has online exhibits featuring items from the Society's manuscript collection.

In addition to the main website, NEHGS supports www.GreatMigration.org.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.GreatMigration.org|title=The Great Migration, A Survey of New England: 1620-1640|publisher=Greatmigration.org|accessdate=2013-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511074720/http://www.greatmigration.org/|archive-date=2013-05-11|url-status=live}}</ref>

NEHGS launched its first website, www.NEHGS.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.NEHGS.org|title=New England Historic Genealogical Society|publisher=Nehgs.org|accessdate=2013-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723110427/http://www.nehgs.org./|archive-date=2008-07-23|url-status=live}}</ref> in 1996; it was one of the first non-profit genealogical societies to have an online presence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} NEHGS' first website consisted of 38 pages with information about NEHGS services and programs.

In 2001, NEHGS redesigned its website to include data rich content, new articles, and member forums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Education===
NEHGS provides various educational opportunities relating to genealogy and family history. Most of educational programs are led and/or taught by members of the NEHGS staff, though some include invited guests.

NEHGS offers a series of research tours, lectures, seminars, and other events throughout the year. For over thirty years, NEHGS has conducted a week-long tour to the [[Family History Library]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and frequently offers opportunities to research and visit in Ireland, Scotland, [[Washington D.C.]], England, [[Quebec]], and other places. For more than twenty years, NEHGS has sponsored a week-long summer “Come Home to New England” program in Boston.

The Society has also developed online seminars many of which are taught by their staff genealogists on a wide variety of topics such as Internet searching, beginning genealogical research, organizing, preparing lineage society applications, and others.

==Publications==
NEHGS publishes books on families, genealogists, and historians, including authoritative guides, source record compilations, compiled genealogies, and family histories. The Newbury Street Press imprint is America's leading publisher of privately sponsored family histories.

Among the Society's recent additions to the genealogical canon are ''Genealogical Writing in the 21st Century, New Englanders in the 1600s, A Guide to Massachusetts Cemeteries, Ancestors of American Presidents: 2009 edition, The Descendants of Henry Sewall,'' and ''Twenty Families of Color in Massachusetts''.

===''The New England Historical and Genealogical Register''===
Published quarterly since 1847, ''The New England Historical and Genealogical Register'' is the flagship journal of American genealogy and the oldest in the field. A wide variety of genealogies and source material have been published in the ''Register'' for over 160 years, with an emphasis on New England. Authoritative compiled genealogies have always been a primary focus of the ''Register''. Thousands of New England families have been treated in the pages of the journal, and many more are referred to incidentally. Typically, these articles solve a genealogical problem, identify immigrant origins, or present a full-scale treatment of multiple generations. Henry B. Hoff was appointed editor of the ''Register'' in 2001. In October 2009, an annual supplement to the ''Register'', ''American Ancestors Journal'', was introduced.

===The Great Migration Study Project===
{{main|Great Migration Study Project}}

The Great Migration Study Project is an ongoing scholarly endeavor to create short biographical sketches of all immigrants from Europe to colonial [[New England]] between 1620 and 1640 (the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Puritan great migration]]). These number over 5,500 individuals, not including dependent wives and children, almost all of whom came from [[England]] (in a few cases after an interlude in the [[Netherlands]]). Directed by [[Robert Charles Anderson]], the project is conducted in collaboration with the Society and has been underway since 1988. Over a dozen volumes of sketches have been published so far, covering over two thousand subjects.<ref>Robert Charles Anderson, ''The Great Migration Directory'' (Boston: NEHGS, 2015).</ref>
