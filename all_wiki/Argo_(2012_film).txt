The film, starring Affleck as Mendez, and [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Alan Arkin]], and [[John Goodman]] in supporting roles, was released in the United States on October 12, 2012. It was produced by [[Grant Heslov]], Affleck and [[George Clooney]].

''Argo'' was praised for the acting (particularly Arkin and Goodman's), Affleck's direction, Terrio's screenplay, the editing, and Desplat's score. The film received seven nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also earned five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations: it won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] for Alan Arkin. It won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[19th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and Arkin was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]]. It also won [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Hochi Film Award|37th Hochi Film Award]] for Best International Picture.

Despite its praise, ''Argo'' has been criticized for minimizing the role of the Canadian embassy in the rescue, for falsely showing that the Americans were turned away by the British and New Zealand embassies, and for exaggerating the danger the group faced during events preceding their escape from the country.

== Plot ==
On November 4, 1979, Iranian [[Islamism|Islamists]] storm the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|United States embassy in Tehran]] in retaliation for President [[Jimmy Carter]] giving the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] asylum in the U.S. during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Sixty-six of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]]. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] begins to explore options for [[Extraction (military)|exfiltrating]] them from Iran. [[Tony Mendez]], a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.

Mendez contacts [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing ''Argo'', a "science fantasy adventure" in the style of [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']], to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.

Posing as a producer for ''Argo'', Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with [[Canadian passports]] and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|bazaar]] to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.

Mendez is told that the operation has been canceled to avoid conflicting with a [[Operation Eagle Claw|planned military rescue of the hostages]]. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a [[Swissair]] flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.

To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. Mendez is awarded the [[Intelligence Star]], but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the [[Canadian Caper]] is declassified in 1997.

==Production==
''Argo'' is based on the "Canadian Caper" that took place during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1979 and 1980. [[Chris Terrio]] wrote the screenplay based on Joshuah Bearman's 2007 article "How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran," which was published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name="Bearman"/>

In 2007, the producers [[George Clooney]], [[Grant Heslov]] and [[David Klawans]] set up a project based on the article. Affleck's participation was announced in February 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |title=Affleck in talks to direct 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035540/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031570 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> The following June, Alan Arkin was the first person cast in the film.<ref name="First">{{cite journal|last=Sneider |first=Jeff |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |title=Alan Arkin first to board 'Argo' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109035626/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038411 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 }}</ref> After the rest of the roles were cast, filming began in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmapia.com/published/scenes?placeId=1825&movie=argo|title=Scenes from 'Argo' shot in 'Los Angeles'|publisher=filmapia|access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref> in August 2011.

As a historical piece, the film made use of archival news footage from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]; and included popular songs from the era, such as "[[Little T&A]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] (an anachronism, as it was not released until the following year), "[[Sultans of Swing]]" by [[Dire Straits]], "[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]" by [[Van Halen]] and "[[When the Levee Breaks]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/argo Argo (2012) – Soundtrack.net]</ref> For its part, Warner Bros. used its 1972–1984 [[production logo]] featuring the "Big W" logo designed by [[Saul Bass]] for [[Warner Communications]] to open the film and painted on its studio lot's famed water tower the logo of [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|The Burbank Studios]] (the facility's name during the 1970s and 1980s when Warner shared it with [[Columbia Pictures]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haithman | first=Diane |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/12/oscars-argo-production-design/|title=OSCARS: Re-Creating The Look Of The '70s For 'Argo'|journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

The screenplay used by the CIA to create their cover story was an adaptation of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Lord of Light]]''.  Producer Barry Geller had spearheaded an earlier attempt to produce the film using the original title. After that production attempt failed, the screenplay was renamed ''Argo'' and used by the CIA.<ref name="Bearman"/><ref>{{cite web | last1=Higgins | first1=Bill | last2=Kit | first2=Borys |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ben-affleck-argo-odd-hollywood-history-374054| title=The Odd Hollywood History Behind Ben Affleck's 'Argo' | work=Hollywood Reporter | date=September 26, 2012 | access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>

According to Tony Mendez, Studio Six—the phony Hollywood production office he helped create at the core of the CIA plan—proved so convincing that even weeks after the rescue was complete and the office had folded, 26 scripts were delivered to its address, including one from [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=Lane>{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Anthony|title=Film Within A Film|journal=The New Yorker|date=October 15, 2012|page=99|url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2012/10/15/121015crci_cinema_lane|access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2016, research by ''[[Vice (magazine)|VICE]]'', based on documents received under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the CIA was involved in the production of the 2012 ''Argo'',<ref name="news.vice.com">{{cite web | last=Leopold | first=Jason | title=The CIA Helped Produce an Episode of 'Top Chef' | url=https://news.vice.com/article/cia-helped-produce-top-chef-covert-affairs | work=VICE | date=April 6, 2016 | access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Adam | last=Johnson | title=CIA's Work With Filmmakers Puts All Media Workers at Risk | url=http://fair.org/home/cias-work-with-filmmakers-puts-all-media-workers-at-risk/ | publisher=FAIR.org | date=April 8, 2016 | access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref> as it was in a number of American entertainment productions (such as the well-established case of the 2012 film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]''<ref>{{cite web | first1=Jason | last1=Leopold | first2=Ky | last2=Henderson | title=Tequila, Painted Pearls, and Prada — How the CIA Helped Produce 'Zero Dark Thirty' | url=https://news.vice.com/article/tequila-painted-pearls-and-prada-how-the-cia-helped-produce-zero-dark-thirty | work=VICE | date=September 9, 2015 | access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>).

===Critical response===
''Argo'' was acclaimed by critics, praising Ben Affleck's direction, the cast (especially Arkin and Goodman), the script and the editing. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 96%, based on 356 reviews, with an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 8.37/10.

Naming ''Argo'' one of the best 11 films of 2012, critic [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "Ben Affleck's seamless direction catapults him to the forefront of Hollywood filmmakers turning out thoughtful entertainment."<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=The Year of the Body Vulnerable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/movies/lincoln-and-amour-top-stephen-holdens-best-of-list.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Times]]'' said it felt "like a movie from an earlier era — less frenetic, less showy, more focused on narrative than sensation," but that the script included "too many characters that he doesn't quite develop."<ref>Peter Suderman, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/11/movie-review-argo/ Movie Review: 'Argo'], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', October 11, 2012</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] said, 
{{quote|The craft in this film is rare. It is so easy to manufacture a thriller from chases and gunfire, and so very hard to fine-tune it out of exquisite timing and a plot that's so clear to us we wonder why it isn't obvious to the Iranians. After all, who in their right mind would believe a space opera was being filmed in Iran during the hostage crisis?<ref name="ebert" />}}Ebert gave the film 4/4 stars, calling it "spellbinding" and "surprisingly funny," and chose it as the best film of the year, the last film he would choose for this honor before his death in 2013.<ref name=ebert>Ebert, Roger (10 October 2012).

Literary critic [[Stanley Fish]] says that the film is a standard [[caper film]] in which "some improbable task has to be pulled off by a combination of ingenuity, training, deception and luck." He goes on to describe the film's structure: "(1) the presentation of the scheme to reluctant and unimaginative superiors, (2) the transformation of a ragtag bunch of ne'er-do-wells and wackos into a coherent, coordinated unit and (3) the carrying out of the task."<ref name="fish"/>

Although he thinks the film is good at building and sustaining suspense, he concludes,
{{quote|This is one of those movies that depend on your not thinking much about it; for as soon as you reflect on what's happening rather than being swept up in the narrative flow, there doesn't seem much to it aside from the skill with which suspense is maintained despite the fact that you know in advance how it's going to turn out. ... Once the deed is successfully done, there's really nothing much to say, and anything that is said seems contrived. That is the virtue of an entertainment like this; it doesn't linger in the memory and provoke afterthoughts.<ref name="fish">{{cite news|first=Stanley|last=Fish|title=The 'Argo' Caper|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/the-argo-caper/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 2012|access-date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Reaction by Iranians===
[[Abolhassan Banisadr]], foreign minister and then president during the incident, argued that the movie does not take into account the fact that most of [[Interim Government of Iran (1979)|the cabinet members]] advocated freeing all the American personnel quickly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parry|first=Robert|title='October Surprise' and 'Argo'|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2013/03/07/october-surprise-and-argo/|access-date=July 30, 2013|work=Consortium News|date= March 7, 2013}}</ref> [[Jian Ghomeshi]], a Canadian writer and radio figure of Iranian descent, thought the film had a "deeply troubling portrayal of the Iranian people." Ghomeshi asserted "among all the rave reviews, virtually no one in the mainstream media has called out [the] unbalanced depiction of an entire ethnic national group, and the broader implications of the portrait." He also suggested that the timing of the film was poor, as American and Iranian political relations were at a low point.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ghomeshi|first=Jian|title=Argo is crowd-pleasing, entertaining – and unfair to Iranians|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/jian-ghomeshi-argo-is-crowd-pleasing-entertaining-and-unfair-to-iranians/article4855769/|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=November 2, 2012|access-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref> University of Michigan history professor [[Juan Cole]] had a similar assessment, writing that the film's narrative fails to provide adequate historical context for the events it portrays, and such errors of omission lead all of the Iranian characters in the film to be depicted as ethnic stereotypes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Juan|title="Argo" as Orientalism and why it Upsets Iranians| url=http://www.juancole.com/2013/02/orientalism-upsets-iranians.html|work=Informed Comment|date=January 26, 2013| access-date=February 26, 2013}}</ref> A November 3, 2012 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' claimed that the film had received very little attention in Tehran, though [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], who was the spokesperson of the students who took the hostages and called only "Tehran Mary" in the film's credits, said that the film did not show "the real reasons behind the event."<ref>{{cite news| last=Mostaghim|first=Ramin|author2=Alexandra Sandels|title=U.S. film 'Argo' not getting any buzz in Iran|work=Los Angeles Times| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/03/world/la-fg-iran-argo-20121104|date=November 3, 2012|access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref> The film also ignores the importance of the date of the Embassy takeover. Mark Bowen, in his book on the subject, noted that November 4th was recognized as National Student's Day to acknowledge the student protesters killed by the Shah's police the year before.

Bootleg DVDs have become popular and are estimated at "several hundreds of thousands" of copies. Interpretations of the film's popularity in Iran have varied, ranging from the fact that the movie portrays the excesses of the revolution and the hostage crisis, which had been long glorified in Iran, to Iranians viewing it as a reminder of what caused the poor relations with America and the ensuing cost to Iran, decades after the embassy takeover.<ref name="Kamali">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/nov/13/argo-iranians-ben-affleck|title=Why Argo is hard for Iranians to watch|author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|date=November 13, 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The high DVD sales suggests a form of silent protest against the government's ongoing hostility to relations with America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578263610160724572|title=Iran's Latest Hit: Bootleg 'Argo' DVDs|last=Fassihi|first=Farnaz|date=February 1, 2013|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=December 14, 2018}}</ref>

{{Main|List of accolades received by Argo (2012 film)}}
The film was nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. Affleck was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and following the announcement of the nominations, [[Bradley Cooper]], who was nominated for his [[Academy Award for Best Actor|leading performance]] in ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'', declared: "Ben Affleck got robbed." This opinion was shared by the ceremony's host [[Seth MacFarlane]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Macatee|first=Rebecca|title=Ben Affleck's Oscars Snub: Bradley Cooper, Seth MacFarlane Think Argo Director Was Robbed|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/377346/ben-affleck-s-oscars-snub-bradley-cooper-seth-macfarlane-think-argo-director-was-robbed|work=[[E!

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote about this controversy:

{{quote|Standing in the Golden Globe pressroom with his directing trophy, Affleck acknowledged that it was frustrating not to get an Oscar nod when many felt he deserved one.

[[File:ThanksCanada.JPG|thumb|right|People welcoming the six American diplomats back to the United States and expressing thanks to Canada, 1980]]

In a CNN interview, former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] addressed the controversy: 
{{quote|90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good. But Ben Affleck's character in the film was... only in Tehran a day and a half. And the main hero, in my opinion, was [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Ken Taylor]], who was the Canadian ambassador who orchestrated the entire process.<ref>{{cite news| last=McDevitt| first=Caitlin| title=Jimmy Carter: 'Argo' great but inaccurate| url= http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2013/02/jimmy-carter-argo-great-but-inaccurate-157592.html| access-date=February 22, 2013| newspaper=Politico| date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>}}Taylor noted, "In reality, Canada was responsible for the six and the CIA was a junior partner. But I realize this is a movie and you have to keep the audience on the edge of their seats."<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 /> In the film, Taylor is shown threatening to close the Canadian embassy. This did not happen, and the Canadians never considered abandoning the six Americans who had taken refuge under their protection.<ref name=KnelmanTorStar2 />

Affleck asserted: 
{{quote|Because we say it's based on a true story, rather than this is a true story, we're allowed to take some dramatic license. There's a spirit of truth .... the kinds of things that are really important to be true are—for example, the relationship between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. stood up collectively as a nation and said, "We like you, we appreciate you, we respect you, and we're in your debt."... There were folks who didn't want to stick their necks out and the Canadians did. They said, "We'll risk our diplomatic standing, our lives, by harbouring six Americans because it's the right thing to do."  Because of that, their lives were saved."<ref name=Macleans />}}

===British and New Zealand roles===
Upon its release in October 2012, the film was criticized for its suggestion that [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[New Zealand]] embassies had turned away the American refugees in Tehran. Neither the British nor the New Zealand embassies had turned the refugees away. Both embassies, along with the Canadians, helped them. The British had initially hosted the American refugees; however, the location was deemed unsafe as the British embassy itself had been targeted and surrounded by mobs and all involved officials from the various nations believed the Canadian ambassador's residence to be a safer location. New Zealand diplomatic ambassadors organised a place for the refugees to hide if they needed to change their location,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Opinion-Ben-Affleck-must-apologise-to-NZ-for-Argos-deception/tabid/1382/articleID/288296/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title=Opinion: Ben Affleck must apologise to NZ for Argo's deception |date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> and driving the Americans to the airport when they made their escape from Tehran.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/NZs-role-in-Iran-crisis-tainted-in-Afflecks-film-Argo/tabid/418/articleID/273069/Default.aspx |title=NZ's role in Iran crisis tainted in Affleck's film 'Argo' – Story – Entertainment |work=3 News |access-date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> British diplomats also assisted other American hostages beyond the escaped group of six.<ref>{{cite web|author=Film |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9622647/Ben-Afflecks-new-film-Argo-upsets-British-diplomats-who-helped-Americans-in-Iran.html |title=Ben Affleck's new film 'Argo' upsets British diplomats who helped Americans in Iran |work=Telegraph|access-date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> Bob Anders, the U.S. consular agent played in the film by [[Tate Donovan]], said, "They put their lives on the line for us.

[[Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet|Sir John Graham]], the then-[[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran|British ambassador to Iran]], said, 
{{quote|My immediate reaction on hearing about this was one of outrage. I have since simmered down, but am still very distressed that the film-makers should have got it so wrong. My concern is that the inaccurate account should not enter the mythology of the events in Tehran in November 1979."<ref name = "Telegraph UK review"/>}} The then-British [[chargé d'affaires]] in Tehran said that, had the Americans been discovered in the British embassy, "I can assure you we'd all have been for the high jump."<ref name = "Telegraph UK review"/> [[Martin Williams (diplomat)|Martin Williams]], secretary to Sir John Graham in Iran at the time, was the one who found the Americans, after searching for them in his own British car (the only [[Austin Maxi]] in Iran) and first sheltered them in his own house.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Affleck is quoted as saying to ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'': "I struggled with this long and hard, because it casts Britain and New Zealand in a way that is not totally fair. But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone."<ref name = "Telegraph UK review" />
On March 12, 2013, the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] censured Affleck by  unanimously agreeing to the following motion, initiated by [[New Zealand First]] leader [[Winston Peters]]:
{{quote|... this House acknowledge[s] with gratitude the efforts of former New Zealand diplomats [[Chris Beeby]] and Richard Sewell in assisting American hostages in Tehran during the hostage crisis in 1979, and express[es] its regret that the director of the movie'' Argo ''saw fit to mislead the world about what actually happened during that crisis when, in reality, our courageous diplomats' inspirational actions were of significant help to the American hostages and deserve the factual and historical record to be corrected.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/50HansD_20130312_00000008/motions-human-rights-fiji-treatment-of-detainees-iran |title=Motions—Iran Hostage Crisis—Fictional Representation of Role of New Zealand Diplomats|publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament|date= March 12, 2013|access-date=March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/movie-argo-misled-the-world/story-e6frf7k6-1226595680820|title=Movie Argo 'misled the world'|work=Herald Sun|date=March 12, 2013 |access-date=March 12, 2013}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

===Imminent danger to the group===
In the film, the diplomats face suspicious glances from Iranians whenever they go out in public, and appear close to being caught at many steps along the way to their freedom. In reality, the diplomats never appeared to be in imminent danger.<ref name="Macleans"/><ref name="KnelmanTorStar2"/><ref name="BBC News - Argo"/> Taylor's wife bought three sets of plane tickets from three different airlines ahead of time, without any issues.<ref name="Macleans"/><ref name="KnelmanTorStar2"/>
* The film depicts a dramatic last-minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration and Mendez declaring he will proceed with the mission. Carter delayed authorization by only 30 minutes, and that was before Mendez had left Europe for Iran.<ref name="CIA history">{{cite journal|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html |title=CIA Goes Hollywood: A Classic Case of Deception|last=Mendez |first=Antonio J. |author-link=Tony Mendez|journal=[[Studies in Intelligence]]|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|date=Winter 1999–2000 |access-date=November 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Other inaccuracies===
The film contains other historical inaccuracies:
* The screenplay does not include the six days Bob Anders, Mark and Cora Lijek and Joe and Kathy Stafford were on the run before taking refuge with the Canadians nor where Lee Schatz was until he joined the group at John and Zena Sheardown's home.
* The screenplay has the escapees—Mark and Cora Lijek, Bob Anders, Lee Schatz, and Joe and Kathy Stafford—settling down to enforced cohabitation at the residence of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. In reality, the group of five (Lee Schatz joined the Lijeks and Bob Anders about ten days later) was split between the Taylor house and the home of another Canadian official, [[John Sheardown]] and his wife [[Zena Sheardown|Zena]].<ref name="BBC News - Argo"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=John Sheardown, Canadian Who Sheltered Americans in Tehran, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/americas/john-sheardown-canadian-who-sheltered-americans-in-tehran-dies-at-88.html|access-date=February 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 4, 2013}}</ref>  It was in fact the friendship between Bob Anders and John Sheardown that led Bob to call John to seek sanctuary for the group when the haven with Thai cook Sam (Somchai) began to unravel.  John's response to Bob was, "Why didn't you call sooner?"
* "It's not true we could never go outside. John Sheardown's house had an interior courtyard with a garden and we could walk there freely," Mark Lijek says.<ref name="BBC News - Argo"/>
* Lester Siegel, played by [[Alan Arkin]], is not a real person. His name and some contribution are based on Robert Sidell's while his personality is based on [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]'s.<ref>{{cite web|title=How accurate is Argo|work=Slate| url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/10/12/argo_true_story_the_facts_and_fiction_behind_the_ben_affleck_movie.html |access-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref>
* In the depiction of a frantic effort by CIA headquarters, in Langley, to get President Jimmy Carter to re-authorize the mission so that previously purchased airline tickets would still be valid, a CIA officer is portrayed as getting the [[White House]] telephone operator to connect him to Chief of Staff [[Hamilton Jordan]] by impersonating a representative of the school attended by Jordan's children. In reality, Jordan was unmarried and had no children at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/dowd-the-oscar-for-best-fabrication.html |title=The Oscar for Best Fabrication|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|work=The New York Times|date=February 16, 2013|access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>
* The film depicts Mendez discovering the script with the title of ''Argo''. In reality the script was titled ''Lord of Light'', based on the [[Lord of Light|book of the same name]] by [[Roger Zelazny]]. The CIA changed the title to ''Argo.''<ref name="Bearman"/><ref name="Higgins">Higgins, Bill; Kit, Borys. "Argo's odd Hollywood history." ''Hollywood Reporter''. October 5, 2012: 64. eLibrary.

* Comic book artist [[Jack Kirby]] did not do his storyboard work for the fabricated CIA film production. He created these when there was an attempt to produce ''Lord of Light'' a few years before the Iranian hostage situation.<ref name="Bearman"/><ref name="Higgins"/>
* The [[Hollywood Sign]] is shown dilapidated as it had been in the 1970s. The sign had been repaired in 1978, two years prior to the events described in the film.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodsign.org/the-history-of-the-sign/1978-a-sign-is-reborn/ 1978: A Sign Is Reborn]. The Hollywood Sign. Retrieved on 2014-05-22.</ref>
* The [[Swissair]] flight that took Mendez and the hostage group out of Tehran is shown operated with a [[Boeing 747]]-300, a type which entered service in 1983, and is painted in a livery that Swissair introduced in 1980. In real life, the group departed Iran on a Swissair [[Douglas DC-8]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askthepilot.com/argo-gets-it-wrong/ |title="Argo" and the 747 |newspaper=Askthepilot.com |date=March 1, 2013 |author=Patrick Smith |access-date= August 17, 2015}}</ref>

===Casting controversy===
Some [[Hispanic]]s and film critics criticized the casting of Ben Affleck in the role of Mendez, who is of Mexican ancestry on his father's side.<ref>Amanda Hess, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/10/16/ben_affleck_in_argo_why_is_a_white_guy_playing_tony_mendez.html Ben Affleck Is No Tony Mendez], ''[[Slate (magazine)]]'', October 16, 2012</ref><ref>Ruben Navarrette Jr, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/09/opinion/navarrette-argo-affleck-latino Latino should have played lead in 'Argo'], ''[[CNN]]'', January 10, 2013</ref><ref>Eduardo Perez, [http://screenpicks.com/2012/10/perez-why-a-latino-not-ben-affleck-should-have-played-argo-lead-role/ Why a Latino — not Ben Affleck —Should Have Played 'Argo' Lead Role], ''ScreenPicks.com'', October 29, 2012</ref><ref>Moctesuma Esparza, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/08/argo-hollywood-latino-hero Argo plays to Hollywood's worst traditions by erasing a Latino hero], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 8, 2013</ref> [[Mexican-American]] actor and director [[Edward James Olmos]] considered Affleck's casting as Mendez a "mistake", and that the actor "had no sense of the cultural dynamic of the character he was playing".<ref>[http://www.latinrapper.com/edward-james-olmos-interview-5-4-2013.html Interview with Edward James Olmos], ''LatinRapper.com'', May 4, 2013</ref> However, Mendez himself has said that he was unconcerned about the casting, and noted he does not identify as Hispanic.<ref>[http://nbclatino.com/2013/01/10/argos-real-tony-mendez-im-not-hispanic/ Argo's real Tony Mendez: "I'm not Hispanic"], ''NBC Latino'', January 10, 2013</ref>
