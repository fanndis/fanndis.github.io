'''Hot Country Songs''' is a chart published weekly by [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine in the United States.

This 50-position chart lists the most popular [[country music]] songs, calculated weekly by collecting airplay data from [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|Nielsen BDS]] along with digital sales and streaming.

The current [[List of Billboard number-one country songs of 2020|number-one song]], as of the chart dated December 5, 2020, is "[[I Hope (Gabby Barrett song)|I Hope]]" by [[Gabby Barrett]].

==History==
''Billboard'' began compiling the popularity of country songs with its January 8, 1944, issue. Only the genre's most popular [[jukebox]] selections were tabulated, with the chart titled "Most Played Juke Box Folk Records".<ref name="campbell">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Michael|title=Popular Music in America:The Beat Goes On|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Chapter 30 Honky Tonk|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf0JAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT143}}</ref>

For approximately ten years, from 1948 to 1958, ''Billboard'' used three charts to measure the popularity of a given song.<ref name="campbell"/> In addition to the jukebox chart, these charts included:
* The "best sellers" chart – started May 15, 1948, as "Best Selling Retail Folk Records". 
* An [[airplay]] chart – started December 10, 1949, as "Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys".

The juke box chart was discontinued in June 1957. Starting with the October 20, 1958, issue, ''Billboard'' began combining sales and radio airplay in figuring a song's overall popularity, counting them in one single chart called "Hot C&W Sides".<ref name="campbell"/> The chart was published under the title Hot C&W Sides through the October 27, 1962, issue and "Hot Country Singles" thereafter, a title it would retain until 1990.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joel Whitburn's Top Country Songs: 1944–2005|page=ix|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|publisher=Record Research|date=2005|isbn=9780898201659}}</ref>

On January 20, 1990, the Hot Country Singles chart was reduced from 100 to 75 positions and began to be compiled entirely from information provided by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]], a system which electronically monitors radio airplay of songs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=R&B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|journal=Billboard|date=24 April 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> Four weeks later, on February 17, the chart was retitled "Hot Country Singles & Tracks". Beginning with the January 13, 2001, issue, the chart was reduced from 75 to 60 positions, and all songs on the chart at the time had their tally of weeks spent on the chart adjusted to count only weeks spent at No.&nbsp;60 or higher.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jessen|first=Wade|date=January 13, 2001|title=Country Corner|journal=Billboard|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/00s/2001/BB-2001-01-13.pdf}}</ref> Effective April 30, 2005, the chart was renamed "Hot Country Songs".

Starting in 1990, the rankings were determined by [[Arbitron]]-tallied listener audience for each spin that a song received. The methodology was changed for the first chart published in 1992 to tally the amount of spins a song received, but in January 2005, the methodology reverted to the audience format. This change was brought on because of "[[payola|label-sponsored spin programs]]" that had manipulated the chart several times in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|date=20 November 2004|title=Country returns to audience-based chart|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehMEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1}}</ref>

The Hot Country Songs chart methodology was changed starting with the October 20, 2012, issue to match the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: digital downloads and streaming data are combined with airplay from all radio formats to determine position. A new chart, the [[Country Airplay]] chart, was created using airplay exclusively from country radio stations. Following the change, songs that were receiving airplay on [[contemporary hit radio|top-40 pop]] were given a major advantage over songs popular only on country radio, and as an [[unintended consequence]], such songs began having record-long runs at the top of the chart. The first song to benefit from this change was [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", which had been declining in popularity but shot up to number one on the chart the first week the change took effect and stayed there until it set an all-time record for the most weeks at No. 1 by a solo female.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jessen|first1=Wade|title=Taylor Swift Makes Country Songs History|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/1481551/taylor-swift-makes-country-songs-history|accessdate=5 April 2018|work=Billboard Magazine|publisher=Billboard Musix|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> This was followed almost immediately by [[Florida Georgia Line]]'s "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]", which had the longest stay at number one of any song in the country chart's history (24 weeks),<ref>{{cite news|last=Jessen|first=Wade|title=Florida Georgia Line's 'Cruise' Sets Record For Longest No. 1 Run On Hot Country Songs|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5447163/florida-georgia-lines-cruise-sets-record-for-longest-no-1-run-on|accessdate=August 18, 2013|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> until it was surpassed by [[Sam Hunt]]'s "[[Body Like a Back Road]]" in 2017 (34 weeks). The record was subsequently broken by [[Bebe Rexha]] and Florida Georgia Line's "[[Meant to Be (Bebe Rexha song)|Meant to Be]]" in 2018 (50 weeks).<ref name="MTB"/>

''Billboard'' has not explicitly defined how it determines which songs qualify for the country chart and which ones do not, only that "a few factors are determined (...) first and foremost is musical composition" and that a song must "embrace enough elements of today's country music" to qualify. (The 1990–2012 chart did not have such ambiguity, being objectively measured by airplay from specifically identified country stations alone.) A later statement from ''Billboard'' elaborated on what those "few factors" entailed: "most notably the song's musical composition, but also how the song is marketed and promoted, the musical history of the artist, airplay the song receives and how the song is platformed on streaming services".<ref>https://qz.com/quartzy/1592928/old-town-road-is-only-the-third-country-song-in-30-years-to-make-it-to-make-it-to-no-1/</ref> The 2019 [[country rap]] record "[[Old Town Road]]" by [[Lil Nas X]] was a subject of controversy over this ambiguous standard after it initially appeared on the country chart, where it debuted and peaked at number 19, before ''Billboard'' took the song off subsequent charts, claiming it had made a mistake in including it. The song gained popularity through viral memes rather than radio, as only one country station, [[KRDC (AM)|Radio Disney Country]], had played it at the time of the charting.<ref name="RS">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/|title=Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' Was a Country Hit.

==Hot Country Songs chart achievements==
=== Songs with most weeks at number one ===
These are the songs with 16 or more weeks at number one. Fifteen songs accomplished this feat between 1946 and 1964, but none did so again until after the 2012 reformulation; between "[[Almost Persuaded (song)|Almost Persuaded]]'s" nine-week run in 1966 and the chart's reformulation in 2012, no song spent more than eight weeks atop the chart. Prolonged runs became commonplace again in 2012. {{as of|2018|October}}; five songs from this period have topped the chart for at least 16 weeks, and the top three longest chart runs have all been since 2012.
