'''Razakar''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|رضاکار}}}}, literally "volunteer"; {{lang-bn|রাজাকার}}) was an anti-Bangladesh paramilitary force organised by the [[Pakistan Army]] in then [[East Pakistan]], now called Bangladesh, during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since the 1971 war, it has become a pejorative term (implying traitor) in Bangladesh due to the numerous atrocities committed by the Razakars during the War. The Razakar force was composed of mostly anti-Bangladesh and pro-Pakistan [[Bengalis]] and [[Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh|Urdu-speaking migrants]] who lived in [[Bangladesh]] at the time.<ref name="Siddiqui">{{cite book |last=Siddiqui |first=A.

==Creation==
The East Pakistan Razakars Ordinance was promulgated on 2 August 1971 by the Governor of East Pakistan, Lieutenant General [[Tikka Khan]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The East Pakistan Razakars Ordinance, 1971, An Ordinance |url=http://www.icsforum.org/library/files/420_GovernmentofEastPakistan1971.pdf |magazine=The Dacca Gazette Extraordinary |url-status=dead |date=2 August 1971 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235644/http://www.icsforum.org/library/files/420_GovernmentofEastPakistan1971.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2013 |access-date=10 February 2013 |via=International Crimes Strategy Forum}}</ref> The Ordinance stipulated the creation of a voluntary force to be trained and equipped by the Provincial Government. This was to add to the government's forces to suppress the rebellion of people who wanted independence for the region. It is also alleged that Razakars were recruited by the [[Shanti Committee]], which was formed by several pro-Pakistani leaders including [[Nurul Amin]], [[Ghulam Azam]] and [[Khwaja Khairuddin]].<ref name="Wall Street Journal">''The Wall Street Journal'', 27 July 1971; quoted in the book ''Muldhara 71'' by Moidul Hasan</ref> The first recruits included 96 [[Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat]] party members, who started training in an Ansar camp at Shahjahan Ali Road, Khulna.<ref>{{cite news |title=Razakar was launched with 96 Jamaat men |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-255595 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=31 October 2012 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref>

==Organisation==
The Razakars had two branches they were [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]] and [[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)|Al-Shams]] paramilitary forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Students from Madrasahs were inducted into Al-Badr for specialised operations while Al-Shams was tasked with protection of important strategic locations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Kaushik |last2=Gates |first2=Scott |year=2014 |title=Unconventional Warfare in South Asia: Shadow Warriors and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdrcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA117 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |page=117 |isbn=978-1-4724-0579-1}}</ref> The Razakar were under Pakistani Army command and also trained by them (see external link section).<ref>[[Sheikh Hasina]], speech in Parliament on Golam Azam and the public tribunal, 16 April 1992, transcript in ''DOCUMENTS ON CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY COMMITTED BY PAKISTAN ARMY AND THEIR AGENTS IN BANGLADESH DURING 1971'' 137, (1999–2002)</ref> In September 1971, the Razakar force was placed under the command of Major General Mohammed Jamshed.<ref name="Siddiqui" /> Organisational command of the Razakar was given to Abdur Rahim.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lifschultz |first=Lawrence |date=1979 |title=Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution |publisher=Zed Press |page=123 |isbn=0-905762-07-X |quote=The following summer [1971], ... [Abdur] Rahim chose to return voluntarily to East Pakistan and take up active duty on the side of the Pakistan authorities ... Rahim took organizational command of the notorious Razakar paramilitary forces.}}</ref>

The Razakar force was organised into [[brigade]]s of around 3000–4000 volunteers, mainly armed with [[light Infantry]] weapons provided by the [[Pakistani Army]]. Each Razakar Brigade was attached as an auxiliary to two Pakistani Regular Army Brigades, and their main function was to arrest and detain nationalist Bengali suspects. Suspects were tortured during custody and killed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charges pressed against 5 Kishoreganj 'Razakars' |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/charges-pressed-against-five-kishoreganj-razakars-81593 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=30 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Razakars killed doc on Yusuf's order |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/razakars-killed-doc-on-yusufs-order/ |work=The Daily Star |access-date=30 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Khan |first1=Tamanna |title=V for a mother |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/v-mother-98452 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=30 June 2015}}</ref> The Razakars were trained by the Pakistan Army.<ref>{{cite book |author=Khuram Iqbal |title=The Making of Pakistani Human Bombs |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2015 |page=38}}</ref> While formed as a paramilitary group, the Razakars also served as local guides for the Pakistan army.

Quoting a declassified US document Azadur Rahman Chandan wrote, "the 'Rasikars' are a destabilizing element – living off the land, able to make life and death decisions by denouncing collaborators and openly pillaging and terrorizing villagers without apparent restraint from the Army".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Razakars were paid by the Pakistan Army and Provincial Government.<ref name=po-pay>{{cite news |title=Razakar's pay revised upwards |newspaper=The Pakistan Observer |date=20 November 1971}}</ref> Leading supporters of a united Pakistan urged General [[Yahya Khan]] to increase the number of Razakars and given them more arms to extend their activities in East Pakistan.<ref name=po-increase>{{cite news |title=Increase number of Razakars |newspaper=The Pakistan Observer |date=7 November 1971}}</ref>

Towards the end of 1971, increasing numbers of Razakars were deserting, as the end of the war approached and Bangladesh moved towards independence.<ref>US Department of State, "Sitrep," 5 October 1971, cited in R. Sisson and L. E. Rose. ''Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh,'' University of California Press, 1990, p 308.</ref>

==Dissolution==
Following the surrender of the West Pakistan army on 16 December 1971 and the proclamation of independence of [[Bangladesh]], the Razakar units were dissolved. The Jamaat party was banned, as it had opposed independence. Many leading Razakars{{who|date=January 2012}} fled to [[Pakistan]] (previously [[West Pakistan]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

Waves of violence followed the official end of the war, and some lower-ranking Razakars were killed in reprisals by [[Mukti Bahini]] militia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.khichuri.org/tui-razakar-picturing-revenge-and-reprisal-in-bangladesh/ |title='Tui Razakar!' – Picturing Revenge and Reprisal in Bangladesh |website=The Khichuri |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314115324/http://www.khichuri.org/tui-razakar-picturing-revenge-and-reprisal-in-bangladesh/ |archive-date=14 March 2013}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=May 2020}} The government rounded up and imprisoned an estimated 36,000 men suspected of being Razakars. The government ultimately freed many of those held in jail, both in response to pressure from the United States and China, who backed Pakistan in the war, and to gain co-operation from Pakistan in obtaining the release of 200,000 Bengali-speaking military and civilian personnel who had been stranded or imprisoned in West Pakistan during the war.<ref>Dr. Mohammad Hannan, ''History of Liberation War of Bangladesh'' (বাংলাদেশের মুক্তিযুদ্ধের ইতিহাস- ড: মোহাম্মদ হান্নান)</ref>

In [[Bangladesh]] today, razakar is used as a pejorative term meaning "traitor" or [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].<ref name=Mookherjee>{{cite book |last=Mookherjee |first=Nayanika |year=2009 |editor1=Sharika Thiranagama |editor2=Tobias Kelly |title=Traitors: Suspicion, Intimacy, and the Ethics of State-Building |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=49 |isbn=978-0-8122-4213-3}}</ref>

== Trials ==
In 2010 the Bangladesh government, led by the [[Awami League]], set up an [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] based on the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973 to prosecute the people who committed [[war crimes]] and crimes against humanities during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war]] in 1971.<ref name=crime_act1973>{{cite web |title=The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=435 |work=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd |access-date=2 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh to Hold Trials for 1971 War Crimes |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/asia/Bangladesh-to-Hold-Trials-for-1971-War-Crimes-89258207.html |work=Voice of America |date=26 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh sets up 1971 war crimes tribunal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8587511.stm |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2010}}</ref>
