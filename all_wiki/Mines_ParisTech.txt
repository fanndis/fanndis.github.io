'''Mines ParisTech''' (officially '''École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris''' in French or '''Paris School of Mines''' in English, also known as '''École des mines de Paris''', '''ENSMP''', '''Mines Paris''' or simply '''les Mines'''), created in 1783 by King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], is a [[France|French]] [[Engineering education|engineer school]] and a constituent college of [[PSL Research University|Université PSL]].

Mines ParisTech is distinguished for the outstanding performance of its research centers <ref>[http://www.usinenouvelle.com/comparatif-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs-2013-par-critere-recherche#filter_ecole Palmarès 2013 des écoles d'ingénieurs par Recherche]. Usinenouvelle.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-17.</ref> and the quality of its international partnerships with other prestigious universities in the world, which include [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], [[University of Hong Kong]], [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), [[Novosibirsk State University]], [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and [[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Tokyo Tech]].

The École des Mines de Paris also publishes a world university ranking based on the number of alumni holding the post of CEO in one of the 500 largest companies in the world: the ''[[Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities]].'' The school is a member of the [[ParisTech]] (Paris Institute of Technology) alliance.

==History==

[[File:Ecole des Mines 4.jpg|thumb|A classroom during the nineteenth century]]

Created by decree of the French King's Counsel on March 19, 1783, the first school of Mines was located in the [[Monnaie de Paris|Hôtel de la Monnaie]], in [[Paris]].

The school disappeared at the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] but was re-established by decree of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in 1794, the 13th [[Messidor]] Year II. It moved to [[Savoie]], after a decree of the [[French Consulate|consuls]] the 23rd [[Pluviôse]] Year X (1802).

After the [[Bourbon Restoration]] in 1814, the school moved to the ''[[Hôtel de Vendôme]]'' (in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] in Paris' [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]). From the 1960s onwards, it created research laboratories in [[Fontainebleau]], [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]] and [[Sophia Antipolis]] ([[Nice]]).

==Education==
[[File:Mines facade.jpg|thumb|The [[Hôtel de Vendôme]], central building of Mines ParisTech]]

The initial aim of the École des mines de Paris, namely to train high-level mining engineers, evolved with time to adapt to the technological and structural transformations undergone by society. Mines ParisTech has now become one of the most prestigious French engineering schools with a broad variety of subjects. Its students are trained to have management positions, work in research and development departments, or as operations officers, etc. They receive a well-rounded education in a variety of subjects, ranging from the most technical (Mathematics, Physics) to economics, social sciences or even art in order to be able to tackle the managing or engineering-related issues they are to face. Exchange programs are possible during the third semester with prestigious universities around the world, such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), [[University of Hong Kong]], [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), [[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Tokyo Tech]], [[Seoul National University]]...

===Degrees===

Mines ParisTech provides different educational paths:

*The '''Ingénieurs civils''' degree (Master of Science and Executive Engineering), ranked among the best French Grande école engineering degrees, similar to that offered at [[École polytechnique]], [[École des Ponts ParisTech]] or [[École Centrale Paris]].
*The [[Corps of Mines (France)|Corps of Mines]], one of the greatest technical corps of the French state. It is a third cycle degree, lasting for three years, consisting in two long-term internships both in public and private economical institutions and courses in economics and public institutions.<ref>[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/corpstechniques/CTE.html Présentation - MINES ParisTech]. Mines-paristech.fr. Retrieved on 2014-06-17.</ref> The admission to the Corps des Mines is highly selective as only the top students from [[École Polytechnique|École polytechnique]], [[École normale supérieure]], Mines ParisTech and Telecom ParisTech may apply
*''[[Mastère Spécialisé]]'' degrees, (higher and far more complicated in academic achievements and requirements than a standard master's degree called "maitrise" in French) post-graduate programs accredited by the ''Conférence des Grandes écoles'', in the fields of Energy, Environment, Transport and Logistics, Informatics, Safety and management in industry and Materials engineering
*Doctoral (19 schools) and Master (9 programs) studies in various fields

===Admission for French and International students===
For students having studied in the [[Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles]] (a two-year highly selective undergraduate program in [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and [[Engineering]], among others), admission to Civil Engineer of Mines is decided through a nationwide competitive examination. Every year, ten applications are also accepted from students around the world according to their academic achievements.

Admission to the Corps of Mines is possible for French students at the end of the studies in École polytechnique (usually 15 of the top 20 ranked European students each year), École normale supérieure, École des télécommunications de Paris and École des mines de Paris (these two later, after a specific examination), or from the other great technical corps of the French state.{{clarify|date=November 2011}} Admission in third year is also open to one [[Ph.D]] graduate.

==Student unions and organizations==
A Student Union is elected every year after a one-week campaign, and is in charge of enhancing the contact between students and various sponsoring industries as well as organizing events for the students.
 
Various other organizations are part of the students' lives: the Students' Sport Committee (BDS), the [[Junior Enterprise]] (JUMP), the Arts' Office (BDA), Cahier Vert (social opening and tutoring), CAV (wine-tasting club), Catholic community, Fanfare band, Entrepreneur club (Mines Genius), humanitarian organizations (Heliotopia, CEres, Zanbinou), photography club, Sailing club, among others.
