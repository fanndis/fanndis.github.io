The indigenous Chamorros settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], while in the service of Spain, was the first European to visit the island, on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized by Spain in 1668 with settlers, including [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]], a Catholic [[Jesuit missionary]]. Between the 16th century and the 18th century, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish [[Manila Galleons]].

Guam, along with the [[Mariana Islands]], were the first islands settled by humans in [[Remote Oceania]]. Incidentally it is also the first and the longest of the ocean-crossing voyages of the [[Austronesian peoples]], and is separate from the later [[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] settlement of the rest of Remote Oceania. They were first settled around 1500 to 1400 BC by migrants departing from the [[Philippines]]. This was followed by a second migration from the [[Caroline Islands]] by the first millennium AD, and a third migration from [[Island Southeast Asia]] (likely the Philippines or eastern [[Indonesia]]) by 900 AD.<ref name="Hung">{{cite journal |last1=Hung |first1=Hsiao-chun |last2=Carson |first2=Mike T. |last3=Bellwood |first3=Peter |last4=Campos |first4=Fredeliza Z. |last5=Piper |first5=Philip J. |last6=Dizon |first6=Eusebio |last7=Bolunia |first7=Mary Jane Louise A. |last8=Oxenham |first8=Marc |last9=Chi |first9=Zhang |title=The first settlement of Remote Oceania: the Philippines to the Marianas |journal=Antiquity |date=2015 |volume=85 |issue=329 |pages=909–926 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00068393}}</ref><ref name="Zotomayor">{{cite journal |last1=Zotomayor |first1=Alexie Villegas |title=Archaeologists say migration to Marianas longest ocean-crossing in human history |journal=Marianas Variety News and Views |date=12 March 2013 |page=2 |url=https://issuu.com/aleksea/docs/mv_3-12-13/2 |access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

There were also "{{transl|ch|makåhna}}" or "{{transl|ch|kakahna}}", shamans with magical powers and "'{{transl|ch|[[Suruhanu|suruhånu]]}}" or "{{transl|ch|suruhåna}}", healers who use different kinds of plants and natural materials to make medicine. Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called "{{transl|ch|[[Taotao mo'na]]}}" still persists as a remnant of pre-European culture. It is believed that "{{transl|ch|suruhånu}}" or "{{transl|ch|suruhåna}}" are the only ones who can safely harvest plants and other natural materials from their homes or "{{transl|ch|hålomtåno}}" without incurring the wrath of the "{{transl|ch|[[Taotao mo'na]]}}".

The Chamorro people raised colonnades of megalithic capped pillars called {{transl|ch|[[Latte stone|latte stones]]}} upon which they built their homes. Latte stones are stone pillars that are found only in the Mariana Islands; they are a recent development in Pre-Contact Chamorro society. The latte-stone was used as a foundation on which thatched huts were built.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|26}} Latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone called the {{transl|ch|haligi}} and with a capstone, or {{transl|ch|tåsa}}, made either from a large brain coral or limestone, placed on top.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|27–28}} A possible source for these stones, the [[Rota Latte Stone Quarry]], was discovered in 1925 on [[Rota (island)|Rota]].<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|28}}

===Magellan's travel to Guam===

[[File:Retrato de Hernando de Magallanes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand Magellan]], Portuguese navigator who was the first European to visit Guam (March 6, 1521) while commanding the fleet that circumnavigated the globe]]
The first European to travel to Guam was Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]], sailing for the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], when he sighted the island on March 6, 1521, during his fleet's circumnavigation of the globe.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|41–42}} When Magellan arrived on Guam, he was greeted by hundreds of small [[outrigger canoe]]s that appeared to be flying over the water, due to their considerable speed. These outrigger canoes were called [[Proas]], and resulted in Magellan naming Guam ''Islas de las Velas Latinas'' ("Islands of the [[Lateen sail]]s"). [[Antonio Pigafetta]] (one of Magellan's original 18) said that the name was "Island of Sails", but he also writes that the inhabitants "entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on", including "the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship."<ref name=Nowell>{{cite book|last=Nowell|first=Charles E.|date=1962|title=Magellan's voyage around the world; three contemporary accounts|url=https://archive.org/details/magellansvoyage00pigagoog|location=Evanston|publisher=Northwestern University Press|oclc=347382|access-date=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114001942/http://archive.org/details/magellansvoyage00pigagoog|archive-date=November 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|129}} "Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three islands ''Islas de los Ladrones'' ("Islands of thieves")."<ref name=Nowell />{{rp|131}}

===Spanish colonization and the Manila galleons===

Despite Magellan's visit, Guam was not officially claimed by Spain until January 26, 1565, by General [[Miguel López de Legazpi]].<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|46}} From 1565 to 1815, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, the only Spanish outposts in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines, were an important resting stop for the [[Manila galleons]], a fleet that covered the Pacific trade route between [[Acapulco]] and [[Manila]].<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|51}} To protect these Pacific fleets, Spain built several defensive structures that still stand today, such as [[Fort Nuestra Senora de la Soledad|Fort Nuestra Señora de la Soledad]] in [[Umatac]]. Guam is the biggest single segment of [[Micronesia]], the largest islands between the island of [[Kyushu]] (Japan), [[New Guinea]], the Philippines, and the Hawaiian Islands.

Spanish colonization commenced on June 15, 1668, with the arrival of [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] and [[Pedro Calungsod]], who established the first Catholic church.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|64}} The islands were part of the [[Spanish East Indies]], and in turn part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], based in [[Mexico City]]. Other reminders of colonial times include the old Governor's Palace in [[Plaza de España (Hagåtña)|Plaza de España]] and the Spanish Bridge, both in [[Hagatña]]. Guam's Cathedral [[Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral Basilica|Dulce Nombre de Maria]] was formally opened on February 2, 1669, as was the Royal College of San Juan de Letran.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|68}} Guam, along with the rest of the Mariana and [[Caroline Islands]], were treated as part of Spain's colony in the Philippines. While the island's Chamorro culture has indigenous roots, the cultures of both Guam and the Northern Marianas have many similarities with Spanish culture due to three centuries of Spanish rule.<ref name="Rogers" />

===Internal conflicts===
Intermittent warfare lasting from July 23, 1670, until July 1695, plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693, and in particular the [[smallpox]] epidemic of 1688, reduced the Chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000, finally to less than 5,000.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|86}} Precipitated by the death of [[Quipuha]], and the murder of [[Diego Luis de San Vitores|Father San Vitores]] and [[Pedro Calungsod]] by local rebel chief [[Matapang]], tensions led to a number of conflicts. Captain Juan de Santiago started a campaign to conquer the island, which was continued by the successive commanders of the Spanish forces.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|68–74}}

After his arrival in 1674, Captain Damian de Esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who attacked the population of certain towns. Hostilities eventually led to the destruction of villages such as Chochogo, Pepura, Tumon, Sidia-Aty, Sagua, Nagan and Ninca.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|74–75}} Starting in June 1676, the first Spanish Governor of Guam, Capt. Francisco de Irrisarri y Vinar, controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions. He also ordered the construction of schools, roads and other infrastructure.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|75–76}}

In 1680, Captain Jose de Quiroga arrived and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors. He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores, resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands, eventually leading to the death of Matapang, Hurao and Aguarin.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|77–78}} Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam, ordering the population to live in a few large villages.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|78–79}} These included Jinapsan, Umatac, Pago, Agat and Inarajan, where he built a number of churches.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|79}} By July 1695, Quiroga had completed the conquest of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Aguigan.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|85}}[[File:The Island of Guajan (Guam), detail from Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Islas Filipinas (1734).jpg|thumb|The island of Guajan (Guam), detail from ''[[Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Islas Filipinas]]'' (1734)]]

===Expulsion of the Jesuits===
On February 26, 1767, [[Charles III of Spain]] issued a decree confiscating the property of the [[Jesuits]] and banishing them from Spain and her possessions.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|101}} As a consequence, the Jesuit fathers on Guam departed on November 2, 1769, on the schooner ''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe'', abandoning their churches, rectories and ranches.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|102–103}}

The arrival of Governor Don Mariano Tobias, on September 15, 1771, brought agricultural reforms, including making land available to the islanders for cultivation, encouraged the development of cattle raising, imported deer and water buffalo from [[Manila]], donkeys and mules from [[Acapulco]], established cotton mills and [[salt evaporation pond|salt pans]], free public schools, and the first Guam militia.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|107–109}} Later, he was transferred to Manila in June 1774.<ref name="Carano" />{{rp|113}}

===Post-Napoleonic era===
Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], many Spanish colonies in the Western Hemisphere had become independent, shifting the economic dependence of Guam from [[Mexico]] to the Philippines.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|144}} Don Francisco Ramon de Villalobos, who became governor in 1831, improved economic conditions including the promotion of rice cultivation and the establishment of a [[Leprosy|leper]] hospital.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|148–149}}

[[Otto von Kotzebue]] visited the island in November 1817,<ref name=Carano />{{rp|127}} and [[Louis de Freycinet]] in March 1819.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|134}} [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] made two visits, the first in May 1828.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|139}} The island became a rest stop for [[whaling|whalers]] starting in 1823.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|145}}

A devastating typhoon struck the island on August 10, 1848, followed by a severe earthquake on January 25, 1849, which resulted in many refugees from the [[Caroline Islands]], victims of the resultant [[tsunami]].<ref name=Carano />{{rp|151}} After a smallpox epidemic killed 3,644 Guamanians in 1856, Carolinians and Japanese were permitted to settle in the Marianas.<ref name=Carano />{{rp|157}} Guam received nineteen Filipino prisoners after their failed [[1872 Cavite mutiny]].<ref name=Carano />{{rp|160}}

===Spanish–American War===
{{Main|Spanish–American War}}
After almost four centuries as part of the [[Kingdom of Spain]], the United States [[Capture of Guam|occupied]] the island following Spain's defeat in the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]], as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. Guam was transferred to the [[United States Navy]] control on December 23, 1898, by [[s:Executive Order 108-A|Executive Order 108-A]] from 25th President [[William McKinley]].

Guam came to serve as a station for American merchant and warships traveling to and from the [[Philippines]] (another American acquisition from Spain) while the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] were sold by Spain to Germany for part of its rapidly expanding [[German Empire]]. A U.S. Navy yard was established at [[Piti, Guam|Piti]] in 1899, and a [[United States Marine Corps]] barracks at Sumay in 1901.<ref name=Rottman>Rottman, G.

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], Guam was [[Battle of Guam (1941)|attacked and invaded]] by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] on Monday, December 8, 1941, shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. In addition, Japan made major military moves into Southeast Asia and the [[East Indies]] islands of the South Pacific Ocean against the British and Dutch colonies, opening a new wider Pacific phase in the Second World War. The Japanese renamed Guam {{lang|ja-Latn|Ōmiya-jima}} (Great Shrine Island).

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] had become a League of Nations mandate assigned to Japan in 1919, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919. [[Chamorros]] indigenous island people from the Northern Marianas were brought to Guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying Japanese force. The Guamanian Chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the Japanese military. After the war, this would cause resentment between the Guamanian Chamorros and the Chamorros of the Northern Marianas. Guam's Chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them, whereas having been administered by Japan for over 30 years, the Northern Mariana Chamorros were loyal to the Japanese government.

The [[Japanese occupation of Guam]] lasted for approximately 31 months. During this period, the indigenous people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, family separation, incarceration, execution, concentration camps and forced prostitution. Approximately 1,000 people died during the occupation, according to later [[United States Congress|Congressional]] committee testimony in 2004. Some historians estimate that war violence killed 10% of Guam's then 20,000 population.<ref>Werner Gruhl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA102#v=onepage Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101014017/https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA102|date=January 1, 2016}}'', Transaction Publishers, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0352-8}}</ref>

The [[United States]] returned and fought the [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] from July 21 to August 10, 1944, to recapture the island from Japanese military occupation. More than 18,000 Japanese were killed as only 485 surrendered. Sergeant [[Shoichi Yokoi]], who surrendered in January 1972, appears to have been the last confirmed [[Japanese holdout]], having held out for 28 years in the forested back country on Guam.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kristofferson|first=Nicholas D.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D81F3BF935A1575AC0A961958260|title=Shoichi Yokoi, 82, Is Dead; Japan Soldier Hid 27 Years|work=The New York Times|date=September 26, 1997|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201172619/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D81F3BF935A1575AC0A961958260|archive-date=February 1, 2009}}</ref> The United States also captured and occupied the nearby Northern Marianas Islands.

North Field was established in 1944, and was renamed for Brigadier General [[James Roy Andersen]] of the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] as [[Andersen Air Force Base]].

===American colonization===
After World War II, the [[Guam Organic Act of 1950]] established Guam as an [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated organized territory of the United States]], provided for the structure of the island's civilian government, and granted the people U.S. citizenship. The Governor of Guam was federally appointed until 1968, when the [[Guam Elective Governor Act]] provided for the office's popular election.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert F.|last=Rogers|title=Destiny's Landfall: A History of Guam|year=1995|place=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaii Press}}</ref>{{rp|242}} Since Guam is not a U.S. state, U.S. citizens residing on Guam are not allowed to vote for president and their congressional representative is a non-voting member.<ref name="Rogers" /> They do, however, get to vote for party delegates in presidential primaries.<ref name="Curry">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24839059/ns/politics-decision_08/t/nominating-not-voting-president/|publisher=[[NBC News]]|title=Nominating, but not voting for president: Clinton-Obama struggle spotlights Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico|first1=Tom|last1=Curry|date=May 28, 2008|access-date=August 19, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815080233/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24839059/ns/politics-decision_08/t/nominating-not-voting-president|archive-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref>

The Mariana chain of which Guam is a part was created by collision of the Pacific and Philippine Sea [[tectonic plate]]s. Guam is the closest land mass to the [[Mariana Trench]], the deep [[subduction|subduction zone]] that runs east of the Marianas. Due to its location on the [[Mariana Plate]] just westward of where the [[Pacific Plate]] [[subduction zone|subducts]] the Mariana and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]s, Guam occasionally experiences earthquakes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Charles S.|display-authors=etal|title=Seismic Hazard Assessment for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1015/report/OF12-1015.pdf|publisher=U.

[[File:US Navy 030225-N-0000X-002 An aerial view of Apra Harbor on U.S. Naval Base Guam is seen during a fly-by, Feb. 25, 2003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Apra Harbor]]]]

Guam has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af''), though its driest month of March almost averages dry enough to qualify as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Köppen ''Am''). The weather is generally hot and humid throughout the year with little seasonal temperature variation. Hence, Guam is known to have equable temperatures year-round. Guam has two distinct seasons: Wet and dry season. The dry season runs from January through May. During this period, rainfalls are less heavy owing to the moderate to fresh [[trade winds]] from the northeast. The wet season runs from July through November with an average annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 of around {{convert|98|in|mm|-1|disp=or|sp=us}}. The wettest month on record at Guam Airport has been August 1997 with {{convert|38.49|in|mm|1}} and the driest was February 2015 with {{convert|0.15|in|mm|1}}. The wettest calendar year has been 1976 with {{convert|131.70|in|mm|1}} and the driest 1998 with {{convert|57.88|in|mm|1}}. The most rainfall in a single day occurred on October 15, 1953, when {{convert|15.48|in|mm|1|disp=or|sp=us}} fell.

The mean high temperature is {{convert|86|°F|°C|disp=or}} and mean low is {{convert|76|°F|°C|1}}. Temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}} or fall below {{convert|70|°F|°C|1}}. The [[relative humidity]] commonly exceeds 84 percent at night throughout the year, but the average monthly humidity hovers near 66 percent. The highest temperature ever recorded in Guam was {{convert|96|F|C|1}} on April 18, 1971, and April 1, 1990, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|65|F|C|1}} on February 8, 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/getclimate.php?date=&wfo=guam&sid=GUM&pil=CLM&recent=yes&specdate=2013-03-04+15%3A20%3A44|title=Climatological Report|publisher=National Weather Service|access-date=February 26, 2014|date=February 26, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307004247/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/getclimate.php?date=&wfo=guam&sid=GUM&pil=CLM&recent=yes&specdate=2013-03-04+15%3A20%3A44|archive-date=March 7, 2014}}</ref>

The highest risk of typhoons is from August through November, where typhoons and tropical storms are most probable in the western Pacific. They can, however, occur year-round. The most powerful typhoon to pass over Guam recently was [[Typhoon Pongsona|Super Typhoon Pongsona]], with sustained winds of {{convert|144|mph|km/h}}, gusts to {{convert|173|mph|km/h}}, which struck Guam on December 8, 2002, leaving massive destruction.

Post-European-contact [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] Guamanian culture is a combination of American, Spanish, Filipino, other Micronesian Islander and Mexican traditions. Few indigenous pre-Hispanic customs remained following Spanish contact. Hispanic influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as {{transl|ch|batu}}, {{transl|ch|chonka}}, {{transl|ch|estuleks}}, and {{transl|ch|bayogu}}), songs, and fashion.

During Spanish rule (1668–1898) the majority of the population was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole, and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from [[Mesoamerica]], principally Mexico, from Spanish trade with Asia.

The modern [[Chamorro language]] has many historical parallels to modern [[Philippine languages]] in that it is an [[Austronesian language]] which has absorbed much Spanish vocabulary. The language lies within the [[Malayo-Polynesian language]]s subgroup, along with such languages as Tagalog, Indonesian, Hawaiian, and Maori. Unlike most other languages of the [[Pacific Islands]], Chamorro does belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] subgroup of the Austronesian languages.

[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Chamorro people]]]]

As with [[Filipinos]], many Chamorros have [[Spanish name|Spanish surnames]], although also like most Filipinos few of the inhabitants are themselves descended from the Spaniards. Instead, Spanish names and surnames became commonplace after their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the historical event of the imposition of the [[Catálogo alfabético de apellidos]] in Guam and other territories of the [[Spanish East Indies]], most notably the Philippines.

Due to foreign cultural influence from Spain, most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost, though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-Hispanic culture in the last few decades. Some scholars have traveled throughout the Pacific Islands conducting research to study what the original Chamorro cultural practices such as dance, language, and canoe building may have been like.

Two aspects of indigenous pre-Hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule' and inafa'maolek. Chenchule' is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of Chamorro society. It is rooted in the core value of inafa'maolek. Historian Lawrence Cunningham in 1992 wrote, "In a Chamorro sense, the land and its produce belong to everyone. {{lang|ch|[[Inafa'maolek]]}}, or interdependence, is the key, or central value, in Chamorro culture&nbsp;... {{lang|ch|Inafa'maolek}} depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing. This is the armature, or core, that everything in Chamorro culture revolves around. It is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than [[individualism]] and private property rights."

The core culture or Pengngan Chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect: from sniffing over the hands of the elders (called mangnginge in Chamorro), the passing down of legends, chants, and courtship rituals, to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds. Other practices predating Spanish conquest include [[Outrigger canoe|galaide']] canoe-making, making of the [[belembaotuyan]] (a string musical instrument made from a gourd), fashioning of {{lang|ch|åcho' atupat}} slings and slingstones, tool manufacture, {{lang|ch|[[Måtan Guma']]}} burial rituals, and preparation of herbal medicines by [[Suruhanu]].

Master craftsmen and women specialize in weavings, including plaited work ([[coconut|niyok]]- and [[pandanus|åkgak]]-leaf baskets, mats, bags, hats, and food containments), loom-woven material ([[plumeria|kalachucha-hibiscus]] and banana fiber skirts, belts and burial shrouds), and body ornamentation (bead and shell necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts, and combs made from tortoise shells and [[Spondylus]]).

While only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms, the resurgence of interest among the Chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young Chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the Chamorro people.

The [[Guam national football team]] was founded in 1975 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1996. [[Guam national football team|Guam]] was once considered one of FIFA's weakest teams, and experienced their first victory over a FIFA-registered side in 2009, when they defeated [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]] in the [[East Asian Cup]].

The national team plays at the [[Guam National Football Stadium]] and are known as the "matao" team. Matao is the definition of highest level or "noble" class. The team did exceptionally well under former head coach Gary White. {{as of|2017}}, the Matao is led by [[Karl Dodd]], the current head coach. The top football division in Guam is the [[Guam Men's Soccer League]]. [[Rovers FC (Guam)|Rovers FC]] and [[Guam Shipyard]] are the league's most competitive and successful clubs, both have won nine championships in the past years.

Guam's economy depends primarily on tourism, Department of Defense installations and locally owned businesses.

===Tourism===
Lying in the western Pacific, Guam is a popular destination for Japanese tourists. Its tourist hub, [[Tumon]], features over 20 large hotels, a Duty Free Shoppers Galleria, Pleasure Island district, indoor aquarium, Sandcastle [[Las Vegas]]–styled shows and other shopping and entertainment venues. It is a relatively short flight from Asia or Australia compared to Hawaii, with hotels and seven public golf courses accommodating over a million tourists per year. Although 75% of the tourists are Japanese, Guam also receives a sizable number of tourists from South Korea and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitguam.org/members/?pg=research|title=Guam Visitors Bureau Tourist Statistics|access-date=August 27, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827061618/http://www.visitguam.org/members/?pg=research|archive-date=August 27, 2007}}. visitguam.org</ref> Significant sources of revenue include [[duty-free]] designer shopping outlets, and the American-style malls: [[Micronesia Mall]], [[Guam Premier Outlets]], the [[Agana Shopping Center]], and the world's largest [[Kmart]].<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Mary|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=KMART IS AN EASY SELL ON GUAM|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/01/02/kmart-is-an-easy-sell-on-guam/74091263-e16f-488b-bca2-8ead3dbe5205/|website=Washington Post|date=January 2, 1999|access-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114073224/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/01/02/kmart-is-an-easy-sell-on-guam/74091263-e16f-488b-bca2-8ead3dbe5205/|archive-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>

The economy had been stable since 2000 due to increased tourism. It is expected to stabilize with the transfer of U.S. Marine Corps' [[3rd Marine Expeditionary Force]], currently in [[Okinawa]], Japan, (approximately 8,000 Marines, along with their 10,000 dependents), to Guam between 2010 and 2015.

The [[Compact of Free Association|Compacts of Free Association]] between the United States, the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the Republic of the [[Marshall Islands]], and the Republic of [[Palau]] accorded the former entities of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] a political status of "free association" with the United States. The Compacts give citizens of these island nations generally no restrictions to reside in the United States (also its territories), and many were attracted to Guam due to its proximity, environmental, and cultural familiarity. Over the years, it was claimed by some in Guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved, and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration. Over the years, Congress had appropriated "Compact Impact" aids to Guam, the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and Hawaii, and eventually this appropriation was written into each renewed Compact. Some, however, continue to claim the compensation is not enough or that the distribution of actual compensation received is significantly disproportionate.<ref name=PCW></ref>

Guam is governed by a popularly elected [[Governor of Guam|governor]] and a [[unicameral]] 15-member [[Legislature of Guam|legislature]], whose members are known as senators. Its judiciary is overseen by the [[Supreme Court of Guam]].

The [[District Court of Guam]] is the court of United States federal jurisdiction in the territory. Guam elects one [[delegate (United States Congress)|delegate to the United States House of Representatives]], currently Democrat [[Michael San Nicolas]]. The delegate does not have a vote on the final passage of legislation, but is accorded a vote in committee, and the privilege to speak to the House. U.S. citizens in Guam vote in a [[United States presidential straw polls in Guam|presidential straw poll]] for their choice in the U.S. presidential general election, but since Guam has no votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], the poll has no real effect. However, in sending delegates to the Republican and Democratic national conventions, Guam does have influence in the national presidential race. These delegates are elected by local party [[United States presidential primary#Types of primaries and caucuses|conventions]].<ref name="Rogers" />

===Political status===
In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant movement in favor of this U.S. territory becoming a [[commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]], which would give it a level of self-government similar to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].<ref name="Americans, Almost and Forgotten"/> In a 1982 plebiscite, voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/pdf/crp_2012_guam.pdf|title=Statement of the Non-Self Governing Territory of Guam to the Pacific Regional Seminar on the implementation of the third decade for the eradication of colonialism: current realities and prospects in Quito, Ecuador|last=Natividad|first=Lisalinda|date=May 30, 2012|work=United Nations|access-date=February 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412031009/https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/pdf/crp_2012_guam.pdf|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the [[Territorial Clause]] (Art.

A Commission on Decolonization was established in 1997 to educate the people of Guam about the various political status options in its relationship with the U.S.: statehood, free association and independence. The island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998, however, the group was dormant for some years. In 2013, the commission began seeking funding to start a public education campaign. There were few subsequent developments until late 2016. In early December 2016, the Commission scheduled a series of education sessions in various villages about the current status of Guam's relationship with the U.S. and the self-determination options that might be considered.<ref name="Raymundo">{{cite news |url=http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2016/12/07/commission-launch-series-decolonization-meetings/95076830/ |title=Commission to launch series of decolonization meetings |last=Raymundo |first=Shawn |date=December 8, 2016 |newspaper=Pacific Daily News |access-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref> The commission's current Executive Director is Edward Alvarez and there are ten members.

The [[U.S. military]] maintains jurisdiction over its bases, which cover approximately {{convert|39000|acre|ha}}, or 29% of the island's total land area:
* U.S. [[Naval Base Guam]], [[U.S. Navy]] – Sumay
* U.S. Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Sector|Sector]] Guam, – Sumay
* [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[U.S. Air Force]] – [[Yigo]]
* [[Apra Harbor]] – Orote peninsula
* [[Ordnance Annex]], U.S. Navy – South Central Highlands (formerly known as Naval Magazine)
* Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station, U.S. Navy – [[Barrigada]] and Finegayan
* Joint Force Headquarters-Guam, [[Guam National Guard]] – Radio Barrigada and Fort Juan Muna

The U.S. military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on Guam and moving 8,600 Marines, and 9,000 of their dependents, to Guam from [[Okinawa]], Japan. Including the required construction workers, this buildup would increase Guam's population by a total of 79,000, a 49% increase over its 2010 population of 160,000. In a February 2010 letter, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall, sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAvoy|first=Audrey|title=EPA sharply criticizes military's Guam plan|work=Boston Globe|access-date=December 28, 2010|date=February 25, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/02/25/epa_sharply_criticizes_militarys_guam_plan/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512013841/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/02/25/epa_sharply_criticizes_militarys_guam_plan/|archive-date=May 12, 2011}}</ref> By 2012, these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 Marines stationed on the island, two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents.<ref>Parrish, Karen (July 20, 2012).

With the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation and relocation efforts of U.S. Marines from Okinawa, Japan to Guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter, the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40% of the entire landmass of Guam.

In January 2011, the [[Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011|Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011]] indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning U.S. Marine Corps service members and their families from Okinawa to Guam. The transfer may be as late as 2020. In addition, the Defense Authorization Act cut approximately $320&nbsp;million from the 2011 budget request.

Villagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways. Many villagers serve in the military or are retired. Many active duty personnel and Defense Department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas. The military and village communities have "adoption" programs where Guam's population and military personnel stationed on Guam perform community service projects.

==Transportation and communications==

[[File:Guam route marker 8.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Guam Highway 8 route marker]]

Most of the island has state-of-the-art mobile phone services and high-speed internet widely available through either cable or [[DSL]]. Guam was added to the [[North American Numbering Plan|North American Numbering Plan (NANP)]] in 1997 (country code 671 became NANP [[area code 671]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf_previous/08_02_99/pl_nanp_004.pdf|title=PL-NANP-004|author=J.

Guam is also a major hub for submarine cables between the Western U.S., Hawaii, Australia and Asia. Guam currently serves twelve submarine cables, with most continuing to China.

In 1899, the local postage stamps were overprinted "Guam" as was done for the other former Spanish colonies, but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular U.S. postage stamps have been used ever since. Because Guam is also part of the U.S. Postal System ([[List of U.S. state abbreviations|postal abbreviation]]: GU, [[ZIP code|ZIP code range]]: 96910–96932), mail to Guam from the U.S. mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required. Private shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL, however, have no obligation to do so, and do not regard Guam as domestic.

The speed of mail traveling between Guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year. Light, first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland, but larger first-class or Priority items can take a week or two. Fourth-class mail, such as magazines, are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii. Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes, although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available. Incoming mail not from the Americas should be addressed to "Guam" instead of "USA" to avoid being routed the long way through the U.S. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from Asia).

[[File:US to Guam First Flight Cover 1935.jpg|thumb|right|Cover carried both directions on the first commercial flights between Guam and the United States, October 5–24, 1935]]

The Commercial Port of Guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into Guam for consumers. It receives the weekly calls of the Hawaii-based shipping line [[Matson, Inc.]] whose container ships connect Guam with Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California and Seattle, Washington. The port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the Micronesian region. The port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island's U.S. Department of Defense installations, Andersen Air Force Base and Commander, Naval Forces Marianas and eventually the Third Marine Expeditionary Force.

Guam is served by the [[Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport]].

Since Guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction, passengers arriving directly from the United States skip immigration and proceed directly to Guam Customs and Quarantine.

However, due to the [[Visa waiver program#Guam and Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program|Guam and CNMI visa waiver program]] for certain countries, an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.

Most residents travel within Guam using personally owned vehicles. The local government currently outsources the only public bus system ([[Guam Regional Transit Authority]]), and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations.

==Ecology==
{{main|Marianas tropical dry forests}}

===Brown tree snake===

Believed to be a [[stowaway]] on a U.S. military transport after the end of World War II, the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the {{transl|ch|kulebla}}, is native to northern and eastern coasts of [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is slightly [[venomous]], but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see them. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow. The [[United States Geological Survey]] also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Resources/Education/BTS/|title=USGS: The Brown Tree Snake on Guam|access-date=July 28, 2007|author=Fritts, T.H.|author2=D.

===Threat to native birds===

Before the introduction of the brown tree snake, Guam was home to 14 species of terrestrial birds. Two of these fourteen birds are endemic to Guam at the species level: The [[Guam flycatcher]], also called the Guam broadbill, and the [[Guam rail]] are not naturally found anywhere else in the world. The Guam flycatcher, was last seen in 1985 and is now believed to be extinct. The Guam rail (or ''ko'ko''' bird in Chamorro), a flightless bird, extinct in the wild, has been successfully bred in captivity. An experimental population of Guam rails has been released on [[Rota (island)|Rota]], an island forty miles north of Guam in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. The loss of these birds is believed to be largely a result of habitat alteration and the effects of the introduced brown tree snake. The devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades. As many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction.<ref name="MarzluffAngell2007">{{cite book|author1=John M. Marzluff|author2=Tony Angell|title=In the Company of Crows and Ravens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrG8pIQ5WJkC|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12255-8|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230042923/https://books.google.com/books?id=FrG8pIQ5WJkC|archive-date=December 30, 2015}}</ref> However, some of the birds still thrive and are common on other islands at the subspecies level in the Marianas, including [[Saipan]]. According to many elders, ko'ko' birds were common in Guam before World War II.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1564858|title=The Impact of the Introduction of the Colubrid Snake Boiga irregularis on Guam's Lizards|first=Gordon H.|last=Rodda|author2=Fritts, Thomas H.|journal=Journal of Herpetology|volume=26|issue=2|year=1992|pages=166–174|jstor=1564858}}</ref>

Other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the [[Mariana crow]], the [[Mariana swiftlet]], and the [[Micronesian starling]], though populations are present on other islands in the Marianas.<ref name="MarzluffAngell2007" />

Guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands, because bird populations are severely diminished, and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of [[birdsong]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=H.|last2=Hille Ris Lambers|first2=J.|last3=Miller|first3=R.|last4=Tewksbury|first4=J.

===Coconut rhinoceros beetle===
[[File:Oryctes nasicornis Thailand.jpg|thumb|[[Oryctes rhinoceros|Coconut rhinoceros beetle]]]]
An infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), ''[[Oryctes rhinoceros]]'', was detected on Guam on September 12, 2007. CRB is not known to occur in the United States except in [[American Samoa]]. Delimiting surveys performed September 13–25, 2007, indicated that the infestation was limited to Tumon Bay and Faifai Beach, an area of approximately {{convert|900|acre|km2}}. Guam Department of Agriculture (GDA) placed quarantine on all properties within the Tumon area on October 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} on October 25; approximately {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} radius in all directions from all known locations of CRB infestation. CRB is native to Southern Asia and distributed throughout Asia and the Western Pacific including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Upolu]], [[Samoa]], American Samoa, [[Palau]], [[New Britain]], [[West Papua (region)|West Irian]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Manus Island|Pak Island and Manus Island]] (New Guinea), [[Fiji]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Réunion|Reunion]].

===Other invasive animal species===
[[File:2011 Feb, Puerto Princesa to Nasiduan, 10.jpg|thumb|Adult female [[carabao]] and calf]]
From the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, the Spanish introduced the [[Philippine deer]] (''Rusa mariannus''), [[black francolin]]s, and [[carabao]] (a subspecies of [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]), which have cultural significance. Herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems. After birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective, the U.S. military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalrights.net/archives/year/2003/000392.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428185829/http://www.animalrights.net/archives/year/2003/000392.html|archive-date=April 28, 2005|publisher=AnimalRights.net|title=More Than 100 Protest Guam Carabao Cull|date=October 15, 2003|access-date=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Other introduced species include the [[Achatina achatina|giant African snail]] (an agricultural pest introduced during World War&nbsp;II by Japanese occupation troops).

Guam has no native amphibian species, but now a total of nine amphibian species has been established in Guam. ''[[Litoria fallax]]'' (native to the eastern coast of Australia) has been present in Guam since 1968, and ''[[Rhinella marina]]'' (the cane toad) was brought to the island in 1937. The other 7 amphibian species, namely ''[[Hylarana guentheri]]'' (native to mainland Asia), ''[[Microhyla pulchra]]'' (native to mainland Asia), ''[[Polypedates braueri]]'' (endemic to Taiwan), ''[[Eleutherodactylus planirostris]]'' (native to the Caribbean), ''[[Fejervarya cancrivora]]'' (the Guam variety being most closely related to ''F. cancrivora'' found in Taiwan), ''[[Fejervarya limnocharis]]'' (native to Southeast Asia), have been in Guam since 2003     <ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.2984/70.2.9|title=Origin and Identity of Fejervarya (Anura: Dicroglossidae) on Guam|journal=Pacific Science|volume=70|issue=2|pages=233–241|year=2016|last1=Wostl|first1=Elijah|last2=Smith|first2=Eric N.|last3=Reed|first3=Robert N.|s2cid=54686596}}</ref> and the ''[[Eleutherodactylus coqui]]'' also commonly known as the coquí frog native to [[Puerto Rico]] that may have arrived from Hawaii, have led to fears that the noise could threaten Guam's tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webspinners.com/coloherp/cb-news/Vol-31/cbn-0404/Coqui.php|title=Two Male Coqui Frogs Found in Guam|date=February 28, 2004|access-date=July 19, 2007|author=Worth, Katie|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929204945/http://webspinners.com/coloherp/cb-news/Vol-31/cbn-0404/Coqui.php|archive-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo, especially from Taiwan, mainland China, and Southeast Asia.

Introduced feral pigs and deer, over-hunting, and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of Guam's native plants and animals.

===Threats to indigenous plants===
Invading animal species are not the only threat to Guam's native flora. Tinangaja, a [[Plant virus|virus]] affecting coconut palms, was first observed on the island in 1917 when [[copra]] production was still a major part of Guam's economy. Though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island, the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of Guam.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hodgson|first1=R. A. J.|last2=Wall|first2=G. C.|last3=Randles|first3=J. W.|title=Specific Identification of Coconut Tinangaja Viroid for Differential Field Diagnosis of Viroids in Coconut Palm|journal=Phytopathology|volume=88|issue=8|pages=774–781|year=1998|access-date=June 16, 2007|url=http://www.apsnet.org/phyto/PDFS/1998/0527-01R.pdf|doi=10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.8.774|pmid=18944882|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614151423/http://www.apsnet.org/phyto/PDFS/1998/0527-01R.pdf|archive-date=June 14, 2007}}</ref>

During the past century, the dense forests of northern Guam have been largely replaced by thick ''tangan-tangan'' brush (''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]''). Much of Guam's foliage was lost during [[World War II]]. In 1947, the U.S. military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent [[erosion]]. Tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.<ref>Stafford, William Edwin (1905) ''Useful Plants of Guam''</ref>

In southern Guam, non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape. Although the colorful and impressive flame tree (''[[Delonix regia]]'') is found throughout the Marianas, the tree on Guam has been largely decimated.

The Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) infestation has become an epidemic event of palm tree damage on Guam. The CRB infects palm trees by burrowing into the tips of the palms, effectively killing the plant by destroying the [[shoot apical meristem]] during the process. While the grubs and larvae of CRB do no actual harm to palms, they populate and grow within the damaged crowns of the palm trees, which is a specific mating habit of Guam CRBs.

A possible solution to the crisis, which has been ecologically analyzed in Western Samoa, would be the introduction of CRB predators. Centipedes, ''[[Scolopendra morsitans|Scolopendra Morsitans]],'' have been found to seek out and eat the larvae of the beetle in logs and other breeding grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinckley|first=Alden|date=1967|title=Associates of The Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle In Western Samoa|url=http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|journal=Pacific Insects|volume=9|pages=505–511|access-date=June 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830102806/http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/9(3)-505.pdf|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Manual insertion of the centipedes, or introduction of volatile attractors within the plant, may cause a significant dent in Guam's CRB mortality. The introduction of [[terpene]], [[fatty acid]]s, or other nitrogenous compound metabolites may allow palm trees to attract CRB-predators such as the centipede through an indirect defense response,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/plant-resistance-against-herbivory-96675700|title=Plant Resistance against Herbivory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914210302/http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/plant-resistance-against-herbivory-96675700|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which is triggered by [[mechanoreceptor]]s activating [[secondary metabolite]] transcribers via an [[action potential]] pathway.

A secondary solution could be introducing [[Metal hyperaccumulation in plants|metal hyperaccumulation]] into the palm population on Guam's beaches. Plants that accumulate extra inorganic minerals, such as iron, nickel, or zinc, indirectly deter herbivory by depositing excess materials in certain sections of the plants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poschenrieder|date=2006|title=Can metals defend plants against biotic stress?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=11|issue=6|pages=288–295|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2006.04.007|pmid=16697693}}</ref> While the excess inorganic materials may not directly affect adult CRBs (as minerals would not be deposited in the meristem sections of the plant), it may create an inhospitable and toxic environment for the immature CRBs that are growing in the trees.

===Wildfires===

[[Wildfire]]s plague the forested areas of Guam every [[dry season]] despite the island's humid climate. Most fires are caused by humans with 80% resulting from [[arson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guamforestry.org/docs/final_guam_2004.pdf|title=Territory of Guam Fire Assessment January 2004|access-date=March 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324224423/http://www.guamforestry.org/docs/final_guam_2004.pdf|archive-date=March 24, 2009}}, pp. 6–7, guamforestry.org</ref> Poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth. Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas. Grasslands and "barrens" have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion. During the rainy season, sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the [[Fena Lake]] Reservoir and [[Ugum River]], leading to water quality problems for southern Guam. Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (planting trees) have had little success in preserving natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213232039/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/Park/Natural/fire/fireguam.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2007|work=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|author=National Park Service|title=Fire and Guam|access-date=June 16, 2007|author-link=National Park Service}}</ref>

===Aquatic preserves===

[[File:Whitespotted boxfish Ostracion meleagris photo Randall J E.jpg|thumb|[[Whitespotted boxfish]] (''[[Ostracion meleagris]]'')]]
Efforts have been made to protect Guam's coral reef habitats from pollution, eroded silt and overfishing, problems that have led to decreased fish populations. This has both ecological and economic value, as Guam is a significant vacation spot for [[scuba diver]]s. In recent years, the Department of Agriculture, Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guampdn.com/guampublishing/special-sections/mlsea/8-future.htm |work=Pacific Daily News |title=Guam's Marine Preserves |last=Brown |first=Valerie |access-date=June 16, 2007}}</ref> These are located at [[Pati Point]], [[Piti Bomb Holes]], [[Sasa Bay]], [[Achang Reef Flat]], and [[Tumon Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Life |url=https://www.visitguam.com/chamorro-culture/nature/sea-life/ |website=Guam Visitors Bureau |access-date=20 May 2020 |archive-date=May 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531225300/https://www.visitguam.com/chamorro-culture/nature/sea-life/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Before adopting [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] standards, portions of Tumon Bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guamepa.govguam.net/programs/epr/sediment_report.pdf|work=EPA Guam Report|title=Management of Contaminated Harbor Sediments in Guam|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808031615/http://www.guamepa.govguam.net/programs/epr/sediment_report.pdf|archive-date=August 8, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrguam.com/press_releases/Tumon_Bay.htm|work=Directions Magazine; June/July 1996|title=Tumon Bay – Engineering a Better Environment|author=Packbier, Paul E.R.|access-date=October 19, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726141402/http://www.pcrguam.com/press_releases/Tumon_Bay.htm|archive-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> Tumon Bay has since been made into a preserve.

Harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on Guam before World War II. The [[green sea turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'') was harvested legally on Guam before August 1978, when it was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The [[hawksbill sea turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata'') has been on the endangered list since 1970. In an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on Guam, routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings.
