==History==
Rose was originally a Norman form of a German name Hrodheid, composed of the words Hrod ("fame") and Heid ("kind", "type"). It was originally spelled (by the Normans) Roese or Rohese.<ref>http://behindthename.com/name/rose</ref> It was used in England, Italy, and France throughout the Middle Ages,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uckelman |first1=S. L. |title=Dictionary of Medieval Names from European Sources |date=2018 |edition=2018, no. 2 }}</ref> and its popularity increased during the 19th century while still regarded as being a [[Rose|flower name]]. The name of the flower has the etymology of Old English rōse from the Latin rosa; phonetically linked to the Greek rhódon, which is independent of the etymology of the [[Rose (surname)|surname Rose]]. Distinctions can sometimes be made between individuals who derive this given name after the surname and those who are named after the flower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/rose|title=the definition of rose|website=www.dictionary.com}}</ref>

'''[[Rhoda (biblical figure)|Rhoda]]''', as in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 12:12-15, is the Greek equivalent.  '''Rosalia''' was the name of a [[Saint Rosalia|12th-century Sicilian saint]].  St. [[Rose of Lima]] was the first person born in the Americas to be canonized.
