He beat incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Gil Gutknecht]] in the general [[United States general elections, 2006|election]] on November 7, and took office on January 3, 2007. After the election, Gutknecht was described as having been caught "off guard" and Walz as having "resolved never to get caught like that himself.... He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans."<ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Walz confident about survival |author=James Hohmann |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43583.html|newspaper=Politico|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

==== 2008 financial crisis ====
During 2008, Walz repeatedly spoke out against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=22428&can_id=65443 |title=Project Vote Smart&nbsp;— Representative Walz on HR 3997 – Financial Asset Purchase Authority |publisher=Votesmart.org |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> Walz released a statement after the bill's passage, saying, "The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes to recouping the losses taxpayers might suffer.

====Economic issues====
Despite his votes against bailout bills that loaned taxpayer money to large banks and auto manufacturers, Walz did vote with his Democratic colleagues to support the [[2009 American Recovery & Reinvestment Act]]. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Walz saw the stimulus bill as an opportunity to work "with his congressional colleagues to make job creation through investment in public infrastructure like roads, bridges and clean energy the cornerstone of the economic recovery plan".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=438895&keyword=economy+and+jobs&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart&nbsp;— Representative Timothy J.
