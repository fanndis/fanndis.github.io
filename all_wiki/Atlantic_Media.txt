'''Atlantic Media''' is an American print and online media company owned by [[David G. Bradley]] and based in [[the Watergate]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] It publishes ''[[The Atlantic]],'' a print and online publication that also holds themed events; and offers business intelligence and consulting services through its [[National Journal|National Journal Group]] subsidiary.

Founded in 1997 when Bradley purchased the National Journal Group, the company expanded for three decades by launching several new publications and acquiring others. It began to slim down in 2017 when Bradley sold a majority stake in ''The Atlantic to'' [[Emerson Collective]], and continued by selling ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' in 2018, ''CityLab'' in 2019, and the [[Government Executive|Government Executive Media Group]] in 2020.

==History==
Bradley began his foray into publishing in 1997 by purchasing the National Journal Group, which published ''[[National Journal]]'', ''[[The Hotline]]'', ''National Journal Daily'' (previously known as ''Congress Daily''), and ''[[Technology Daily]]''.<ref name="AMC">{{cite web|date=|title=Atlantic Media|url=http://www.atlanticmedia.com/|accessdate=2012-12-23|publisher=Atlantic Media}}</ref>  The group also published books and directories, the most known of which is the biennial ''[[The Almanac of American Politics|Almanac of American Politics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://nationaljournal.com/about-us|accessdate=23 December 2012|publisher=National Journal}}</ref>

Four years later, he acquired ''[[The Atlantic]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jaffe |first=Harry |url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/6914.html |title=Citizen Bradley &#124; People & Politics |publisher=Washingtonian |date=October 1, 2000 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref> After first vowing to leave the magazine in Boston, he moved the headquarters to Washington, D.C., in 2005.

He also acquired ''[[Government Executive]]'', which later created ''Nextgov'', aimed at government leaders in IT; ''Defense One'', aimed at national security leaders; and Route Fifty, aimed at leaders in state and local governments.<ref name="AMC" /> 

In 2012, the company launched ''Quartz'', one of the first websites designed from the start to serve mobile readers.

On July 28, 2017, ''The Atlantic'' announced that Bradley had sold majority ownership of the publication to multi-billionaire investor and philanthropist [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] (the widow of former [[Apple Inc.]] chairman and CEO [[Steve Jobs]]) through her [[Emerson collective|Emerson Collective]] organization.<ref>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Gillian B.|title=Emerson Collective Acquires Majority Stake in The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/emerson-collective-atlantic-coalition/535215/|accessdate=July 28, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=July 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Halper|first1=Daniel|title=Key Dem Donor Takes Over ‘Country’s Most Important’ Journalistic Institution|url=http://freebeacon.com/politics/key-dem-donor-takes-countrys-important-journalistic-institution/|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|date=July 28, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Emerson Collective planned to move to full ownership in "three to five years".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/07/28/laurene-powell-jobss-emerson-collective-to-purchase-majority-stake-in-the-atlantic/|title=Laurene Powell Jobs’s Emerson Collective to purchase majority stake in the Atlantic|last=Wemple|first=Erik|date=July 28, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=August 24, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>
