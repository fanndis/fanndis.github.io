'''The Pussycat Dolls''' are an American [[girl group]] and [[dance ensemble]], founded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], by choreographer [[Robin Antin]] in 1995 as a [[burlesque]] troupe. At the suggestion of [[Jimmy Iovine]], Antin decided to take the burlesque troupe mainstream as a pop group.<ref name=adamw>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/always-nicoles-project-pussycat-dolls-became-pops-embittered/|title='Always Nicole's project': How The Pussycat Dolls became pop's most embittered group|last=White|first=Adam|date=2019-11-30|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-12-01|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Antin negotiated a record deal with [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records]] in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising [[Nicole Scherzinger]], [[Carmit Bachar]], [[Ashley Roberts]], [[Jessica Sutta]], [[Melody Thornton]], and [[Kimberly Wyatt]]. Their debut single, "[[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)#The Pussycat Dolls version|Sway]]", was featured on the soundtrack of the 2004 film ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]''

The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with number-one singles "[[Don't Cha]]", "[[Stickwitu]]", "[[Buttons (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Buttons]]", and their [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] debut album ''[[PCD (album)|PCD]]'' (2005). However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008), which contains hit singles "[[When I Grow Up (The Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up]]", "[[I Hate This Part]]", and "[[Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)]]". Following the completion of their [[Doll Domination Tour|2009 world tour]], the group went on hiatus and fully disbanded in 2010. The original recording line-up, minus Thornton, announced their reunion in 2019 with [[Unfinished Business (tour)|an upcoming tour]] and a new album.

The Pussycat Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, [[Pussycat Dolls Present|reality television programs]], a [[Las Vegas]] act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups ([[Girlicious]], [[Paradiso Girls]], [[G.R.L.]]), and other ventures. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/artists-of-the-decade?year=2009&begin=71&order=position |title=Artists of the Decade: Pussycat Dolls |date=2009-12-21 |access-date=2011-08-01 |work=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> The group has sold 55 million records worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZhRjnNLu3k|title=The Pussycat dolls Live BBC The One Show Interview 02/26/20|date=February 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/people/pussycat-dolls-announced-first-northampton-headliners-summer-1383176|title=Pussycat Dolls announced as first Northampton headliners this summer|last=Roberts|first=Carly|date=February 3, 2020}}</ref> making them one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time.<ref name=pcdsales>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/listen-to-nicole-scherzingers-new-album-big-fat-lie-3212/|date=October 16, 2014|last=Copsey|first=Rob|title=Listen to Nicole Scherzinger's new album Big Fat Lie|work=Official Charts Company|access-date=January 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name="mensxp">{{cite web|url=https://www.newmarketjournal.co.uk/news/pussycat-dolls-set-to-star-at-newmarket-nights-9098395/|title=Pussycat Dolls set to star at Newmarket Nights|date=February 3, 2020}}</ref> In 2012, the Pussycat Dolls ranked 100th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and as the tenth all-girl group.<ref>{{cite web |last=Graham |first=Mark |url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list/ |title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music &#124; VH1 Tuner |publisher=VH1.com |date=2012-02-13 |access-date=2013-05-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303101656/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref>

==History==

===1995–2002: Beginnings as burlesque dance troupe===
Antin began exploring the idea of a modern [[burlesque]] troupe during 1990 with Carla Kama and [[Christina Applegate]] as performers.<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|title=((( The Pussycat Dolls > Biography )))|publisher=[[AllMusic]].[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p702645/biography|pure_url=yes}}| last=Jeffries|first=David| access-date=2010-06-11}}</ref><ref name=reviewjournal>{{cite news|title=Neon: Beyond Burlesque|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413224425/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-08-Fri-2005/weekly/26226584.html|archive-date=2005-04-13|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-08-Fri-2005/weekly/26226584.html|last=Weatherford|first=Mike|date=2005-04-08 |access-date=2009-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.struttercabaret.com/carlakama/choreographer/bio/bio.html |title=Carla Kama Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155231/http://www.struttercabaret.com/carlakama/choreographer/bio/bio.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The troupe began to perform in 1995, with a repertoire of 1950s and 1960s [[pop standard|popular music standards]] while dressed in [[lingerie]] or old-fashioned [[pin-up]] costumes. They secured a Thursday night residency at a [[Los Angeles]] nightclub, [[the Viper Room]], where they stayed from 1995 to 2001. They appeared briefly in the 1998 films ''Matters of Consequence'' (dancing to [[Henry Mancini|Mancini]]'s "[[Breakfast at Tiffany's: Music from the Motion Picture|Hub Caps and Tail Lights]]", and [[Keely Smith]]'s "When Your Lover has Gone"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480557/|title=Matters of Consequence (1999)|date=January 13, 1999|work=IMDb}}</ref> and ''The Treat'' (directed by [[Jonathan Gems]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120871/fullcredits#cast|title=The Treat|date=January 15, 1999|access-date=November 18, 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> From 1995 to 2003 there were numerous guest vocalists, and many changes to the dance personnel.

The troupe received wider press coverage during June 1999, when ''[[Playboy]]'' featured a Pussycat Dolls pictorial, featuring at least seven contemporary members posing semi-nude (Kasey Campbell, Kiva Dawson, Antonietta Macri, Erica Breckels, Katie Bergold, Erica Gudis and Lindsley Allen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageplayboymags.co.uk/90s/June/09.htm|title=Playboy Magazine June 1999 vol.46, no.6|access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> Three years later, the Pussycat Dolls moved to [[The Roxy Theatre|the Roxy]]. They were featured in magazines, television specials for [[MTV]] and [[VH1]], ad campaigns, and films. Some of the Pussycat Dolls appeared in the 2003 film ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'',<ref name=allmusicbio/> dancing to Mancini's "[[The Pink Panther Theme]]". They were also featured in [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s "[[Trouble (Pink song)|Trouble]]" music video. Along with Applegate, [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Carmen Electra]] (who was the group's lead performer for many of their shows) the troupe was featured in a ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine shoot in 2002,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.dotspotter.com/news/545425_The_Pussycat_Dolls_Maxim_Photo_Shoot_Video |title=The Pussycat Dolls Maxim Photo Shoot Video |publisher=theinsider.com |date=2007-12-25 |access-date=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202203829/http://www.theinsider.com/index.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which increased public interest in them (Aguilera later appeared in the similarly themed 2010 film ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' directed by Robin Antin's brother [[Steve Antin|Steve]]).

Following their growing popularity, [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records]] [[music producer]]s [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Ron Fair]] became involved with the group helping them to transform into a franchise after [[Gwen Stefani]] was asked to perform with the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166116,00.html|title=The Pussycat With Nine Lives|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=December 14, 2007|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]. [[Time Inc.]]|access-date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> The former dance troupe evolved into a [[pop music|popular music]] recording group and became employees of Iovine's label Interscope Records. The only troupe members who remained after the re-casting process were Robin Antin, [[Carmit Bachar]], [[Cyia Batten]], Kasey Campbell, [[Ashley Roberts]], [[Jessica Sutta]] and [[Kimberly Wyatt]]. Electra, when asked about her lack of involvement with the group's evolution into a popular music group, said, "I was part of [the Pussycat Dolls] for over two years and did every show with them [...] but financially, I couldn't become part of their new music project [...] It was a sacrifice I couldn't make."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/electra-i-couldnt-afford-to-be-a-pussycat-doll_12_04_2006 |title=Electra: 'I Couldn't Afford To Be A Pussycat Doll' |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 2006-04-26 |access-date=2009-09-03}}</ref>

Since the Pussycat Dolls were originally a burlesque dance troupe, Scherzinger and Thornton were the only members specifically hired for singing role when the group turned into a pop act in 2003. Ron Fair stated that even though "there were some adequate voices in the original group," Scherzinger and Thornton were needed "to bring the ability."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1958|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060708101605/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1958|title=Pussycat Dolls: Pussy Galore!|archive-date=July 8, 2006|date=July 8, 2006|last=Raftery|first=Brian|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|access-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite Thornton taking the sole [[lead vocals]] for their debut performance as a music group at the 2004 [[MTV Asia Awards]], Scherzinger eventually assumed the majority of the vocals on the group's recordings.

Scherzinger, who said that she did not want to get in trouble for her revelations, explained that the other members did not even hear the tracks until they were finished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicole Scherzinger: 'I sang 95% of the Pussycat Dolls vocals'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a410519/nicole-scherzinger-i-sang-95-percent-of-the-pussycat-dolls-vocals.html|access-date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>

== Public image and media coverage ==
=== Nicole Scherzinger as lead singer ===
Critics have taken a major swipe at the group for their overemphasis of Scherzinger. Margeaux Watson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "there are two kinds of girl groups: those anchored by a superstar ([[The Supremes]], [[Destiny's Child]]), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts ([[Spice Girls]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]]). The Pussycat Dolls are neither—they're a brand, not a band. This follow-up to 2005's multi-platinum ''PCD'' finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no [[Beyoncé]]. As for the others, well... can you name them? Do you even know how many there are?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20226270,00.html|title=Doll Domination – Music Review |last=Watson|first=Margeaux|date=2008-09-24|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|access-date=2010-06-08}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Adam White described the Pussycat Dolls as "pop's most embittered group" where the other members played the role of "glorified back-up dancers", and said that their 2006 performance at the [[American Music Awards]] "appeared to prove all was not well within the group’s dynamic."<ref name=adamw/>

[[Kaya Jones]], who initially auditioned as a vocalist for the group, said: "Nicole was always someone who wanted to be in the spotlight and would do pretty much anything to get it. [...] To call the other girls in the Pussycat Dolls 'window dressings' is a bit farfetched... every girl in the group was talented."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/nicole-scherzinger-could-reunite-with-the-pussycat-dolls-8462612.html|title=Nicole Scherzinger could reunite with the Pussycat Dolls|date=January 23, 2013|website=Evening Standard}}</ref> In a 2014 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Ashley Roberts claimed that she and her bandmates "were always told it was very much Nicole's project [...] we were the football team, and [Scherzinger] was the quarterback.

We weren't even allowed in the studio sometimes."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ashley-roberts-interview-what-the-pussycat-dolls-were-really-like-9683418.html|title=Ashley Roberts interview: What The Pussycat Dolls were really like|date=August 22, 2014|website=The Independent}}</ref> Kimberly Wyatt said in 2009: "Every video and stage performance that we've done, Nicole has been our leader. I wasn't in videos like I wanted and wasn't seen in the way I was hoping, which has been the same for all the other girls too."<ref name=adamw/> In an interview with ''Vibe'', Thornton  said: "For me, it's important for people to know that I do write... I got into the group to sing. That was made very clear to me. But it became more and more apparent what was going on. Roles were being minimised and minimised, and then by the time it got on the [road], it was very much like 'Y'all play your part and this is what it is.' It was tough because you don't want to s--- on your own opportunity."<ref name=adamw/>

=== 2019 reunion ===
Following the group's reformation in 2019, Bachar addressed their prior split, "It wasn't a bitter ending. It was just a time in our lives where we all wanted to go and do our own thing and flourish. I went and had a family. We all stayed in touch."<ref name="Metro 2020-06-20">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro.news/pussycat-dolls-want-body-proud-star-lizzo-to-join-them/1901146/|title=Pussycat Dolls want body-proud star Lizzo to join them|website=Metro Newspaper UK}}</ref> Roberts added, "Nicole is our lead singer and that is the way the band is constructed. We all have our place in the band and we each give something special individually, which fits like a puzzle—that's what makes the Pussycat Dolls."<ref name="Metro 2020-06-20"/> Scherzinger confirmed that she would take centre stage but that this was by mutual agreement, "It feels better than ever now I have evolved as a woman. It is actually the time for me to carry it. It's not even me—we all carry each other. We make each other stronger".<ref name="Metro 2020-06-20"/> Wyatt also confirmed that the other girls do get chance to record vocal, "Ultimately, The Pussycat Dolls has a lead singer and that is Nicole. Whenever I get an opportunity to sing and get in the studio and throw down on some vocals, I'm so grateful." Speaking about the scrutiny that the group come under and the media attention Wyatt said "we want people to love it and focus on the amazing feat we have done together instead of trying to rip us apart."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/128628/The-Pussycat-Dolls-want-people-to-stop-trying-to-rip-them-apart|title=The Pussycat Dolls want people to stop 'trying to rip' them 'apart'|website=Music-News.com}}</ref>

=== Sexual image ===
Following their performance on ''[[The X Factor: Celebrity]]'' (2019), the group were accused of over-sexualisation and being raunchy for wearing sheer PVC outfits. Over 400 viewers complained to British broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]].<ref name="NZcity 2020-02-13">{{cite web |url=https://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=306003 |title=Nicole Scherzinger thinks The Pussycat Dolls have "evolved" over the last decade |website=home.nzcity.co.nz |author=BANG showbiz |date=2020-02-13 |access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref> Despite a more muted performance on ''[[Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'' in February 2020 that poked fun out of their ''X Factor'' performance and featured some censorship, the group garnered further complaints to Ofcom albeit a smaller amount.<ref name="Chronicle 2020-02-25">{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/pussycat-dolls-saturday-takeaway-performance-17811567 |title=Pussycat Doll hits back at Saturday Night Takeaway critics after performance sparks Ofcom complaints |website=The Chronicle (North East) |last=Duke |first=Simon |date=2020-02-25 |access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> Scherzinger spoke out against the media and negative coverage, comparing the group's message to American singer-songwriter [[Lizzo]] who is an advocate for body awareness, saying "If you have people like Lizzo leading the movement of accepting yourself and they don't get any criticism, then why are we getting this criticism? When we perform, we perform from a place of passion and power. We're not floundering out there just trying to be cute. We come like warriors out there and people feel empowered by that."<ref name="NZcity 2020-02-13"/> Barchar addressed criticism on their second performance by saying "being on Ant & Dec's show was hysterical; they are so good at what they do and the way they made light of the whole censorship thing was amazing. It's great that we got to be silly with it and we had a blast." She supported early comments by Scherzinger that the intention and aims of the group's performances was always about empowerment, saying "everyone has an opinion on what we do, and while I think the power of a woman can be intimidating, it's all about the intention of our performances".<ref name="Chronicle 2020-02-25"/> Roberts also responded by likening the groups' outfits to costumes and responded by noting that the group were entertainers.

Wyatt has also defended the group's image saying that it is an important message around female empowerment, during an appearance on ''The Morning Show'', Wyatt talked about bring her kids to rehearsals, "[I love] teaching them what it means to be a Pussycat Doll and own your space as a female. I think it's a really positive and important message for my girls to see and understand what that means."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a31256623/pussycat-dolls-complaints-kimberly-wyatt/ |title=Pussycat Dolls star Kimberly Wyatt says the band is a "positive" influence on young girls after complaints |website=[[Digital Spy]] |last=West |first=Amy |date=2020-03-06 |access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> Wyatt also stated during an interview with News.com.au that the reunion feels like unfinished business due to the Pussycat Dolls being misunderstood.

Referring to their provocative image, Sutta told ''The Daily Telegraph Australia'' that she felt that [[ageism]] is rife within the music industry but that times were changing, "You’ve got J-Lo at 50 who’s looking as fabulous as ever, and Lizzo who is all about self-love and owning it.

=== Sexist media coverage ===
Later in March 2020, during an interview with [[Network Ten]]'s ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'', Scherzinger acknowledged that the costumes for the performance were provocative but said "but we are women now and like literally as we say, (our bums) were hanging out and it takes courage to be that, you know it is vulnerable wearing as much as that, it takes a lot of courage to do it and we always do everything with confidence with the intent of empowering others and all of our women out there and anyone who feels they relate to us".<ref name="News AU 2020-02-04">{{cite web |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/nicole-scherzingers-incredibly-awkward-interview-on-the-project/news-story/5059ff13d1c5dd1296765f7abc9a1ceb |title=The Pussycat Dolls’ Nicole Scherzinger Went On ‘The Project’ Only To Endure A Woeful Interview |website=News.com.au |date=2020-03-04 |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> ''News AU'' and ''Junkee'' both criticised hosts of ''The Project'' for focusing on a perceived sexual nature of their dance moves and for making the interview with Scherzinger awkward.<ref name="Junkee 2020-03-04">{{cite web |url=https://junkee.com/nicole-scherzinger-pussycat-dolls-project-interview/245318 |title=The Pussycat Dolls’ Nicole Scherzinger Went On ‘The Project’ Only To Endure A Woeful Interview |website=Junkee |last=Richards |first=Jared |date=2020-03-04 |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref><ref name="News AU 2020-02-04"/> One of ''The Project's'' hosts [[Waleed Aly]] asked [[sexism|sexist]] questions such as whether the girls "fight over who wore the best tube tops and low rise jeans?".<ref name="Music News 2020-03-05">{{cite web |url=https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/129462/Nicole-Scherzinger-fails-to-hide-irritation-during-bizarre-TV-interview |title=Nicole Scherzinger fails to hide irritation during bizarre TV interview |author=Newsdesk |website=Music-news.com |date=2020-03-05 |access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> Jared Richards (''Junkee'') said "it’s a mess, absolutely dismissive of Scherzinger as a person and The Pussycat Dolls as an act...

As the music played, Scherzinger could be heard asking if the interview was about to cut to another segment."
