'''Cedille Records''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|d|iː}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Podcast Archive |url=https://www.cedillerecords.org/podcasts/ |website=Cedille Records |accessdate=7 July 2020}}</ref>) is the [[independent record label]] of the Chicago Classical Recording Foundation.

==History==
In 1989, [[James Steven Ginsburg|James Ginsburg]], the son of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], founded Cedille Records as a for-profit classical music recording company featuring Chicago-area musicians. Ginsburg's vision for Cedille was "to record local musicians overlooked by the major labels." Cedille was and remains the only Chicago-based classical label since [[Mercury Records|Mercury Living Presence]] in the 1950s. In 1994, Cedille was transformed into a not-for-profit record label under the umbrella of the Chicago Classical Recording Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title=A2IM|url=http://a2im.org/groups/cedille-records|work=Cedille Records|access-date=2011-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109132027/http://a2im.org/groups/cedille-records|archive-date=2011-11-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The label's releases included ''The Pulitzer Project'', an album featuring Chicago's [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra]] which includes two world premier recordings: [[William Schuman|William Schuman's]] "[[A Free Song]]" (Pulitzer 1943) and [[Leo Sowerby| Leo Sowerby's]] "[[The Canticle of the Sun (Sowerby)|Canticle of the Sun]]" (Pulitzer 1946).<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulitzer Project|url=http://cedillerecords.org/music/product_info.php?products_id=1185|work=Cedille Records Website}}</ref>
