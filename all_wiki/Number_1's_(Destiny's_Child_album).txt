'''''#1's''''' is the first [[compilation album]] released by recording group [[Destiny's Child]] through [[Columbia Records]] on October 25, 2005. It marked their last album before a formal disbandment in late 2005, announced during the tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]]. The [[greatest hits album]] features the highest-charting singles from Destiny's Child's four [[studio album]]s released between 1998 and 2004 as well as a song from their [[remix album]] ''[[This Is the Remix (Destiny's Child album)|This Is the Remix]]'' released in 2002. In addition to already existing material, three new songs were recorded for the compilation&nbsp;—"[[Stand Up for Love]]", "Feel the Same Way I Do" and group member [[Beyoncé]]'s collaboration with [[Slim Thug]], "[[Check on It]]".

Following its release, ''#1's'' received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]] who praised the included material as the highlights of the group's music career. However, its title was dismissed as many of the songs included on the track listing hadn't reached the top position of a major [[record chart]]; it was later acknowledged by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine that the title was only used as a marketing strategy. The compilation debuted and peaked on top of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart becoming the group's second album to reach number one in that country. It further peaked at number one in Japan and number six in the UK while also reaching the top forty in many European countries. The compilation received seven certifications by music trade organizations in different countries across the world. It further spawned two [[single (music)|singles]]: "Stand Up for Love", which failed to appear on a major music chart, and "Check on It", which reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the top ten on many European charts.

== Background and release ==
[[Image:Destiny's Child Tour.jpg|thumb|left|Destiny's Child performing "[[Say My Name]]" during a stop of their farewell [[concert tour]], [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]].]]
[[Destiny's Child]] went to a hiatus, following the release of their third [[studio album]] ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), allowing each member of the group to release solo material. As each member had success with their individual projects, questions arose by the public whether they would record again as a group.<ref name="survivor" /> However, group members [[Beyoncé]], [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] reunited again to work on their fourth studio album ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]''. The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] the following year as part of its promotion.<ref name="survivor">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-to-fame-the-song-isnt-called-survivor-for-nothing/|title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing)|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=June 13, 2005|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> During a concert the group had at the [[Palau Sant Jordi]] in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment.<ref name="KaufSplit">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503975/20050612/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child Announce Split|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=June 12, 2005|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> It was announced that after their final North American leg, the group would part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act.<ref name="survivor" /> During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of ''Destiny Fulfilled'' as they discussed their individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504619/20050623/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child Talk Split: 'It's Not The End'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=June 23, 2005|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>

On August 1, 2005, Rowland announced the release of a [[greatest hits album]] later that year during an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. She said, "We're definitely going to record another song for our greatest hits album for our fans.

''#1's'' contained charting songs from Destiny's Child's four studio albums ''[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]'' (1998), ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' (1999), ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001) and ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' (2004) as well as their [[remix album]] ''[[This Is the Remix (Destiny's Child album)|This Is the Remix]]'' (2002).<ref name="pitch" />{{refn|group=nb|"[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]" was originally recorded for the group's self-titled first studio album.

[[AllMusic]]'s Andy Kellman further noted that every charting single was included on the album with the exception of songs from the group's [[holiday album]] ''[[8 Days of Christmas]]'' (2001).<ref name="Allmusic" /> "Brown Eyes" which was not released as a single was featured as an international bonus track due to its appearance on a chart in the US.<ref name="Allmusic" /> Similarly, "[[Nasty Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Nasty Girl]]" and "So Good" were placed as bonus songs on the album's Japanese edition.<ref name="Japan" />

Andy Kellman from [[AllMusic]] wrote in his review that ''#1's'' was formatted the same was as other music scores and [[anthology|anthologies]] packed for the [[holiday shopping season]]. He further commented that its title should have been different and concluded, "the disc reaffirms that Destiny's Child released some of the biggest R&B singles of the late '90s and early 2000s."<ref name="Allmusic"/> Slant Magazine{{'s}} Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's title as only four of the singles reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. However, he praised Destiny's Child's "impressive output, which includes some of the most recognizable R&B hits of the past bling/celly/status-obsessed five years".<ref name="Slant"/> [[BBC Online]]'s writer James Blake called the album "more than decent" and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, ''Destiny Fulfilled'', as it was released only eleven months before ''#1's''.<ref name="Blake" /> [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Jess Harvell felt that it was a "smart" move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it "has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined". Harvell finished the review by writing, "you can take ''#1's'' as pure product and not feel wrong for doing so".<ref name="pitch" /> Despite classifying its title as "misleading" and criticizing the new material, ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''{{'}}s editor Michael D. Clark wrote the album was "dolled up as beautiful and immaculate as" the members of the group and included their best singles from their four studio albums.<ref name="houston" />

John A. Hanson of [[Sputnikmusic]] felt that the greatest hits album was released "at the perfect time" as many of the songs were released a long time ago and "they've lost the overplayedness, but its {{sic}} soon enough that they still have some sort of relevance".<ref name="Sputnik"/> He concluded for the album, "[it] hits you with recognizable hit after recognizable hit, and they are all pretty much as perfect as contemporary R&B-pop gets".<ref name="Sputnik"/> Describing the album as a "masterclass in what happens when a great band comes together", [[Yahoo! Music]]'s Hattie Collins wrote, "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R&B's most significant talents".<ref name="Yahoo"/> A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website [[musicOMH]] who felt the album included many "skippable" songs and noted that the material from ''The Writing's on the Wall'' and ''Survivor'' were the collection's best. She felt that the progress in the sound of the band was evident on ''#1's'', but offered the opinion, "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R&B".<ref name="musicOMH" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'s}} Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from ''Destiny Fulfilled'' and "Stand Up for Love" and concluded "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".<ref name="SFgate" />
