'''Michael Sinclair MacAuslan Shea''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CVO}} (10 May 1938 &ndash; 17 October 2009) was [[Royal Communications|Press Secretary]] to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] from 1978 to 1987. Earlier he had been a career diplomat and was also an author of political thrillers and non-fiction.

==Early life==
Until the age of 14 Shea attended [[Lenzie Academy]], where his mother was a teacher. He then attended [[Gordonstoun]] as a result of gaining a scholarship. He graduated from the [[University of Edinburgh]], having read Economics; he also completed his doctorate at Edinburgh<ref name="Griffiths">Dennis Griffiths (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992'', London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.516</ref> on economic development in West Africa. He was commissioned during his National Service into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1957.  He entered the Foreign Service in 1963 and served in Ghana, West Germany, Romania and New York.<ref>David McKittrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-shea-press-secretary-to-the-queen-in-the-late-seventies-and-eighties-1811156.html Obituary for Michael Shea in ''The Independent'']</ref>

==Royal press secretary==
After helping to arrange the Queen's official visit to the US bicentennial celebrations in 1976, Shea became her press secretary two years later. He was at the centre of a "mole hunt" in 1986 for the person who gave a briefing to a journalist on ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in which it was said the social policies being followed by the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Thatcher government]] were causing the Queen "dismay",<ref name="Telegraph">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/royalty-obituaries/6377211/Michael-Shea.html "Michael Shea"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 19 October 2009</ref> and [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s negative attitude to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] caused displeasure.<ref name="Guardian">Stephen Bates [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/21/michael-shea-obituary Michael Shea Obituary], ''The Guardian'', 21 October 2009</ref> Members of Parliament called for Shea's resignation if he was responsible. The Queen's Private Secretary, Sir [[William Heseltine]], responded to the controversy in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' confirming Shea as the contact, but asserting that Shea's comments had been misreported.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6881428.ece Obituary for Michael Shea in ''The Times'']</ref> 

Shea left royal service the following year; some sources indicated that he was "dropped" from the role.<ref>{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=Dean |date=1 June 2015 |title=Queen and Mrs Thatcher: An Inconvenient Relationship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGsTDQAAQBAJ&q=A+View+from+the+Sidelines+shea+about+his+time+as+press+secretary&pg=PT174 |publisher=The History Press |page= |isbn=978-0750962650}}</ref> He continued to deny that there was any connection with the earlier controversy.<ref name="Telegraph"/> He was not knighted<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/21/michael-shea-obituary|title=Michael Shea obituary |author=Stephen Bates|date=21 October 2009 |work=The Guardian |access-date=26 November 2020}}</ref>&nbsp;but was a [[Royal Victorian Order|Lieutenant of the Victorian Order]] (LVO) from 1985 and [[Royal Victorian Order|Commander]] (CVO) from 1987.<ref name="Griffiths"/>

==Other activities==
While [[First Secretary (diplomatic rank)|First Secretary]] in [[Bonn]], then the capital of [[West Germany]], Shea began his career as a writer. A thriller, ''Sonntag'', was published under the [[pseudonym]] '''Michael Sinclair''' in 1971, the first of 20 books, most of them political thrillers, some set in the near future. ''State of the Nation'' (1997)  and ''Endgame'' (2002) take place in an independent Scotland. His memoirs were published as ''A View from the Sidelines'' (2003).

After he resigned as the Queen's press secretary, Shea worked for six years at [[Hanson plc]] as director of public relations. He can be heard in a private interview given to Brendan Bruce  (former Conservative Party Director of Communications under Margaret Thatcher) for his book 'Images of Power' (Kogan Page 1992) in the British Library Sound Archive.<ref>BL reference C1251/21  http://cadensa.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/gR0fld7fWI/WORKS-FILE/11570052/123</ref> Other activities included service with National Galleries of Scotland as a trustee, with the Edinburgh Military Tattoo as a director, and with the Royal Lyceum theatre as chairman. Shea was also among the group that revived the Edinburgh Oyster Club. <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/21/michael-shea-obituary&nbsp;|title=Michael Shea obituary |author=Stephen Bates|date=21 October 2009 |work=The Guardian |access-date=21 November 2020}}</ref>&nbsp;

Michael Shea was married to Mona Grec Stensen, a native of Norway; they married in 1968. The couple had two daughters. 

His last years were affected by the onset of [[dementia]]. He died at age 71 in 2009.
