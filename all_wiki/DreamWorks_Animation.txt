'''DreamWorks Animation LLC''' (also simply known as '''DreamWorks''') is an American [[animation studio]] and a subsidiary of [[Universal Pictures]], itself a subsidiary of [[Comcast]]'s [[NBCUniversal]]. It is based in [[Glendale, California]], and produces animated feature films, television programs, and online virtual games. The studio has currently released a total of [[List of DreamWorks Animation productions#Released films|38 feature films]], beginning with ''[[Antz]]'' (1998); its most recent film was ''[[The Croods: A New Age]]'' (2020), with their next release being ''[[The Boss Baby: Family Business]]'' on March 26, 2021.

Originally formed as a division of [[DreamWorks Pictures]] in 1994 by some alumni from [[Amblin Entertainment]]'s former animation branch [[Amblimation]], it was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] into a separate public company in 2004. DreamWorks Animation currently maintains its Glendale campus, as well as satellite studios in India and China.<ref name="verrier2015">{{cite news|author=Verrier, Richard|title=DreamWorks Animation plans substantial layoffs|date=January 19, 2015|work=[[Los Angel.

{{as of|2019|May|}}, its feature films have grossed $15.019 billion worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/?view=Brand&sort=sumgross&order=DESC&p=.htm|title=Movie Brands Sorted by Total Gross |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> with a $417.2 million average gross per film.<ref>When added to foreign grosses {{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=dwanimation.htm |title=DreamWorks Animation Movies at the Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] }}</ref> Fifteen of their films produced by the studio are among the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|50 highest-grossing animated films]], with ''[[Shrek 2]]'' being the eleventh all-time highest. Although the studio also made [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] films in the past, as well as two [[stop-motion]] co-productions with [[Aardman Animations]], all of their films now use computer animation.

The studio has earned three [[Academy Awards]], as well as 41 [[Emmy Award]]s and numerous [[Annie Award]]s, and multiple [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations. In recent years, the animation studio has acquired and created new divisions in an effort to diversify beyond the high-risk movie business.

Films produced by DreamWorks Animation were originally distributed worldwide by DreamWorks Pictures from 1998 to 2005, then by [[Paramount Pictures]] from 2006 to 2012 and [[20th Century Fox]] from 2013 to 2017.

== History ==
=== DreamWorks SKG era (1994–2006) ===
[[File:Dreamworksanimationentrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to DreamWorks campus in Glendale]]
On October 12, 1994, a trio of entertainment players, film director and producer [[Steven Spielberg]], former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and music executive [[David Geffen]], founded [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks SKG]] (the three letters taken from the surnames of the founders). To build the talent base, Spielberg brought over artists from his London-based studio, [[Amblimation]], while Katzenberg recruited some of the top animation staff from Disney.<ref name=AWN2DRenaissance>{{cite web|last1=Sito|first1=Tom|title=The Late, Great, 2D Animation Renaissance — Part 2|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/late-great-2d-animation-renaissance-part-2 |website=Animation World Network|access-date=October 16, 2015|date=March 16, 2006}}</ref> Some of Amblimation's artists came to DreamWorks in 1995, when the studio's [[Balto (film)|last feature]] was completed,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://fmx.de/about-us/boards/advisory-board/shelley-page-dreamworks-animation.html | title=Shelley Page (DreamWorks Animation) | website=FMX.de | access-date=July 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201161237/http://www.fmx.de/about-us/boards/advisory-board/shelley-page-dreamworks-animation.html |archive-date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> with the rest doing so following the studio's closure in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Sam|title=Balto |url=https://animatedviews.com/2003/laserdisc-archives-balto/|website=Animated Views|access-date=October 16, 2015|date=May 11, 2003}}</ref>

In 1995, DreamWorks signed a co-production deal with [[Pacific Data Images]] to form subsidiary PDI, LLC (PDI owned 60% of PDI, LLC, while DreamWorks SKG owned 40%). This new unit would produce computer-generated feature films, beginning with ''[[Antz]]'' in 1998. In the same year, DreamWorks SKG produced ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which used both CGI technology and traditional animation techniques.

In 1997, DreamWorks partnered with [[Aardman Animations]], a British [[stop-motion]] animation studio, to co-produce and distribute ''[[Chicken Run]]'' (2000), a stop-motion film already in pre-production.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chicken Run: Deal clinched with DreamWorks & Pathe |url=http://www.telepathy.co.uk/aardman/news/recent/recent10.html |access-date=August 30, 2011 |website=telepathy.co.uk |publisher=Telepathy Ltd|date=December 3, 1997}}</ref> Two years later they extended the deal for an additional four films. With Aardman doing stop-motion, they covered all three major styles, besides traditional and computer animation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moerk |first=Christian|title=DW-Aardman pact drawn |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117757480 |access-date=September 3, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=October 27, 1999}}</ref> This partnership had DreamWorks participating in the production of stop-motion films in Bristol, and also had Aardman participating in some of the CGI films made in the United States.

Three years later, DreamWorks SKG created DreamWorks Animation, a new business division that would regularly produce both types of animated feature films. The same year DW acquired majority interest (90%) in PDI, and reformed it into PDI/DreamWorks, the Northern California branch of its new business division.<ref>{{cite web | last=Carlson | first=Wayne | url=https://excelsior.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~carlson/history/tree/pdi.html | title=Pacific Data Images | website=design.osu.edu | publisher=[[Ohio State University]] | access-date=July 4, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811134916/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/pdi.html | archive-date=August 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2001, ''[[Shrek]]'' was released and went on to win the first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]]. Due to the success of CGI animated films, DWA decided the same year to exit hand-drawn animation business after the next two of total four hand-drawn films. Beginning with ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), all released films, other than some co-produced with Aardman, were expected to be produced with CGI.<ref name="Annual2007">{{cite web | url=https://www.dreamworks.com/2007AR/pdf/DWA_07AR.pdf | title=2007 Annual Report | website=DreamWorks Animation SKG | date=March 17, 2008 | access-date=July 3, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928232607/http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/2007AR/pdf/DWA_07AR.pdf | archive-date=September 28, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The releases of ''Shrek 2'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]'' also made DWA the first animation studio to produce two CGI animated features in a single year.<ref name="Annual2004">{{cite web | url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DWA/1132307488x0x429592/93F65FFB-C004-4B6F-AF32-A046FF23C9FF/35766-DreamWorks-AR-2004.pdf | title=Annual Report 2004 | publisher=DreamWorks Animation SKG | website=files.shareholder.com | date=March 25, 2005 | access-date=July 4, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529090957/http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DWA/1132307488x0x429592/93F65FFB-C004-4B6F-AF32-A046FF23C9FF/35766-DreamWorks-AR-2004.pdf | archive-date=May 29, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Public corporation (2004–2016) ===
The animation division was spun off into a publicly traded company named '''DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.''' (doing business as '''DreamWorks Animation LLC''') on October 27, 2004, and traded via the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name="NYSEDWA" /> Katzenberg headed the new division, while Spielberg and Geffen remained on board as investors and consultants.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-05/dreamworks-katzenberg-still-seeks-advice-from-spielberg.html | title= DreamWorks' Katzenberg Still Seeks Advice From Spielberg |first=Andy |last=Fixmer |website=bloomberg.com | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date=December 5, 2013 | access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> DWA also inherited interests in PDI/DreamWorks. They made an agreement with their former parent to distribute all of their films until they delivered twelve new films, or December 12, 2010, whichever came last.<ref name="Annual2004" />

On January 31, 2006, DWA entered into a distribution agreement with [[Paramount Pictures]], which recently acquired DWA's former parent and distribution partner, DreamWorks SKG. The agreement granted Paramount the worldwide rights to distribute all animated films, including previously released films, until the delivery of 13 new animated feature films or December 31, 2012, whichever came last.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dreamworks.com/2010AR/docs/114527_008_DreamWorks_BMK.PDF | title=Annual Report 2010 | website=dreamworksanimation.com | publisher=DreamwWorks Animation SKG | date=February 24, 2011 | access-date=July 3, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928232652/http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/2010AR/docs/114527_008_DreamWorks_BMK.PDF | archive-date=September 28, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' was the last film distributed by it's former distribution arm and ''[[Over the Hedge (2006 film)|Over the Hedge]]'' was the first film distributed by Paramount.

DWA's partnership with Aardman ended after the release of ''[[Flushed Away]]'' in November 2006, having delivered three out of five films. The announcement was made before the film's release, on October 3, citing "creative differences".<ref>{{cite news | first=Laura M.| last=Holson | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/business/media/03animation.html | title=Is Th-Th-That All, Folks? |work=The New York Times | date=October 3, 2006 | access-date=November 17, 2010}}</ref> DWA retained the co-ownership of rights to all films co-produced with Aardman, with an exception being ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' (2005), for which they only kept the worldwide distribution rights.<ref name="Annual2007" />

On March 13, 2007, DreamWorks Animation announced it would release all of its films, beginning with ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' (2009), in stereoscopic 3D.<ref>{{Cite press release | title = DreamWorks Animation Goes 3D |website=ir.dreamworksanimation.com | publisher=DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. | date = March 13, 2007 | url = http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540426 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20110818161758/http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540426 | url-status = dead | archive-date = August 18, 2011 | access-date = November 6, 2010 }}</ref> Together with [[Intel]], they co-developed a new 3D film-making technology, [[InTru3D]].<ref>{{Cite press release | title = INTEL, DreamWorks Animation Form Strategic Alliance to Revolutionize 3-D Filmmaking Technology | publisher=DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. | date = July 8, 2008 | url = http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540764 |website=ir.dreamworksanimation.com | archive-url = https://archive.is/20110818161915/http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=540764 | url-status = dead | archive-date = August 18, 2011 | access-date = November 6, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2008, DWA extended its production pipeline into [[Bangalore]], [[India]], where they established a special unit within [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]], named DreamWorks Dedicated Unit. The unit is owned by Technicolor, but DreamWorks hires and trains the animators, who then contribute to DreamWorks projects. DDU at first worked only on TV specials, such as ''[[Merry Madagascar]]'' (2009), ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'' (2010), and DVD projects.<ref>{{cite web | title=Opportunities in India to work on Dreamworks Featured Projects | url=https://www.siggraph.org//asia2011/exhibitor-tech-talk-detail?id=133 | work=Siggraph | date=December 13, 2011 | access-date=December 16, 2011 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913090124/http://www.siggraph.org/asia2011/exhibitor-tech-talk-detail?id=133 | archive-date=September 13, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Eventually they started contributing to DreamWorks' feature films as well, beginning with animating part of ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite news|title='Puss in Boots' showcases work by India animators for DreamWorks|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-dwa-india-20111029,0,1526743.story|access-date=November 1, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Richard |last=Verrier|date=October 29, 2011}}</ref>

At Guggenheim Partners' TMT Symposium, NBCUniversal CEO [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]] discussed how the purchase of DWA would fit into its business strategies. Burke explained that Meledandri planned to "take a lot of the existing DreamWorks franchises and add value as we create new franchises", and that the main goal was to "[take] the low-single-digit returns of the movie business and turn it into a different kind of business" by creating new [[intellectual property]] that can be merchandised and adapted into theme park attractions. Burke reaffirmed a commitment to animated features, stating that Universal would be able to release as many as four animated films per-year, divided between DreamWorks and Illumination. Burke also outlined that the purchase would be beneficial to Universal's expanding presence in China (where it is building a new Universal Studios park in Beijing).<ref>{{cite web|title=NBCUniversal Execs Reassure DreamWorks Animation Staffers They Are Committed to More Animated Features|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbcuniversal-execs-reassure-dreamworks-animation-890873|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 4, 2016|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NBCU Chief Looks To Revive 'Shrek' And Sales From DreamWorks Animation Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2016/06/steve-burke-nbcuniversal-revive-shrek-sales-dreamworks-animation-deal-1201772640/|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 14, 2016|access-date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>
