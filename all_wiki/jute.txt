'''Jute''' is a long, soft, shiny [[bast fiber]] that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced from [[flowering plants]] in the genus ''[[Corchorus]]'', which is in the mallow family [[Malvaceae]]. The primary source of the fiber is ''[[Corchorus olitorius]]'', but it is considered inferior to ''[[Corchorus capsularis]]''.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Corchorus+olitorius |title=Plants for a Future|website=Pfaf.org |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> "Jute" is the name of the plant or fiber used to make [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap, hessian or gunny]] cloth.

Jute is one of the most affordable [[natural fiber]]s, and second only to [[cotton]] in the amount produced and variety of uses. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. It falls into the [[bast fiber]] category (fiber collected from bast, the [[phloem]] of the plant, sometimes called the "skin") along with [[kenaf]], [[Hemp|industrial hemp]], [[flax]] ([[linen]]), [[ramie]], etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is ''raw jute''. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1–4 metres (3–13&nbsp;feet) long. Jute is also called the "golden fiber" for its color and high cash value.

== Cultivation ==
{{Main|Jute cultivation}}
[[File:Jute plant.gif|thumb|Jute plants (''Corchorus olitorius'' and ''Corchorus capsularis'')]]
The jute plant needs a plain [[alluvial]] soil and standing water. The suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the [[monsoon]] climate, during the monsoon season. Temperatures from {{cvt|20|to(-)|40|C|F}} and relative humidity of 70%–80% are favourable for successful cultivation. Jute requires {{cvt|5|-|8|cm|in|0}} of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time.  [[Soft water]] is necessary for jute production.

===White jute (''Corchorus capsularis'')===
Historical documents (including ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'' by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] in 1590) state that the poor villagers of [[India]] used to wear clothes made of jute. The weavers used simple hand spinning wheels and hand looms, and spun cotton yarns as well. History also suggests that Indians, especially [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], used ropes and twines made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. It is highly functional for carrying grains or other agricultural products.

===Tossa jute (''Corchorus olitorius'')===
Tossa jute (''[[Corchorus olitorius]]'') is a variety thought native to [[South Asia]]. It is grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. People use the leaves as an ingredient in a [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]] [[Leaf vegetable|potherb]] called "[[molokhiya]]" ({{lang|ar|ملوخية}}, of uncertain etymology). It is popular in some [[Arabian]] countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat over rice or [[lentil]]s. The [[Book of Job]] (chapter 30, verse 4), in the King James translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] {{lang|he|מלוח}} ''maluaḥ'' "salty",<ref>The New Bantam-Megiddo Hebrew & English Dictionary, Sivan and Levenston, Bantam books, NY, 1875</ref> mentions this vegetable potherb as "mallow, giving rise to the term [[Jew]]'s Mallow.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chiffolo|first=Anthony F|title=Cooking With the Bible: Biblical Food, Feasts, And Lore|date=30 August 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j74CAAAAQAAJ&q=jew%27s+mallow+jute+bible&pg=RA1-PA327|author2=Rayner W. Hesse|accessdate=13 June 2012|page=237}}</ref> It is high in [[protein]], [[vitamin&nbsp;C]], [[beta-carotene]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].

[[Bangladesh]] and other countries in [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] mainly use jute for its fiber. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety shows good sustainability in the [[Ganges Delta]] climate. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of [[Bengal]] where it is known as ''paat'' from the start of the 19th&nbsp;century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety.

==History==
Jute was used for making textiles in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus valley civilization]] since the 3rd millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harappa.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Jute.pdf|title=New evidence for jute (Corchorus capsularis L.) in the Indus civilization|website=Harappa.com|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref>

In [[classical antiquity]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] recorded that jute plants were used as food in [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name="pieroni">{{cite book |editor1-last= Prance |editor1-first=Ghillean |editor2-last=Nesbitt |editor2-first=Mark |last1=Pieroni |first1=Andrea |author-link=Andrea Pieroni |date=2005 |title=The Cultural History of Plants |publisher=Routledge |page=31 |isbn=0415927463}}</ref> It may have also been cultivated by the [[Jews]] in the Near East, which gives the plant its name.<ref name="pieroni"/>

For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the culture of [[East Bengal]] and some parts of [[West Bengal]], precisely in the southwest of Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century the British started trading in jute. During the reign of the [[British Empire]], jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling manufactured products made from it. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal, and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish [[jute trade]]. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches of [[World War I]], and to the United States south to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing, construction, art and the arms industries. Initially, due to its texture, it could only be processed by hand until someone in Dundee discovered that treating it with [[whale oil]] made it machine processable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n5pvr | title=BBC Two - Brian Cox's Jute Journey |publisher=BBC |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}</ref> The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ("jute weaver" was a recognised trade occupation in the 1900 UK census), but this trade had largely ceased by about 1970 due to the emergence of synthetic fibers. In the 21st century, jute again has become an important export crop around the world, mainly in Bangladesh.

[[File:পাট পঁচানো.jpg|thumb|Jute stems being [[retting|retted]] in water to separate the fibers]]
The jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by [[retting]]. The retting process consists of bundling jute stems together and immersing them in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins; women and children usually do this job. In the stripping process, non-fibrous matter is scraped off, then the workers dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem.<ref name="IJSG">{{cite web|url=http://www.jute.org/home2.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526151933/http://www.jute.org/home2.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 May 2008|title=Welcome to the world of Jute and Kenaf - IJSG|date=26 May 2008|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>

==Genome==
{{main|Jute genome}}
At the beginning of the 21st century, in 2002 Bangladesh commissioned a consortium of researchers from [[University of Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh Jute Research Institute]] (BJRI) and private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration with Centre for Chemical Biology, [[University of Science Malaysia]] and [[University of Hawaii]], to research different fibers and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (''Corchorus olitorius'') was completed.<ref name="The Jute Genome Project Homepage">{{cite web|url=http://www.jutegenome.org/|title=The Jute Genome Project Homepage|website=Jutegenome.org|accessdate=2010-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619060302/http://www.jutegenome.org/|archive-date=2010-06-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Uses==
Making twine, rope, and matting are among its uses.

In combination with sugar, the possibility of using jute to build aeroplane panels has been considered.
<ref>{{cite web|title=SUGAR AND JUTE AEROPLANE PANELS|url=http://dailyfuture.eu/en/environment/sugar-and-jute-aeroplane-panels/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415041105/http://dailyfuture.eu/en/environment/sugar-and-jute-aeroplane-panels/|archivedate=2015-04-15}}</ref>

Jute is in great demand due to its cheapness, softness, length, lustre and uniformity of its fiber. It is called the 'brown paper bag' as it is also the most used product in [[gunny sacks]] to store rice, wheat, grains, etc. It is also called the "golden fiber" due to its versatile nature.<ref name="PIJ-Kumari" />

===Fibers===

[[File:Jute fibre extraction.jpg|thumb|Jute fiber is extracted from retted stem of jute plants]]

Jute matting is used to prevent flood erosion while natural vegetation becomes established. For this purpose, a natural and [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] fiber is essential.

Jute is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton due to its versatility. Jute is used chiefly to make [[cloth]] for wrapping bales of raw cotton, and to make sacks and coarse cloth. The fibers are also woven into [[curtain]]s, [[chair]] coverings, [[carpet]]s, area rugs, [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian cloth]], and backing for [[linoleum]].

While jute is being replaced by synthetic materials in many of these uses,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} some uses take advantage of jute's biodegradable nature, where synthetics would be unsuitable. Examples of such uses include containers for planting young trees, which can be planted directly with the container without disturbing the roots, and land restoration where jute cloth prevents erosion occurring while natural vegetation becomes established.

The fibers are used alone or blended with other types of fiber to make [[twine]] and [[rope]]. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into ''imitation silk''. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the [[wood pulp]] used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry.

Jute was used in traditional textile machinery as fibers having cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and [[lignin]] (wood fiber content). But, the major breakthrough came when the automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, [[technical textiles]], and composites. Therefore, jute has changed its textile fiber outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e., wood fiber. As a textile fiber, jute has reached its peak from where there is no hope of progress, but as a wood fiber jute has many promising features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exporter-of-jute-products.blogspot.com/|title=Information on Jute, Kenaf, Roselle Hemp, & Natural/Bast Fiber Textile Products - by GFTCL|website=Exporter-of-jute-products.blogspot.com|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>

Jute is used in the manufacture of a number of fabrics, such as [[Hessian (cloth)|Hessian cloth]], sacking, [[Scrim (material)|scrim]], carpet backing cloth (CBC), and [[canvas]]. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.

Diversified jute products are becoming more and more valuable to the consumer today. Among these are [[espadrilles]], soft [[sweaters]] and [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigans]], floor coverings, home textiles, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, composites, and more.

Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute mats and mattings with 5/6 mts width and of continuous length are easily being woven in southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and in different weaves, like bouclé, Panama, herringbone, etc. Jute mats and rugs are made both by powerloom and handloom in large volume in Kerala, India. The traditional Satranji mat is becoming very popular in home décor. Jute non-wovens and composites can be used for underlay, linoleum substrate, and more.

Jute has many advantages as a home textile, either replacing cotton or blending with it. It is a strong, durable, color and light-fast fiber. Its UV protection, sound and heat insulation, low thermal conduction and anti-static properties make it a wise choice in home décor. Also, fabrics made of jute fibers are carbon-dioxide neutral and naturally decomposable. These properties are also why jute can be used in high performance technical textiles.<ref name="IJSG"/>

Moreover, jute can be grown in 4–6 months with a huge amount of cellulose being produced from the jute hurd (inner woody core or [[parenchyma]] of the jute stem) that can meet most of the wood needs of the world.

Thus, jute is the most environment-friendly fiber starting from the seed to expired fiber, as the expired fibers can be recycled more than once.

Jute is also used to make ghillie suits, which are used as camouflage and resemble grasses or brush.

Another diversified jute product is geotextiles, which made this agricultural commodity more popular in the agricultural sector. It is a lightly woven fabric made from natural fibers that is used for soil erosion control, seed protection, weed control, and many other agricultural and [[landscaping]] uses. The geotextiles can be used more than a year and the bio-degradable jute geotextile left to rot on the ground keeps the ground cool and is able to make the land more fertile.

===Culinary uses===
''Corchous olitorius'' leaves are used to make [[mulukhiya]], sometimes considered the Egyptian national dish, but consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries as well. It is an ingredient for stews, typically cooked with lamb or chicken.

In Nigeria, leaves of ''Corchorus olitorius'' are prepared in sticky soup called ''ewedu'' together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried small fish or shrimp.<ref>AVRDC. [http://avrdc.org/?p=2844 Recipes - African Sticky Soup (Ewedu)]. Retrieved 27 June 2013.</ref> The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky before adding to the soup. Amongst the Yoruba of Nigeria, the leaves are called ''Ewedu'', and in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves are called ''turgunuwa'' or ''lallo''. The cook cuts jute leaves into shreds and adds them to the soup, which normally also contains ingredients such as meat or fish, pepper, onions, and spices. Likewise, the [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] of [[West Nile sub-region|Northwestern Uganda]] eat the leaves in a soup they call ''pala bi''. Jute is also a [[totem]] for Ayivu, one of the Lugbara [[clan]]s.

In the Philippines, especially in Ilocano-dominated areas, this vegetable, locally known as ''saluyot'', can be mixed with either bitter gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or sometimes all of them. These have a slimy and slippery texture.

* Jute fiber is 100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly.
* Jute has low pesticide and fertilizer needs.
* It is a natural fiber with golden and silky shine and hence called ''the golden fiber''.<ref name="PIJ-Kumari" />
* It is the cheapest vegetable fiber procured from the bast or skin of the plant's stem.
* It is the second most important vegetable fiber after cotton, in terms of usage, global consumption, production, and availability.
* It has high tensile strength, low [[extensibility]], and ensures better [[Waterproof fabric|breathability]] of fabrics. Therefore, jute is very suitable in agricultural commodity bulk packaging.
* It helps to make top quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibers that has been used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile, construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of [[yarn]] results in a reduced breaking tenacity and an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend.
* Advantages of jute include good insulating and [[static electricity|antistatic]] properties, as well as having low [[thermal conductivity]] and a moderate [[moisture regain]]. Other advantages of jute include [[Soundproofing|acoustic insulating]] properties and manufacture with no [[Irritation|skin irritations]].
* Jute can be blended with other fibers, both synthetic and natural, and accepts cellulosic [[dye]] classes such as [[natural dye|natural]], [[basic dye|basic]], [[vat dye|vat]], [[Sulfur dye|sulfur]], [[reactive dye|reactive]], and [[dye|pigment dyes]]. As demand for natural comfort fibers increases, demand for jute and other natural fibers that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, some manufactures in the natural fiber industry plan to modernize processing with the [[Rieter]]'s [[Elitex]] system. Resulting jute/cotton yarns produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with [[caustic soda]], crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid [[ammonia]] has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with [[fireproofing|flameproofing]] agents.
* Some noted disadvantages include poor drapability and crease resistance, [[brittleness]], fiber shedding, and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with [[castor oil]] [[lubricant]]s result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to [[Microorganism|microbial]] attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an [[enzyme]] to reduce some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from [[Asteraceae|marigold]] flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was [[mordant]]ed with [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulphate]], increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to [[reactive dye]]ing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute.
