{{short description|American annual sports award}}
The first [[Athlete of the Year]] award in the [[United States]] was initiated by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) in 1931. At a time when [[women's sports|women in sports]] were not given the same recognition as men, the AP offered a male and a female athlete of the year award to either a professional or amateur [[Sportsperson|athlete]]. The awards are voted on annually by a panel of AP sports editors from across the United States, covering mainly American sports. As a result, a large majority of the winners have been Americans. However, non-Americans are also eligible for the honor, and have won on a few occasions.
