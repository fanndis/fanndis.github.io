===2003===
Davenport started the year by hiring [[Rick Leach]] as her coach, but this association lasted only a short time. She then hired [[Adam Peterson (tennis)|Adam Peterson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/11/1041990140111.html |title=Davenport's passion is back |newspaper=The Age |date=January 12, 2003 |accessdate=September 20, 2014 }}</ref> She reached the final of the tournament in [[Medibank International|Sydney]], where she lost to Kim Clijsters.

===2005===
Davenport's success continued into 2005, when she reached her first Grand Slam final, at the Australian Open, since the [[2000 U.S. Open (tennis)|2000 US Open]]; she fell to [[Serena Williams]] in three sets.

At the tournament in [[Pacific Life Open|Indian Wells, California]], in March, Davenport made history by defeating world no. 3 [[Maria Sharapova]], 6–0, 6–0. It marked the first time that a player ranked in the top 3 had ever been "shut out" on the WTA tour and was the first time Sharapova had failed to win a game during a match. This turned out to be Davenport's only career victory against Sharapova.

In April, she won the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island, Florida]] for the third time, defeating [[Silvia Farina Elia]] in the final. In the quarterfinals of that tournament, Davenport defeated [[Venus Williams]] for the fourth consecutive time.

Davenport bypassed the European clay-court season and went to the French Open without having played a professional competitive match for weeks. She confounded expectations with a run to the quarterfinals on her least favourite surface, including a come-from-behind victory over [[Kim Clijsters]] in the fourth round. Davenport lost to eventual runner-up [[Mary Pierce]].

At [[Wimbledon (tennis)|Wimbledon]], Davenport was the top seed and made it easily to the fourth round, where she was tested again by Clijsters, but came through in three sets to win her second successive match against the Belgian. Davenport then reached the semifinals, where her match against [[Amélie Mauresmo]] was interrupted by rain and was completed over the course of two days. Davenport eventually defeated Mauresmo and faced 14th-seeded [[Venus Williams]] in an all-American final. Davenport led most of the way, as she served for the match at 6–5 in the second set, and had a match point at 5–4 in the third set. Williams went on to win, 4–6, 7–6, 9–7, in the longest (in terms of time) women's Wimbledon final in history. In that match, Davenport sustained a serious back injury while leading 4–2 (40–15) in the final set, although she acknowledged after the match that the injury did not cause her defeat and that Williams was the superior mentally strong player on the day. The injury forced Davenport to withdraw from [[Fed Cup]] competition. She returned to the tour at the [[Bank of the West|Stanford]] tournament. After reinjuring her back in a warmup just hours before her match, Davenport retired while trailing 0–5 in the first set. This back injury then forced her to withdraw from other hard-court events in [[Acura Classic|San Diego]] and [[JPMorgan Chase Open|Los Angeles]].

Davenport returned to the WTA Tour in August, winning her comeback tournament in [[Pilot Pen Tennis|New Haven]] without dropping a set. Davenport then reached the quarterfinals of the US Open, where she held a match point on [[Elena Dementieva]], before falling in the third set tie-break. Davenport briefly lost the no. 1 ranking following the event.

[[File:Davenport 2006 US Open.jpg|thumb|210px|Davenport preparing to return serve at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 U.S. Open]] against [[Katarina Srebotnik]] of [[Slovenia]] in the third round on the Grandstand court]]

After the loss at the US Open, Davenport captured the title in [[Wismilak International|Bali]] without dropping a set, and subsequently qualified for the [[WTA Tour Championships]]. She then won the title in [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]], defeating Mauresmo in the final for the second consecutive year. The win made her only the tenth woman ever to win 50 career WTA singles titles.

In [[Zürich Open|Zürich]], Davenport saved two match points while defeating [[Daniela Hantuchová]]. The win assured Davenport of recapturing the world no. 1 ranking from Sharapova the following week. In the final, Davenport defeated sixth seeded [[Patty Schnyder]] for her fourth title in Zürich and her sixth title of 2005, second only to Clijsters's nine. It was also the first time Davenport had saved match points en route to a victory since the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|1999 U.S. Open]]. The Zürich title left her with eleven Tier I titles, second among active players.

Davenport was a semifinalist at the WTA tour year-end championships (losing to Pierce in two tie-breaks), which ensured that she finished the year ranked no. 1. 2005 was the fourth time that Davenport ended the year ranked no. 1, joining [[Steffi Graf]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Chris Evert]] as the only female players to end a year ranked first at least four times.

In 2005, TENNIS Magazine ranked Davenport 29th in its list of the 40 greatest players of the tennis era.

===2006===
On February 22, 2006, Davenport became just the eighth woman in WTA history to win 700 singles matches, when she handed out her fourth career "double bagel", defeating [[Elena Likhovtseva]] in the second round of the [[Dubai Duty Free Women's Open|Dubai]] tournament.

At the March tournament in [[Pacific Life Open|Indian Wells, California]], Davenport lost in the fourth round to [[Martina Hingis]]. She was then absent from the tour until August because of a back injury. She returned in [[JPMorgan Chase Open|Los Angeles]], losing a second-round match to [[Samantha Stosur]]. It was Davenport's earliest exit from a tournament since early 2003. Davenport attributed the loss to her having resumed training only three weeks prior to the start of the tournament. Davenport had re-hired [[Adam Peterson (tennis)|Adam Peterson]] as her coach, with whom she worked during her 2004–05 resurgence.

At the tournament in [[Pilot Pen Tennis|New Haven]], Davenport defeated world no. 1 [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the quarterfinals, but was forced to retire with a right shoulder injury while playing [[Justine Henin]] in the final.

Despite injury, Davenport reached the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarterfinals, where she again lost to Henin.

Davenport's last competitive match before the December announcement of her pregnancy was a quarterfinal loss in [[China Open (tennis)|Beijing]] to top-ranked Mauresmo. It was Mauresmo's first win over Davenport after nine consecutive losses.

===2007===
On July 18, 2007, Davenport announced that she would return to the [[WTA Tour]]. At her first tournament, she partnered with [[Lisa Raymond]] in the doubles competition at [[Pilot Pen Tennis|New Haven]], where they lost in the first round to top seeds [[Cara Black]] and [[Liezel Huber]].

Davenport returned to singles competition in [[Wismilak International|Bali]], where she won her first title since 2005, defeating [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in the final.

Davenport and her partner Hantuchová also advanced to the semifinals in Bali, before withdrawing from the tournament.

Davenport's second tournament was in [[China Open (tennis)|Beijing]], where she defeated fourth-seeded Russian [[Elena Dementieva]] in the quarterfinals, before losing to Janković in the semifinals.

Davenport's third tournament was in [[Bell Challenge|Quebec City, Canada]], defeating second-seeded [[Vera Zvonareva]] in the semifinals and [[Julia Vakulenko]] in the final. This was Davenport's 53rd career singles title and lifted her to no. 73 in the WTA rankings.

===2008===
Davenport won the [[2008 ASB Classic|ASB Classic]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, the first [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tour event of the year. Davenport defeated [[Aravane Rezaï]] in the final. This raised her ranking to world no. 52. She was the only player in the WTA top 100 that had fewer than 10 tournaments counting towards her world ranking.

At the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, Davenport lost in the second round to eventual champion [[Maria Sharapova]], 1–6, 3–6. This was the first time that Davenport had lost to Sharapova in straight sets.

On January 14, 2008, Davenport surpassed [[Steffi Graf]] in career prize money earned on the women's tour, garnering a total of US$21,897,501.

In March, Davenport won her second tournament of the year and 55th career singles title by beating [[Olga Govortsova]] in the final of the [[2008 Cellular South Cup|Regions Morgan Keegan Championships & The Cellular South Cup]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. She tied [[Virginia Wade]] for seventh place on the list of most singles titles won during the [[Tennis open era|open era]]. Davenport also teamed with [[Lisa Raymond]] to win the doubles title.

At the [[Tier I]] [[2008 Pacific Life Open|Pacific Life Open]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], Davenport lost in the quarterfinals to [[Jelena Janković]], 6–2, retired.

In her first clay-court tournament since 2005, Davenport reached the semifinals of the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island, Florida]], where she defaulted her match with Sharapova before it began, due to illness. Citing undisclosed personal reasons, Davenport withdrew from the [[2008 French Open|French Open]] five days before the tournament began.
