'''Vincent Kennedy McMahon''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|k|ˈ|m|æ|n}}; born August 24, 1945) is an American [[professional wrestling]] promoter and executive, [[American football]] executive, and [[media proprietor]] currently serving as the chairman and CEO of [[WWE]], and the founder and owner of Alpha Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alphaentllc.com/#vince|title=Alpha Entertainment LLC|website=www.alphaentllc.com}}</ref>

McMahon was born in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]], and graduated from [[East Carolina University]] with a degree in business in 1968. He worked for the WWE for [[Vincent J. McMahon|his father]] as a commentator and he assumed control of the company in 1982; McMahon saw the [[1980s wrestling boom|commercial potential of monopolizing the industry]], which previously operated as separate fiefdoms across the United States. This led to the development of the annual [[WrestleMania]], which has since become the [[Pay-per-view#PPV_home_television|most successful professional wrestling event]] in history. He faced stiff [[Monday Night Wars|industry competition]] from [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the 1990s, but eventually purchased the company in 2001 after a long power struggle, and also purchased the assets of the defunct [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in 2006.

McMahon has embarked on a number of [[WWE#Subsidiaries|WWE-related ventures]]; in 2014, he launched the [[WWE Network]], an [[Over-the-top media services|over-the-top]] video [[streaming service]]. McMahon also owns other WWE subsidiaries related to [[multimedia]] such as [[WWE Studios|film]], [[WWE Music Group|music]], and [[WWE Magazine|magazines]], as well as a [[WWE Performance Center|professional wrestling school system]]. Outside of wrestling, McMahon joint-owned and operated the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], a football league, twice; [[XFL (2020)|both iterations]] folded after a single season. He also headed the short-lived [[World Bodybuilding Federation]], and co-owns the clothing brand [[Tapout (clothing brand)|Tapout]].

McMahon also worked as a professional wrestler and personality known by the [[ring name]] '''Mr. McMahon''', using a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] based on his real-life persona. He was the broadcast color commentator and chief broadcaster until 1997, and is a two-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]], a [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] match winner, and has headlined multiple [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE pay-per-view]] events. He is the eldest living member of the [[McMahon family]], and is a third-generation wrestling promoter, following his grandfather [[Jess McMahon|Jess]] and father [[Vincent J. McMahon|Vincent]]. He married political executive [[Linda McMahon|Linda Edwards]] in 1966, and is the father of businesspeople [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Shane McMahon]], and father-in-law to [[Triple H]].

== Business career ==
=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1969–1979) ===
McMahon first met the promoter for [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (CWC), his father [[Vincent J. McMahon]], at the age of 12. At that point, McMahon became interested in following his father's professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to [[Madison Square Garden]]. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.<ref name="DVD"/>

In 1968, McMahon graduated from [[East Carolina University]]<ref name="Roderick"/> with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father's [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] promotion. In 1969, McMahon made his debut as an in-ring announcer for the WWWF's ''[[List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974–1986)|All-Star Wrestling]]''.<ref name="McMahonFamily">{{cite book|last=Kaelberer|first=Angie Peterson|title=The McMahons: Vince McMahon and Family|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/mcmahonsvincemcm0000kael/page/15 15]|isbn=0-7368-2143-0|url=https://archive.org/details/mcmahonsvincemcm0000kael/page/15}}</ref> In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after he replaced Ray Morgan in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.

Throughout the 1970s, McMahon became the prominent force in his father's company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPCGDAAAQBAJ&q=inoki+vs+ali+vince+mcmahon+jr&pg=PA152|title=Ali vs. Inoki: The Forgotten Fight That Inspired Mixed Martial Arts and Launched Sports Entertainment|first=Josh|last=Gross|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|isbn=9781942952206|via=Google Books}}</ref> He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The younger McMahon was also behind the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus [[Antonio Inoki]] match of 1976.<ref name="books.google.com"/> In 1979, the younger McMahon and his wife [[Linda McMahon|Linda]] founded their own company, [[WWE#Titan Sports|Titan Sports]], which was incorporated in the following year,<ref name="WWEBoard">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/governance/board.jsp |title=WWE Board of Directors |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924084351/http://corporate.wwe.com/governance/board.jsp |archive-date=September 24, 2009 }}</ref> and in 1982 acquired control of the CWC from his ailing father (who died in May 1984).

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE ===
==== 1980s wrestling boom ====
{{main|1980s professional wrestling boom}}
On February 21, 1980, McMahon officially founded Titan Sports, and the company's headquarters were established in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]], using the now-defunct [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] as a home base for the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ctnews.com/politicalcapitol/2010/09/30/a-few-loose-ends-from-the-mcmahon-bankruptcy-story/|title=A few loose ends from the McMahon bankruptcy story|date=October 1, 2010}}</ref> At the time of his purchase of the WWF, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions. The various promoters shared an understanding that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitecore.ca/superstar/index.php?threadid=68183|title=KM : Reading Topic : WWF NATIONAL EXPANSION}}</ref> McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] a second time, after initially splitting from them in 1963 before rejoining them in 1971. The NWA was the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan.

He began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company's Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). In 1984, he recruited [[Hulk Hogan]] to be the WWF's charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. Nevertheless, McMahon (who still also fronted as the WWF's squeaky clean babyface announcer) created ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'' by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines. As a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], available on [[closed circuit television]] in various markets throughout the U.S.

During the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who had never before paid attention to pro wrestling. By directing his storylines towards highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on [[pay-per-view]] television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]] (which was called the "biggest crowd in sports-entertainment history") for [[WrestleMania III]], which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan versus [[André the Giant]].<ref name="corporatebio">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |title=Vince McMahon's biography |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |publisher=WWE Corporate |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215125621/http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |archive-date=December 15, 2007 }}</ref>

==== Attitude Era ====
{{main|Attitude Era}}
After struggling against [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), McMahon cemented the WWF as the preeminent wrestling promotion in the late 1990s when he initiated a new brand strategy that eventually returned the WWF to prominence. Sensing a public shift towards a more hardened and cynical fan base, McMahon redirected storylines towards a more adult-oriented model. The concept became known as "WWF Attitude", and McMahon commenced the new era when he manipulated the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] away from [[Bret Hart]] at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in what is now known as the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]."<ref name="Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1997/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1997 main event (Montreal Screwjob)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> McMahon, who for years had downplayed his ownership of the company and was mostly known as a commentator, became involved in WWF storylines as the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mr. McMahon, who began a legendary feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who challenged the boss's authority. As a result, the WWF suddenly found itself back in national pop-culture, drawing millions of viewers for its weekly ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' broadcasts, which ranked among the highest-rated shows on cable television.<ref name="corporatebio"/>

In October 1999, McMahon led the WWF in an [[initial public offering]] of company stock. McMahon acquired the fading [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) from [[Turner Broadcasting System]] on March 23, 2001, bringing an end to the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref>{{cite web|title= WWF buys rival WCW |url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/03/23/deals/wwf/|accessdate=March 12, 2016|website=CNN Money|date=March 23, 2001}}</ref> On April 1, 2001, [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) filed for bankruptcy, leaving WWF as the last major wrestling promotion at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott|page=[https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139 139]|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0275984014|url=https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139}}</ref> McMahon later acquired the assets of ECW on January 28, 2003.<ref name="scribd.com">https://www.scribd.com/doc/305765539/WWE-acquires-ECW-Assets-HHG-Corporation</ref>

===Company name change===
On May 5, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to '''World Wrestling Entertainment''' (WWE) after the company lost a lawsuit initiated by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] over the WWF trademark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contracts.onecle.com/wwe/wwf.settle.1994.01.20.shtml|title=World Wildlife Fund and Titan Sports, Inc. legal settlement|publisher=Contracts.onecle.com|date=January 20, 1994|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> Although initially caused by an unfavorable ruling in its [[WWE#WWF name dispute|dispute]] with the World Wildlife Fund regarding the "WWF" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.<ref name=GetFOut>{{cite web|title=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Drops The "F" To Emphasize the "E" for Entertainment, WWE also must censor the old WWF logo on any DVDs and merchandise.|publisher=WWE.com|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2002/2002_05_06.jsp|accessdate=August 28, 2006}}</ref>

=== Other business dealings ===
[[File:Ron Killings & Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|McMahon sharing a joke with [[Ron Killings]] at the 2008 ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]]'' event]]
In 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] and the [[Cape Cod Buccaneers]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (1981–87)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]]. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts, including [[Van Halen]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]], in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a great benefit to WWE's success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=2013 |title=WWE 50 |page=33}}</ref>

In 1990, McMahon founded the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dilbert|first=Ryan|title=Vince McMahon's Failed Attempt to Take over Bodybuilding|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2542941-vince-mcmahons-failed-attempt-to-take-over-bodybuilding|work=Salon.com|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}</ref> The organization folded in 1992.

In 2000, McMahon again ventured outside the world of professional wrestling by launching the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], a professional [[American football]] league. The league began in February 2001, with McMahon making an appearance at the first game. It folded after one season due to low television ratings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boehlert|first=Eric|title=Why the XFL tanked |url=http://entertainment.salon.com/2001/05/11/xfl_demise/|work=Salon.com|date=May 11, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2014, McMahon helped launch an [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] streaming service called the [[WWE Network]].

In 2017, McMahon established and personally funded Alpha Entertainment, a separate entity from WWE. On January 25, 2018, he announced the [[XFL (2020)|resurrection of the XFL]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alpha Entertainment LLC| url=https://www.alphaentllc.com/#vince| website= Alphaentllc.com|date=January 25, 2018| accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> The league filed for bankruptcy on April 13, 2020.<ref name=seekingbuyer>{{cite news|title=XFL Files for Bankruptcy, Up for Sale|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/vince-mcmahons-xfl-files-bankruptcy-up-sale-1290073|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>

== Professional wrestling career ==
{{Kayfabe|section=yes|date=July 2019}}

=== World Wide/World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===
==== Commentator (1971–1997) ====
Before the evolution of the Mr. McMahon character, McMahon was primarily seen as a [[sports commentator|commentator]] on television, with his behind-the-scenes involvement generally kept off TV for [[kayfabe]]-based reasons. While he did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on TV his ownership of the WWF was considered an [[open secret]] through the mid-1990s. Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of him.

McMahon made his commentary debut in 1971 when he replaced Ray Morgan after Morgan had a pay dispute with McMahon's father, [[Vincent J. McMahon]], shortly before a scheduled TV taping. The elder McMahon let Morgan walk instead of giving in to his demands and needed a replacement on the spot, offering it to his son. For the younger McMahon, it was also somewhat of a compromise, as it allowed him to appear on television. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.<ref name="DVD">''McMahon'' DVD</ref>

McMahon eventually became the regular play-by-play commentator and maintained that role until November 1997, portraying himself as easily excited and over-the-top. In addition to matches, McMahon also hosted other WWF shows, and introduced WWF programming to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on [[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]], upon the WWF's acquisition of [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and its lucrative [[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday night timeslot]] (McMahon sold the timeslot to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] after the move backfired on him and he eventually acquired JCP's successor company, [[World Championship Wrestling]], from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] in 2001). At the [[Slammy Award|1987 Slammy Awards]], McMahon performed in a musical number and sang the song "Stand Back".<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2008/12/07/7661906.html|title=Bringing back Slammy Awards – a good, bad idea|author=Bishop, Matt and Matt Mackinder|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=December 9, 2008|date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> The [[Camp (style)|campy]] "Stand Back" video has since resurfaced several times over the years as a [[running gag]] between McMahon and any [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestler he is feuding with at that particular time, and was included on the 2006 ''McMahon'' DVD.<ref name="DVD"/>

As with most play-by-play commentators, McMahon was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] "voice of the fans", in contrast to the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[color commentator]], usually [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Bobby Heenan]] or [[Jerry Lawler]]. While most of McMahon's on-screen physicality took place during his "Mr. McMahon" character later in his career, he was involved in physical altercations on WWF television only a few times as a commentator or host; in 1977, when he and [[Arnold Skaaland]] were struck from behind by [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]] (as part of a kayfabe "Manager Of the Year" storyline, when Albano was disgruntled over losing to Skaaland); in 1985, when [[Andre the Giant]] grabbed him by the collar during an interview on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'' (Andre had become irritated at McMahon's questions regarding his feud with [[Big John Studd]] and their match at [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]]); on the September 28, 1991 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', when [[Roddy Piper]] mistakenly hit him with a folding chair aimed at [[Ric Flair]] (requiring McMahon to be taken out of the arena on a [[stretcher]]), and again on the November 8, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', when [[Randy Savage]] hurled him to the floor in an attempt to attack [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] after McMahon attempted to restrain him. McMahon can also be seen screaming at medics and WWF personnel during the May 26, 1990 episode of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'' (after Hulk Hogan was attacked by [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] during a segment of ''The Brother Love Show''), when Hogan was not moved out of the arena quickly enough.

==== Start of the Mr. McMahon character (1996–1997) ====
{{see also|Montreal Screwjob}}
Throughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company's lead play-by-play commentator. On the September 23, 1996 ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', [[Jim Ross]] delivered a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as [[chairman]] and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines. This was followed up on the October 23 ''Raw'' with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] referring to then-WWF President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] as "just a puppet" and that it was McMahon "pulling all the strings". The March 17, 1997 ''WWF Raw Is War'' is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, as after [[Bret Hart]] lost to [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]] in a steel cage match for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]], Hart engaged in an [[Profanity|expletive]]-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview. McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler.<ref name="DVD" />

McMahon largely remained a commentator after the Bret Hart incident on ''Raw''. On September 22, 1997, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Bret's brother [[Owen Hart]] was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered the ring with five [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers following and assaulted Hart. When it appeared Austin would fight the officers, McMahon ran into the ring to lecture him that he could not physically compete; at the time, Austin was recovering from a broken neck after Owen Hart [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] in his match against Austin at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]]. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.

At [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in 1997, [[Bret Hart]] defended his WWF Championship against long-time rival [[Shawn Michaels]] in the main event. During the match, Michaels applied Hart's signature [[Professional wrestling holds|submission maneuver]] [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|The Sharpshooter]] on Hart. Though Hart did not submit, McMahon ordered the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] to ring the bell, thus [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwing]] Hart out of the title and making Michaels the champion and making McMahon turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time on WWF television. This incident was subsequently dubbed the "Montreal Screwjob".<ref name="Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart" /> Following the incident, McMahon left the commentary table for good ([[Jim Ross]] replaced McMahon as lead commentator) and the Mr. McMahon character began.

==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997–1999) ====
{{main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporate Ministry|l1=The Corporation}}In December 1997 on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', the night after [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself. Mr. McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental championship against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] in a rematch. As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the [[Nation of Domination]] gang. Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead, Austin gave The Rock a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.

On the January 19, 1998 episode of Raw Is War, McMahon called [[Mike Tyson]] to the ring for a major announcement. Before McMahon could make the announcement (that Tyson would serve as a ringside enforcer at [[Wrestlemania XIV]] for the WWE World title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels) Austin interrupted and confronted Tyson culminating with Austin displaying his middle finger right in Tyson's face. Tyson shoved Austin at which point WWE security and Tyson's entourage intervened and separated both men. McMahon was incensed by Austin's actions screaming "YOU RUINED IT" and had to be held back from attacking Austin himself.

On the March 2 edition of Raw Is War, Mike Tyson joined [[D-Generation X]], led by WWE World Champion Shawn Michaels. A week later, Austin called out McMahon incensed by Tyson's alignment with Michaels. Austin verbally abused McMahon and attempted to provoke an agitated McMahon into hitting him (Austin) but McMahon left. On the following episode of Raw Is War, McMahon claimed he hadn't hit Austin on the previous episode of Raw as he didn't want to ruin the Wrestlemania XIV main event. Asked to explain what this meant, McMahon stated Austin would be unable to compete with a broken jaw. After initial attempts to dodge the question of whether he wanted Austin to become WWF Champion, McMahon finally answered with "it's not just a "no", it's an OH HELL NO" mimicking Austin's "hell yeah" catchphrase. McMahon didn't get involved during the Wrestlemania XIV main event during which Mike Tyson turned on Shawn Michaels and assisted Austin in becoming WWE Champion.

On the March 30 ''Raw Is War'', the night after Austin won the WWF title at WrestleMania XIV, McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature. Austin responded by delivering the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to McMahon for the second time. On the April 13 episode of Raw Is War, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] interfered. This marked the first time since June 10, 1996, that [[Monday Night Wars|''Raw'' beat WCW's ''Nitro'' in the ratings]]. This led to a title match between Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], for which McMahon sat ringside and attempted to assist Love in winning the match. Love ultimately did win by disqualification when Austin hit McMahon with a chair. Austin retained the title which couldn't change hands by disqualification under regular match rules. In a title rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]], Austin again retained, despite McMahon being the referee and his "Corporate Stooges", [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. While McMahon was incapacitated by an accidental Love chair shot, Austin delivered the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Love and used McMahon's hand to count his pinfall victory.

In the fall of 1998, McMahon said he was "damn sick and tired" of seeing Stone Cold Steve Austin as the WWF Champion and developed a "master plan" to remove the championship from Austin. By employing the services of [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]], McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF championship at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], in which Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after being pinned simultaneously by both Undertaker and Kane. However, no new champion was crowned. The following night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] into the arena and attacked McMahon before police officers stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at [[WWE Judgment Day#1998|Judgment Day]] between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special referee]]. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]] behind their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980928.html|title=WWF RAW is WAR 28.9.98|first=Christopher|last=Zimmerman|publisher=Slash Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>

At Judgement Day, there was still no champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a [[Professional wrestling tournament|14-man tournament]] named [[Survivor Series (1998)#Tournaments bracket|Deadly Games]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in 1998. McMahon made sure that [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] reached the finals because Mankind had visited McMahon in the hospital after McMahon was sent to the hospital by [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]].<ref name="Survivor Series - The Rock vs Mankind">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1998/1998/|title=Survivor Series 1998 main event|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> He also awarded Mankind the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] due to his status as a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore wrestling legend]]. Originally, McMahon was acting as he if he was helping out Mankind during the match. At one point, The Rock turned his attention to McMahon. McMahon [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Mankind after a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwjob]], however, as The Rock had caught Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]]. Mankind had not submitted but McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, thus giving The Rock the WWF Championship.

McMahon restarted a long-running feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when, in December 1998, he made Austin face the Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with the Royal Rumble qualification on the line. Austin defeated the Undertaker with help from Kane. McMahon had put up $100,000 to anyone who could eliminate Austin from the Royal Rumble match.<ref name="Royal Rumble - 1999 Rumble match">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/mainevent/|title=1999 Royal Rumble match|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> At [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]], thanks to help from the Corporation's attack on Austin in the women's bathroom during the match (Austin and McMahon went under the ropes, not over them as the Royal Rumble rules require for elimination to occur along with the 'Shawn Michaels Rule', in which both feet must touch the floor after going over the top rope) and The Rock distracting Austin, McMahon lifted Austin over the top rope from behind, thus winning the match and earning a title shot at [[WrestleMania XV]] against the WWF Champion The Rock. He turned down his spot, however, and WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels awarded it to Austin, which infuriated McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|first=Christopher |last=Zimmerman |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999/raw012599 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209100552/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1999%2Fraw012599 |archive-date=February 9, 2008 |title=RAW is WAR recap |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=January 25, 1999 |publisher=The Other Arena |url-status=dead }}</ref> Austin decided to put his title shot on the line against McMahon so he could get a chance to fight Vince at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|In Your House: St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]].

The Corporation started a feud with [[The Undertaker]]'s new faction the "[[Ministry of Darkness]]", which led to a storyline introducing McMahon's daughter [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]]. Stephanie played an "innocent sweet girl" who was kidnapped by The Ministry twice. The first time she was kidnapped, she was found by [[Ken Shamrock]] on behalf of McMahon in a basement of the stadium. The second time she was kidnapped, The Undertaker attempted to marry her whilst she was forcefully tied to the Ministry's crucifix, but she was saved by Steve Austin. This angle saw a brief friendship develop between McMahon and Austin, cooling their long-running feud. McMahon became a member of the short-lived stable [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], during May 1999. McMahon's son Shane merged the Corporation with Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. On the June 7 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon was revealed as the "Higher Power" behind the Corporate Ministry. This not only reignited McMahon's feud with WWF Champion Austin but also caused a [[kayfabe]] disgusted [[Linda McMahon|Linda]] and Stephanie McMahon to give their 50% share of the WWF to Austin.

At [[King of the Ring (1999)|King of the Ring]], Vince and Shane defeated Austin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap]] [[ladder match]] to regain control of the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#1999|title=King of the Ring 1999 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> While CEO, Austin had scheduled a WWF Championship match, to be shown on ''Raw Is War'' after King Of The Ring. During the match, Austin defeated the Undertaker once again to become the WWF Champion. At [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]], Austin was again scheduled for a match against The Undertaker. If Austin lost, he would be banned from wrestling for the WWF Championship again; if he won, Vince McMahon would be banned from appearing on WWF TV. Austin defeated The Undertaker, and McMahon was banned from WWF TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/loaded.html#99|title=Fully Loaded 1999 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref>

McMahon returned as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] in the fall of 1999 and won the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] in a match against [[Triple H]], thanks to outside interference from Austin on the September 16 ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. He had decided to vacate the title during the following Monday's ''Raw Is War'' because he was not allowed on WWF TV because of the stipulations of the Fully Loaded 1999 contract he signed. However, Stone Cold Steve Austin reinstated him in return for a WWF title shot. Over the next few months, McMahon and Triple H feuded, with the linchpin of the feud being Triple H's storyline marriage to Stephanie McMahon. The feud culminated at [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]] in 1999; McMahon faced Triple H in a [[Hardcore wrestling|No Holds Barred match]] which McMahon lost. Afterward, Stephanie turned on him, revealing her true colors. McMahon, along with his son Shane, then disappeared from WWF television, unable to accept the union between Triple H and Stephanie. This left Triple H and Stephanie in complete control of the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/1999/results/ |title=Armageddon 1999 official results |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319104738/http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/1999/results/ |archive-date=March 19, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

==== McMahon-Helmsley Era (2000–2001) ====
{{main|McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}
McMahon returned to WWF television on the March 13, 2000 ''Raw Is War'' helping [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] win his WWF title shot back from the Big Show. He also attacked Shane McMahon and [[Triple H]].<ref name="raw2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/2000.html|title=RAW is WAR results, 2000|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Two weeks later, McMahon and The Rock defeated [[Shane McMahon]] and The [[Big Show]] in a tag team match with help from special guest referee [[Mick Foley|Mankind]].<ref name="raw2000"/> At [[WrestleMania 2000]], Triple H defended the WWF Championship in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]] in which each competitor had a McMahon in his corner.

After Big Show and Foley were eliminated, Triple H and The Rock were left. Although Vince was in The Rock's corner, he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on The Rock after [[Professional wrestling attacks#Chair shot|hitting him with a chair]], turning heel for the first time since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, which helped Triple H win the match and retain his title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/mainevent/ |title=WrestleMania 2000 main event |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221171738/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/mainevent/ |archive-date=February 21, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> This began the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction|McMahon-Helmsley Era]].

[[File:Vince kotr 2000.jpg|thumb|McMahon after losing his match at [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] in June 2000]]
At [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]], McMahon, Shane, and WWF Champion Triple H took on [[The Brothers of Destruction]] ([[The Undertaker]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]) and The Rock in a six-man tag team match for the WWF Championship. This match stipulated that whoever made the scoring pinfall would become the WWF Champion. McMahon was pinned by The Rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/kingring.html#2000|title=King of the Ring 2000 results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments}}</ref> McMahon was then absent from WWF television until late 2000. On the December 4 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon questioned the motives of WWF Commissioner Mick Foley and expressed concern of the well being of the six superstars competing in the Hell in a Cell match at [[Armageddon (2000)|Armageddon]]. On the December 18 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon faced [[Kurt Angle]] in a non-title match which was fought to no contest when Mick Foley interfered and attacked both men. After the match, both men beat Foley and McMahon fired him.<ref name="raw2000"/>

McMahon then began a public [[kayfabe|extramarital affair]] with [[Trish Stratus]], much to the disgust of his daughter, Stephanie. However, on the February 26 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon and Stephanie humiliated Trish by dumping sewage on her, with McMahon adding that Stephanie will always be "daddy's little girl" and Trish was only "daddy's little toy". McMahon and Stephanie then aligned together against Shane, who'd returned and had enough of Vince's actions in recent months. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], McMahon lost to Shane after Linda—who had been [[Psychological abuse|emotionally abused]] to the point of a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]; the breakdown was caused after Vince demanded a divorce on the December 7 episode of ''SmackDown!''; the breakdown left her helpless as she was deemed unable to continue being CEO of the WWF at the time, giving Vince 100% authority; finally, she was heavily sedated, in the storyline—hit Vince with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/ |title=WrestleMania XVII official results |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119085101/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/ |archive-date=November 19, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=9Khz-5HDsiQ#t=03m36s|title=Mcmahon vs Mcmahon – WrestleMania 17 Match Recap MV}}.

Austin and Triple H put The Rock out of action with a brutal assault and suspension; this was done so The Rock could film ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. Austin and Triple H held all three major WWF titles at the same time. The alliance was short-lived, due to an injury to Triple H and a business venture by McMahon.

==== The Invasion and brand extension (2001–2005) ====
{{main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion|WWE brand extension}}
McMahon purchased long-time rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in March 2001 from [[AOL]] [[Time Warner]] and signed many wrestlers from the organization. This marked the beginning of the Invasion storyline, in which the former WCW wrestlers regularly fought matches against the WWF wrestlers. On the July 9, 2001, episode of ''Raw Is War'', some [[List of Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni|extremists]] as well as several former ECW wrestlers on the WWF roster, joined with the WCW wrestlers to form [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] joined the Alliance, along with [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Stephanie McMahon]]. Vince McMahon led Team WWF thus turning [[Babyface (professional wrestling)|face]]. At [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]], Team WWF defeated Team Alliance in a Survivor Series elimination match to pick up the victory and end the Invasion storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 2001 main event |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326173627/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |archive-date=March 26, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Following the collapse of The Alliance, McMahon created the "Vince McMahon Kiss My Ass Club", also known as the "Mr. McMahon Kiss My Ass Club", which consisted of various WWE individuals being ordered to kiss his buttocks in the middle of the ring, usually with the threat of suspension or firing if they refused reverting to a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]. The club was originally proclaimed closed by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] after McMahon was forced to kiss [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]]'s buttocks on an episode of ''SmackDown!''.<ref name=assclub02540>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/011206.html|title=WWE SmackDown!

In November 2001, [[Ric Flair]] returned to WWF after an eight-year hiatus declaring himself the co-owner of the WWF, which infuriated McMahon. The two faced each other in January 2002, at [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]], in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Street Fight|Street Fight]] which Flair won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811413/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2002 official results|accessdate=January 16, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Due to their status as co-owners, McMahon became the owner of ''SmackDown!'' while Flair became the owner of ''Raw''.

==== Feuds with D-Generation X, Donald Trump and Bobby Lashley (2005–2007) ====
He began a feud with [[Eric Bischoff]] in late 2005, when he decided that Bischoff was not doing a good job as General Manager of ''Raw'' turning face again. He started "The Trial of Eric Bischoff" where McMahon served as the judge. Bischoff ended up losing the trial; McMahon "fired" him, and put him in a garbage truck before it drove away. Bischoff stayed gone for months. Almost a year later on ''Raw'' in late 2006, Bischoff was brought out by McMahon's executive assistant [[Jonathan Coachman]] so that he could announce the completion of his book ''[[Controversy Creates Cash]]''. Bischoff began [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Examples of "worked shoots"|blasting remarks]] at McMahon, saying that he was fired "unceremoniously" as the ''Raw'' General Manager, that there would be no McMahon if not for Bischoff's over-the-top rebellious ideas, and that [[D-Generation X]] was nothing but a rip off of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].[[File:Mrmcmahon092407.jpg|thumb|upright|left|McMahon during a ''Raw'' episode in 2007]]

In January 2007, McMahon started a feud with [[Donald Trump]], which was featured on major media outlets. Originally Trump wanted to fight McMahon himself but they came to a deal: both men would pick a representative to wrestle at [[WrestleMania 23]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]]. The man whose wrestler lost would have his head shaved bald. After the contract signing on ''Raw'', Trump pushed McMahon over the table in the ring onto his head after McMahon provoked Trump with several finger pokes to the shoulders. Later at a press conference, McMahon, during a photo opportunity, offered to shake hands with Trump but retracted his hand as Trump put out his. McMahon went on to fiddle with Trump's tie and flick Trump's nose. This angered Trump as he then slapped McMahon across the face. McMahon was then restrained from retaliating by Trump's bodyguards and [[Bobby Lashley]], Trump's representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/exclusives/pressconference|title=Billion-dollar breakdown at Trump Tower|last=Dee|first=Louie|website=WWE.com|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> At WrestleMania 23, McMahon's representative ([[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]]) lost the match.<ref name="WrestleMania 23 - Lashley vs Umaga">{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Tello|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania23/matches/39161842/results/|title=The 'mane' event|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> As a result, McMahon's hair was shaved bald by Trump and Lashley with the help of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], who was the special guest referee of the "Battle of the Billionaires" match.<ref name="WrestleMania 23 - Lashley vs Umaga"/>

McMahon then began a rivalry with Lashley over his [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Championship]]. At [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], McMahon pinned Lashley in a 3-on-1 [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] teaming up with his son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]] to win the ECW World Championship.<ref name="Backlash - Team McMahon vs Lashley">{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Robinson|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/2007/matches/396065214/results/ |title=Hell freezes over in ECW|accessdate=January 17, 2008|date=April 29, 2007|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/history/ecwchampionship/042907mcmahon|title=Mr. McMahon's first ECW Championship reign|accessdate=January 18, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> At [[Judgment Day (2007)|Judgment Day]], McMahon defended his ECW World Championship against Lashley again in a 3-on-1 handicap match.

==== Faked death, illegitimate son and Million Dollar Mania (2007–2008) ====
[[File:Flickr - simononly - WWE Fan Axxess - Vince's Limo.jpg|thumb|The exploded limousine at [[WrestleMania Axxess]] in 2012]]
On June 11, 2007, WWE aired a segment at the end of ''Raw'' that featured McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded. The show went off-air shortly after, and WWE.com reported the [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] within minutes as though it were a legitimate occurrence, proclaiming that McMahon was "presumed dead".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/mcmahonexplosionupdate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621115331/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/mcmahonexplosionupdate|archive-date=June 21, 2007|title=Feds probe crime scene|publisher=WWE|date=June 11, 2007|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}</ref> Although this was the fate of the fictional "Mr. McMahon" character, no harm came to the actual person; the "presumed death" of McMahon was part of a storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/breakingnews/20070612_12wwe_breaking.html|title=Vince McMahon's hoax goes up in smoke|last=Sweeney|first=Rory|date=June 26, 2007|website=Timesleader.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623150701/http://www.timesleader.com/news/breakingnews/20070612_12wwe_breaking.html|archive-date=June 23, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=July 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> WWE later acknowledged to [[CNBC]] that he was not truly dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/19330600|title=WWE's McMahon "Death": I'm A Murder Suspect|last=Rovell|first=Darren|date=June 20, 2007|website=CNBC.com|accessdate=July 2, 2007}}</ref>

The June 25 ''Raw'' was scheduled to be a three-hour memorial to "Mr. McMahon". However, due to the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|actual]] [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|death]] of [[Chris Benoit]], the show opened with McMahon standing in an empty arena, acknowledging that his reported death was only of his character as part of a storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usbenoit0626,0,4246396.story?coll=ny-top-headlines|title=WWE wrestler Chris Benoit and family found dead|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|date=June 26, 2007|website=Newsday.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705113805/http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usbenoit0626%2C0%2C4246396.story?coll=ny-top-headlines|archive-date=July 5, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=July 2, 2007}}</ref> This was followed by a tribute to Benoit that filled the three-hour timeslot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/benoitdead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627210219/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/benoitdead |archive-date=June 27, 2007 |title=WWE Superstar Chris Benoit found dead|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=June 25, 2007|date=June 25, 2007}}</ref> McMahon's last appearance on WWE television until August 6, 2007, was the next night on ''[[WWE ECW|ECW on Sci Fi]]'' in which after acknowledging that a tribute to Benoit had aired the previous night, he announced that there would be no further mention of Benoit [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide#World Wrestling Entertainment|due to the circumstances becoming apparent]] and that the ECW show would be dedicated to those that had been affected by the Benoit murders.

[[File:Wrestling has come a long way...down..jpg|thumb|left|McMahon commands [[Hornswoggle]] to join his "Kiss My Ass Club" in 2008]]
The "Mr. McMahon" character officially returned on the August 6 episode of ''Monday Night Raw''. McMahon said that he faked his death to see what people thought of him, with Stephanie accused of faking mourning while checking her father's last will to see how it would benefit her. He also talked about many subjects, including an investigation by the [[United States Congress]] and owing money to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. McMahon also declared a battle royal to determine a new ''Raw'' General Manager, which was won by [[William Regal]]. At the end of ''Raw'', [[Jonathan Coachman]] informed McMahon of a ([[kayfabe|storyline]]) paternity suit regarding an illegitimate long-lost child,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070806.html|title=RAW results – August&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> who was revealed in the following weeks as being a male member of the WWE roster. On the September 3 ''Raw'', McMahon appeared and was confronted by his family. They were interrupted by [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]], who claimed to be McMahon's "illegitimate son". He was himself interrupted by a lawyer claiming Kennedy was not McMahon's son and that the real son would be revealed the next week on ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070903.html|title=RAW results – September&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> His illegitimate son was finally revealed on September 10 on ''Raw'' as [[Hornswoggle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/070910.html|title=RAW results – September&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2007|accessdate=September 12, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> In February 2008, after months of "tough love" antics towards Hornswoggle, [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] revealed that Hornswoggle was not McMahon's son and that he was actually [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]]'s son. It turned out that the scam was thought up by Shane, Stephanie and Linda McMahon, along with Finlay.

[[File:Vince McMahon hof.jpg|thumb|McMahon during the 2009 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] ceremony]]
On the June 2 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that starting the next week, he would give away US$1,000,000 live on ''Raw''. Fans could register online, and each week randomly selected fans would receive a part of the $1,000,000. McMahon's Million Dollar Mania lasted just three weeks and was suspended after the 3-hour Draft episode of ''Raw'' on June 23. After giving away $500,000, explosions tore apart the ''Raw'' stage, which fell and collapsed on top of McMahon. On June 30, Shane addressed the WWE audience before ''Raw'', informing the fans that his family had chosen to keep his father's condition private. He also urged the WWE roster to stand together during what he described as a "turbulent time". The McMahons made several requests to the wrestlers for solidarity, before finally appointing [[Mike Adamle]] as the new general manager of ''Raw'' to restore order to the brand.

==== Feud with The Legacy and Bret Hart (2009–2010) ====
On the January 5, 2009 ''Raw'', [[Chris Jericho]] told Stephanie McMahon that McMahon would be returning to ''Raw'' soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/01052009/|title=Big Night In The Big Easy|accessdate=January 5, 2009|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> The following week, Jericho was ([[kayfabe]]) fired from WWE by Stephanie. On the January 19 ''Raw'', McMahon returned, as a face, and supported his daughter's decision on Jericho, but Stephanie rehired him. [[Randy Orton]] then came out and assaulted McMahon after harassing Stephanie. McMahon returned on the March 30 ''Raw'' with his son, Shane, and son-in-law Triple H to confront Orton. The night after [[WrestleMania XXV]], McMahon appeared on ''Raw'' to announce Orton would not receive another championship opportunity at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]], but compete in a six-man tag team match with his [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|Legacy]] stablemates against Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself. ''Raw'' General Manager [[Vickie Guerrero]] made the match for the WWE Championship. Orton then challenged McMahon to a match that night, in which Legacy assaulted him, and Orton also hitting him with the RKO. After being assisted by Triple H, Shane and a returning Batista, McMahon announced Batista would replace him in the match at Backlash. On the June 15 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that he had sold the ''Raw'' brand to businessman Donald Trump. The next week, during the ''Trump is Raw'' show, McMahon bought the brand back from Trump. On the June 29 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that every week, a celebrity guest host would control ''Raw'' for the night. He soon appeared on ''SmackDown'', putting [[Theodore Long]] on probation for his actions. On August 24 ''Raw'', McMahon had a birthday bash which was interrupted by The Legacy, and competed in a six-man tag team match with his long-time rival team [[D-Generation X|D-X]], in which they won after the interference of [[John Cena]]. He continued to appear on ''SmackDown'', making occasional matches and reminding Long that he is still on probation. On the November 16 ''Raw'', McMahon was called out by guest host [[Roddy Piper]], who wanted a match with McMahon that night in [[Madison Square Garden]]. McMahon declined and announced his retirement from in-ring competition.<ref name="us.wwe.com">[http://us.wwe.com/shows/raw/results/]{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}</ref>

On the January 4, 2010 ''Raw'', McMahon, once again a heel, confronted special guest host Bret "The Hitman" Hart for the (televised) first time since the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series 1997, to bury the hatchet from the above-mentioned Montreal Screwjob. The two appeared to finally bury the hatchet, but after shaking hands, Vince kicked Hart in the groin and left the arena to a loud chorus of boos and the crowd chanting "You screwed Bret! You screwed Bret!".<ref name="us.wwe.com"/> A match was then booked between the two at [[WrestleMania XXVI]], which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match. On the May 31 ''Raw'', McMahon returned to congratulate Hart on becoming the new Raw General Manager. On the June 22 ''Raw'', McMahon fired Hart for not dealing with ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' season one rookies, known as [[Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]]. That same night, he announced the new General Manager would be anonymous and make decisions via emails, which would be read by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The General Manager's first decision was McMahon to be the guest referee for a WWE Championship match that night between John Cena and [[Sheamus]]. The match was interrupted by The Nexus who then attacked McMahon. McMahon appeared in a segment on the November 1 ''Raw'', in a coma from the attack by The Nexus. He woke up and his doctor ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) explained what had happened since he had been out. The scene transitioned to Stephanie McMahon waking up, revealing [[Dream sequence|it was all a dream]].

==== Sporadic appearances (2011–present) ====
In early 2011, McMahon once again stepped away from WWE storylines to focus on both his corporate and backstage duties.

On the June 27 episode of ''Raw'', [[CM Punk]] made a scathing on-air speech criticizing WWE and McMahon about the way WWE was run. McMahon suspended Punk but reinstated him at the behest of Punk's [[Money in the Bank (2011)|Money in the Bank]] opponent, WWE Champion John Cena. At the pay-per-view, McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations [[John Laurinaitis]] interfered on Cena's behalf but Punk was ultimately successful and walked out of the company with the championship. On the following ''Raw'', Triple H returned and, on behalf of WWE's board of directors, fired McMahon from his position of running ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', though leaving him chairman of the board. Triple H then announced he had been designated Chief Operating Officer of WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-07-18/mcmahon-relieved-of-duties|title=McMahon Released |accessdate=July 16, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> McMahon returned on the October 10 ''Raw'', firing Triple H from running ''Raw'', stating the board of directors had called Triple H a financial catastrophe, and that the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE employees]] had voted [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]] in him the previous week. He subsequently appointed Laurinaitis as the interim general manager of ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-10-10/results|title=WWE Raw SuperShow results: The "Laurinaitis Era" begins|accessdate=October 12, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref>

On June 11, 2012, McMahon returned to give a job evaluation to John Laurinaitis. After a conflict with Cena and Big Show that saw McMahon accidentally knocked out by Big Show, McMahon declared that if Big Show lost his match at [[No Way Out (2012)|No Way Out]], Laurinaitis would be fired. Cena defeated Big Show in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], and McMahon fired Laurinaitis. McMahon announced [[AJ Lee|AJ]] as ''Raw''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s new general manager at ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' and made Booker T SmackDown's new general manager on August 3 episode of ''SmackDown''. After CM Punk interrupted him on the October 8 episode of ''Raw'', he challenged Punk to a match, threatening to fire him if he declined. The match did not officially start, but McMahon held his own in a brawl with Punk until Punk attempted the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Go to Sleep|GTS]]. Ryback and Cena interfered and McMahon ultimately booked Punk in a match with Ryback at [[Hell in a Cell (2012)|Hell in a Cell]].

During the buildup for the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], McMahon told CM Punk that if [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] interfered in his match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Punk would forfeit his title. During the match, the lights went out and Rock was attacked by what appeared to be The Shield, leading to Rock's loss. Vince came out and restarted the match at Rock's request and Rock was victorious. The next night on ''Raw'', while conducting a performance review on [[Paul Heyman]], he was assaulted by the returning [[Brock Lesnar]], who attacked him with the [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]]. According to WWE.com, McMahon broke his pelvis and required surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-01-28/mr-mcmahon-injury-update-after-brock-lesnar-attack-26088187|title=Mr. McMahon suffers broken pelvis due to Brock Lesnar attack|publisher=WWE.com|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> Vince sought revenge on Heyman and faced him in a street fight on the February 25 episode of ''Raw'', but Lesnar again interfered, only for Triple H to interfere as well, setting up a rematch between Lesnar and Triple H at [[WrestleMania 29]]. From June 2013, members of the [[McMahon family]] began to dispute various elements of the control of WWE, such as the fates of [[Daniel Bryan]], and of ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' General Managers [[Brad Maddox]] and [[Vickie Guerrero]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-smackdown-results/42724-wwe-smackdown-results-7-19-13-new-smackdown-gm|title=WWE SMACKDOWN RESULTS - 7/19/13 (NEW SMACKDOWN GM)|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=July 19, 2013|last=Tedesco|first=Mike}}</ref> After Triple H and Stephanie created [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]], McMahon celebrated [[Randy Orton]]'s victory at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2013)|TLC]] with them, but stepped aside from his on-screen authority role in early 2014 to evaluate Triple H and Stephanie's control of the company.

McMahon returned on the November 3, 2014, episode of ''Raw'', making a stipulation that if Team Cena had defeated Team Authority at [[Survivor Series (2014)|Survivor Series]], The Authority would be removed from power.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=CALDWELL'S WWE RAW RESULTS 11/3: Complete "virtual-time" coverage of live Raw - VKM returns on 3 Hour & 38 Minute Show, Rollins vs. Orton, U.S. Title match on WWE Network, more|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwerawreport/article_81616.shtml#.VFigNfnF9ps|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> Team Cena won the match, but McMahon gave John Cena the option to reinstate The Authority.

McMahon granted Reigns a rematch for the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Sheamus]], with the stipulation that if he failed to win the championship he would be fired.

On the February 22, episode of ''Raw'', McMahon presented the first-ever "Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence" Award to Stephanie before being interrupted [[Shane McMahon]], who returned to WWE for the first time in over six years, confronting his father and sister, and claiming that he wanted control of ''Raw''. This led to Vince book Shane against The Undertaker at [[WrestleMania 32]] in a Hell in a Cell match with the stipulation that if Shane won, he would have full control of ''Raw'' and The Undertaker would be banned from competing in any future WrestleMania.<ref name="Raw2222016">{{cite web|last1=Tedesco|first1=Mike|title=WWE RAW Results - 2/22/16 (Shane McMahon returns)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/57868-wwe-raw-results-2-22-16-live-results-from-detroit|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref> On the April 4 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon gloated about Shane's loss at WrestleMania the previous night, before Shane came out, accepted his defeat and said goodbye, leading McMahon to allow Shane to run that nights show, after feeling upstaged by his son. After Shane ran ''Raw'' for the rest of April, at [[Payback (2016)|Payback]], McMahon announced Shane and Stephanie had joint control.

On the April 3, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon returned to announce [[Kurt Angle]] as the new Raw General Manager and the upcoming [[2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/77098-wwe-raw-results-april-3-wrestlemania/|title=WWE RAW Results - 4/3/17 (Night after WrestleMania 33) - WWE News and Results, RAW and Smackdown Results, TNA News, ROH News|first=Mike|last=Tedesco|date=April 3, 2017}}</ref>

On September 5, it was announced that McMahon would make an appearance on the September 12 episode of ''SmackDown Live''. At the end of that night as a [[Babyface (professional wrestling)|face]], McMahon confronted [[Kevin Owens]], who was unhappy about Vince's son Shane attacking him the week before, which resulted in Shane being suspended. McMahon was furious about the heinous words regarding his family, and how Owens was not respectful, and how he planned to prosecute everybody who wronged him. McMahon warned him that his lawsuit would result in him being fired, but McMahon has the cash to deal with that empty threat. This prompted Owens to say Shane put his hands on him, but McMahon said he suspended Shane for not finishing off Owens. Shane was then reinstated to face Owens at the ''Hell in a Cell'' pay-per-view. Owens then attacked McMahon, leaving him lying in the ring. Even with several referees present, Owens continued to attack McMahon, and splashed down on him from atop one of the ring posts, resulting in McMahon being ([[kayfabe]]) injured. [[Stephanie McMahon]] also returned to help her father, as he was attended to by WWE officials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0912/632078/wwe-smackdown-live-results/|title=WWE SmackDown Results - Vince McMahon Attacked, Three Title Matches, New Champions Crowned, More - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}</ref>

On January 22, 2018, McMahon returned on ''[[Raw 25 Years]]'' to address the WWE Universe, only to later turn on them by calling them "cheap" turning heel once again. He was later confronted, and [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|stunnered]], by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. On March 12, McMahon made an appearance in a backstage segment with [[Roman Reigns]], announcing that Reigns would be suspended for his recent actions. On SmackDown 1000 McMahon returned as face once again after dancing on TruthTV.

McMahon returned once again to WWE television on the December 17, 2018, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', accompanied by his son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]], daughter [[Stephanie McMahon]], and his son-in-law [[Triple H]], promising to shake things up as they admitted they weren't performing as well as they should have. McMahon announced that the four of them would now [[kayfabe|''run'']] both ''Monday Night Raw'' and ''SmackDown Live'' collectively. In early 2019, McMahon entered in the feud between [[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Kofi Kingston]], not letting that latter receive a [[WWE Championship|WWE championship]] match at [[WrestleMania 35|WrestleMania]].

McMahon returned to WWE television on the April 24, 2020, episode of ''[[Friday Night Smackdown|Friday Night SmackDown]]'', in celebration of [[Triple H]]'s 25th anniversary in the WWE.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.givemesport.com/1564745-wwe-news-vince-mcmahon-and-shawn-michaels-appear-on-smackdown-to-celebrate-triple-h|title=WWWE news: Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels appear on Smackdown to 'celebrate' Triple Hs 25th Anniversary - Vince McMahon - givemesport.com|work=givemesport.com|access-date=2020-04-25|language=en}}</ref>

=== United States Wrestling Association (1993) ===
While the Mr. McMahon character marked the first time that McMahon had been portrayed as a villain in WWF, in 1993, McMahon was engaged in a feud with [[Jerry Lawler]] as part of a cross-promotion between the WWF and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). As part of the angle, McMahon sent various WWF wrestlers to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to dethrone Lawler as the "king of professional wrestling". This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside. During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF, and the feud was not acknowledged on WWF television, as the two continued to provide commentary together (along with [[Randy Savage]]) for the television show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''. The feud also helped build toward Lawler's match with [[Bret Hart]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1993/|title=SummerSlam 1993 official results|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The peak of the angle came with [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]] defeating Lawler to win the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship|USWA Championship]] with McMahon gloating at Lawler while wearing the championship belt.<ref name="tatankabio">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Chavis|url=http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html|title=Tatanka's Biography (Page 2)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=Native Tatanka |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226140653/http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = December 26, 2007}}</ref> This storyline came to an abrupt end when Lawler was accused of raping a young girl in Memphis, and he was dropped from the WWF. He returned shortly afterward, however, as the girl later stated that the rape accusations were lies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/faq/?article=jerrylawler | title=Jerry Lawler – FAQ  | publisher=Wrestleview}}</ref>

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
McMahon's on-screen persona is known for his throaty exclamation of "You're fired!", and his "power walk"—an exaggerated strut toward the ring, swinging his arms and bobbing his head from side to side in a cocky manner. According to [[Jim Cornette]], the power walk was inspired by one of McMahon's favorite wrestlers as a child, [[Dr. Jerry Graham]]. [[The Fabulous Moolah]], however, claims in her autobiography that [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]] was the inspiration for the walk.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=60}}</ref> McMahon has occasionally dropped his character performance upon real-life events affecting WWE, such as the death of [[Owen Hart]] at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] in 1999, the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center and the [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide|death]] of [[Chris Benoit]]. Generally speaking, the character has been portrayed as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], though on occasion the character has been a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] as well.

His finishers consisted of the ''Pedigree'' ([[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Double underhook facebuster]]), which was adopted from [[Triple H]], ''People's Elbow / Corporate Elbow'' ([[Feint]] [[leg drop]] transitioned into a high impact [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drop]] to the opponent's chest, with theatrics) (taken from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]), the [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running jumping guillotine leg drop]] (parodied from [[Hulk Hogan]]) and the ''McStunner/Mr. McMahon Stunner'' ([[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Three-quarter facelock jawbreaker]]) inherited from [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

== Other media ==
In 2001, McMahon was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' and performed an interview with his son Shane for the second issue of the magazine that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Playboy Interview: Vince McMahon |magazine=Playboy |pages=55–68 |date=February 2001}}</ref> In March 2006, at age 60, McMahon was featured on the cover of ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' magazine. In August 2006, ''McMahon'', a two-disc DVD set showcasing McMahon's career was released. The box art symbolizes the blurred reality between Vince McMahon the person and Mr. McMahon the character. ''McMahon'' features profiling of the Mr. McMahon character, such as the rivalries with wrestlers, on-screen firings, and antics. The DVD includes Vince's business life, such as acquiring WCW and ECW and the demise of the XFL. McMahon's top nine matches of his professional wrestling career are included in ''McMahon''. In March 2015, at age 69, McMahon once again appeared on the cover of ''Muscle & Fitness'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/interviews/wwe-chief-vince-mcmahon-still-making-gains|title=WWE Chief Vince McMahon Is Still Making Gains}}</ref>

=== Family ===
{{Main|McMahon family}}
McMahon married [[Linda McMahon]] on August 26, 1966, in [[New Bern, North Carolina]]. The two met in church when Linda was 13 and Vince was 16. At that time, McMahon was known as Vince Lupton, using his stepfather's surname. They were introduced by Vince's mother, Vicky H. Lupton (now Vicky H. Askew). They have two children, [[Shane McMahon|Shane]] and [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]], both of whom have spent time in the WWF/E both onscreen and behind the scenes. Shane left the company on January 1, 2010 (later returning in 2016), while Stephanie continues to be active in a backstage role and onscreen.

McMahon also has an older brother, Roderick James McMahon III, who is not involved in the wrestling industry.

McMahon has six grandchildren: Declan James, Kenyon Jesse, and Rogan Henry McMahon, sons of Shane and his wife [[Marissa Mazzola-McMahon|Marissa]]; and Aurora Rose, Murphy Claire, and Vaughn Evelyn Levesque, daughters of Stephanie and her husband [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rxmuscle.com/hmr-radio-show/2424-jefftheproducer-hmr.html|title=Heavy Muscle Radio/Access Bodybuilding: (1-3-11):TRIPLE H!

=== Rape and harassment allegations ===
On April 3, 1992, Rita Chatterton, a former [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly in professional wrestling history),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sexliesheadlocks00shau/page/116|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|last1=Assael|first1=Shaun|last2=Mooneyham|first2=Mike|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0609606905|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexliesheadlocks00shau/page/116 116]|oclc=49276567|author-link=Shaun Assael|name-list-style=amp}}</ref> made an appearance on [[Geraldo Rivera]]'s show ''Now It Can Be Told''. She claimed that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform [[oral sex]] on him in his limousine and, when she refused, raped her.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sexliesheadlocks00shau/page/115|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|last1=Assael|first1=Shaun|last2=Mooneyham|first2=Mike|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0609606905|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexliesheadlocks00shau/page/115 115–117]|oclc=49276567|author-link=Shaun Assael|name-list-style=amp}}</ref>

On February 1, 2006, McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in [[Boca Raton, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bocaratonnews.com/index.php?src=news&prid=14071&category=Local%20News|title=WWE chief accused of groping Boca tanning salon worker|last=King|first=Dale|date=February 3, 2006|work=Boca Raton News|accessdate=July 2, 2007}}</ref> At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in [[Miami]] for the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]] at the time. It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15391|title=McMahon situation to get more publicity|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|magazine=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=February 2, 2006}}</ref> On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Digest|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2006-03-25/news/0603250062_1_consecutive-life-cancer-treatment-life-terms|accessdate=March 9, 2016|work=Sun-Sentinel|date=March 25, 2006}}</ref>

=== Legal trial ===
In 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after a [[steroid]] controversy engulfed the promotion and thus temporarily ceded control of the WWF to his wife Linda.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/sports/wwf-s-mcmahon-indicted.html|title=W.W.F.'s McMahon Indicted|date=1993-11-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2009-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/nyregion/wrestling-promoter-fights-steroid-charges.html|title=Wrestling Promoter Fights Steroid Charges|date=1994-04-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2009-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> One prosecution witness was [[Kevin Wacholz]], who had wrestled for the company in 1992 as "Nailz" and who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon.
