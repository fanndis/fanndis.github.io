In 2007, Murphy won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]] and received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of [[soul music|soul]] singer James "Thunder" Early in the musical film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56447/dreamgirls-snares-multiple-golden-globe-nods |title='Dreamgirls' Snares Multiple Golden Globe Nods|date=December 14, 2006 |author=Kilday, Gregg |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

Murphy's work as a voice actor in films includes the [[Chinese dragon]] [[Mushu]] in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), Thurgood Stubbs in the sitcom ''[[The PJs]]'' (1999–2001), and [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] in [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series (2001–2010). In some films he plays multiple roles in addition to his main character; this is intended as a tribute to one of his idols, [[Peter Sellers]]. He has played multiple roles in ''[[Coming to America]]'' (1988), [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'' (1995), the ''Nutty Professor'' films, ''[[Bowfinger]] (1999)'', ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' (2002), ''[[Norbit]]'' (2007), and ''[[Meet Dave]]'' (2008). {{As of|2016}}, Murphy's films have grossed over $3.8&nbsp;billion ({{US$|6.5 billion|long=no}} adjusted for inflation) in the United States and Canada [[box office]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=EddieMurphy.htm |title=Eddie Murphy |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607032348/www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=eddiemurphy.htm |archive-date=2019-06-07 |access-date=March 8, 2020}}</ref> and over $6.7&nbsp;billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eddie Murphy—Box Office |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/person/700401-Eddie-Murphy#tab=acting |website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |access-date=19 July 2020}}</ref> In 2015, his films made him the sixth-highest grossing actor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDb List of Highest Grossing Actors in the United States|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls074328260/ |access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=eddiemurphy.htm |title=Eddie Murphy |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |access-date=March 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&sort=sumgross&p=.htm |title=People Index |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Murphy was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City<ref name=filmref /> and raised in the borough's [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JtAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6872%2C5299502 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711010347/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JtAEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6872%2C5299502 |url-status=dead |title=Calhoun Times and Gordon County News. |via=Google News Archive Search |date=July 11, 2012 |archive-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> His mother, Lillian (Laney), was a [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]], and his father, Charles Edward Murphy (1940–1969), was a [[transit police]] officer and an amateur actor and comedian.<ref name=filmref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Eddie-Murphy.html |title=Eddie Murphy Biography (1961–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="actors">Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''</ref><ref name=nymag>{{cite news |last=Flippo |first=Chet |title=Eddie Murphy Live: The razor-edged king of late night comedy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-ICAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 |access-date=June 27, 2011 |newspaper=New York |date=October 11, 1982}}</ref><ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800011536/bio Eddie Murphy] Yahoo!

His father died in 1969 when Murphy was eight. He later declared:
{{bquote|My mother and father broke up when I was three and he died when I was eight, so I have very dim memories{{nbsp}}... He was a victim of the Murphy charm ''(laughs)''. A woman stabbed my father. I never got all the logistics. It was supposed to be one of those crimes of passion: "If I can't have you, no one else will" kind of deal.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Zehme |first=Bill |title=Eddie Murphy: the Rolling Stone interview |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 24, 1989 |page=131}}</ref>}}

When Murphy's single mother became ill, the eight-year-old Murphy and his elder brother [[Charlie Murphy|Charlie]] lived in foster care for one year. In interviews, Murphy has said his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor. Later, he and his brother were raised in [[Roosevelt, New York]], by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch, a foreman at an ice cream plant.<ref name="actors"/>

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
When Murphy was 15 he listened to [[Richard Pryor]]'s comedy album ''[[That Nigger's Crazy]]'', which inspired his decision to become a comedian.<ref name=WashingtonPost>Edgers, Geoff (October 13, 2015). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2015/10/13/eddie-murphy-hasnt-told-a-joke-onstage-in-28-years-hes-still-the-funniest-guy-around/ "The Real King of Comedy: Eddie Murphy hasn't told a joke onstage in 28 years.

This led to work at other clubs within walking distance, and then late-night jobs at locations that required him to commute by train. To do this he secretly skipped school, and after his mother discovered this at the end of his senior year, he was required to attend summer school.<ref name=WashingtonPost/>

Murphy's early comedy was characterized by copious profanity and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people (including [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s (WASPs), African-Americans, Italian-Americans, overweight people, and gay people). He released two stand-up specials. ''[[Eddie Murphy (album)|Eddie Murphy]]'' was his first album, released in 1982. ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious|Delirious]]'' was filmed in 1983 in [[Washington, D.C.]] Due to the popularity of ''Delirious'', his concert film ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]'' (1987) received a wide theatrical release, grossing $50&nbsp;million; the movie was filmed in the [[The Theater at Madison Square Garden|Felt Forum]] section of [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{IMDb title|title=Eddie Murphy Delirious|id=0085474|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|title=Eddie Murphy Raw|id=0092948|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref>

===1980s acting career===
[[File:EddieMurphy1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Murphy in 1988]]
In the early 1980s, Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) and was credited with helping to revitalize the show.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shales |first=Tom |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> His characters included a grown-up version of the ''[[Little Rascals]]'' character [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]];<ref name=buckwheat>{{cite book |last=Shales |first=Tom |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |page=549 |isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> a streetwise children's show host named Mr. Robinson (parodying [[Fred Rogers]], who found it amusing);<ref>{{cite book |last=Shales |first=Tom |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |page=238 |isbn=0-316-73565-5}}</ref> and a morose, cynical ''[[Gumby]]'', whose trademark slogan became an SNL catchphrase: "I'm Gumby, dammit!"<ref name=buckwheat/>

The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion—assassinated, on camera, in front of [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]—at Murphy's request, after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to "Do Buckwheat! Do Buckwheat!"<ref name=SNL-Backstage>{{IMDb title |title=Saturday Night Live Backstage |id=tt1899280 |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title |title="Saturday Night Live" March 12, 1983, NBC |id=tt0694998 |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref> In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Murphy was ranked second (behind [[John Belushi]]). "It is customary (and accurate) to say that Eddie Murphy is the only reason SNL survived the five-year wilderness without [[Lorne Michaels]]", the magazine noted.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.</ref>

In 1982, Murphy made his big screen debut in the film ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' with [[Nick Nolte]].<ref name="actors"/> ''48 Hrs.'' proved to be a hit when it was released in the Christmas season of 1982. Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over. He became the only cast member to host while still a regular. Murphy opened the show with the phrase, "Live from New York, It's the Eddie Murphy Show!"

The following year, Murphy starred in ''[[Trading Places]]'' with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Dan Aykroyd]].<ref name="actors"/> The movie marked the first of Murphy's collaborations with director [[John Landis]], who also directed Murphy in ''[[Coming to America]]'' (1988) and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' (1994). ''Trading Places'' was an even greater box office success than ''48 Hrs.''

Murphy appeared in ''[[Best Defense]]'' (1984), co-starring [[Dudley Moore]]. Murphy, who was credited as a "Strategic Guest Star", was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences. ''Best Defense'' was a major financial and critical disappointment. When he hosted ''SNL'', Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing ''Best Defense'', calling it "the worst movie in the history of everything".

Murphy starred in the successful action comedy film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984).<ref name="actors"/> The film was Murphy's first solo leading role.<ref name="actors"/> ''Beverly Hills Cop'' grossed over $230&nbsp;million at the U.S. box office, becoming the highest-grossing film released in 1984, the highest-grossing comedy of all time, and the highest-grossing "R"-rated film of all time; {{As of|2018|May|lc=on}}, it was 46th in the list of all-time U.S. box office grossers after adjusting for inflation (third-highest amongst "R"-rated films).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=Domestic Grosses Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> Murphy was offered a part in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' (1986), a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to [[Catherine Hicks]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Couch |first=Aaron |title='Star Trek IV' Writer on Eddie Murphy's Lost Role and Film's Rewrite Drama |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-iv-voyage-home-writer-eddie-murphys-lost-role-950551 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 26, 2016 |access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref> By this time,<ref>According to the autobiography of the film's director and co-star, [[Leonard Nimoy]].</ref> Murphy's near-exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] rivaled ''Star Trek'' as Paramount's most lucrative franchise.

Murphy starred in the [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] comedy ''[[The Golden Child]]'' (1986).<ref name="actors"/> Although ''The Golden Child'' performed well at the box office, the movie was not as well received as ''48 Hrs.'', ''Trading Places'', and ''Beverly Hills Cop''. ''The Golden Child'' was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the supernatural setting as opposed to the "street smart" settings of his previous efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the [[Tony Scott]]-directed ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' (1987). It was a box-office success, grossing almost $300&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beverlyhillscop2.htm |title=Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood's biggest box office star.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hollywood's Hottest Hunks |journal=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |date=November 1988 |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=33–34 (33) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33 |publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]] |issn=0012-9011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Eddie Murphy's Testimony Disputes Buchwald's Suit |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=15 January 1990 |volume=77 |issue=14 |pages=54–55 (54) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=370DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54 |publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]] |issn=0021-5996}}</ref>

===1990s career===
From 1989 through the early 1990s, box-office receipts and reviews were strong for Murphy's films, but by 1992 both declined, hitting a low point with the critically panned ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' (1994),<ref>{{cite web|title=Beverly Hills Cop 3 (1994) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beverly_hills_cop_3/ |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'',<ref name="actors"/> although he did find box office success with ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'' (1992) and ''[[Another 48 Hrs.]]''. On ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, [[Charlie Murphy]]. The film featured Murphy's comic idols [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Redd Foxx]] in supporting roles.<ref name="actors"/>

During this period, Murphy was criticized by filmmaker [[Spike Lee]] for not using his status to help black actors break into film,<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 6, 1989|title=Spike Lee Challenges Black Show Biz Figures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r0DAAAAMBAJ&q=should%20use%20his%20clout%20rather%20than%20focus%20on%20who%20gets%20the%20best%20table%20at%20Spago&pg=RA1-PA57|journal=JET|pages=57}}</ref> although as Murphy's prominence increased, his films (especially those he produced) often had a mainly black cast (''[[Coming to America]]'', ''Harlem Nights'', ''Boomerang'', ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]''). Many black actors who would later receive greater recognition made early appearances in Murphy's films, such as [[Damon Wayans]] in ''Beverly Hills Cop'', [[Halle Berry]] and [[Martin Lawrence]] in ''Boomerang'', [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] in ''Coming to America'', [[Dave Chappelle]] in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', and [[Chris Rock]] in ''Beverly Hills Cop II''. Naming ''The Nutty Professor'' his favorite comedy, Chris Rock regards Murphy's performance in the film as being so great he had "been robbed of an Oscar", adding his various performances were "Peter Sellers-esque".<ref>{{cite news |title=The 5 Greatest Comedies Of All-Time, According To Chris Rock |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/5-Greatest-Comedies-All-Time-According-Chris-Rock-68419.html |access-date=September 23, 2019 |work=Cinemablend}}</ref>

Although Murphy has enjoyed commercial success since ''Saturday Night Live'', he did not participate in the making of the ''Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' retrospective book by [[Tom Shales]] and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the [[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special|''SNL'' 40th anniversary special]]. Murphy's box office results began to recover in 1996, starting with ''The Nutty Professor''.

In May 1997, Murphy was stopped by police shortly before the release of ''[[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'', causing him a number of public relations problems.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/movies/09cris.html?_r=1&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/G/Gibson,%20Mel&oref=slogin|title=The Mavens Speak|work=The New York Times|date=August 9, 2006 | first=Dennis | last=McDougal | access-date=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/20/entertainment/et-word20|title=Owen Wilson Sits Out 'Drillbit Taylor' Promotion|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 20, 2008 | first1=John | last1=Horn | first2=Gina | last2=Piccalo}}</ref>

===1998–2014: Family-friendly films and ''Dreamgirls''===
Murphy followed with a series of successful family-friendly movies like ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), ''[[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' (also 1998) and [[Dr. Dolittle 2|its 2001 sequel]], the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series, ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'' (2003), and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'' (also 2003), along with ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'' (2000). However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'' (1997), ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'' (2002), and ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'' (also 2002, also with [[Robert De Niro]]) all grossed less than $40&nbsp;million domestically, ''[[Holy Man]]'' (1998) performed poorly, grossing less than $13&nbsp;million, and ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' (2002) is on record as one of the biggest theatrical money-losers of all time, grossing just $7&nbsp;million worldwide on a reported $110&nbsp;million budget. An exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the [[Frank Oz]] comedy ''[[Bowfinger]]'' (1999), also starring [[Steve Martin]]. The film garnered generally positive critical reviews and grossed $98&nbsp;million at the box-office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bowfinger.htm |title=Bowfinger (1999) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=June 19, 2007 |access-date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>

Murphy starred in the motion picture version of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006) as soul singer James "Thunder" Early. Murphy won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]], as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] Award in that category. Several reviews for the film highlighted Murphy's performance while he received some pre-release [[Academy Awards]] buzz.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/movies/03modd.html|title=Eddie Murphy Inspires Oscar Buzz.

==Singing career==
Murphy is also a singer, having frequently provided background vocals to songs released by [[The Bus Boys]]; the song "(The Boys Are) Back in Town" was featured in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and Murphy's comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious]]''. As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, "[[Party All the Time]]" (produced by [[Rick James]]) and "Put Your Mouth on Me" during the latter half of the 1980s. He had started singing earlier in his career, with the songs "Boogie in Your Butt" and "Enough Is Enough", the latter being a parody of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s and [[Donna Summer]]'s 1979 song, "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)|No More Tears]]". (They both appear on his 1982 self-titled comedy album.)

"Party All the Time" was featured on Murphy's debut album ''[[How Could It Be]]'' (1985), which included a minor follow-up [[R&B]] hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake. This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by [[Stevie Wonder]]'s cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out with Rick James. In 2004, [[VH-1]] and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' voted "Party All the Time" number seven among the "50 Worst Songs of All-Time". [[Sharam Tayebi|Sharam]] used a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of the song for the UK No.{{nbsp}}8 hit "PATT (Party All The Time)" in 2006. "Put Your Mouth on Me" appeared on Murphy's 1989 follow-up album, ''[[So Happy]]''.

Murphy recorded the album ''[[Love's Alright]]'' in the early 1990s. He performed in a music video of the single "[[Whatzupwitu]]", featuring [[Michael Jackson]]. He recorded a duet with [[Shabba Ranks]] called "I Was a King". In 1992, Murphy appeared in the music video for Michael Jackson's "[[Remember the Time]]" alongside [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Iman Abdulmajid|Iman]].

Though uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on ''SNL'' castmate [[Joe Piscopo]]'s comedy single, "The Honeymooners Rap".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Marilyn|date=Summer 1985|title=JOE PISCOPO ISN'T COUNTING ON 'DAYS' MOVIE|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-06-20-8502090556-story.html|journal=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Piscopo impersonated [[Jackie Gleason]] on the single, while Murphy provided an imitation of [[Art Carney]].

In ''[[Coming to America]]'', he imitated [[Jackie Wilson]] when he sang "[[To Be Loved]]", but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character. In later years, Murphy performed several songs in the [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'' film franchise]]. In the first film, he performed a version of [[The Monkees]]' "[[I'm a Believer]]" in the film's final scene; in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' he performed [[Ricky Martin]]'s hit "[[Livin' La Vida Loca]]" along with co-star [[Antonio Banderas]]; Murphy performed "[[Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)]]" for ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', once again with Banderas.

In 2013, he released his first single in many years titled "Red Light", a [[reggae]] song featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]. He is also working on a new album titled ''9''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-eddie-murphy-feat-snoop-lion-%E2%80%98red-light%E2%80%99 |title=New Music: Eddie Murphy Feat.

Following his divorce from Mitchell, in 2006, Murphy began dating former [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]], who became pregnant and said the child was Murphy's.

You shouldn't jump to conclusions, sir". Brown gave birth to a baby girl, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007.
