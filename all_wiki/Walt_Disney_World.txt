The '''Walt Disney World Resort''', also called '''Walt Disney World''' and '''Disney World''', is an entertainment complex in [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]], in the United States, near the cities of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products]], a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It was first operated by Walt Disney World Company. The property covers nearly {{convert|25000|acre|sqmi km2|0}}, of which half has been used.<ref name="Fun Facts">{{Cite  news|url=http://wdwnews.com/fact-sheets/2014/10/31/walt-disney-world-fun-facts/|title=Walt Disney World Fun Facts|work=Walt Disney World News |language=en-us |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> The resort comprises four [[Amusement park|theme parks]] (consisting of [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], and [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]), two [[water park]]s, 27 themed [[resort|resort hotels]], nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center [[Disney Springs]].

Designed to supplement [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by [[Walt Disney]] in the 1960s. "The Florida Project", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an "[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]" (EPCOT), a [[planned community]] intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex. After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition. However, Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized. Construction started in 1967, with the company instead building a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998). It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's dream.

In 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.<ref name="2018 Report"/> The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a [[Popular culture|popular staple]] in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]. {{As of|2020||alt=In 2020}}, Walt Disney World was chosen to host the [[2020 NBA Bubble | NBA Bubble]] for play of the [[2019–20 NBA season|2019–20 season]] of the [[National Basketball Association | NBA]] to resume at the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex]].

===Planning and construction===

In 1959, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the [[Mississippi River]], where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, [[Walt Disney]] disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.<ref name="married">{{cite book|title=Married to the Mouse|last=Fogleson|first=Richard E.|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0|page=274}}</ref>

Walt Disney flew over a potential site in [[Orlando, Florida]]—one of many—in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both [[Interstate 4]] and [[Florida's Turnpike]] into account, with [[McCoy Air Force Base]] (later [[Orlando International Airport]]) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near [[Bay Lake (Florida)|Bay Lake]].<ref name="Quest">{{cite book|title=Walt Disney and the Quest for Community|url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneyquestf00mann|url-access=limited|last=Mannheim|first=Steve|year=2002|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate Publishing Limited]]|location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England|isbn=978-0-7546-1974-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneyquestf00mann/page/n86 68]–70|ref=Mann02}}</ref> The development was referred to in-house as "The Florida Project,".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Patches|first=Matt|date=May 20, 2015|title=Inside Walt Disney's Ambitious, Failed Plan to Build the City of Tomorrow|work=Esquire|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/news/a35104/walt-disney-epcot-history-city-of-tomorrow/|access-date=October 20, 2020}}</ref> To avoid a burst of land speculation, [[Walt Disney World Company]] used various [[dummy corporation]]s to acquire {{convert|30500|acre|sqmi km2|0}} of land.<ref name="Quest"/> In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] in [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]]. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically named companies such as the "[[Interstate 4|Ayefour]] Corporation", "Latin-American Development and Management Corporation" and the "Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in [[Magic Kingdom]]. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called "outs". They were {{convert|5|acre|4=0|adj=on|spell=in}} lots [[plat]]ted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly [[swamp]] at the time. Another issue was the [[mineral rights]] to the land, which were owned by [[Tufts University]]. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World|last=Koenig|first=David|year=2007|publisher=Bonaventure Press|location=Irvine, CA|isbn=978-0-9640605-2-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25 25–26]|ref=Koenig07|url=https://archive.org/details/realityland00/page/25}}</ref>

Working strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions, and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-30/news/9305280833_1_walt-disney-osceola-land-transactions|title=Disney Assembled Cast Of Buyers To Amass Land Stage For Kingdom|work=Orlando Sentinel |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903204555/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-30/news/9305280833_1_walt-disney-osceola-land-transactions|archive-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref> With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.<ref name="WDW-Secret">{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-08-06/news/0008050172_1_walt-disney-andersen-central-florida/2|title=Disney Pulled Strings So Mouse Moved In With Barely A Squeak|author=Mark Andrews|work=Orlando Sentinel |date=August 6, 2000|accessdate=September 10, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910033232/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-08-06/news/0008050172_1_walt-disney-andersen-central-florida/2|archive-date=September 10, 2015}}</ref>

Early rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by [[NASA]] in support of the nearby [[Kennedy Space Center]], as well as references to other famous investors such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], and [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name="WDW-Secret"/> An ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' news article published weeks later on May 20, 1965, acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an "East Coast" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.<ref name="WDW-Secret"/> In October 1965, editor [[Emily Bavar]] from the ''Sentinel'' visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida. Bavar later described that Disney "looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face" before denying the story.<ref name="WDW-Secret"/> His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.<ref name="WDW-Secret"/> Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the ''Sentinel'' published another article headlined, "We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney".<ref name="WDW-Secret"/>

Walt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the ''Sentinel'' story, Disney asked Florida Governor [[Haydon Burns]] to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park "the greatest attraction in the history of Florida".<ref name="WDW-Secret"/> The official reveal was kept on the previously planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.<ref name="WDW-Secret"/>

====Roy Disney's oversight of construction====
[[File:Roy Disney inspecting property in Florida.jpg|left|thumb|Roy O. Disney inspecting design plans on-site in Florida]]
Walt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by [[lung cancer]] on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Santora |first1=Phil |title=The day Walt Disney, an American icon who gave us Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, died |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/archives-walt-disney-died-lung-cancer-article-1.2042273 |website=nydailynews.com |publisher=New York Daily News |accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref> His brother and business partner, [[Roy O. Disney]], postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.

On February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in [[Winter Park, Florida]]. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] with two cities inside it, [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and Reedy Creek, now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be [[property tax]]es and [[elevator]] inspections.<ref name="married"/> The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor [[Claude R. Kirk, Jr.]] on May 12, 1967.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Bob|title=Walt Disney - An American Original|date=1994|url=http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/ |page=357 |accessdate=September 21, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024034807/http://kpolsson.com/wdworld/|archive-date=October 24, 2015}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Florida]] then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.

The district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Resort|Polynesian Village]] were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.<ref name="dwfonfr">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0-4eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wCQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6996%2C2342976 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |agency=UPI |title=Disney World Florida opens next Friday |date=September 27, 1971 |page=11}}</ref><ref name="opfgteslns">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SsEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=izIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=7198%2C139625 |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |location=California |agency=UPI |title=Walt Disney World opens Florida gates |date=October 2, 1971 |page=10 }}</ref> The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Fort Wilderness]] opened one month later. Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as "Walt Disney World" in his brother's honor. In his own words: "Everyone has heard of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars. But have they all heard of [[Henry Ford]], who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here." After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]], what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, "I think Walt would have approved." Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.<ref name="bbroydsn">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IkVQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yFcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5417%2C1489507 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title=Backstage brain Roy Disney dies |date=December 21, 1971 |page=10–A }}</ref>

Admission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.<ref name=dwfonfr/>

===1980s–present===
Much of Walt Disney's plans for his [[EPCOT (concept)|Progress City]] were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, [[Epcot|EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982 (renamed [[Epcot|EPCOT]] in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a [[world's fair]] than a "community of tomorrow". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]] much later. The resort's third theme park, [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. 

In the early 1990s, the resort was seeking permits for expansion. There was considerable environmentalist push-back, and the resort was convinced to engage in [[mitigation banking]]. In an agreement with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and the state of Florida, Disney purchased 8,500 acres of land adjacent to the park for the purpose of rehabilitating wetland ecosystems. The [[Disney Wilderness Preserve]] was established in April 1993, and the land was subsequently transferred to The Nature Conservancy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Disney Wilderness Preserve |url=http://disney.go.com/disneyhand/environmentality/environment/preserve.html |website=The Walt Disney Company |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030819004243/http://disney.go.com/disneyhand/environmentality/environment/preserve.html |archive-date=August 19, 2003}}</ref> The Walt Disney Company provided additional funds for landscape restoration and wildlife monitoring.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Tom |title=Disney Wilderness Preserve Site Is Internationally Recognized Model for Success |url=https://www.theledger.com/article/LK/20130216/news/608072862/LL |accessdate=19 July 2020 |work=The Ledger |date=February 16, 2013 |language=en}}</ref>

The resort's fourth theme park, [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], opened in 1998.

[[George Kalogridis]] was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing [[Meg Crofton]], who had overseen the site since 2006.

On January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. [[Disney Springs]] and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pedicini|first1=Sandra|title=Walt Disney World announces management reorganization|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-disney-overhauls-management-20160122-story.html |date=January 22, 2016 |accessdate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827045305/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-disney-overhauls-management-20160122-story.html|archive-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

On April 8, 2017, the show [[Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]] was broadcast live to the UK from the park.

On October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring dogs to [[Disney's Yacht Club Resort]], [[Disney's Port Orleans Resort]] – Riverside, [[Disney's Art of Animation Resort]] and [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trejos|first1=Nancy|title=Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2017/10/18/pets-now-welcome-disney-world-resorts/774803001/|work=USA Today |language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, Josh D'Amaro replaced [[George Kalogridis]] as President of the resort. He had previously held the position of Vice President of Animal Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Walt Disney Company News |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/other/walt-disney-company/news/25sep2019-josh-damaro-to-become-new-vice-president-walt-disney-world.htm |publisher=WDWMagic}}</ref> D'Amaro was subsequently promoted to Chairman of [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products]] in May 2020, succeeding Bob Chapek who was promoted to CEO of The Walt Disney Company in February 2020. Jeff Vahle, who served as president of Disney Signature Experiences subsequently took over as President of the resort.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bevil|first=Dewayne|title=Disney World: Josh D’Amaro promoted; Jeff Vahle takes over as president|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-bz-disney-president-promoted-damaro-vahle-20200518-wnkwciyehzfphoa4to73jfvabe-story.html|website=orlandosentinel.com}}</ref>

==Resorts==
{{See also|Category:Hotels in Walt Disney World Resort}}
Of the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, 28 are owned and operated by [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products]]. These are classified into four categories—Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas—and are located in one of five resort areas: the [[Magic Kingdom Resort Area|Magic Kingdom]], [[Epcot Resort Area|Epcot]], [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Resort Area|Wide World of Sports]], [[Animal Kingdom Resort Area|Animal Kingdom]], or [[Disney Springs Resort Area|Disney Springs]] resort areas. There is also the Other Select Deluxe Resorts category used to describe two resorts in the Epcot Resorts Area that carry Walt Disney World branding, but are managed by a third-party.

While all of the Deluxe resort hotels have achieved an AAA Four Diamond rating, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is considered the highest-tier flagship luxury resort on the Walt Disney World Resort complex.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/Showpic.asp?filename=http://s231432788.onlinehome.us/lotion/pics/SS20090814-WDWGF/big/P1-0002.jpg&caption=Sign+explaining+the+project|title=Grand Floridian Construction Project|publisher=Laughing Place|access-date=August 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200420/http://www.laughingplace.com/Showpic.asp?filename=http%3A%2F%2Fs231432788.onlinehome.us%2Flotion%2Fpics%2FSS20090814-WDWGF%2Fbig%2FP1-0002.jpg&caption=Sign+explaining+the+project|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Former resorts===
* The Golf Resort – Became The Disney Inn, and later became [[Shades of Green (resort)|Shades of Green.]]
* Disney's Village Resort – Became the [[Disney Institute|Villas at Disney Institute]] and then [[Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa]]. The "Tree House" Villas were decommissioned for a time because they were not accessible to disabled guests. Until early 2008, they were used for [[Walt Disney World International Program|International Program]] Cast Member housing. In February 2008, Disney submitted plans to the [[South Florida Water Management District]] to replace the 60 existing villas with 60 new villas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treehouse Villas To Be Replaced By New Treehouses At Walt Disney World |url=http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2008/02/12/treehouse-villas-to-be-replaced-by-new-treehouses-at-walt-disney-world/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520040229/http://www.netcot.com/thesite/2008/02/12/treehouse-villas-to-be-replaced-by-new-treehouses-at-walt-disney-world/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 20, 2008 |publisher=Netcot.com |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 8, 2008 }}</ref> The Treehouse Villas opened during the summer of 2009.
* [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]] – a town designed and built by Disney, now managed by a resident-run association.
* [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]] – Disney originally intended this area to become a complete community with multiple residences, shopping, and offices, but transformed the original homes into hotel lodging in the 1970s, which were demolished in the early 2000s to build [[Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa]]

===Transportation===
{{Disney Transport}}
[[File:WDW Monorail.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] provides free transport across the resort.|alt=]]
The Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by [[Disney Transport]], a complimentary [[Public transport|mass transportation system]] allowing guest access across the property. The fare-free system utilizes buses, monorails, gondola lifts, watercraft, and parking lot trams.

The [[Walt Disney World Monorail System]] provides free transportation at Walt Disney World; guests can board the monorail and travel between the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, including select on-property resorts such as [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa|The Grand Floridian]] and [[Disney's Polynesian Village Resort|The Polynesian Village]]. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the [[Transportation and Ticket Center]] (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. Disney Transport owns a fleet of Disney-operated [[bus]]es on property, that is also complimentary for guests.

A [[gondola lift]] system, dubbed [[Disney Skyliner]], opened in 2019. The system's three lines connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-disney-gondola-cost-20180124-story.html|title=Disney's gondola system picks up $3.8 million worth of electrical work|last=Russon|first=Gabrielle|work=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US |access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>

Disney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from [[water taxi]]s, up to the [[Ferry|ferries]] that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of [[Trackless train|parking lot trams]] that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.

In addition to its free transportation methods, in conjunction with [[Lyft]], Walt Disney World also offers a [[vehicle for hire]] service for a fee. The Minnie Van Service are [[Chevy Traverse]]s dressed in a [[Minnie Mouse]] red-and-white polka dot design that can accommodate up to six people and have two carseats available to anyone that is within the Walt Disney World Resort limits. Cast members can install the car seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/minnie-van-service/|title=Minnie Van™ Service|website=Walt Disney World}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lyft-Powered Minnie Van™ Service Launches at Walt Disney World|url=https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-powered-minnie-van-disney|publisher=Lyft|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801002423/https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-powered-minnie-van-disney|archive-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> Some of the unique advantages that the Minnie Van Service offers over a normal ride share is the ability to be dropped off in the Magic Kingdom bus loop (instead of at the TTC like the other ride shares) and being able to ride to any point in [[Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground|Fort Wilderness.]]

===Employment===
When the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 "cast members".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayindisneyhistory.com/DisneyWorldGrandOpening.html|title=Disney World's Grand Opening|website=www.thisdayindisneyhistory.com}}</ref> In 2020, Walt Disney World employs more than 77,000 cast members.<ref name="factsheet220"/> The largest single-site employer in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Profile|url=http://profiles.hospitalityonline.com/206943/|work=Hospitality Online|accessdate=July 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043040/http://profiles.hospitalityonline.com/206943/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Rich|title=How Walt Disney's Love of Trains Changed the World|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rich-grant/how-walt-disneys-love-of-trains-changed-the-world_b_6894946.html|website=The Huffington Post |date=March 18, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318033725/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rich-grant/how-walt-disneys-love-of-trains-changed-the-world_b_6894946.html|archive-date=March 18, 2016}}</ref> Walt Disney World has more than 3,000 job classifications with a total 2019 payroll of over $3 billion.<ref name="factsheet220"/> The resort also sponsors and operates the [[Walt Disney World College Program]], an internship program that offers American college students (CPs) the opportunity to live about {{convert|15|mi}} off-site in four Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, and thereby provides much of the theme park and resort "front line" cast members. There is also the [[Walt Disney World International College Program]], an internship program that offers international college students (ICPs) from all over the world the same opportunity. In September 2020, the Walt Disney Company began laying off 6,500 Walt Disney World employees.<ref name=layoffs />

===Energy use===
Walt Disney World requires an estimated {{Convert|1|e9kWh|e9MJ|abbr=off}} of electricity annually, costing the company nearly $100 million in annual energy consumption.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2019/02/21/disney-world-could-have-gone-nuclear/#3bed2e3c5393|title=Disney World Could Have Gone Nuclear|last=Conca|first=James|date=February 21, 2019|work=Forbes|access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref> In addition to relying primarily on fossil fuels and nuclear energy from the state's power grid, Walt Disney World has two [[Photovoltaic power station|solar energy facilities]] on property; a {{Convert|22|acre|sqmi km2|adj=on}} [[Mickey Mouse]]-shaped [[solar panel]] farm near Epcot, and a {{Convert|270|acre|sqmi km2|adj=on}} facility near Disney's Animal Kingdom.<ref name="Forbes Clean Energy">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/edfenergyexchange/2019/01/28/why-disney-world-is-betting-on-clean-energy/#41dcfc7c6722|title=Why Disney World Is Betting On Clean Energy|last=Hiller|first=Jake|date=January 28, 2019|work=Forbes|access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref> The larger facility produces enough [[solar energy]] to provide electricity to two of the resort's theme parks.

===Security===
<!-- Anchor for redirect from: [Disney Global Security] article; caution with changes. -->
[[File:Walt Disney World Security Vehicle.jpg|thumb|left|Disney Security Vehicle, picture taken July 2, 2009 in front of Epcot]]
Disney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], uniformed security has been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks. Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving the Transportation and Ticket Center by tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort hotel bus or [[Disney Transport#Minnie Van|Minnie Van™]] have their own bag check just outside the bus stops. Guests arriving via Magic Kingdom Resort boat launch will be bag checked on the arrival dock outside Magic Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wdwmagic.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/news/03apr2017-photos---new-bag-check-areas-greatly-enhance-magic-kingdom-arrival-experience.htm |title=New bag check areas greatly enhance Magic Kingdom arrival experience |publisher=Walt Disney World |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref>

The land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney. RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the [[Florida Highway Patrol]] along with the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County]] and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.<ref name="married 2">{{cite book|last=Foglesong|first=Richard E. |title=Married to the Mouse|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003|pages=69,139|isbn=978-0-300-09828-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Florida Supreme Court|others=Alabama.

Supreme Court|title=Southern Reporter. Second Series|publisher=West Pub. Co.}}</ref>

Despite the appearance of the uniformed security personnel, they are not considered a legal law enforcement agency. Disney and the Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a "night watchman" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws. An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pastor
|first=James F. |title=Security Law and Methods|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2006|pages=505–512|isbn=978-0-7506-7994-7}}</ref>

In late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances.

Although the scattering of ashes on Disney property is illegal, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in October 2018 that Walt Disney World parks were becoming a popular spot for families to scatter the ashes of loved ones, with the [[Haunted Mansion]] at Magic Kingdom being the favorite location.

Like [[Disneyland|its sister park]], parks at the resort may close early to accommodate various special events, such as special press events, tour groups, VIP groups, and private parties. It is common for a corporation to rent entire parks for the evening. In such cases, special passes are issued which are valid for admission to all rides and attractions. At the ticket booths and on published schedules, the guests are notified of the early closures. Then, cast members announce that the parks are closing, sometime before the private event starts, and clear the parks of guests who do not have the special passes.

In October 2020, it was revealed that attendance had still not permitted to return to full capacity following the COVID-19 closure which occurred earlier in the year.<ref name=capped />
