'''Timea Bacsinszky'''<ref>{{lang-hu|Bacsinszky Tímea}}</ref> (born 8 June 1989) is a Swiss professional tennis player who has won four [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] singles and five doubles titles, as well as 13 [[ITF Women's World Tennis Tour|ITF]] singles and 14 doubles titles. A former top ten singles player, Bacsinszky reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 9 on 16 May 2016.

A former prodigy on the junior tennis circuit, Bacsinszky semi-retired from tennis in 2011 at the age of 22 following a major foot injury. After playing a qualifying match at the [[2013 French Open]], Bacsinszky made a full comeback onto the WTA tour in 2014 with success, winning her opening round match at three of the Grand Slams and upsetting world No. 4 and five-time Grand Slam winner [[Maria Sharapova]] en route to the quarterfinals in [[2014 Wuhan Open – Singles|Wuhan]], earning her a first ever year-end top 50 ranking. Her breakthrough year in singles came in 2015, winning a career-best 15 consecutive matches spanning two titles, upsetting [[Madison Keys]] and [[Petra Kvitová]] en route to the semifinals of the [[2015 French Open|French Open]] (the first time she advanced past the third round of a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Major]]), reaching her first Premier Mandatory final at the [[2015 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], and becoming the first Swiss female tennis player to be ranked in the top 10 since [[Martina Hingis]] in 2007. Bacsinszky received the [[WTA Most Improved Player of the Year]] award for her massive singles rise that year. She once again reached the semifinals of the French Open in [[2017 French Open|2017]]. She also reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in [[2015 Wimbledon Championships|2015]], and of the French Open in [[2016 French Open|2016]].

Representing [[Switzerland Fed Cup team|Switzerland]], Bacsinszky has a [[Fed Cup]] career match record of 28–22.<ref>{{Fed Cup player}}</ref> She won the [[silver medal]] in women's doubles at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], partnering Hingis.

==Personal life==
Bacsinszky, who first picked up a racket at age 5, was pushed hard to succeed in youth tennis by her father Igor, a tennis coach from [[Romania]].<ref name="wtatennis">{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/311579/title/Timea-BACSINSZKY|title=Timea Bacsinszky Biography|first=|last=|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=}}</ref> She has stated that she resented him for this and remains estranged from him after her parents divorced, though she still developed a passion for competitive tennis.<ref name="power"/> Her mother, Suzanne, is a dentist from [[Hungary]].

She spent part of her childhood in [[Satu Mare]].

==Tennis career==
===2004–10: Early career===
Bacsinszky's early tennis highlights included reaching the semifinals of three junior Grand Slam tournaments in 2004–05. Her breakthrough professional tournament was the [[2006 Zurich Open]], where she qualified then defeated [[Anastasia Myskina]] and [[Francesca Schiavone]] before losing to former No. 1, [[Maria Sharapova]]. Her early years on tour were a learning experience, and she finished both 2006 and 2007 ranked in the 120s.

Her singles ranking climbed in 2008, and she finished in the top 60 three straight years. Most important was reaching the semifinals of the [[Diamond Games]] in February, winning three qualifying and several main draw matches before losing to world No. 1 [[Justine Henin]], in three sets. She won her first WTA singles title at the [[2009 BGL Luxembourg Open|2009 Luxembourg Open]], then won her first three doubles titles the following year.

===2011–14: Injury and return===
Bacsinszky suffered a serious foot injury in the spring of 2011, requiring surgery and a long recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/2637764|title=Bacsinszky breaking those percentages|work=[[Women's Tennis Association]]|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=26 June 2014}}{{deadlink|date=September 2020}}</ref> She returned at the [[2012 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]] the following February then used her protected ranking to play several WTA tournaments. She also played a number of [[ITF Women's Circuit]] events. However, she decided to skip the Olympics for personal reasons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2012.itftennis.com/olympics/news/articles/itf-confirms-paszek%27s-olympic-eligibility.aspx|title=ITF confirms Paszek's Olympic eligibility|work=[[International Tennis Federation]]|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=26 June 2014}}{{deadlink|date=September 2020}}</ref> and soon took a hiatus from tennis altogether. She ended up working in restaurants and bars while preparing to attend hotel management school.<ref name="may14"/>

In May 2013, Bacsinszky received an email, stating she was eligible to compete in that month's [[2013 French Open|French Open]] qualifier. With no practice and having to take time off work, she drove from Lausanne to Paris; she lost her first match but felt her passion for the game reignited. Thus she hired Dimitri Zavialoff, former coach of compatriot [[Stan Wawrinka]], and committed herself to reviving her tennis career.<ref name="may14">{{cite news|last1=Rothenberg|first1=Ben|title=Trying to Keep Peace at Home, While Losing Her Peace of Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/sports/tennis/trying-to-keep-peace-at-home-while-losing-her-peace-of-mind.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 June 2015|work=New York Times|date=28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://letstalktennis.org/bacsinszky-i-had-given-up-on-tennis/|title=Bacsinszky: "I Had Given Up on Tennis" - Lets Talk Tennis}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Louisa|title=Clay Courage: The Unlikely Rise of Timea Bacsinszky at the French Open|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/timea-bacsinszky-french-open-2015/|accessdate=2 June 2015|publisher=Grantland|date=1 June 2015}}</ref> Her gradual return to the WTA Tour reached a big milestone at the [[2014 Wuhan Open]] when she upset No. 4, Maria Sharapova, in the third round. A few weeks later, she won her fourth career doubles title.

===2015: Top-10 debut and first Grand Slam semifinal===
[[File:Timea Bacsinszky RG15.jpg|thumb|Bacsinszky at the [[2015 French Open]]]]
Bacsinszky began the year in [[2015 WTA Shenzhen Open|Shenzhen]], upsetting No. 4 [[Petra Kvitová]] in the semifinal before losing to No. 3 [[Simona Halep]] in her first WTA final in five years. She then reached the third round of the [[2015 Australian Open|Australian Open]] followed by back-to-back titles in Mexico at [[2015 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Acapulco]] and [[2015 Monterrey Open|Monterrey]], beating [[Caroline Garcia]] in both finals. As a result, her ranking rose into the top 30 for the first time. She continued this good form at the [[2015 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] Premier Mandatory, defeating No. 8 [[Ekaterina Makarova]] en route to the quarterfinals where she lost to No. 1 [[Serena Williams]], thereby ending her win streak at a career-best 15 matches.<ref name="power">{{cite news|title=The Power in Her|work=tennis.com|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/power-her/54389/|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>

At the [[2015 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]] she advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time, once again upsetting Kvitová. She made it all the way to the semifinals and a rematch with No. 1 Williams; Bacsinszky led by a set and a break but lost the last ten games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Serena Williams beats Timea Bacsinszky to reach French Open final – as it happened |work=theguardian.com |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jun/04/serena-williams-timea-bacsinszky-french-open |accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Then after making the quarterfinals of [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] her ranking rose to 13.

The U.S. hard-court season however saw unstable results for her, falling in the first round of all four tournaments she entered, including losing to [[Barbora Strýcová]] in her opening match at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. Entering the [[2015 China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in poor form, Bacsinszky beat Italian [[Camila Giorgi]], qualifier [[Mariana Duque-Marino]], and three former top-10 players including [[Carla Suárez Navarro]], [[Sara Errani]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]] to advance her first ever Premier-Mandatory final where she lost to [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] in straight sets. Her run to the final put her in the top 10 in the [[WTA rankings]] for the first time.

She lost out on her run to the [[WTA Finals]], however, because the last tournament she played (Luxembourg) held its final on Saturday and the points could not count for the race. She withdrew from the [[WTA Elite Trophy]] due to a left knee injury that had already forced her retirement in her first round match in Luxembourg. After the end of the season, Bacsinszky received the WTA's Most Improved Player Award, ending the year No. 12 in the rankings.

===2016: Fourth WTA title and Olympic silver medal in doubles===
Bacsinszky's first two tournaments both ended in defeats as she lost to [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]] and [[Anna Karolína Schmiedlová]] at the [[Brisbane International]] and at the [[Sydney International]], respectively. Her next tournament was the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], where she beat [[Kateřina Siniaková]] but lost to [[Annika Beck]]. At the Fed Cup, Bacsinszky lost both of her matches in Switzerland's tie against Germany, but these losses did not do any harm to Switzerland who beat Germany in the doubles. She then withdrew from the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]]. At the [[WTA Qatar Open|Qatar Open]], Bacsinszky defeated [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]] and [[Yulia Putintseva]] before losing to eventual champion Carla Suárez Navarro. However, Bacsinszky was not able to defend her back-to-back title in Acapulco and Monterrey from 2015 as they were set in the same dates as the aforementioned tournaments.

In March, Bacsinszky reached the fourth round at [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] beating [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] and [[Eugenie Bouchard]] respectively, but lost to [[Daria Kasatkina]] subsequently. She then made a surprising semifinal run at [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]], beating [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] and Simona Halep, two top-5 players, back-to-back. She lost to [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in straight sets in the semifinal.

At the clay-court season, Bacsinszky won her fourth WTA title in [[2016 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem|Rabat]], losing only one set in the tournament, and re-entered the top 10. She made the quarterfinals at [[2016 Internazionali BNL d'Italia – Women's Singles|Rome]] (losing to Garbine Muguruza) and reached her highest career ranking at No. 9. At the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], she beat [[Sílvia Soler Espinosa]], [[Eugenie Bouchard]], [[Pauline Parmentier]] and [[Venus Williams]] en route to her second straight quarterfinal, but lost to the unseeded [[Kiki Bertens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5606162/title/bacsinszky-behind-the-mic|title=Bacsinszky: Behind The Mic|website=Women's Tennis Association|access-date=2016-05-29}}</ref>

Coming to the grass-court season, Bacsinszky played [[2016 Aegon International Eastbourne – Singles|Eastbourne]] but was defeated by the in-form [[Kristina Mladenovic]] in straight sets. At [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], she started her campaign by beating qualifier [[Luksika Kumkhum]] in the first round and set up a rematch of last year's fourth round match against [[Monica Niculescu]]. Similar to last year, Bacsinszky turned the match around with a comeback win by winning six games in a row in the last set. However, she lost in straight sets to the eventual quarterfinalist [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]]. She then reached the semifinals of the inaugural [[Ladies Championship Gstaad]], losing to Kiki Bertens.

At the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]], Bacsinszky suffered a shocking first round loss to China's [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]]; however, partnering with Martina Hingis for the first time ever in the doubles tournament, Bacsinszky earned her first Olympic medal, as they beat Daria Gavrilova/[[Samantha Stosur]] of Australia, Bethanie Mattek-Sands/[[CoCo Vandeweghe]] of the United States, [[Chan Hao-ching]]/[[Chan Yung-jan]] of Taipei and [[Andrea Hlaváčková]]/[[Lucie Hradecká]] of Czech Republic en route to the final where the pair lost to [[Ekaterina Makarova]]/[[Elena Vesnina]] of Russia. They become the first two Swiss female tennis Olympic medalists.

Bacsinszky had a round-two loss to [[Varvara Lepchenko]] in three tight sets in the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. She exited in the second round of the [[2016 China Open – Women's Singles|China Open]], where she was runner-up the previous year. However, due to her strong first half of the season, Bacsinszky qualified for [[2016 WTA Elite Trophy|Elite Trophy]] in Zhuhai. At the last event of the season, she lost to Zhang Shuai in straight sets in one of the two round-robin matches, but concluded the season with a win against [[Tímea Babos]]. She ended the season ranked No. 15.

===2017: Second Grand Slam semifinal===
Bacsinszky withdrew from the [[2017 WTA Shenzhen Open|Shenzhen Open]] and the [[2017 Apia International Sydney|Apia International Sydney]] due to injury.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sarkar |first1=Jalaluddin |title=Swiss Player Bacsinszky Pulls Out From WTA Shenzhen Open |url=https://sportzwiki.com/tennis/swiss-player-bacsinszky-pulls-wta-shenzhen-open |accessdate=28 May 2020 |publisher=sportzwiki.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=WTA Injury Report: Sydney, Hobart |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1417858/wta-injury-report-sydney-hobart |accessdate=28 May 2020 |publisher=www.wtatennis.com |date=19 January 2017}}</ref> With no warm-up match before the [[2017 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], she matched her best result at this tournament with a third-round appearance, losing to Daria Gavrilova in three sets. Entering the Fed Cup as the Swiss No. 1, Bacsinszky won both of her rubbers against French player [[Alizé Cornet]] and Kristina Mladenovic. With injuries carried on from the Fed Cup, she had to retire in the first round of Doha and eventually withdrew from Dubai, the first Premier-5 event of the year. The Swiss, however, reached the second week of [[2017 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]] for the third consecutive year, only to retire against [[Karolína Plíšková]] due to wrist injury. She also had to withdraw from the Miami Open, where she was a semifinalist from the previous year. In the Fed Cup semifinal against Belarus, Bacsinszky beat [[Aryna Sabalenka]] but lost to [[Aliaksandra Sasnovich]], and Switzerland eventually lost to Belarus 2-3 in that round.

Coming into the clay-court season with few tournaments played from the first quarter of the season, Bacsinszky struggled to go deep in different events including a loss to [[CiCi Bellis]] at [[2017 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem – Singles|Rabat]] as the defending champion; a second round loss at [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open – Women's Singles|Madrid]] to [[Kiki Bertens]], and a loss to Karolína Plíšková in the third round of [[2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia – Women's Singles|Rome]]. The Swiss however did upset the reigning French Open champion Garbiñe Muguruza in first round of Madrid, her first top-10 win of the season and first win against the Spaniard.

At [[2017 French Open|Roland Garros]], Bacsinszky defeated Spaniard [[Sara Sorribes Tormo]], Tunisian lucky loser [[Ons Jabeur]] and American [[Madison Brengle]] before beating the 2017 Australian Open runner-up Venus Williams in three sets to qualify for the quarterfinals. Bacsinszky then defeated home favourite Mladenovic but lost in the semifinal match against eventual champion [[Jelena Ostapenko]] from Latvia.

Bacsinszky reached the third round of Wimbledon where she lost to Agnieszka Radwańska after leading by a set. During the match, she suffered an injury to her quadriceps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tdg.ch/sports/timea-bacsinszky-estce-dechirure-musculaire/story/30616001|title=Timea Bacsinszky: "Est-ce une déchirure musculaire?"|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2017-07-12|language=French}}</ref> She later missed the US Open due to an injury of her right wrist,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/sport/wta-tour-us-open-ohne-timea-bacsinszky-ld.1310749|title=US Open ohne Timea Bacsinszky|work=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=2017-08-14|accessdate=2017-09-20|language=German}}</ref> and subsequently underwent a surgical procedure in October, thus ending her season prematurely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/47637/timea-bacsinszky-calls-it-a-season-says-she-hopes-to-be-back-stronger/|title=Timea Bacsinszky calls it a season, says she hopes to be back stronger|work=Tennis World USA|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}</ref>
