Recently, scholars have distinguished between different kinds of diaspora, based on its causes such as [[colonialism]], trade or labor migrations, or by the kind of social coherence within the diaspora community and its ties to the ancestral lands. Some diaspora communities maintain strong political ties with their homeland. Other qualities that may be typical of many diasporas are thoughts of return, keeping ties back home (country of origin) relationships with other communities in the diaspora, and lack of full integration into the host countries. Diasporas often maintain ties to the country of their historical affiliation and influence the policies of the country where they are located.

In 2019, according to the [[United Nations]] with 17.5 million [[Indian diaspora]] is [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by immigrant population|world's largest diaspora]], followed by 11.8 million [[Emigration from Mexico|Mexican diaspora]] and 10.7 million of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]]. <ref name=etdata1>[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/forex-and-remittance/with-78-billion-india-still-highest-overseas-remittance-receiver/articleshow/72271170.cms With $78 billion, India still highest overseas remittance receiver], Eonomic Times, 28 November 2019.</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File: Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|'' Emigrants Leave Ireland'' depicting the emigration to America following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland]]

The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb διασπείρω (''diaspeirō''), "I scatter", "I spread about" which in turn is composed of διά (''dia''), "between, through, across" and the verb σπείρω (''speirō''), "I sow, I scatter". In [[Ancient Greece]] the term διασπορά (''diaspora'') hence meant "scattering"<ref name=liddell>{{LSJ|diaspora/|διασπορά|ref}}</ref> and was inter alia used to refer to citizens of a dominant [[city-state]] who emigrated to a conquered land with the purpose of [[colonization]], to assimilate the territory into the empire.<ref>pp. 1–2,  Tetlow</ref> An example of a diaspora from classical antiquity is the century-long exile of the [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenians]] under [[Sparta]]n rule and the Ageanites as described by Thucydides in his "history of the Peloponnesian wars."

Its use began to develop from this original sense when the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek;<ref>p. 81, Kantor</ref>  the first mention of a diaspora created as a result of exile is found in the [[Septuagint]], first in
* [[Deuteronomy]] 28:25, in the phrase {{lang|grc| ἔσῃ ἐν διασπορᾷ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς}}, ''esē en diaspora en pasais tais basileiais tēs gēs'', translated to mean "thou shalt be a dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth"
and secondly in
* [[Psalms]] 146(147).2, in the phrase {{lang|grc|οἰκοδομῶν Ἰερουσαλὴμ ὁ Kύριος καὶ τὰς διασπορὰς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπισυνάξει}}, ''oikodomōn Ierousalēm ho [[Kyrios]] kai tas diasporas tou Israēl episynaxē'', translated to mean "The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel".

So after the Bible's translation into Greek, the word ''diaspora'' would then have been used to refer to the Northern Kingdom exiled between 740–722 BC from Israel by the Assyrians,<ref>[[Assyrian captivity of Israel]]</ref> as well as Jews, Benjaminites, and Levites exiled from the Southern Kingdom in 587 BC by the [[Babylonian exile|Babylonians]], and from [[Roman Judea]] in 70 AD by the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>pp. 53, 105–06, Kantor</ref> It subsequently came to be used to refer to the historical movements and settlement patterns of the dispersed indigenous population of Israel.<ref>p. 1, Barclay</ref> When relating to Judaism and capitalized without modifiers (that is simply, ''the Diaspora''), the term refers specifically to the [[Jewish diaspora]];<ref name=webster/> when uncapitalized '' diaspora'' may refer to [[refugee]] or [[Immigration|immigrant]] populations of other origins or ethnicities living "away from an indigenous or established homeland".<ref name=webster/> The wider application of ''diaspora'' evolved from the Assyrian two-way mass deportation policy of conquered populations to deny future territorial claims on their part.<ref>pp. 96–97, Galil & Weinfeld</ref>

===Definition===
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]'', the first known recorded usage of the word ''diaspora'' in the [[English language]] was in 1876 referring "extensive ''diaspora'' work (as it is termed) of evangelizing among the National Protestant Churches on the continent".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/52085|title=diaspora, n.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]|date=November 2010|access-date=22 February 2011}}</ref> The term became more widely assimilated into [[English language|English]] by the mid 1950s, with long-term [[expatriates]] in significant numbers from other particular countries or regions also being referred to as a diaspora.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} An academic field, [[diaspora studies]], has become established relating to this sense of the word. In English, capitalized, and without modifiers (that is simply, ''the Diaspora''), the term refers specifically to the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the context of Judaism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diaspora|title=Definition of DIASPORA|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref>

In all cases, the term ''diaspora'' carries a sense of [[Forced migration|displacement]]. The population so described finds itself for whatever reason separated from its national territory, and usually, its people have a hope, or at least a desire, to return to their homeland at some point if the "homeland" still exists in any meaningful sense. Some writers{{Who|date=November 2010}} have noted that diaspora may result in a loss of nostalgia for a single home as people "re-root" in a series of meaningful displacements. In this sense, individuals may have multiple homes throughout their diaspora, with different reasons for maintaining some form of attachment to each. Diasporic cultural development often assumes a different course from that of the population in the original place of settlement. Over time, remotely separated communities tend to vary in culture, traditions, language, and other factors. The last vestiges of cultural affiliation in a diaspora is often found in community resistance to [[language change]] and in the maintenance of traditional religious practice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Scholarly work and expanding definition===
[[William Safran]] in an article published in 1991,<ref>Safran, William. 1991. "Diasporas in Modern Societies: Myths of Homeland and Return." In ''Diaspora'', 1, no. 1: pp. 83–99.</ref> set out six rules to distinguish diasporas from migrant communities. These included criteria that the group maintains a myth or collective memory of their homeland; they regard their ancestral homeland as their true home, to which they will eventually return; being committed to the restoration or maintenance of that homeland, and they relate "personally or vicariously" to the homeland to a point where it shapes their identity.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=5}}{{sfn|Weinar|2010|p=75}}{{sfn|Cohen|2008|p=6}} While Safran's definitions were influenced by the idea of the Jewish diaspora, he recognised the expanding use of the term.{{sfn|Cohen|2008|p=4}}

[[Rogers Brubaker]] (2005) also notes that the use of the term diaspora has been widening. He suggests that one element of this expansion in use "involves the application of the term diaspora to an ever-broadening set of cases: essentially to any and every nameable population category that is to some extent dispersed in space".{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=3}} Brubaker has used the [[WorldCat]] database to show that 17 out of the 18 books on diaspora published between 1900 and 1910 were on the Jewish diaspora. The majority of works in the 1960s were also about the Jewish diaspora, but in 2002 only two out of 20 books sampled (out of a total of 253) were about the Jewish case, with a total of eight different diasporas covered.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=14}}

Brubaker outlines the original use of the term diaspora as follows:

<blockquote>Most early discussions of the diaspora were firmly rooted in a conceptual 'homeland'; they were concerned with a paradigmatic case, or a small number of core cases. The paradigmatic case was, of course, the Jewish diaspora; some dictionary definitions of diaspora, until recently, did not simply illustrate but defined the word with reference to that case.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=2}}</blockquote>

Brubaker argues that the initial expansion of the use of the phrase extended it to other, similar cases, such as the [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian]] and [[Greek diaspora]]s. More recently, it has been applied to emigrant groups that continue their involvement in their homeland from overseas, such as the category of long-distance nationalists identified by [[Benedict Anderson]]. Brubaker notes that (as examples): Albanians, Basques, Hindu Indians, Irish, Japanese, Kashmiri, Koreans, Kurds, Palestinians, and Tamils have been conceptualized as diasporas in this sense. Furthermore, "labor migrants who maintain (to some degree) emotional and social ties with a homeland" have also been described as diasporas.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=2}}

In further cases of the use of the term, "the reference to the conceptual homeland – to the 'classical' diasporas – has become more attenuated still, to the point of being lost altogether". Here, Brubaker cites "transethnic and transborder linguistic categories...such as [[French language|Francophone]], [[English language|Anglophone]] and [[Lusophone]] 'communities'", along with Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Confucian, Huguenot, Muslim and Catholic 'diasporas'.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|pp=2–3}} Brubaker notes that, {{as of|2005|lc=on}}, there were also academic books or articles on the [[Dixie]], white, liberal, gay, queer and digital diasporas.{{sfn|Brubaker|2005|p=14}}

Some observers have labeled evacuation from [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]] the [[New Orleans diaspora]], since a significant number of evacuees have not been able to return, yet maintain aspirations to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/katrina-evacuees-economic-impact-new-homes-destinations/19614294/|title=The Economic Impact of the 'Katrina Diaspora'|first=Bruce|last=Kennedy|work=Daily Finance|date=31 August 2010|access-date=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4203360.stm|title=Katrina scatters a grim diaspora|first=Will|last=Walden|work=BBC News|date=1 September 2005|access-date=23 February 2011}}</ref> Agnieszka Weinar (2010) notes the widening use of the term, arguing that recently, "a growing body of literature succeeded in reformulating the definition, framing diaspora as almost any ''population'' on the move and no longer referring to the specific ''context'' of their existence".{{sfn|Weinar|2010|p=75}} It has even been noted that as charismatic Christianity becomes increasingly globalized, many Christians conceive of themselves as a diaspora, and form an imaginary that mimics salient features of ethnic diasporas.<ref>{{cite web|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=Listening for Geographies|url=http://works.bepress.com/elizabeth_mcalister/28/|publisher=Routledge|access-date=5 November 2012}}</ref>

Professional communities of individuals no longer in their homeland can also be considered diaspora. For example, science diasporas are communities of scientists who conduct their research away from their homeland.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=William|title=The Potential of Science Diasporas|journal=Science & Diplomacy|date=9 December 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2013/potential-science-diasporas}}</ref> In an article published in 1996, [[Khachig Tölölyan]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tölölyan|first=Khachig|title=Rethinking Diaspora(s): Stateless Power in the Transnational Moment|journal=Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies |date=December 1996|volume=3|issue=36|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/diaspora_a_journal_of_transnational_studies/summary/v005/5.1.tololyan.html}}</ref> argues that the media have used the term corporate diaspora in a rather arbitrary and inaccurate fashion, for example as applied to “mid-level, mid-career executives who have been forced to find new places at a time of corporate upheaval” (10) The use of [[corporate diaspora]] reflects the increasing popularity of the diaspora notion to describe a wide range of phenomena related to contemporary migration, displacement and transnational mobility. While corporate diaspora seems to avoid or contradict connotations of violence, coercion, and unnatural uprooting historically associated with the notion of diaspora, its scholarly use may heuristically describe the ways in which corporations function alongside diasporas. In this way, corporate diaspora might foreground the racial histories of diasporic formations without losing sight of the cultural logic of [[late capitalism]] in which corporations orchestrate the transnational circulation of people, images, ideologies and capital.

==African diasporas==
{{Further|African diaspora}}
One of the largest diasporas of modern times is that of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]ns, which dates back several centuries. During the [[Atlantic slave trade]], 9.4 to 12 million people from [[West Africa]] survived transportation to the [[Americas]] and arrived there as [[slavery|slaves]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title="Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=5 January 2014}}</ref> This population and their descendants were major influences on the culture of [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[New World]] colonies.  Prior to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, millions of Africans had moved and settled as merchants, seamen, and slaves in different parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].  From the 8th through the 19th centuries, an Arab-controlled [[slave trade]] dispersed millions of Africans to Asia and the islands of the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>Jayasuriya, S. and Pankhurst, R. eds. (2003) ''The African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean''.  Trenton: Africa World Press{{ISBN?}}</ref>

Currently, migrant{{vague|date=August 2019}} Africans can only enter thirteen African countries without advanced visas.  In pursuing a unified future, the [[African Union]] (AU) will{{When|date=August 2019}} allow people to move freely between the 54 countries of the AU under a visa free passport and encourage migrants to return to Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/05/africa/african-union-passport/index.html|title=African Union launches all-Africa passport|last=Monks|first=Kieron|website=CNN|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>

The largest Asian diaspora, and in the world, is the [[Indian people|Indian]] diaspora. The overseas Indian community, estimated at over 17.5 million, is spread across many regions in the world, on every continent. It constitutes a diverse, heterogeneous and eclectic global community representing different regions, languages, cultures, and faiths (see [[Desi]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/at-17-5-million-indian-diaspora-largest-in-the-world-un-report/articleshow/71179163.cms?from=mdr|title=At 17.5 million, Indian diaspora largest in the world : UN report|date=2019-09-18|work=The Economic Times}}</ref> Similarly, the [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering roughly 12 million in Europe<ref>{{cite web |title=Roma |url=https://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/roma#:~:targetText=For%20more%20than%20a%20thousand,biggest%20ethnic%20minority%20in%20Europe. |website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |language=en |date=11 August 2012}}</ref> trace their origins to the [[Indian subcontinent]], and their presence in Europe is first attested to in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="kenrick_intro">{{cite book |last=Kenrick |first=Donald | title= Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies)|edition=2nd |publisher=Scarecrow Press|year= 2007|page= xxxvii |quote= The Gypsies, or Romt it is generally accepted that they did emigrate from northern India some time between the 6th and 11th centuries, then crosanies, are an ethnic group that arrived in Europe around the 14th century.

The earliest known Asian diaspora of note is the [[Jewish diaspora]]. With roots in the [[Babylonian Captivity]] and later migration under [[Hellenistic Period|Hellenism]], the majority of the diaspora can be attributed to the Roman conquest, expulsion, and enslavement of the Jewish population of [[Judea]],<ref>[[Josephus]] [http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/war-6.htm War of the Jews] 9:2.</ref> whose descendants became the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]], and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahim]] of today,<ref>{{harvnb|Tubb|1998|pp=13–14}}</ref><ref>Ann E.

C. |last2=Cartier |first2=Carolyn L. |isbn=978-0-7425-1756-1 }}</ref> first occurred thousands of years ago. The mass emigration that occurred from the 19th century to 1949 was caused mainly by wars and starvation in [[mainland China]], as well as political corruption. Most migrants were illiterate or poorly educated peasants, called by the now-recognized racial slur [[coolies]] (Chinese: 苦力, literally "hard labor"), who migrated to developing countries in need of labor, such as the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and other places.

At least three waves of [[People of Nepal|Nepalese diaspora]] can be identified. The earliest wave dates back to hundreds of years as early marriage and high birthrates propelled Hindu settlement eastward across Nepal, then into [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]]. A backlash developed in the 1980s as Bhutan's political elites realized that Bhutanese Buddhists were at risk of becoming a minority in their own country. At least 60,000 ethnic [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] from [[Bhutan]] have been resettled in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = 7 November 2007 | work = BBC News | access-date = 25 April 2008}}</ref> A second wave was driven by British recruitment of mercenary soldiers beginning around 1815 and resettlement after retirement in the British Isles and Southeast Asia. The third wave began in the 1970s as land shortages intensified and the pool of educated labor greatly exceeded job openings in Nepal. Job-related emigration created Nepalese enclaves in India, the wealthier countries of the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Current estimates of the number of Nepalese living outside Nepal range well up into the millions.

In [[Thailand|Siam]], regional power struggles among several kingdoms in the region led to a large diaspora of ethnic Lao between the 1700s–1800s by Siamese rulers to settle large areas of the Siamese kingdom's northeast region, where Lao ethnicity is still a major factor in 2012. During this period, Siam decimated the Lao capital, capturing, torturing, and killing the Lao king [[Anuwongse]].

==European diasporas==
{{Further|European diaspora}}
[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.png|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Greek Homeland and Diaspora 6th century BCE]]
European history contains numerous diaspora-like events. In ancient times, the trading and colonising activities of the [[ancient Greeks|Greek]] tribes from the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] spread people of Greek culture, religion and language around the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] basins, establishing Greek [[city-states]] in [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Sicily]], [[southern Italy]]), northern [[Libya]], eastern [[Spain]], the [[south of France]], and the Black Sea coasts. Greeks founded more than 400 colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072424354/student_view0/chapter10/table_of_contents.html |title= Early development of Greek society |publisher= Highered.mcgraw-hill.com |access-date= 5 January 2014 |url-status= dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306063142/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072424354/student_view0/chapter10/table_of_contents.html |archive-date= 6 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Tyre and Carthage also colonised the Mediterranean.

[[Alexander the Great]]'s the conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]], characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], with Greek ruling-classes established in [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egypt]], [[Seleucid Empire|southwest Asia]] and [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|northwest India]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc1/lectures/10hellenism.html|title= Hellenistic Civilization|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195541/http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc1/lectures/10hellenism.html|archive-date= 5 July 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Subsequent waves of colonization and migration during the Middle Ages added to the older settlements or created new ones, thus replenishing the [[Greek diaspora]] and making it one of the most long-standing and widespread in the world.

The [[Migration Period|Migration-Period]] relocations, which included several phases, are just one set of many in history. The first phase Migration-Period displacement (between CE 300 and 500) included relocation of the [[Goths]] ([[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]]), [[Vandals]], [[Franks]], various other [[Germanic people]]s ([[Burgundians]], [[Lombards]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], [[Suebi]], [[Alemanni]], [[Varangian]]s and [[Normans]]), [[Alans]] and numerous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]]. The second phase, between CE 500 and 900, saw [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], [[Turkic people|Turkic]], and other tribes on the move, resettling in [[Eastern Europe]] and gradually leaving it predominantly Slavic, and affecting [[Anatolia]] and the [[Caucasus]] as the first Turkic tribes ([[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Pechenegs]]), as well as [[Bulgars]], and possibly [[Magyars]] arrived. The last phase of the [[Migration Period|migrations]] saw the coming of the Hungarian Magyars. The [[Vikings|Viking]] expansion out of [[Scandinavia]] into southern and eastern Europe, [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. The recent application of the word "diaspora" to the Viking lexicon highlights their cultural profile distinct from their predatory reputation in the regions they settled, especially in the North Atlantic.<ref>Jesch, J. ''A Viking Diaspora'', London, Routledge.</ref> The more positive connotations associated with the social science term helping to view the movement of the Scandinavian peoples in the Viking Age in a new way.<ref>Adrams, L. "Diaspora and Identity in the Viking Age", ''Early Medieval Europe'', '''vol. 20'''(1),  pp. 17–38.</ref>

Such colonizing migrations cannot be considered indefinitely as diasporas; over very long periods, eventually, the migrants assimilate into the settled area so completely that it becomes their new mental homeland. Thus the modern Magyars of Hungary do not feel that they belong in the Western [[Siberia]] that the Hungarian Magyars left 12 centuries ago; and the [[England|English]] descendants of the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] do not yearn to reoccupy the plains of Northwest Germany.

In 1492 a Spanish-financed expedition headed by [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[Americas]], after which European exploration and colonization rapidly expanded. Historian [[James Axtell]] estimates that 240,000 people left Europe for the Americas in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |first= James |last= Axtell |title= The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America |journal= Humanities |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071952/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |archive-date=19 November 2009 |date=September–October 1991 | issue= 5| volume= 12| pages= 12–18 |jstor= 4636419}}</ref> Emigration continued.

Other Europeans moved to Siberia, Africa, and Australasia.

A specific 19th-century example is the [[Irish diaspora]], beginning in the mid-19th century and brought about by ''An Gorta Mór'' or "the Great Hunger" of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]]. An estimated 45% to 85% of Ireland's population emigrated to areas including Britain, the United States of America, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and [[New Zealand]]. The size of the Irish diaspora is demonstrated by the number of people around the world who claim Irish ancestry; some sources put the figure at 80 to 100 million.

From the 1860s the [[Circassians|Circassian]] people, originally from Europe, [[Circassian diaspora|were dispersed]] through Anatolia, Australia, the Balkans, the Levant, North America, and West Europe, leaving less than 10% of their population in the homeland – parts of historical Circassia (in the modern-day [[Russia]]n portion of the [[North Caucasus|Caucasus]]).

The [[Scottish Diaspora]] includes large populations of Highlanders moving to the United States and Canada after the [[Highland Clearances]]; as well as the Lowlanders, becoming the [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] in Ireland and the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish in America.]]

Much of [[Siberia]]'s [[Demographics of Siberia|population]] has its origins in internal migration – voluntary or otherwise – from [[European Russia]] since the 16th century.

==Twentieth century==

The twentieth century saw huge population movements. Some involved large-scale transfers of people by government action. Some migrations occurred to avoid conflict and warfare. Other diasporas formed as a consequence of political developments, such as the end of [[colonialism]].

=== World War II, colonialism and post-colonialism ===

As [[World War II]] (1939-1945) unfolded, [[Nazi Germany | Nazi German]] authorities deported and killed millions of Jews; they also enslaved or murdered millions of other people, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]] and other [[Slavs]]. Some Jews fled from persecution to unoccupied parts of western Europe or to the Americas before borders closed. Later, other eastern European refugees moved west, away from [[Soviet Union | Soviet]] expansion<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirmus.ee/baltic_archives_abroad_2006/participants.html |title= An International Conference on the Baltic Archives Abroad |publisher= Kirmus.ee |access-date= 5 January 2014 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120213140758/http://www.kirmus.ee/baltic_archives_abroad_2006/participants.html |archive-date= 13 February 2012 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> and from the [[Iron Curtain]] regimes established as World War II ended. Hundreds of thousands of these anti-Soviet political refugees and [[displaced person]]s ended up in western Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States of America.

After World War II, the Soviet Union and [[Communism | Communist]]-controlled [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Yugoslavia]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950) | expelled millions]] of [[ethnic Germans]], most them descendants of immigrants who had settled in those areas centuries previously. This was allegedly in reaction to German Nazi invasions and to pan-German attempts at annexation.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Most of the refugees moved to [[Western world | the West]], including western Europe, and with tens of thousands seeking refuge in the United States.

[[Spain]] sent{{cn|date=June 2020}} many political activists into exile during the rule of [[Francisco Franco| Franco]]'s military regime from 1936 to his death in 1975.

Prior to World War II and the re-establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948, a series of anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s broke out in the [[Arab world]] and caused many to flee, mostly to Palestine/Israel. The [[1947–1949 Palestine war | 1948 Israeli War of Independence]] likewise saw several hundred thousand{{quantify|date=June 2020}} Jews expelled from the [[West Bank]],<ref>

===The Cold War and the formation of post-colonial states===
During and after the [[Cold War]]-era, huge populations of refugees migrated from conflict, especially from then-[[developing countries]].

Upheaval in the Middle East and Central Asia, some of which related to power struggles between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], produced new refugee populations that developed into global diasporas.

In [[Southeast Asia]], many [[Vietnamese people]] emigrated to [[France]] and later millions to the United States, Australia and Canada after the Cold War-related [[Vietnam War]] of 1955-1975. Later, 30,000 [[French people |French]] ''colons'' from [[Cambodia]] were displaced after being expelled by the 1975-1979 [[Khmer Rouge]] regime under [[Pol Pot]].{{Citation needed|date= August 2008}} A small, predominantly Muslim ethnic group, the [[Cham (Asia) |Cham people]], long residing in Cambodia, were nearly eradicated.<ref>

In [[Southwest China]], many [[Tibetan people]] emigrated to India, following the [[14th Dalai Lama]] after the failure of his [[1959 Tibetan uprising]]. This wave lasted until the 1960s, and another wave followed when Tibet opened up to trade and [[tourism]] in the 1980s. It is estimated{{by whom?|date=June 2020}} that about 200,000 Tibetans live now dispersed worldwide, half of them in [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]].

[[Uganda]] expelled [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda| 80,000 South Asians in 1972]] and took over their businesses and properties. The 1990-1994 [[Rwandan Civil War]] between rival social/ethnic groups ([[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]]) turned deadly and produced a mass efflux of refugees.

A South Korean diaspora movement during the 1990s caused the homeland fertility rate to drop when a large amount of the middle class emigrated, as the rest of the population continued to age.
