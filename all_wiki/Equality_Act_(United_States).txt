}}The '''Equality Act''' is a bill in the [[United States Congress]], that, if passed, would amend the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] to prohibit [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] in [[employment]], [[housing]], [[public accommodations]], [[public education]], [[federal funding]], [[credit (finance)|credit]], and the [[jury system]].<ref name="hrc">{{cite web|title=The Equality Act|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-equality-act|publisher=[[Human Rights Campaign]]}}</ref> While the Supreme Court's June 2020 ruling in ''[[Bostock v.

The Equality Act seeks to incorporate protections against LGBT discrimination into the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights law]].

== History ==

=== Early history (1970s–1990s) ===
The original Equality Act was developed by U.S. Representatives [[Bella Abzug]] (D-NY) and [[Ed Koch]] (D-NY) in 1974. The Equality Act of 1974 sought to amend the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to include prohibition of discrimination on the basis of [[sex]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[marital status]] in federally assisted programs, housing sales, rentals, financing, and brokerage services. The bill authorized civil actions by the [[Attorney General of the United States]] in cases of discrimination on account of sex, sexual orientation, or marital status in public facilities and public education. On June 27, 1974, the bill was referred to the [[House Committee on the Judiciary]], but did not proceed to a vote in the full [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/15692?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22equality+act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=43|title=Congress - Equality Act|date=2017|publisher=[[United States Congress]]}}</ref> 

From 1994, the more narrow [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) was introduced, but faced opposition over whether transgender Americans would be protected. An expanded version of ENDA which included both sexual orientation and gender identity in its protections passed the [[United States Senate]]  in 2013, but did not advance in the House.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/5554531/equality-act-lgbt-rights-trump/|title=Why Federal Laws Don't Explicitly Ban Discrimination Against LGBT Americans|first=Katy|last=Steinmetz|date=2013-03-21|accessdate=2019-04-09|publisher=Time Magazine}}</ref>

== Public opinion ==
{{See also|Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States}}

A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May/June 2019 found that most Americans do not know that LGBT people lack federal protections. Only one-third of respondents knew that such protections do not exist on the basis of transgender identity, and only one-quarter knew that they don't exist on the basis of lesbian, gay, and bisexual identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-stonewall-equality-idUSKCN1TC120|title=Americans' perception of LGBTQ rights under federal law largely incorrect: Reuters/Ipsos|last=Caspani|first=Maria|date=2019-06-12|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-06-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20190612/StonewallFinalResults.pdf|title=Ipsos Poll Conducted for Reuters: Stonewall Anniversary Poll|date=6 June 2019|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref>

A nationwide and state-by-state poll on the issue conducted throughout 2017 by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] as part of the annual ''American Values Atlas'' survey revealed that 70% of Americans, including a majority in every state, supported laws that would protect [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people against [[discrimination]], while 23% opposed such laws, and 8% had no opinion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emerging Consensus on LGBT Issues: Findings From the 2017 American Values Atlas|url=https://www.prri.org/research/emerging-consensus-on-lgbt-issues-findings-from-the-2017-american-values-atlas/|website=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PRRI - American Values Atlas|url=http://ava.prri.org/#lgbt/2017/States/lgbtdis/2,3,9|website=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=70% Of Americans Support LGBT Anti-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.newnownext.com/70-of-americans-support-lgbt-non-discrimination-laws/02/2016/|publisher=[[NewNowNext]]}}</ref>

A poll conducted by [[Quinnipiac University]] in April 2019 found that 92% of American voters believed that employers should not be allowed to fire someone based on their sexual orientation or sexual identity, while only 6% believed that employers should be allowed to do so. A wide consensus on this question was found among both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters, as well as Independents, although Democratic voters were slightly more likely to believe that this kind of discrimination should be illegal, with only 1% of them believing that employers should be allowed to fire someone based on their sexual orientation or sexual identity.<ref name="qu poll">{{Cite web|url=https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2618|title=U.S. Voters Still Say 2-1 Trump Committed Crime, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; But Voters Oppose Impeachment 2-1|last=University|first=Quinnipiac|date=May 2, 2019|website=QU Poll|language=en|access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref>

On March 20, 2019, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] sent a letter addressed to the [[United States Senate]] that opposed the Equality Act on the grounds of [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of religion]], among other concerns.<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/marriage/promotion-and-defense-of-marriage/upload/Equality-Act-Letter-to-Congress-Senate-1.pdf USCCB 3-20-19 Letter to Congress on the Equality Act]</ref>

On May 7, 2019, a coalition of Christian organizations sent a letter to the House of Representatives to state opposition to the Equality Act, which they said "undermines religious freedom, and threatens charitable nonprofits and the people they serve, regulates free speech, hinders quality health care, and endangers the privacy and safety of women and girls." In addition to four committee chairs of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, signers included leaders from the [[Christian Legal Society]], the Center for Law and Religious Freedom, the [[Center for Public Justice]], the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], the [[Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission]] of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], the Lutheran Center for Religious Liberty (affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod]]), the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities, and the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://erlc.com/resource-library/policy-briefs/erlc-joins-coalition-in-opposition-to-h-r-5-the-equality-act|title=ERLC joins coalitions in opposition to H.R. 5, the Equality Act|last=Staff|first=Policy|date=2019-04-06|website=ERLC|language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>

[[Bill Donohue]] president of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] has asserted that "The Equality Act is the most comprehensive assault on religious liberty, the right to life, and privacy rights ever packaged into one bill." Donohue also stated his concern that "Catholic hospitals would no longer be allowed to govern as Catholic facilities, threatening healthcare for everyone, especially the poor."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicleague.org/equality-act-is-madness-on-stilts/|title=EQUALITY ACT IS MADNESS ON STILTS|last=Bill|website=Catholic League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>

On May 16, 2019, Sister Carol Keehan, president of the [[Catholic Health Association]] sent a letter to lawmakers in the House expressing concern that the Act, as written, would roll back religious liberty protections. "Federal law has long recognized that certain services can present conflict for some faith-based health care providers with religious or moral objections to providing those services, and protected them from having to do so. We are concerned that the Equality Act omits and could erode or reduce those protections." The legislation, she noted, "lacks conscience protection language and precludes application of RFRA ([[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]])."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/051619-cha-letter-on-equality-act.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title=Dear Representative:|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>

On May 13, 2019, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] released a statement that read in part, “The Equality Act now before Congress is not balanced and does not meet the standard of fairness for all.

In August 2019, the White House issued a statement, "The Trump Administration absolutely opposes discrimination of any kind and supports the equal treatment of all; however, the House-passed bill in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/08/27/trump-white-house-responds-taylor-swifts-equality-act-petition/2135744001/|title=White House responds to Taylor Swift after she calls out President Trump at the VMAs|last=Henderson|first=Cydney|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}

==Supreme Court ruling on [[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia]]==
On June 15th, 2020, the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia|ruled]] that Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. LGBTQ rights advocates welcomed the ruling and reaffirmed support for passage of the Equality Act, noting that the ruling only covered employment and in many states LGBTQ people still lack non-discrimination protections in housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and jury service which would be covered under the Equality Act.<ref>https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-supreme-court-is-on-right-side-of-history-for-lgbtq-rights</ref><ref>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lgbtq-supreme-court-ruling-merkley-equality-act_n_5ee7c734c5b655d06c1e6b95</ref><ref>https://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20200615_supreme-court-workplace-protections-lgbtq-employees</ref>
