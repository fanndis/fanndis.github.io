The word "silicon" in the name originally referred to the large number of innovators and manufacturers in the region specializing in [[silicon]]-based [[MOS transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]] chips. The area is now home to many of the world's largest [[Technology company|high-tech corporations]], including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the [[Fortune 1000]], and thousands of [[startup company|startup companies]]. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the [[venture capital]] investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and [[startup ecosystem]] for high-tech innovation. It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based [[integrated circuit]], the [[microprocessor]], and the [[microcomputer]], among other technologies, were developed. As of 2013, the region employed about a quarter of a million [[information technology]] workers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monthly employment continues upward climb|url=http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|publisher=Silicon Valley Index|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130924195800/http://www.siliconvalleyindex.org/index.php/economy/employment|archivedate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>

As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], the term "Silicon Valley" has come to have two definitions: a narrower geographic one, referring to [[Santa Clara County]] and southeastern [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], and a [[metonym]]ical definition referring to high-tech businesses in the entire [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. The term Silicon Valley is often used as a [[synecdoche]] for the American high-technology [[economic sector]]. The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired [[List of places with "Silicon" names|similar named locations]], as well as [[List of research parks|research parks]] and [[List of technology centers|technology centers]] with a comparable structure all around the world.

Due to the personal connection between people and computer technology, many headquarters of companies in Silicon Valley are a hotspot for [[tourism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/16-silicon-valley-landmarks-you-must-visit-on-your-next-trip-2015-10|title=16 Silicon Valley landmarks you must visit on your next trip|first=Biz|last=Carson|website=Business Insider|access-date=July 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725181218/https://www.businessinsider.com/16-silicon-valley-landmarks-you-must-visit-on-your-next-trip-2015-10|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/tech-headquarters-you-can-visit-in-silicon-valley-2993787|title=Tech Headquarters You Can Visit in Silicon Valley|website=TripSavvy|access-date=July 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725181222/https://www.tripsavvy.com/tech-headquarters-you-can-visit-in-silicon-valley-2993787|archive-date=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/03/why-the-headquarters-of-iconic-tech-companies-are-tourist-attractions.html|title=Why the headquarters of iconic tech companies are now among America's top tourist attractions|first=Ellen|last=Sheng|date=December 3, 2018|website=CNBC|access-date=July 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726015719/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/03/why-the-headquarters-of-iconic-tech-companies-are-tourist-attractions.html|archive-date=July 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Origin of the term ==
The popularization of the name is credited to [[Don Hoefler]].<ref name="Malone_Page_xix" /> He first used it in the article "Silicon Valley USA", which appeared in the January 11, 1971 issue of the weekly trade newspaper ''[[Electronic News]]''.<ref name="DH-71">{{cite web |last1=Laws |first1=David |title=Who named Silicon Valley? |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-named-silicon-valley/ |website=Computer History Museum |date=January 7, 2015 |accessdate=October 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016203301/http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-named-silicon-valley/ |archive-date=October 16, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, it took about a decade before the term came into common use.<ref name="Malone_Page_xix" /> The term gained widespread use in the early 1980s, at the time of the introduction of the [[IBM PC]] and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.

Silicon Valley was born through the intersection of several contributing factors including a skilled science research base housed in area universities, plentiful [[venture capital]], and steady [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] spending. [[Stanford University]] leadership was especially important in the valley's early development. Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success.<ref name=Castells2011p52>{{cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |author-link=Manuel Castells |year=2011 |title=The Rise of the Network Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FihjywtjTdUC&pg=PT52 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |page=52 |isbn=978-1-4443-5631-1 |access-date=March 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222854/https://books.google.com/books?id=FihjywtjTdUC&pg=PT52 |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 23, 1899, the first [[ship-to-shore]] wireless telegraph message to be received in the US was from the San Francisco lightship outside the [[Golden Gate]], signaling the return of the American fleet from the [[Philippines]] after their victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnZRwXzjNnMC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103|title=Lighthouses of the Pacific Coast|last=Leffingwell|first=Pamela Welty, Randy|date=2010|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=9781610604383|language=en}}</ref> The ship had been outfitted with a wireless telegraph transmitter by a local newspaper, so that they could prepare a celebration on the return of the American sailors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Jane|title=Electronics in the West: The First Fifty Years|year=1967|publisher=National Press Books|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PBCAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> Local historian [[Clyde Arbuckle]] states in ''Clyde Arbuckle's History of San Jose''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arbuckle|first1=Clyde|title=Clyde Arbuckle's History of San Jose|date=1986|publisher=Memorabilia of San Jose|location=San Jose, CA|pages=380}}</ref> that "California first heard the click of a telegraph key on September 11, 1853.  It marked completion of an enterprise begun by a couple of San Francisco Merchants' Exchange members named George Sweeney and Theodore E. Baugh…"  He says, "In 1849, the gentleman established a [[Wigwag (flag signals)|wigwag]] telegraph station a top a high hill overlooking [[Portsmouth Square|Portsmouth Squares]] for signaling arriving ships… The operator at the first station caught these signals by telescope and relayed them to the Merchant's Exchange for the waiting business community."  Arbuckle points to the historic significance the [[Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco)]] and [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco]] when he goes on to say "The first station gave the name ''Telegraph'' to the hill on which it was located.  It was known as the Inner Station; the second, as the Outer Station.  Both used their primitive mode of communication until Messrs. Sweeney and Baugh connected the Outer Station directly with the Merchants's Exchange by electric telegraph Wire."

According to Arbuckle (p.&nbsp;380–381) Sweeney and Baugh's line was strictly an intra-city, San Francisco-based service; that is until California State Telegraph Company enfranchised on May 3, 1852; whereas, O.E. Allen and C. Burnham led the way to "build a line from San Francisco to [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] via San Jose, [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], and [[Sacramento]]".  Delays to construction occurred until September 1853; but, "…San Jose became the first station on the line when the wire arrived here on October 15.  The line was completed when [James] Gamble's northbound crew met a similar crew working southward from Marysville on October 24."

The Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology. In 1909, [[Charles Herrold]] started the first [[radio]] station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Later that year, Stanford University graduate [[Cyril Frank Elwell|Cyril Elwell]] purchased the U.S. patents for [[Arc converter|Poulsen arc]] radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in [[Palo Alto]]. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.<ref name=Sturgeon>{{cite book |last=Sturgeon |first=Timothy J. |year=2000 |chapter=How Silicon Valley Came to Be |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLxzUW4V_2cC&pg=PA15 |editor-last=Kenney |editor-first=Martin |title=Understanding Silicon Valley: The Anatomy of an Entrepreneurial Region |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLxzUW4V_2cC |publisher=Stanford University |isbn=978-0-8047-3734-0 |access-date=March 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905220513/https://books.google.com/books?id=CLxzUW4V_2cC |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1933, [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Air Base Sunnyvale]], California, was commissioned by the [[United States Government]] for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS Macon]] in [[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)|Hangar One]]. The station was renamed NAS [[Moffett Field]], and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html|title=Moffett Field History|first=Dave|last=Black|work=moffettfieldmuseum.org|accessdate=April 19, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406011808/http://moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html|archivedate=April 6, 2005}}</ref> A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA, forerunner of [[NASA]]) took over portions of Moffett Field for [[aeronautics]] research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with [[aerospace]] firms, such as [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], which was Silicon Valley's largest employer from the 1950s into 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/why-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-dont-innovate-anymore/604969/ |title=Silicon Valley Abandons the Culture That Made It the Envy of the World |last=Madrigal |first=Alexis C. |date=January 15, 2020 |website=The Atlantic |url-status=live |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115160317/https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/why-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-dont-innovate-anymore/604969/ |archive-date=January 15, 2020 }}</ref>

;Ham radio
The Bay Area was an early center of [[ham radio]] with about 10% of the operators in the United States. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and [[Charles Litton, Sr.|Charles Litton]], who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay Area, were hobbyists with training in technology gained locally who participated in the development of [[shortwave radio]] by the ham radio hobby. [[High frequency]], and especially, [[Very high frequency]], VHF, transmission in the 10-meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse which controlled vacuum tube manufacture. Litton, founder of [[Litton Industries]], pioneered manufacturing techniques which resulted in the award of wartime contracts to manufacture transmitting tubes for [[radar]] to [[Eimac|Eitel-McCullough]], a San Bruno firm, which manufactured power-grid tubes for radio amateurs and aircraft radio equipment.<ref name=MSV13-40>{{cite book|first1=Christophe|last1=Lécuyer|title=Making Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930–1970|date=August 24, 2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62211-0|pages=13–40}}</ref>

;Welfare capitalism
A union organizing drive in 1939–1940 at Eitel-McCullough by the strong Bay Area labor movement was fought off by adoption of a strategy of [[welfare capitalism]] which included pensions and other generous benefits, profit sharing, and such extras as a medical clinic and a cafeteria.

=== Stanford University ===
[[Stanford University]], its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of this area.<ref name="Markoff">{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|title=Searching for Silicon Valley|last=Markoff|first=John|date=April 17, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 17, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429065011/http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|archivedate=April 29, 2011}}</ref> Some examples include the work of [[Lee De Forest]] with his invention of a pioneering vacuum tube called the [[Audion]] and the oscilloscopes of [[Hewlett-Packard]].

A very powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the (American) West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development.<ref>Stephen B. Adams, "Regionalism in Stanford's Contribution to the Rise of Silicon Valley", ''Enterprise & Society'' 2003 4(3): 521–543</ref>

After World War II, [[Frederick Terman]], as Stanford University's dean of the school of engineering, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies.

During 1955–1985, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory|Shockley Semiconductor]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]. In 1969, the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised [[ARPANET]], predecessor to the [[Internet]].<ref>Christophe Lécuyer, "What Do Universities Really Owe Industry?

;Stanford Industrial Park 
After World War II, universities were experiencing enormous demand due to returning students. To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand [[ink jet printer]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1984.htm|title=History of Computing Industrial Era 1984–1985|work=thocp.net|accessdate=April 19, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428155324/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1984.htm|archivedate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> Other early tenants included [[Eastman Kodak]], [[General Electric]], and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Stanford Research Park: The Engine of Silicon Valley|url=http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanford-research-park.php|work=PaloAltoHistory.com|accessdate=March 29, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329094048/http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanford-research-park.php|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>

Up until the late 1950s, [[germanium]] was the dominant [[semiconductor]] material for [[transistors]] and other [[semiconductor devices]]. Germanium was initially considered the more effective semiconductor material, as it was able to demonstrate better performance due to higher [[carrier mobility]].<ref name="Dabrowski6">{{cite book |last1=Dabrowski |first1=Jarek |last2=Müssig |first2=Hans-Joachim |chapter=6.1.

In 1953, [[William Shockley]] left [[Bell Labs]] in a disagreement over the handling of the invention of the [[bipolar transistor]]. After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]], in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the "simple" transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the "[[traitorous eight]]". Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]], would go on to found [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Goodheart |first=Adam |date=July 2, 2006 |title=10 Days That Changed History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02goodheart.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902050843/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02goodheart.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=September 2, 2017  }}</ref><ref name=SV110>{{cite book |last1=McLaughlin |first1=John |last2=Weimers |first2=Leigh |last3=Winslow |first3=Ward |year=2008 |title=Silicon Valley: 110 Year Renaissance |url=http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/silicon-valley-110-year-renaissance-book/|publisher=[[Silicon Valley Historical Association]]|isbn=978-0-9649217-4-0|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152340/http://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/silicon-valley-110-year-renaissance-book/ |archivedate=April 2, 2015  }}</ref>

=== Homebrew Computer Club ===
{{Main|Microcomputer revolution}}
[[File:Invitation to First Homebrew Computer Club meeting.jpg|thumb|Invitation to first Homebrew Computer Club meeting, 1975.]]
The [[Homebrew Computer Club]] was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, [[Electronic circuit|circuits]], and information pertaining to [[DIY]] construction of computing devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/homebrew_and_how_the_apple.php|title=Homebrew And How The Apple Came To Be|work=atariarchives.org|accessdate=April 19, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407041946/http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/homebrew_and_how_the_apple.php|archivedate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> It was started by [[Gordon French]] and [[Fred Moore (activist)|Fred Moore]] who met at the Community Computer Center in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.<ref name=Dormouse>{{cite book |last=Markoff |first=John |year=2006 |orig-year=2005 |title=What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFbjjwEACAAJ |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978-0-14-303676-0 |access-date=March 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905223806/https://books.google.com/books?id=NFbjjwEACAAJ |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first meeting was held as of March 1975 at French's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[San Mateo County, California]]; which was on occasion of the arrival of the [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] [[Altair 8800|Altair]] microcomputer, the first unit sent to the area for review by [[People's Computer Company]].

=== Venture capital ===

By the early 1970s, there were many [[semiconductor]] companies in the area, [[computer]] firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both. Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of [[venture capital]] on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3&nbsp;billion [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.<ref name="WRichardScott" />

In 1971 [[Don Hoefler]] traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]'s eight co-founders.<ref name=DH-71 /><ref name="NetValley">[http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the "Golden" Startups of Silicon Valley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601012834/http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html |date=June 1, 2013 }} by Gregory Gromov</ref> The key investors in [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] were from the same group, directly leading to ''[[Tech Crunch]]'' 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 Trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.<ref name=Morris-2014>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |title=The First Trillion-Dollar Startup |work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first=Rhett |last=Morris |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151949/https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/the-first-trillion-dollar-startup/ |archive-date=February 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Law firms===
Prior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced [[patent attorney]]s whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property.  During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley.  One sign of the rapid expansion of Silicon Valley legal services was that Palo Alto law firm [[Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati]] "expanded from a dozen attorneys in 1975 to more than 700 by 2000".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Stephen B. |last2=Chambers |first2=Dustin |last3=Schultz |first3=Michael |title=A moving target: The geographic evolution of Silicon Valley, 1953–1990 |journal=Business History |date=2018 |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=859–883 |doi=10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612 |s2cid=157613638 }}</ref>  During this era, law firms evolved from their "conventional role" as protectors of intellectual property into business advisers, intermediaries, and dealmakers, and thereby acquired "unusual prominence" in Silicon Valley.<ref name="WRichardScott">{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=W.

=== Software ===
Although semiconductors are still a major component of the area's economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and [[Internet]] services. Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.

Using money from [[NASA]], the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], and [[DARPA|ARPA]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as [[The Mother of All Demos]].  Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] at SRI was also involved in launching the [[ARPANET]] (precursor to the [[Internet]]) and starting the [[InterNIC|Network Information Center]] (now [[InterNIC]]). [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].

While Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.<ref>[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001230844/http://www.apple-history.com/gui.html |date=October 1, 2002 }} from apple-history.com</ref> Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over [[Stanford University]]'s [[Ethernet]] [[campus network]].<ref>{{cite book |first = John K. |last = Waters |date= 2002 |title= John Chambers and the Cisco Way: Navigating Through Volatility  |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=  9780471273554| page = 28}}</ref>

===Internet age===
{{main|Internet}}
Commercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s.

In 1995, commercial use of the [[Internet]] grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and the predecessor to [[Craigslist]] began operations.<ref name=N1995>{{cite book|author1=W.

====Dot-com bubble====
{{main|dot-com bubble}}
Silicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the [[dot-com bubble]], which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the [[NASDAQ]] [[stock market]] began to decline dramatically in April 2000. During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels. For a brief time, [[Sand Hill Road]] was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe [[traffic congestion]].

====21st century====
After the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world. A 2006 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115352188346314087 Reed Albergotti, "The Most Inventive Towns in America"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203065605/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115352188346314087 |date=December 3, 2017 }} ''Wall Street Journal'', July 22–23, 2006, P1.</ref> San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Silicon Valley is also home to a significant number of "[[Unicorn (finance)|Unicorn]]" ventures, referring to [[Startup company|startup companies]] whose [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] has exceeded $1&nbsp;billion [[United States dollar|dollars]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Unicorn List|url=http://fortune.com/unicorns/xiaomi-1/|accessdate=April 6, 2015|magazine=Fortune|date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411235623/http://fortune.com/unicorns/xiaomi-1/|archivedate=April 11, 2015}}</ref> However, taxes and the cost of living in Silicon Valley have prompted some corporations to gradually transfer their operations to the Midwest or Sun Belt states.<ref>{{cite web
