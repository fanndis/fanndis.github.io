==Location==
According to the USGS, the [[epicenter]] of the earthquake was about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=in}} off the coast of [[Pelluhue]], a town in the [[Maule Region]]. This is about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=in}} west of the village of Chovellén, {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=in}} southwest of the town of Pelluhue and at a point approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=in}} away from the following four provincial capitals: [[Talca]] (to the north-east), [[Linares, Chile|Linares]] (to the east), [[Chillán]] (to the south-east) and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] (to the south).<ref name="USGS"/> Chile's Seismological Service located the quake's epicenter at about {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=in}} off the coast of [[Ñuble Region]] in the [[Biobío Region]]. This is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=in}} north of Concepción and {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=in}} south-west of Talca.<ref name="sismologia"/>

== Seismology and geology ==
{{Main|Nazca Plate|geology of Chile}}
The earthquake took place along the boundary between the [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]] and [[South American Plate|South American]] [[tectonic plates]], at a location where they [[convergent boundary|converge]] at a rate of eighty millimeters (3&nbsp;in) a year. This earthquake was characterized by a [[thrust fault|thrust-faulting]] [[focal mechanism]], caused by the [[subduction]] of the Nazca plate beneath the South American Tectonic Plates.<ref name="USGS"/> The end-regions of the [[earthquake rupture|rupture zone]] coincided with the Andean [[orocline]]s of Maipo (33° S) and Arauco (37° S). This has been interpreted as suggesting a link between upper plate (South American plate) [[structural geology|structure]] and rupture length.<ref name=Jara-MuHInoz2015>{{Citation

Chile has been at a convergent plate boundary that generates [[megathrust earthquake]]s since the [[Paleozoic]] era (500 million years ago). In historical times the Chilean coast has suffered many megathrust earthquakes along this plate boundary, including the strongest earthquake ever measured, which is the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]]. Most recently, the boundary ruptured, causing the [[2007 Tocopilla earthquake]] in northern Chile.

The segment of the fault zone which ruptured in this earthquake was estimated to be over {{Convert|700|km|abbr=on}} long with a displacement of almost 10 meters, or 120 years of accumulated plate movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/highlights/chileearthquakeFeb2010.html |title=Chile Earthquake &#124; Magnitude 8.8 |publisher=British Geological Survey |date=27 February 2010 |accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref> It lay immediately north of the {{Convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} segment which ruptured in the great earthquake of 1960.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fountain|first=Henry|title=Underwater Plate Cuts 400-Mile Gash|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/world/americas/28quake.html|date=27 February 2010|accessdate=27 February 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100303235619/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/world/americas/28quake.html| archive-date= 3 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Preliminary measurements show that the entire South American Plate moved abruptly westward during the quake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/chilemoves.htm |title=Researchers show how far South American cities moved in quake, Research News, Ohio State University, March 8, 2010 |publisher=Researchnews.osu.edu |accessdate=23 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412040819/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/chilemoves.htm |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> A research collaborative of Ohio State and other institutions have found, using [[GPS]], that the earthquake shifted Santiago 28&nbsp;cm (11&nbsp;in) to the west-southwest and moved Concepción at least {{convert|3|m|0}} to the west.

=== Humanitarian response ===
{{Main|Humanitarian response to the 2010 Chile earthquake|Timeline of relief efforts after the 2010 Chile earthquake}}
Despite President [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s earlier statement that Chile would only ask for international aid once it had assessed the extent of the damage,<ref name="Impulsobaires"/> leaders of many countries and intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations and [[European Union]], responded to the earthquake and sent messages of condolence to the government and people of Chile over the loss of lives and property. [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], the United States, United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, Singapore, [[Haiti]], and [[Pakistan]] were among the countries that responded earliest following the quake.<ref name="xinhuanet1">{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-02/28/c_13191071.htm|title=Int'l community offers sympathy, aid to quake-stricken Chile |date=28 February 2010|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97466&Itemid=2 Associated Press of Pakistan: ''President Saddened by Chile Earthquake; Conveys Solidarity to Govt, People of Chile''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130012932/http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97466&Itemid=2 |date=30 November 2011 }}.

Chilean television host [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]] led a [[telethon]] called ''[[Chile helps Chile]]'' with the goal of raising 15 billion [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (about US$29 million) needed to build 30,000 emergency houses ("[[mediagua]]s"). The charity event, which ran for 24 hours in Santiago starting on Friday 5 March at 22:00, was summoned by the government and organized by several Chilean NGOs. At 23:00 on Saturday the goal was doubled, collecting 30.2 billion pesos (about US$58 million).<ref name="details">{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/contenido/661_230917_9.shtml |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=[[La Tercera]] |title=Así será el programa de televisión Chile Ayuda a Chile. |accessdate=4 March 2010 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713185307/http://www.latercera.com/contenido/661_230917_9.shtml |archive-date=13 July 2011 }}</ref>

== Conditions in the aftermath ==

=== Chaos and disorder ===
Nearly half the places in the country were declared "catastrophe zones", and curfews were imposed in some areas of looting and public disorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/centenares-de-personas-saquearon-supermercado-en-concepcion/prontus_nots/2010-02-28/093816.html|title=Centenares de personas saquearon supermercado en Concepción|date=28 February 2010|publisher=cooperativa.cl|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> On 28 February 2010, a day after the earthquake, some affected cities were chaotic, with extensive looting of [[supermarkets]] in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. Items stolen included not only food and other necessities, but also electronic goods and other durable merchandise. To control vandalism, a special force of [[Carabineros de Chile|''carabineros'']] (police) was sent to disperse rioters with [[tear gas]] and water cannons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100228/83563/Turba-saquea-varios-supermercados-en-Chile-tras-caos-generado-por-el-sismo-de-88-grados-de-magnitud |title=Turba saquea varios supermercados en Chile tras caos generado por el sismo de 8.8 grados de magnitud |date=28 February 2010 |publisher=Peru.com |accessdate=28 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303122838/http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100228/83563/Turba-saquea-varios-supermercados-en-Chile-tras-caos-generado-por-el-sismo-de-88-grados-de-magnitud |archive-date=3 March 2010 }}</ref> However, measures were taken late. The outgoing president didn't want to remind people of the Dictatorship years by militarizing the streets, thus failed to provide assistance on time to the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} When the situation became unsustainable and all sectors of the population were demanding actions, the government authorized the use of the military to control the affected cities. Despite these and other government acts (including the [[curfew]]s), pillaging continued in both urban and rural areas of the affected zones.<ref name="Ya son 723">{{cite news|url=http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100301/83678/Ya-son-723-los-muertos-por-el-fuerte-terremoto-de-88-grados-que-destruyo-gran-parte-de-Chile |title=Ya son 723 los muertos por el fuerte terremoto de 8.8 grados que destruyó gran parte de Chile |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Peru.com |accessdate=1 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808211411/http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100301/83678/Ya-son-723-los-muertos-por-el-fuerte-terremoto-de-88-grados-que-destruyo-gran-parte-de-Chile |archive-date=8 August 2011 }}</ref> Reportedly, military police arrested 160 in Concepción on 1 and 2 March.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8542789.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chile troops tackle quake looters | date=1 March 2010| accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>

In Concepción, despite the militarization of the zone, mobs continued to steal from supermarkets and went as far as to set one store ablaze.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100301/83810/Saqueos-y-violencia-azotan-Chile-tras-terremoto-de-88-grados- |title=Saqueos y violencia azotan Chile tras terremoto de 8.8 grados |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Peru.com |accessdate=1 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305060507/http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100301/83810/Saqueos-y-violencia-azotan-Chile-tras-terremoto-de-88-grados- |archive-date=5 March 2010 }}</ref> The government warned looters they would face the full weight of the law, as penalties for stealing are increased under a state of catastrophe. A week after the quake the police—tipped by neighbors—arrested three people with massive quantities of looted goods stashed in their homes. Other looted goods such as mattresses, furniture, television sets and other electronic appliances were abandoned in the streets of Concepción during the following days.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/7397527/Chile-earthquake-looters-return-1.3-million-of-stolen-goods.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Chile earthquake: looters return £1.3 million of stolen goods | date=8 March 2010| accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>

According to the [[BBC]] on 5 March, the city and fishing port of [[Talcahuano]], which lies but a few kilometers down the coast from Concepción, has been left largely to fend for itself. Neighbourhood vigilante groups, including one led by a public works employee with a gun license, and the few police present allow such behavior as residents' siphoning fuel from tanks at a petrol station, but step in if someone starts to attack a cash machine. One man stated, "I've personally saved dozens of people from attack in this apartment block."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8550960.stm|title=Lawlessness after quake in Chile fishing village|publisher=BBC|author=Will Grant|date=5 March 2010|accessdate=5 March 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100306053307/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8550960.stm| archive-date= 6 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Chileans living in regions not affected by the earthquake (including those living abroad) also grieved, as they sought to learn more regarding kinsmen and friends affected by the earthquake. In the hardest-hit zones there was no communication with the exterior because of the failure of electricity and the destruction of telephone lines.<ref name="Ya son 723"/>

===Prison escape===
In the prison of [[El Manzano (prison)|El Manzano]] in Concepción, a [[prison riot]] began after a failed escape attempt by the inmates. Different parts of the prison were set afire and the riot was brought under control only after the guards shot into the air and received help from military units.<ref name=elmerc>[[El Mercurio]], 1 March. Cuerpo C, page C13</ref>

By 1 March, prison guards in a prison in [[Chillán]] had recaptured 36 of 203 prisoners who had escaped following the earthquake. During their escape, prisoners burned seven houses close to the prison. A witness in [[Chillán]] asserted that he had been robbed by prisoners with a machine gun who had also forced his [[girlfriend]] to kiss them. Another witness alleged [[sexual abuse|sexual molestation]] by around twenty men who were believed to be escaped prisoners. The leading Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'' described the situation in Chillán as reminiscent of the "[[Wild West]]".<ref name=elmerc/>

===Government response===
Four hours after the earthquake, when the death count was still low, President Bachelet gave a press conference in which she informed the population of the situation and stated that Chile did not yet need international aid.<ref name="Impulsobaires">{{cite news|url=http://www.impulsobaires.com.ar/nota.php?id=86211|title=Turba Terremoto en Chile: Aumenta el número de fallecidos.

However, about two million people were affected by the quake with more than 500,000 houses uninhabitable. In many cities, people slept in tents, in parks or simply on the streets for fear of aftershocks. The government began distributing food and other vital aid around the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-01/chile-orders-curfew-amid-quake-chaos/346148?section=justin |date=28 February 2010 |title=Chile orders curfew amid quake chaos |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>

On 28 February, President Bachelet said that her government had reached an agreement with the major supermarkets which would allow them to give away basic foodstuffs in stock to people affected by the earthquake.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/02/28/chile.quake/ | work=CNN | title=Security concerns spread as Chile quake death toll rises | date=28 February 2010| accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>
By 28 February, the [[Santiago Metro]] rapid-transit network was already partially up and running and expected to be fully operative on the following day, 1 March.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/metro-comprometio-para-el-lunes-restablecimiento-total-del-servicio/prontus_nots/2010-02-28/121510.html |title=Balance: 160 personas fueron detenidas durante la noche |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref>

On 4 March, President-elect [[Sebastián Piñera]], who assumed office on 11 March, was quoted as saying that his goals were "to cope with the emergency needs of citizens, find people who are still missing, provide prompt and timely assistance to the sick and wounded, and restore law and order so that people can return to peace."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8550140.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rebuilding Chile 'to take years' | date=4 March 2010| accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>

=== Economic recovery ===
Authorities of the central port city of San Antonio speaking on 3 March 2010, stated that the port had returned to eighty percent of capacity. On the same date, Raul Maturana, a spokesman for the Federation of Port Workers' union, stated that the port of Valparaíso was operating normally. However, ports in southern Chile, which were closer to the epicenter, remained closed.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aW.tGFQaicJs Chile’s San Antonio Port Returns to 80% Capacity (Update1)], Bloomberg, Rodrigo Orihuela(Buenos Aires) and James Attwood, 3 March 2010.</ref>

On 4 March, President Bachelet said that Chile would need international loans and three to four years to rebuild.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSN03127528._CH_.2400 | work=Reuters | first=Terry | last=Wade | title=Chile wants loans, focuses on aid for quake areas | date=5 March 2010| accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>

===Food scarcity===
On 10 March the National Commission for Agricultural emergencies (CNEA) assured that milk and wheat prices would not rise, despite fears of lack of fuel supply for transport and harvest of these products. In the same CNEA report the mill associations of central and southern Chile are said to have expressed that they had currently no production difficulties.<ref>[http://www.sag.gob.cl/OpenNews/asp/pagDefault.asp?argInstanciaId=1&argNoticiaId=504&argEdicionId=9 Minagri anuncia que consecuencias de terremoto no afectarán abastecimiento de trigo y leche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010339/http://www.sag.gob.cl/OpenNews/asp/pagDefault.asp?argInstanciaId=1&argNoticiaId=504&argEdicionId=9 |date=7 July 2011 }}, 10 March 2010.</ref> Despite this on 11 March newspaper [[La Segunda]] cited the president of the bakeries association complaining on unjustified price rises for flour, who said of cases of price rises of 10 to 20%.<ref>[http://www.la2da.cl/modulos/generacion/mobileASP/detailNew.asp?idNoticia=C4R1E70FT20100311&strNamePage=LUCSGEC26SG1103.jpg&codCuerpo=701&iNumPag=26&strFecha=2010-03-11&iPage=3&tipoPantalla=24 Molineros aseguran normal abastecimiento de harina, pero panaderos acusan alzas en precios], [[La Segunda]], 11 March 2010.</ref>

The earthquake affected production at the [[Compañía de Cervecerías Unidas]] (CCU) and Cervecería Chile factories that together have a 90% share of the Chilean beer market. With an average annual per capita consumption of 36 liters, scarcity caused prices to rise from 990–1500 to 2000 [[Chilean peso]]s per litre. CCU responded by increasing capacity of their plant in [[Temuco]] that did not suffer major damage during the earthquake and by importing beer from their factories in Argentina. 50 trucks with beer are reported to have reached Santiago from Argentina. In March 2010, ten CCU executives said that the country will not run out of beer and that within two to three months production levels would be normalized.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rodrigo Bustamante Santiago de Chile |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/03/100309_0140_chile_sismo_cerveza_gz.shtml |title=El sismo hace escasear la cerveza en Chile |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> Liquor store owners expressed complaints regarding a beer [[rationing]] scheme implemented by CCU.

;Antarctica
The [[U.S. Antarctic Program]]'s coastal station along the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], [[Palmer Station]], went on a tsunami alert shortly after the earthquake struck Chile. To prepare for a possible tsunami, station personnel removed all Zodiac boats from the water and moved any materials from low-lying areas that waves could have swept away. Personnel also retreated to the station's highest building, GWR, while the tsunami warning was in effect, Ellis said. Palmer personnel developed a tsunami emergency plan following the 2004 earthquake in the Indian Ocean that created a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in 14 countries. While no noticeable tsunami occurred at Palmer, the station tide monitor displayed bumps of several centimeters, signifying that a small wave had indeed reached the shores of Anvers Island.<ref>{{cite web |title=Not shaken|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=2045|publisher=[[The Antarctic Sun]] |date=3 March 2010 | accessdate= 11 April 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Center]] (JATWC) sent out tsunami warnings for [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

As a result of the warnings, patrolled beaches in New South Wales and Queensland remained closed (red flags) and lifeguards ushered people to leave the water. However beach goers and surfers ignored the warnings. Numerous onlookers also crowded parts of the shore to view potential effects of the tsunami.<ref name=newscom>{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/national/tsunami-threatens-australia-new-zealand-hawaii-pacific-rim/story-e6frfkvr-1225835186186 | accessdate =28 February 2010 | work=news.com.au | title=Tsunami beach ban cancelled in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Pacific Rim | date=28 February 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100301235417/http://www.news.com.au/national/tsunami-threatens-australia-new-zealand-hawaii-pacific-rim/story-e6frfkvr-1225835186186| archive-date= 1 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>
