==History==

===Founding and establishment ===
{{See also|Goldman–Sachs family}}
Goldman Sachs was founded in New York City in 1869 by [[Marcus Goldman]].<ref>{{cite news | first1=Leah Nathans | last1=Spiro | first2=Stanley | last2=Reed | title=Inside the Money Machine-In a big-is-all business, Goldman vows to go it alone | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1997-12-21/inside-the-money-machine | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=December 22, 1997}}</ref> In 1882, Goldman's son-in-law [[Samuel Sachs]] joined the firm.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770464,00.html | title=Business & Finance: Cash & Comeback | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=November 9, 1936 |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/21/goldman-sachs-fraud-case-personal-finance-gs.html#1b2ef41476b3|title=The Evolution Of Goldman Sachs|last=Beattie|first=Andrew|date=|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> In 1885, Goldman took his son Henry and his son-in-law Ludwig Dreyfuss into the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Endlich|first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Endlich|title=Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success|publisher=[[A.A.

Goldman entered the [[initial public offering]] market in 1906 when it took [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] public.<ref name="Cohan2012"/> The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman's personal friendship with [[Julius Rosenwald]], an owner of Sears.<ref name="Cohan2012" /> Other IPOs followed, including [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F. W. Woolworth]] and [[Continental Can]].<ref name="Cohan2012"/> In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits.<ref name="Cohan2012" />

In 1917, under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned.<ref name="Cohan2012" /> The Sachs family gained full control of the firm until [[Waddill Catchings]] joined the company in 1918.<ref name="Cohan2012" /> By 1928, Catchings was the Goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm.<ref name="Cohan2012" />

On December 4, 1928, the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp, a [[closed-end fund]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2011-07-20/goldman-sachs-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly|title=Goldman Sachs, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|date=July 20, 2011|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=August 1, 2017}}</ref> The fund failed during the [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and [[insider trading]].<ref name="Cohan2012"/>

===Mid-20th century===
In 1930, the firm ousted Catchings, and [[Sidney Weinberg]] assumed the role of senior partner and shifted Goldman's focus away from trading and toward [[investment banking]].<ref name="Cohan2012"/> Weinberg's actions helped to restore some of Goldman's tarnished reputation. Under Weinberg's leadership, Goldman was the lead advisor on the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s IPO in 1956, a major coup on Wall Street at the time. Under Weinberg's reign, the firm started an investment research division and a [[municipal bond]] department, and it became an early innovator in [[risk arbitrage]].<ref name="Cohan2012" />

In the 1950s, [[Gus Levy]] joined the firm as a securities trader, where two powers fought for supremacy, one from investment banking and one from securities trading. Levy was a pioneer in [[block trade|block trading]] and the firm established this trend under his guidance. Due to Weinberg's heavy influence, the firm formed an investment banking division in 1956 in an attempt to shift focus off Weinberg.<ref name="Cohan2012" />

In 1969, Levy took over Weinberg's role as Senior Partner and built Goldman's trading franchise once again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Endlich|first=Lisa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDionNrrBqwC&q=1969+levy&pg=PA62|title=Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success|date=2000-03-09|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-86968-1|location=|pages=62|language=en}}</ref> Levy is credited with Goldman's famous philosophy of being "long-term greedy," which implied that as long as money is made over the long term, short-term losses are bearable. At the same time, partners reinvested nearly all of their earnings in the firm.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Endlich|first=Lisa|authorlink=Lisa Endlich|title=Goldman Sachs: The Culture Of Success|publisher=[[A.A.

Another financial crisis for the firm occurred in 1970, when the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] went bankrupt with over $80 million in [[commercial paper]] outstanding, most of it issued through Goldman Sachs. The bankruptcy was large, and the resulting lawsuits, notably by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], threatened the partnership capital, life, and reputation of the firm.<ref name="cohan_wpost2012">{{cite news

=== Subprime mortgage crisis: 2007–2008 ===
During the 2007 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], Goldman profited from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in summer 2007 by [[short (finance)|short-selling]] subprime [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]. Two Goldman traders, Michael Swenson and [[Josh Birnbaum]], are credited with being responsible for the firm's large profits during the crisis.<ref name="FinancialTimes2010December10AllowayTracy">{{cite news|last1=Alloway|first1=Tracy|title=Goldman's uneasy subprime short|url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/12/10/433571/goldmans-uneasy-subprime-short/|accessdate=June 3, 2012|agency=Nikkei|issue=Alphaville|publisher=Financial Times|date=December 10, 2010|language=English|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2788346/Subprime-star-Josh-Birnbaum-leaves-Goldman.html Subprime star Josh Birnbaum leaves Goldman.

By summer 2007, they persuaded colleagues to see their point of view and convinced skeptical risk management executives.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/21/goldmansachs.useconomy |title=Success shines unwelcome spotlight on to Goldman Sachs|work=The Guardian |date=December 21, 2007 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Clark |access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref> The firm initially avoided large subprime write-downs and achieved a net profit due to significant losses on non-prime [[securitization|securitized]] loans being offset by gains on short mortgage positions. The firm's viability was later called into question as the crisis intensified in September 2008.

On October 15, 2007, as the crisis had begun to unravel, [[Allan Sloan]], a senior editor for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine, wrote:<ref>{{cite news | url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/12/goldman-sachs-house-of-junk-mortgage-bonds/ | title=Goldman Sachs' House of Junk | first=Allan | last=Sloan | authorlink=Allan Sloan | publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=October 16, 2007 }}</ref>
<blockquote>So let's reduce this macro story to human scale. Meet GSAMP Trust 2006-S3, a $494 million drop in the junk-mortgage bucket, part of the more than half-a-trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities issued last year. We found this issue by asking mortgage mavens to pick the worst deal they knew of that had been floated by a top-tier firm - and this one's pretty bad.
It was sold by Goldman Sachs - GSAMP originally stood for Goldman Sachs Alternative Mortgage Products but now has become a name itself, like [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and [[3M]].
This issue, which is backed by ultra-risky second-mortgage loans, contains all the elements that facilitated the housing bubble and bust. It's got speculators searching for quick gains in hot housing markets; it's got loans that seem to have been made with little or no serious analysis by lenders; and finally, it's got Wall Street, which churned out mortgage "product" because buyers wanted it. As they say on the Street, "When the ducks quack, feed them."</blockquote>

==Current operations==
The company includes 4 business units, as follows:<ref name="reutersoverview">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/investor-day-2020/presentations/consolidated-presentations.pdf  | title=Company Overview (GS) | accessdate=January 20, 2020| publisher=Goldman Sachs}}</ref>

===Investment Banking===
In 2015, [[investment banking]] accounted for 21% of total company revenues.

[[Investment banking]] includes financial advisory (mergers and acquisitions, investitures, corporate defense activities, [[restructuring]], and spin-offs) and underwriting (capital raises, public offerings, and [[private placements]] of equity and debt instruments).

Goldman Sachs is one of the leading M&A advisory firms, often topping the [[Thomson Financial league tables]] in sizes of transactions. The firm gained a reputation as a white knight in the mergers and acquisitions sector by advising clients on how to avoid unfriendly [[hostile takeover]]s. During the 1980s, Goldman Sachs was the only major investment bank with a strict policy against helping to initiate a hostile takeover, which increased the firm's reputation immensely among sitting management teams at the time.

===Global Markets===
In 2017, Global Markets accounted for 37% of revenues.

The segment is divided into four divisions and includes Fixed Income (the trading of interest rate and [[credit (finance)|credit]] products, [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], [[Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS)|insurance-linked securities]] and structured and derivative products), Currency and Commodities (the trading of currencies and commodities), Equities (the trading of equities, [[equity derivative]]s, [[structured product]]s, [[option (finance)|options]], and [[futures contract]]s), and Principal Investments (merchant banking investments and funds). This segment consists of the revenues and profit gained from the Bank's trading activities, both on behalf of its clients (known as [[flow trading]]) and for its own account (known as [[proprietary trading]]).

===Asset Management===
In 2015, asset management accounted for 18% of total company revenues.<ref name="reutersoverview" />

The Asset Management division provides investment advisory and financial planning services and offers investment products (primarily through [[separately managed account]]s and commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide. The division provides [[clearing (finance)|clearing]], financing, [[custodian bank|custody]], securities lending, and reporting services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, and pension funds. The division generates revenues primarily in the form of spreads, or management and transaction fees.<ref name="reutersoverview" />

===Employees' views===
In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity derivatives sales business in [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa]] (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing touch with the company's culture, which he described as "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years". Smith said that advising clients "to do what I believe is right for them" was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a "toxic and destructive" environment in which "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as "[[Wikt:muppet|muppets]]" and colleagues callously talked about "ripping their clients off".<ref name=topexec>{{cite news | title=Top Goldman executive quits over culture of 'toxic' greed | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/top-goldman-sachs-executive-quits-over-culture-of-toxic-greed-7566430.html | first=John | last=Hall | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=March 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="NewYorkTimes2012March14SmithGreg">{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Greg|title=Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html|accessdate=March 14, 2012|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Opinions|page=A27|work=New York Times|date=March 14, 2012|location=New York, N.Y., United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref> In reply, Goldman Sachs said that "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming "this fundamental truth lies at the heart of how we conduct ourselves", and that "we don't think [Smith's comments] reflect the way we run our business".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/03/goldman-sachs | title=A noisy exit | first=Joseph | last=Schumpeter | work=[[The Economist]] | date=March 14, 2012}}</ref> Later that year, Smith published a book titled ''Why I left Goldman Sachs''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21565219-insider%E2%80%99s-take-goldman-sachs-strikes-nerve-mammon-and-muppets | title=Of Mammon and muppets | work=[[The Economist]] | date=October 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name="NewYorkTimes2012October19StewartJames">{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=James|title=A Tell-All on Goldman Has Little Worth Telling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/business/why-i-left-book-about-goldman-falls-short.html|accessdate=May 16, 2017|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Business|page=B1|work=New York Times|date=October 19, 2012|location=New York, N.Y., United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref>

===Personnel "revolving-door" with U.S. government===
During 2008 Goldman Sachs received criticism for an apparent [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] relationship, in which its employees and consultants have moved in and out of high-level U.S. Government positions, creating the potential for conflicts of interest.

In April 2010, Goldman director [[Rajat Gupta]] was named in an insider-trading case. It was said Gupta had "tipped off a hedge-fund billionaire", [[Raj Rajaratnam]] of [[Galleon Group]], about the $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008#Impacts on financial institutions|financial crisis of 2007-2008]]. According to the report, Gupta had told Goldman the month before his involvement became public that he wouldn't seek re-election as a director.<ref name="james-npr">James, Frank, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/04/goldman_sachs_director_linked.html "Goldman Sachs Director Tied To Insider-Trading Scandal"], [[NPR]], April 23, 2010.

===Abacus synthetic CDOs and SEC lawsuit ===

Unlike many investors and investment bankers, Goldman Sachs anticipated the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] that developed in 2007-8.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2009December24MorgensonGretchen">{{cite news|last1=Morgenson|first1=Gretchen|last2=Story|first2=Louise|title=Banks Bundled Bad Debt, Bet Against It and Won|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/business/24trading.html|accessdate=April 14, 2010|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Business|page=A1|work=New York Times|date=December 24, 2009|location=New York, N.Y., United States|language=English|url-access=limited}} ''This article describes the intricate links between Goldman Sachs trader, Jonathan M. Egol, synthetic collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O., ABACUS, and asset-backed securities index (ABX)''</ref> Some of its traders became "bearish" on the housing boom beginning in 2004 and developed mortgage-related securities, originally intended to protect Goldman from investment losses in the housing market. In late 2006, Goldman management changed the firm's overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative. As the market began its downturn, Goldman "created even more of these securities", no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but, according to business journalist Gretchen Morgenson, "enabling it to pocket huge profits" from the mortgage defaults and that Goldman "used the C.D.O.'s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes".<ref name="NewYorkTimes2009December24MorgensonGretchen" /> Authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera stated that "the firm's later insistence that it was merely a 'market maker' in these transactions - implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients - became less true over time"-<ref>{{cite book | author=McLean and Nocera | title=All the Devils Are Here | page=271}}</ref>

The investments were called [[synthetic CDO]]s because unlike regular [[collateralized debt obligation]]s, the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans, but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults - the insurance known as "[[credit default swap]]s". Goldman and some other hedge funds held a "short" position in the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the "long" position. The longs were responsible for paying the insurance "claim" to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted. Through April 2007, Goldman issued over 20 CDOs in its "Abacus" series worth a total of $10.9 billion.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2010April16StoryLouise">{{cite news|last1=Story|first1=Louise|last2=Morgenson|first2=Gretchen|title=S.E.C.

But while Goldman was praised for its foresight, some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion worth of the securities either carried "junk" ratings or had defaulted.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/abacus-let-goldman-shuffle-mortgage-risk-like-beads-20100418-smx3.html | title=Abacus Let Goldman Shuffle Mortgage Risk Like Beads | first1=Jody | last1=Shenn | first2=Bob | last2=Ivry | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=April 16, 2010}}</ref> One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against but also sold to investors, was the $800 million Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006.

Unable to find counterparties to take the long position off its hands, Goldman used Hudson as a means by which it hedged its long position. ... None of which was clear from the Hudson prospectus.

====2010 SEC civil fraud lawsuit====
In April 2010, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) charged Goldman Sachs and one of its vice-presidents, Fabrice Tourre, with securities fraud. The SEC alleged that Goldman had told buyers of a [[synthetic CDO]], a type of investment, that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent CDO manager, ACA Management. In fact, [[Paulson & Co.]] a [[hedge fund]] that wanted to bet against the investment had played a "significant role" in the selection,<ref name="FCIR-p192">''[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf Financial Crisis Inquiry Report]'', by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011, p.192</ref> and the package of securities turned out to become "one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis" because "less than a year after the deal was completed, 100% of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded".<ref name="WSJ2010April20LucchettiAaron">{{cite news|last1=Lucchetti|first1=Aaron|last2=Ng|first2=Serena|title=Abacus Deal: As Bad as They Come|journal=The Wall Street Journal.

The particular synthetic CDO that the SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1.

The SEC alleged that Goldman "materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents" about the financial security,<ref name="FCIR-p192" /> including the fact that it had "permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market [the hedge fund manager Paulson & Co.] to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party", ACA Management.<ref name="sec21489">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21489.pdf|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|title=Securities and Exchange Commission vs Goldman Sachs & Co & Fabrice Tourre, Complaint (Securities Fraud)|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm | title=SEC Charges Goldman Sachs With Fraud in Structuring and Marketing of CDO Tied to Subprime Mortgages | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 16, 2010}}</ref> The SEC further alleged that "Tourre also misled ACA into believing ... that Paulson's interests in the collateral section [sic] process were aligned with ACA's, when, in reality, Paulson's interests were sharply conflicting".<ref name="sec21489" />

Critics of Goldman Sachs point out that Paulson went to Goldman Sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank, [[Bear Stearns]] who he had asked to build a CDO. Ira Wagner, the head of Bear Stearns's CDO Group in 2007, told the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal Paulson was proposing encouraged Paulson to pick the worst assets.<ref>''Federal Crisis Inquiry Report'', p.193</ref><ref name=Fiderer>{{cite news | title=The Moral Compass Missing From The Greatest Trade Ever | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-moral-compass-missing_b_358856 | last=Fiderer | first=David | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> Describing Bear Stearns's reasoning, one author compared the deal to "a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team".<ref name=Zuckerman>{{cite news | last=Zuckerman|first=Gregory|title=Inside Paulson's Deal with Goldman |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/04/19/inside-paulsons-deal-with-goldman.html|date=April 19, 2010|newspaper=Daily Beast|quote=Scott Eichel, a senior Bear Stearns trader, was among those at the investment bank who sat through a meeting with Paulson but later turned down the idea.

===Alleged commodity price manipulation===
{{Hatnote|See also: [[2000s commodities boom]]}}

A provision of the 1999 financial deregulation law, the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is "complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally".<ref name=devious>{{cite journal | last=Taibbi | first=Matt | title=The Vampire Squid Strikes Again: The Mega Banks' Most Devious Scam Yet | journal=Rolling Stone | date=February 12, 2014 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-vampire-squid-strikes-again-the-mega-banks-most-devious-scam-yet-20140212|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> In the years since the laws passing, Goldman Sachs and other investment banks (Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase) have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials, such as food products, zinc, copper, tin, nickel and, aluminum.

Some critics, such as Matt Taibbi, believe that allowing a company to both "control the supply of crucial physical commodities, and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets", is "akin to letting casino owners who take book on NFL games during the week also coach all the teams on Sundays".<ref name=devious/>

===Unauthorized trades by Goldman Sachs trader Matthew Marshall Taylor===
Former Goldman Sachs trader Matthew Marshall Taylor was convicted of hiding $8.3 billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the [[S&P 500]] index by making "multiple false entries" into a Goldman trading system. When Goldman Sachs management uncovered the trades, Taylor was immediately fired. The trades cost the company $118 million, which Taylor was ordered to repay. In 2013, Taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to 9 months in prison in addition to the monetary damages.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013December6AbramsRachel">{{cite news|last1=Abrams|first1=Rachel|title=Ex-Goldman Trader Sentenced to 9 Months in Prison|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/ex-goldman-trader-sentenced-to-9-months-in-prison/|accessdate=April 21, 2016|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=DealBook|work=New York Times|date=December 6, 2013|location=New York, N.Y., United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref>

====Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the 2005-2008 Food Bubble====
Frederick Kaufman, a contributing editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', argued in a 2010 article that Goldman's creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (now the [[S&P GSCI]]) helped passive investors such as pension funds, mutual funds and others engage in food price [[speculation]] by betting on financial products based on the commodity index. These financial products disturbed the normal relationship between [[supply and demand]], making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://frederickkaufman.typepad.com/files/the-food-bubble-pdf.pdf | title=The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and got away with it | first=Frederick | last=Kaufman | publisher=[[Harper's Magazine]] | date=July 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.democracynow.org/2010/7/16/the_food_bubble_how_wall_street | title=The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and Got Away With It | first1=Amy | last1=Goodman | first2=Juan | last2=Gonzales | first3=Frederick | last3=Kaufman | publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] | date=July 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pacificfreepress.com/news/1/6154-a-global-food-bubble.pdf | title=Global Food Bubble?

====Aluminum price and supply====
In a July 2013 article, [[David Kocieniewski]], a journalist with ''[[The New York Times]]'' accused Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms of "capitalizing on loosened federal regulations" to manipulate "a variety of commodities markets", particularly aluminum, citing "financial records, regulatory documents, and interviews with people involved in the activities".<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid">{{cite news|last1=Kocieniewski|first1=David|title=A Shuffle of Aluminum, but to Banks, Pure Gold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Business|page=A1|work=New York Times|date=July 20, 2013|location=United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref> After Goldman Sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company Metro International in 2010, the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories - to make beer cans, home siding, and other products - went from an average of 6 weeks to more than 16 months, "according to industry records".<ref name=Zamansky /><ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid" /> "Aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at Metro International after Goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since 2010."<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid" /> The price increase has cost "American consumers more than $5 billion" from 2010 to 2013 according to former industry executives, analysts and consultants.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid" /> The cause of this was alleged to be Goldman's ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum - a million and a half tons - in network of 27 Metro International warehouses Goldman owns in Detroit, Michigan.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid" /><ref name=Stanley>{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/07/24/how-goldman-sachs-and-wall-street-manipulate-alumnimum-and-other-commodities | title=The Goldman Sachs Guide To Manipulating Commodities | last=Stanley | first=Marcus | work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] | date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that "at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day". Goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum - not to factories, but "from one warehouse to another" - according to the Times.<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013July20KocieniewskiDavid" />

In August 2013, Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the federal [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] as part of an investigation into complaints that Goldman-owned metals warehouses had "intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum".<ref name="NewYorkTimes2013August12KocieniewskiDavid">{{cite news|last1=Kocieniewski|first1=David|title=U.S. Subpoenas Goldman in Inquiry of Aluminum Warehouses|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/business/us-subpoenas-goldman-in-inquiry-of-aluminum-warehouses.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Business|page=B3|work=New York Times|date=August 12, 2013|location=New York, N.Y., United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref> In December 2013, it was announced that 26 cases accusing Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the two investment banks' warehousing businesses, and the London Metal Exchange in various combinations - of violating U.S. anti-trust laws, would be assigned to [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] Judge [[Katherine B.

According to Lydia DePillis of Wonkblog, when Goldman bought the warehouses it "started paying traders extra to bring their metal" to Goldman's warehouses "rather than anywhere else. The longer it stays, the more rent Goldman can charge, which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium."<ref name=DePillis>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/22/heres-how-goldman-sachs-is-making-your-beer-more-expensive/ | title=Here's how Goldman Sachs is making your beer more expensive | first=Lydia | last=DePillis | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 22, 2013}}</ref> The effect is "amplified" by another company, [[Glencore]], which is "doing the same thing in its warehouse in [[Vlissingen]]".<ref name=DePillis />

Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said the cases are without merit.<ref name=Harris /> Columnist Matt Levine, writing for ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', described the conspiracy theory as "pretty silly", but said that it was a rational outcome of an irrational and inefficient system which Goldman Sachs may not have properly understood.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-11-20/the-goldman-sachs-aluminum-conspiracy-was-pretty-silly | title=The Goldman Sachs Aluminum Conspiracy Was Pretty Silly | first=Matt | last=Levine | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>

====Oil futures speculation====
Investment banks, including Goldman, have also been accused of driving up the price of [[gasoline]] by speculating on the oil [[futures exchange]]. In August 2011, "confidential documents" were leaked "detailing the positions"<ref name=Sheppard/> in the oil futures market of several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, [[Morgan Stanley]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[Barclays]], just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of 2008. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. Journalist Kate Sheppard of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] called it "a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude".<ref name=Sheppard>{{cite news | url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/09/oil-speculators-goldman-sachs | title=$4 Gas: Brought to You by Wall Street | last=Sheppard | first=Kate | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date=September 8, 2011}}</ref> However, another source stated that, "Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world's largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data..."<ref name=sanders>{{cite news | url=http://fuelfix.com/blog/2011/08/29/big-banks-bet-crude-oil-prices-would-fall-in-2008-run-up-leaked-data-show/ | title=Big Banks Bet Crude Oil Prices Would Fall in 2008 Run-Up, Leaked Data Show | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | quote=Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world's largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data released by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. The net positions of the banks undermine arguments made by Sanders that speculative trades on Wall Street drove oil prices in 2008, said Craig Pirrong, director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston. Retail gasoline reached a record $4.08 a gallon on July 7, 2008, and oil peaked at $147.27 a barrel on July 11 that year.}}</ref>

In April 2011, a couple of observers - Brad Johnson of the blog Climate Progress,<ref name=blame/> founded by [[Joseph J. Romm]], and Alain Sherter of [[CBS MoneyWatch]]<ref name=Sherter/> - noted that Goldman Sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil. Climate Progress quoted Goldman as warning "that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation" in petroleum futures, and that "net speculative positions are four times as high as in June 2008", when the price of oil peaked.<ref name=sanders/>

It stated that, "Goldman Sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least $20 higher than supply and demand dictate."<ref name=blame>{{cite web | title=Goldman Sachs Admits Record Speculation To Blame For Skyrocketing Gas Prices | url=https://thinkprogress.org/goldman-sachs-admits-record-speculation-to-blame-for-skyrocketing-gas-prices-2d3eb98320d2/ | first=Brad | last=Johnson | publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] | date=April 13, 2011}}</ref> Sherter noted that Goldman's concern over speculation did not prevent it (along with other speculators) from lobbying against regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish "position limits", which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold, and thus prevent speculation.<ref name=Sherter>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-goldman-sachs-warns-that-speculation-drives-oil-prices-listen-up/ | title=When Goldman Sachs Warns That Speculation Drives Oil Prices, Listen Up | first=Alain | last=Sherter | work=[[CBS News]] | date=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

According to Joseph P. Kennedy II, by 2012, prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by "hedge funds and bankers" pumping "billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price".<ref name="NewYorkTimes2012April10KennedyJoseph" /> The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when <blockquote>just a few years after oil futures began trading on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]], Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.

The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades. Other exemptions followed,<ref name="NewYorkTimes2012April10KennedyJoseph" /></blockquote> and "by 2008, eight investment banks accounted for 32% of the total oil futures market".<ref name="NewYorkTimes2012April10KennedyJoseph">{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Joseph|title=The High Cost of Gambling on Oil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/opinion/ban-pure-speculators-of-oil-futures.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014|agency=The New York Times Company|issue=Opinions|page=A23|work=New York Times|date=April 10, 2012|location=Boston, MA, United States|language=English|url-access=limited}}</ref>

==Political contributions==
Goldman Sachs employees have donated to both major American political parties, as well as candidates and [[super PAC]]s belonging to both parties. According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], Goldman Sachs and its employees collectively gave $4.7 million in the [[2014 United States elections|2014 elections]] to various candidates, [[leadership PAC]]s, political parties, [[527 group]]s, and outside spending entities.<ref>[https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000085 Goldman Sachs: Profile for 2014 Election Cycle], [[Center for Responsive Politics]].</ref> In the 2016 election cycle, Goldman employees were reported ({{as of|2016|September|lc=y}}) to have donated $371,245 to the [[Republican National Committee]] and $301,119 to the [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]].
