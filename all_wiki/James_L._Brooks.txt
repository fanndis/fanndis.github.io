'''James Lawrence Brooks''' (born May 9, 1940) is an American [[film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[screenwriter]].  His television and film work includes ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'', ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', and ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''.

While growing up in [[North Bergen, New Jersey]], Brooks endured a fractured family life and passed the time by reading and writing. After dropping out of [[New York University]], he got a job as an usher at [[CBS]], going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1965 to work on [[David L. Wolper]]'s documentaries. After being laid off he met producer [[Allan Burns]] who secured him a job as a writer on the series ''[[My Mother the Car]]''.

Brooks wrote for several shows before being hired as a story editor on ''[[My Friend Tony]]'' and later created the series ''[[Room 222]]''. [[Grant Tinker]] hired Brooks and Burns at [[MTM Productions]] to create ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' in 1970. The show, one of the first to feature an independent working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several [[Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs from ''Mary Tyler Moore'': ''[[Rhoda]]'' (a comedy) and ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.

Brooks moved into feature film work when he wrote and co-produced the 1979 film ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]''. His next project was the critically acclaimed film ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for all three roles. Basing his next film, ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'', on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work ''[[I'll Do Anything]]'' was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' (co-written with [[Mark Andrus]]) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, 2004's ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]''. His sixth film, ''[[How Do You Know (film)|How Do You Know]]'', was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored [[Cameron Crowe]] on ''[[Say Anything...]]'' (1989) and [[Wes Anderson]] and [[Owen Wilson]] on ''[[Bottle Rocket]]'' (1996).

In 1984, Brooks founded the television and film company, [[Gracie Films]]. Although he did not intend to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. He hired cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] to create [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of shorts]] for the show, which eventually led to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 1989. ''The Simpsons'' won numerous awards and is still running. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. In total, Brooks has received 53 Emmy nominations, winning 21 of them.<ref name="emmys">{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominations/award-search?search_api_views_fulltext=James+L.+Brooks&submit=Search&field_celebrity_details_field_display_name=&field_show_details_field_nominee_show_nr_title=&field_show_details_field_network=All&field_show_details_field_production_company=All&field_nominations_year%5Bmin%5D=&field_nominations_year%5Bmax%5D=&field_nominations_year_op=%3E%3D&field_nominations_year%5Bvalue%5D=1949-01-01&field_nominations_year_1%5Bmin%5D=&field_nominations_year_1%5Bmax%5D=&field_nominations_year_1_op=%3C%3D&field_nominations_year_1%5Bvalue%5D=2019-01-01&field_award_category=All |title=Nominations Search |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Mary Tyler Moore 1993.jpg|thumb|alt=A smiling women wearing a black and white dress holds a golden statuette.|right|Brooks won several Emmy Awards for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'']]
In 1987 the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' described Brooks's career as "a non-stop crescendo."<ref name=doubt/> Although he dropped out of a [[New York University]] public relations course,<ref name=archive/><ref name=nyt/><ref name=worry/><ref name=place/> Brooks' sister got him a job as a host at [[CBS]] in [[New York City]], a job usually requiring a college education, as she was friends with a secretary there.<ref name=archive/> He held it for two and a half years. For two weeks he filled in as a [[Copywriting|copywriter]] for CBS News and was given the job permanently when the original employee never returned. Brooks went on to become a writer for the news broadcasts, joining the [[Writers Guild of America]] and writing reports on events such as the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1965, to write for documentaries being produced by [[David L. Wolper]], something he "still [hasn't] quite figured out how [he] got the guts to do,"<ref name=venice/> as his job at CBS was secure and well-paid. He worked as an associate producer on series such as ''Men in Crisis'', but after six months he was laid off as the company was trying to cut back on expenses.<ref name=archive/> Brooks did occasionally work for Wolper's company again, including on a ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]'' insect special.<ref name=venice/>

Failing to find another job at a news agency, he met producer [[Allan Burns]] at a party. Burns got him a job on ''[[My Mother the Car]]'' where he was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas.<ref name=venice/> Brooks then went on to write episodes of ''[[That Girl]]'',<ref name=venice/> ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''<ref name=worry/> and ''[[My Three Sons]]'' before [[Sheldon Leonard]] hired him as a story editor on ''My Friend Tony''.<ref name=archive/> In 1969 he created for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] the series ''[[Room 222]]'', which lasted until 1974. ''Room 222'' was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by [[Lloyd Haynes]].<ref name=brooksbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/brooksjames/brooksjames.htm|title=Brooks, James L.|author=Horace Newcomb|accessdate=July 12, 2009|publisher=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]}}</ref> The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with [[Gene Reynolds]] who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at [[Los Angeles High School]] for ''Room 222'', and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left ''Room 222'' as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show.<ref name=archive/><ref name=venice/>

Brooks and Burns were hired by CBS programming executive [[Grant Tinker]] to create a series together with [[MTM Productions]] for Tinker's wife [[Mary Tyler Moore]] which became ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.<ref name=brooksbio/> Drawing on his own background in journalism, Brooks set the show in a newsroom. Initially the show was unpopular with CBS executives who demanded Tinker fire Brooks and Burns. However the show was one of the beneficiaries of network president [[Fred Silverman]]'s "[[rural purge]]"; executive Bob Wood also liked the show and moved it into a better timeslot.<ref name=venice/><ref>{{cite news|title=The New South has risen in the post-industrial North|work=[[The News Sun]]|date=March 31, 2006|page=A6}}</ref> Brooks and Burns hired all of the show's staff themselves and eventually ended it of their own accord.<ref name=venice/> ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' became a critical and commercial success and was the first show to feature an independent-minded, working woman, not reliant on a man, as its lead.<ref name=mtmmus/> Geoff Hammill of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] described it as "one of the most acclaimed television programs ever produced" in US [[television]] history.<ref name=mtmmus>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/marytylermo/marytylermo.htm|title=The Mary Tyler Moore Show|publisher=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|last=Hammill |first=Geoff|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> During its seven-year period it received high praise from critics and numerous [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including for three years in a row ''Outstanding Comedy Series''.<ref name=mtmmus/> In 2003 ''[[USA Today]]'' called it "one of the best shows ever to air on TV".<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-04-10-better-sitcoms_x.htm |title=Building a better sitcom |accessdate=October 30, 2007 |work=[[USA Today]] | first1=Robert | last1=Bianco | date=April 11, 2003}}</ref> In 1997 ''[[TV Guide]]'' selected a ''Mary Tyler Moore Show'' episode as the best TV episode ever and in 1999, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' picked Mary's hat toss in the opening credits as television's second greatest moment.<ref name="greatest_ep">{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/mary-tyler-moore/100491 |title=Mary Tyler Moore: TV Guide News |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref><ref name="ewtop100">{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274575,00.html |title=The Top 100 Moments In Television|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 19, 1999}}</ref>

With ''Mary Tyler Moore'' going strong, Brooks produced and wrote the TV film ''[[Thursday's Game]]'',<ref name=brooksbio/> before creating the short-lived series ''[[Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers]]'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title=Name That Show, Part II|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|date=February 20, 2001|page=39}}</ref> He and Burns moved on to ''[[Rhoda]]'', a spin-off of ''Mary Tyler Moore'', taking [[Valerie Harper]]'s character [[Rhoda Morgenstern (fictional character)|Rhoda Morgenstern]] into her own show.<ref>{{cite news|title=One Her Own – Second banana rises to the top as 'Rhoda' gives Harper a post-'Mary Tyler Moore' hit|date=April 17, 2009|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|page=09|author=Michael H. Kleinschrodt}}</ref> It was well received, lasting four years and earning Brooks several Emmys.<ref name="emmys"/> The duo's next project came in 1977 in the shape of ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', a second ''Mary Tyler Moore'' spin-off, which they created along with Tinker. Unlike its source however, the series was a drama starring [[Edward Asner]] as Grant. James Brown of the Museum of Broadcast Communications said it "explore[d] a knotty issue facing media people in contemporary society, focusing on how investigating and reporting those issues impact on the layers of personalities populating a complex newspaper publishing company." The show was also critically acclaimed, twice winning the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]] and also a [[Peabody Award]].<ref name=lougrant>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/L/htmlL/lougrant/lougrant.htm|title=Lou Grant|accessdate=July 18, 2009|publisher=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|first=James|last=Brown}}</ref>

Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 and formed the [[John Charles Walters Company]] along with [[David Davis (TV producer)|David Davis]], [[Stan Daniels]] and [[Ed Weinberger]]. They decided to produce ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', a show about a New York taxi company, which unlike the other MTM Productions focused on the "blue-collar male experience".<ref name=taxi>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/taxi/taxi.htm|title=Taxi|accessdate=July 18, 2009|publisher=The [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|author=Jason Mittel}}</ref> Brooks and Davis had been inspired by the article "Night-Shifting for the Hip Fleet" by [[The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans|Mark Jacobson]], which appeared in the September 22, 1975 issue of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeff Sorensen|title=The Taxi Book|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1987|page=3|isbn=0-312-00691-8}}</ref> The show began on ABC in 1978 airing on Tuesday nights after ''[[Three's Company]]'' which generated high ratings and after two seasons it was moved to Wednesday. Its ratings fell and in 1982 it was canceled; NBC picked it up, but the ratings remained low and it was dropped after one season. Despite its ratings, it won three consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Emmys.<ref name=taxi/> Brooks' last TV show produced before he began making films was ''[[The Associates (U.S. TV series)|The Associates]]'' (1979–1980) for ABC. Despite positive critical attention, the show was quickly canceled.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Short: Madly Manic, I must Say|date=April 26, 1985|author=Tom Shales|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=F1}}</ref>

Alex Simon of ''Venice Magazine'' described Brooks as "[bringing] realism to the previously overstated world of television comedy. Brooks' fingerprints can now be seen in shows such as ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and numerous other shows from the 1980s and 1990s."<ref name=venice>{{cite news|title=James L.

In 1978 Brooks began work on feature films. His first project was the 1979 film ''[[Starting Over (1979 film)|Starting Over]]'' which he wrote and co-produced with [[Alan J. Pakula]].<ref name=dart/> He adapted the screenplay from a novel by [[Dan Wakefield]] into a film ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called "a good-humored, heartening update of traditional romantic comedy" unlike the "drab" novel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sweet, Sour & Sorry|date=October 5, 1979|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Gary Arnold|page=B1}}</ref>

Brooks' next project came in 1983, when he wrote, produced and directed ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', adapting the screenplay from [[Larry McMurtry]]'s novel of the same name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Without Them, There Wouldn't Have Been a Movie|date=February 3, 1984|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|author=Michael Blowen}}</ref> It cost $8.5 million and took four years to film.<ref name=venice/> Brooks won the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Adapted Screenplay]].<ref name=doubt>{{cite news|title=The 'Broadcast News' report – James L. Brooks comes to terms with his doubts|date=December 20, 1987|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Peter Keough|page=Show 1}}</ref>

Brooks was fearful of the attention Oscar success would bring as he would be "deprived of a low profile", finding it "hard to work with the spotlight shining in your eyes." He added: "There's a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being aware of your 'career'. That can be lethal."<ref name=doubt/> He also grew more concerned of the "threatening" corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of "the idea of the creative spirit".<ref name=doubt/> He channeled this ambivalence into ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]''. As a [[romantic comedy]], Brooks felt he could say "something new ... with that form" adding "One of the things you're supposed to do every once in a while as a filmmaker is capture time and place. I was just glad there was some way to do it in a comedy."<ref name=doubt/> He cast [[William Hurt]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Albert Brooks]] (no relation) in the three main roles.<ref name=doubt/>

He wished to set the film in a field he understood and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]], Brooks realised it had "changed so much since I had been near it", and so "did about a year and a half of solid research," into the industry.<ref name=doubt/> When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he "didn't like any of the three [main] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto."<ref name=doubt/> He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for ''Broadcast News''.<ref name=venice/> At the [[38th Berlin International Film Festival]], the film was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]] and Holly Hunter won the [[Berlin Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Silver Bear for Best Actress]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1988/03_preistr_ger_1988/03_Preistraeger_1988.html |title=Berlinale: 1988 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 4, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

His 1994 film ''[[I'll Do Anything]]'', starring [[Nick Nolte]], was conceived and filmed by Brooks as an old-fashioned [[musical film|movie musical]] and parody of "Hollywood lifestyles and movie clichés", costing $40 million.<ref name=any>{{cite news|title=Anything to save the movie James L.

While it was not unusual for Brooks to edit his films substantially after preview screenings on this occasion he was "denied any privacy" because the media reported the negative reviews before its release and "it had to be good enough to counter all this bad publicity."<ref name=any/> It was a commercial failure,<ref name=venice/> and Brooks attempted to produce a documentary about it four years later but was scuppered by failing to obtain the rights to Prince's song.<ref name=worry/>

Brooks agreed to produce and direct ''Old Friends'', a screenplay by [[Mark Andrus]]. Andrus' script "needed you to suspend disbelief" but Brooks realised "my style when directing is that I really don't know how to get people to suspend disbelief." Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: "There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it's the product, really, of a very unusual writing team," and the project became ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', taking a year to produce after funding had been secured.<ref name=venice/> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Brooks "was constantly experimenting, constantly reshooting, constantly re-editing" the film, changing its ending five times and allowing the actors to improvise the film's tone.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/08/movies/a-happily-baffled-director-lets-his-cast-find-its-own-way.html|title=A Happily Baffled Director Lets His Cast Find Its Own Way|accessdate=July 15, 2009|date=December 8, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=James Sterngold}}</ref>

The film garnered more praise than ''I'll Do Anything'' and Brooks was again nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

Brooks did not direct and write a film again for seven years until 2004's ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]''. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of additional filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in "15 to 25 takes" as he did not feel the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast [[Adam Sandler]] in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [while writing]. I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." Brooks's directing style "drove [the cast] bats", especially [[Téa Leoni]], with [[Cloris Leachman]] (who replaced an ill [[Anne Bancroft]] a month into filming) describing it as "free-falling.

His next film, entitled ''[[How Do You Know]]'', was released December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars [[Reese Witherspoon]] as a professional [[softball]] player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they may not even be aware." He created [[Paul Rudd]] and [[Jack Nicholson]]'s characters for this concept.<ref name=hdyk>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/movies/23brooks.html|title=Star-Heavy Big-Budget Love Story Bucks Trend|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 22, 2010|author=Michael Cieply}}</ref> Filming finished in November 2009,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/11/03/reese-witherspoon-sheds-some-light-on-her-untitled-project-with-james-l-brooks/#more-24059|title=Reese Witherspoon Sheds Some Light On Her Untitled Project With James L.

Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32|title=3rd Degree: Harry Shearer|accessdate=September 1, 2006|author=Kuipers, Dean|date=April 15, 2004|publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archivedate = March 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to writer [[Jon Vitti]], Brooks contributed more to the episode "[[Lisa's Substitute]]" than to any other in the show's history.<ref>{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's Substitute"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' garnered critical and commercial acclaim, winning numerous awards and is still producing original content after almost 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=5888441&page=1|title='The Simpsons' Hits a Landmark|author=Bill Keveney|date=September 28, 2008|accessdate=October 2, 2008|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}</ref> In a 1998 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named ''The Simpsons'' the century's best television series.<ref name="century">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993039,00.html|title=The Best Of The Century|accessdate=June 3, 2007|date=December 31, 1999|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]}}</ref> In 1997 Brooks was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/hall-of-fame-honorees|title=Hall of Fame Honorees: Complete List|work=Emmys.org|publisher= Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

In 1995 Brooks and Groening were involved in a public dispute over the episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]". Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute [[advertisement]] for Brooks' show ''[[The Critic]]'' (which had moved to Fox from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for its second season), and was created by former ''The Simpsons'' [[showrunner]]s [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because "articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [Groening] created ''The Critic''", and remove his name from the credits.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news| title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons| author=Brennan, Judy| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=The Times Mirror Company| date=March 3, 1995}}</ref> In response, Brooks said "I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw ''The Critic'' into the Simpsons' universe he was right and we agreed to his changes. Certainly he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. ... He is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten."<ref name="LATimes"/>

''The Critic'' was short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes on Fox before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten internet broadcast [[webisode]]s.
