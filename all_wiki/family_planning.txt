'''Family planning''' services are “the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of involuntary infertility.” <ref>{{Cite book|last=Program|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on a Comprehensive Review of the HHS Office of Family Planning Title X.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215219/|title=Overview of Family Planning in the United States|last2=Butler|first2=Adrienne Stith|last3=Clayton|first3=Ellen Wright|date=2009|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref> Family planning may involve consideration of the number of children a woman wishes to have, including the choice to have no children and the age at which she wishes to have them. These matters are influenced by external factors such as marital situation, career considerations, financial position, and any disabilities that may affect their ability to have children and raise them. If sexually active, family planning may involve the use of [[Birth control|contraception]] and other techniques to control the timing of [[reproduction]].

Family planning has been of practice since the 16th century by the people of [[Djenné]] in [[West Africa]]. Physicians advised women to space their children, having them every three years rather than too many and too quickly. <ref>{{cite book|last1=McKissack|first1=Patricia|url=https://archive.org/details/royalkingdomsofg00patr/page/104|title=The Royal Kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay Life in Medieval Africa|last2=McKissack|first2=Fredrick|publisher=Macmillan|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8050-4259-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/royalkingdomsofg00patr/page/104 104]}}</ref>

Family planning is sometimes used as a synonym or [[euphemism]] for access to and the use of [[contraception]]. However, it often involves methods and practices in addition to contraception. Additionally, many might wish to use contraception but are not necessarily, planning a family (e.g., unmarried adolescents, young married couples delaying childbearing while building a career). Family planning has become a catch-all phrase for much of the work undertaken in this realm. However, contemporary notions of family planning tend to place a woman and her childbearing decisions at the center of the discussion, as notions of women's empowerment and reproductive autonomy have gained traction in many parts of the world. It is usually applied to a [[female]]-[[male]] couple who wish to limit the number of children they have or control pregnancy timing (also known as [[Birth spacing|''spacing children'']]).

Family planning has been shown to reduce teenage birth rates and birth rates for unmarried women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Packham|first=Analisa|date=2017-09-01|title=Family planning funding cuts and teen childbearing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629616303241|journal=Journal of Health Economics|language=en|volume=55|pages=168–185|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2017.07.002|pmid=28811119|issn=0167-6296}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Yao|last2=Slusky|first2=David J.

In 2006, the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) issued a recommendation, encouraging men and women to formulate a reproductive life plan, to help them in avoiding [[unintended pregnancies]] and to improve the health of women and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|year=2006|title=Recommendations to improve preconception health and health care — United States: A report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the select panel on Preconception Care|url=http://www.famplan.org/Resources/Docs/cdc_mmwr.pdf|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=55|issue=RR-6}}</ref>

{{dubious|date=March 2012}}  With these resources a couple, man or woman can explore the options of natural birth, [[surrogacy]], [[artificial insemination]], or [[adoption]]. In the other case, if the person does not wish to have a child at the specific time, they can investigate the resources that are needed to prevent pregnancy, such as [[birth control]], contraceptives, or physical protection and prevention.

There is no clear social impact case for or against conceiving a child. Individually, for most people,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-4/think-having-children-will-make-you-happy|title=Think having children will make you happy?|last=Powdthavee|first=N.|date=n.d.|website=The British Psychological Society|language=en|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref> bearing a child or not has no measurable impact on person well-being. A review of the economic literature on life satisfaction shows that certain groups of people are much happier without children:
* Single parents
* Fathers who both work and raise the children equally.

===Resources===
When women can pursue additional education and paid employment, families can invest more in each child. Children with fewer siblings tend to stay in school longer than those with many siblings. Leaving school in order to have children has long-term implications for the future of these girls, as well as the human capital of their families and communities. Family planning slows unsustainable [[population growth]] which drains resources from the environment, and national and regional development efforts.<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="Family planning/Contraception">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en/|title=Family planning/Contraception|last=World Health Organization|date=2018|website=World Health Organization Newsroom|language=en-GB|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>

===Health===

[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|240px|Global maternal mortality rate per 100 000 live births, (2010)<ref name=CIA>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]].</ref>]]
The WHO states about maternal health that:
:"Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. While motherhood is often a positive and fulfilling experience, for too many women it is associated with suffering, ill-health and even death."

About 99% of [[maternal deaths]] occur in [[Developing country|less developed countries]]; less than one half occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third in South Asia.<ref name="who.int">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}</ref>

Both early and late motherhood have increased risks. Young teenagers face a higher risk of complications and death as a result of pregnancy.<ref name="who.int"/> Waiting until the mother is at least 18 years old before trying to have children improves maternal and child health.<ref name=USAIDHTSP>{{cite web |url=http://www.esdproj.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Themes_Spacing_KeyMessages |
title = Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy: HTSP Messages |
publisher = USAID |access-date=2008-05-13}}</ref>

Also, if additional children are desired after a child is born, it is healthier for the mother and the child to wait at least 2 years after the previous birth before attempting to conceive (but not more than 5 years).<ref name="USAIDHTSP" /> After a [[miscarriage]] or abortion, it is healthier to wait at least 6 months.<ref name="USAIDHTSP" />

When planning a family, women should be aware that reproductive risks increase with the age of the woman. Like older men, older women have a higher chance of having a child with [[autism]] or [[Down syndrome]], the chances of having [[multiple birth]]s increases, which cause further late-pregnancy risks, they have an increased chance of developing [[gestational diabetes]], the need for a [[Caesarian section]] is greater, older women's bodies are not as well-suited for delivering a baby.  The risk of prolonged labor is higher. Older mothers have a higher risk of a long labor, putting the baby in distress.

==Modern methods==
Modern methods of family planning include birth control, [[assisted reproductive technology]] and family planning programs.

In regard to the use of modern methods of contraception, [[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) says, “Contraceptives prevent unintended pregnancies, reduce the number of abortions, and lower the incidence of death and disability related to complications of pregnancy and childbirth.” <ref name=unfpa1>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning|website=www.unfpa.org}}</ref> UNFPA states, “If all women with an unmet need for contraceptives were able to use modern methods, an additional 24 million abortions (14 million of which would be unsafe), 6 million miscarriages, 70,000 maternal deaths and 500,000 infant deaths would be prevented.” <ref name=unfpa1/>

In cases where couples may not want to have children just yet, family planning programs help a lot. Federal family planning programs reduced childbearing among poor women by as much as 29 percent, according to a [[University of Michigan]] study.<ref>{{cite web  | url=http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2011/research/family-planning-federal-program-reduced-births-to-poor-women-by-nearly-30-percent/  | title=Family planning: Federal program reduced births to poor women by nearly 30 percent  | access-date=2012-03-19  | url-status=dead  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008050517/http://www.sampler.isr.umich.edu/2011/research/family-planning-federal-program-reduced-births-to-poor-women-by-nearly-30-percent/  | archive-date=2011-10-08  }}</ref>

[[Adoption]] is another option used to build a family. There are seven steps that one must make towards adoption. You must decide to pursue an adoption, apply to adopt, complete an adoption home study, get approved to adopt, be matched with a child, receive an adoptive placement, and then legalize the adoption.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Adopt|url=http://www.adoptuskids.org/for-families/how-to-adopt|publisher=Adoption Exchange Association |access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref>

===Contraception===
{{main|Birth control}}
[[File:Family planning Ethiopia (good effects).JPG|thumb|Placard showing positive effects of family planning (Ethiopia)]]

A number of contraceptive methods are available to prevent [[unwanted pregnancy]]. There are natural methods and various chemical-based methods, [[comparison of contraceptive methods|each with particular advantages and disadvantages]]. Behavioral methods to avoid [[pregnancy]] that involve vaginal intercourse include the [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]] and [[calendar-based methods]], which have little upfront cost and are readily available. [[Long-acting reversible contraceptive]] methods, such as [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) and implant are highly effective and convenient, requiring little user action, but do come with risks. When cost of failure is included, IUDs and [[vasectomy]] are much less costly than other methods. In addition to providing birth control, [[condom|male]] and/or [[female condom]]s protect against [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STD). Condoms may be used alone, or in addition to other methods, as backup or to prevent STD. Surgical methods ([[tubal ligation]], [[vasectomy]]) provide long-term contraception for those who have completed their families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birth control methods fact sheet|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.cfm|access-date=21 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418105722/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.cfm|archive-date=18 April 2012}}</ref>

===Assisted reproductive technology===
{{Main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
When, for any reason, a woman is unable to conceive by natural means, she may seek assisted conception. It's recommended to the couple to ask for reproductive counceling after 1 year of searching or after 6 months of searching if the woman has more than 35 years old, if she has irregular or infrequent menses, if she has an history of endometriosis or PID or  if a problem releted to the male is present. For example, some families or women seek assistance through [[surrogacy]], in which a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for another couple or person (this is not allowed in all countries).

There are two types of surrogacy: traditional and [[gestational]]. In traditional surrogacy, the surrogate uses her own eggs ''and'' carries the child for her intended parents. This procedure is done in a doctor's office through IUI. This type of surrogacy obviously includes a genetic connection between the surrogate and the child. Legally, the surrogate will have to disclaim any interest in the child to complete the transfer to the intended parents. A gestational surrogacy occurs when the intended mother's or a donor egg is fertilized outside the body and then the embryos are transferred into the uterus. The woman who carries the child is often referred to as a gestational carrier. The legal steps to confirm parentage with the intended parents are generally easier than in a traditional because there is no genetic connection between child and carrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Surrogate Mother or Gestational Carrier?| url=http://infertilityanswers.org/surrogacy|access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Sperm donation]] is another form of assisted conception. It involves donated sperm being used to fertilise a woman's ova by [[artificial insemination]] (either by [[intracervical insemination]] or [[intrauterine insemination]]) and less commonly by invitro fertilization ([[IVF]]), but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having [[sexual intercourse]] with a woman for the purpose of achieving conception. This method is known as natural [[insemination]] (NI).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mapping of a woman's [[ovarian reserve]], [[Ovarian follicle|follicular]] dynamics and associated [[female reproductive biomarkers|biomarkers]] can give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy, facilitating an informed choice of when to have children.<ref name=pmid23103636>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humupd/dms043 |pmid=23103636 |pmc=3508627 |title=The ageing ovary and uterus: New biological insights |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=67–83 |year=2013 |last1=Nelson |first1=S.M |last2=Telfer |first2=E.E |last3=Anderson |first3=R.A }}</ref>

Investing in family planning has clear economic benefits and can also help countries to achieve their “demographic dividend,” which means that countries productivity is able to increase when there are more people in the workforce and less dependents.<ref name=unfpa1/> UNFPA says that “For every dollar invested in contraception, the cost of pregnancy-related care is reduced by $1.47.”<ref name=unfpa1/>

UNFPA states,

{{block quote|The lifetime opportunity cost related to adolescent pregnancy – a measure of the annual income a young mother misses out on over her lifetime – ranges from 1 per cent of annual gross domestic product in a large country such as China to 30 per cent of annual GDP in a small economy such as Uganda.

In the Copenhagen Consensus produced by Nobel laureates in collaboration with the UN, universal access to contraception ranks as the third-highest policy initiative in social, economic, and environmental benefits for every dollar spent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/health-women-children|title=Health - Women & Children {{!}} Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> Providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health services and eliminating the unmet need for contraception will result in 640,000 fewer newborn deaths, 150,000 fewer maternal deaths and 600,000 fewer children who lose their mother. At the same time, societies will experience fewer dependents and more women in the workforce, driving faster economic growth. The costs of universal access to contraceptives will be about $3.6 billion/year, but the benefits will be more than $400 billion annually and cut maternal deaths by 150,000.

===Fertility awareness===
{{main|Fertility awareness}}

Fertility awareness refers to a set of practices used to determine the [[fertility|fertile]] and infertile phases of a woman's [[menstrual cycle]]. These methods may be used to avoid pregnancy, to [[fertilisation|achieve pregnancy]], or as a way to monitor [[female reproductive system (human)|gynecological]] health. Methods of identifying infertile days have been known since antiquity, but scientific knowledge gained during the past century has increased the number and variety of methods. Various methods can be used and the Symptothermal method has achieved a success rates over 99% if used properly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trussell|first=James|year=2011|chapter=Contraceptive efficacy|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last= Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S. |display-editors=2|title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn = 0091-9721|oclc=781956734|pages=779–863}} Table 26–1 = <span class="plainlinks">[http://www.contraceptivetechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CTFailureTable.pdf Table 3–2: Percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of typical use and the first year of perfect use of contraception, and the percentage continuing use at the end of the first year.

===Media campaign===
Recent research based on nationally representative surveys supports a strong association between family planning mass media campaigns and contraceptive use, even after social and demographic variables are controlled for. The 1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey found half of the women who recalled hearing or seeing family planning messages in radio, print, and television consequently used contraception, compared with 14% who did not recall family planning messages in the media, even after age, residence and socioeconomic status were taken into account.<ref name="Guttmacher Institute">{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/1999/06/impact-multimedia-family-planning-promotion-contraceptive-behavior-women|title=The Impact of Multimedia Family Planning Promotion On the Contraceptive Behavior of Women in Tanzania|date=2005-07-11|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref>

The Health Education Division of the Ministry of Health conducted the Tanzanian Family Planning Communication Project from January 1991 through December 1994, a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).<ref name="Guttmacher Institute"/> The program intended to educate both men and men of reproductive age about modern contraception methods. The major media channels and products included radio spots, radio series drama, Green Star logo promotional activities (identifies sites where family planning services are available), posters, leaflets, newspapers, and audio cassettes. In conjunction with other non-project interventions sponsored by other Tanzanian and international agencies from 1992–1994, contraception use among women ages 15–49 increased from 5.9% to 11.3%. The total fertility rate dropped from 6.3 lifetime births per individual in 1991–1992 to 5.8 in 1994.

Direct government support for family planning includes providing family planning education and supplies through government-run facilities such as hospitals, clinics, health posts and health centers and through government fieldworkers.<ref name= "AutoW0-18">{{cite report|author = United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |title = Abortion Policies and Reproductive Health around the World|publisher = United Nations|date= 2014|url = http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/AbortionPoliciesReproductiveHealth.pdf}}</ref>

In 2013, 160 out of 197 governments provided direct support for family planning. Twenty countries only provided indirect support through private sector or NGOs. Seventeen governments did not support family planning. Direct government support has continued to increase in developing countries from 82% in 1996 to 93% in 2013, but is declining in developed countries from 58% in 1976 to 45% in 2013. Ninety-seven percent of Latin America and the Caribbean, 96% of Africa, and 94% of Oceania governments provided direct support for family planning. In Europe, only 45% of governments directly support family planning. Out of 172 countries with available data in 2012, 152 countries had implemented realistic measures to increase women's access to family planning methods from 2009–2014. This included 95% of developing nations and 65% of developed nations.<ref name="AutoW0-18"/>

===Private sector===
The private sector includes nongovernmental and faith-based organizations that typically provide free or subsidized services to for-profit medical providers, pharmacies and drug shops. The private sector accounts for approximately two-fifths of contraceptive suppliers worldwide. Private organizations are able to provide sustainable markets for contraceptive services through social marketing, social franchising, and pharmacies.<ref name="AutoW0-19">Karen Hardee (Population Council), David Wofford (Meridien Group International), Nandita Thatte (World Health Organization), "Family Planning Evidence Briefs" prepared for the Family Planning Summit held in London on July 11, 2017. Published: World Health Organization, 2017.https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/FP2020_brief_private_sector_FINAL_07.10.17.pdf</ref>

Social marketing employs marketing techniques to achieve behavioral change while making contraceptives available. By utilizing private providers, social marketing reduces geographic and socioeconomic disparities and reaches men and boys.<ref name="AutoW0-19"/>

Social franchising designs a brand for contraceptives in order to expand the market for contraceptives.<ref name="AutoW0-19"/>

Drug shops and pharmacies provide health care in rural areas and urban slums where there are few public clinics. They account for most of the private sector provided contraception in sub-Saharan Africa, especially for condoms, pills, injectables and emergency contraception. Pharmacy supply and low-cost emergency contraception in South Africa and many low-income countries increased access to contraception.<ref name="AutoW0-19"/>

Workplace policies and programs help expand access to family planning information. The Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia, which works with more than 150 enterprises to improve health services, analyzed health outcomes in one factory over 10 years and found reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs as well as sick leave. Contraception use rose from 11% to 90% between 1997 and 2000. In 2016, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Export Association partnered with family planning organizations to provide training and free contraceptives to factory clinics, creating the potential to reach thousands of factory employees.<ref name="AutoW0-19"/>

===Non-governmental organizations===
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) may meet the needs of local poor by encouraging self-help and participation, understanding social and cultural subtleties, and working around red tape when governments do not adequately meet the needs of their constituents. A successful NGO can uphold family planning services even when a national program is threatened by political forces. NGOs can contribute to informing government policy, developing programs, or carry out programs that the government will not or can not implement.<ref name=pmid12283526>{{cite journal |pmid=12283526 |year=1987 |last1=Lubin |first1=D |title=Role of voluntary and non-governmental organizations in the national family planning programme |journal=Population Manager : ICOMP Review |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=49–52 }}</ref>

==International oversight==
{{See also|International Planned Parenthood Federation|Marie Stopes International|United States Agency for International Development}}
Family planning programs are now considered a key part of a comprehensive development strategy. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (now superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]) reflects this international consensus. The 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, hosted by the UK government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, affirmed political commitments and increased funds for the project, strengthening the role of family planning in global development.<ref name=pmid24931078>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2014.00387.x |pmid=24931078 |title=The Impact of Family Planning Programs on Unmet Need and Demand for Contraception |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=247–62 |year=2014 |last1=Bongaarts |first1=John }}</ref>  Family Planning 2020 is the result of the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning where more than 20 governments made commitments to address the policy, financing, delivery, and socio-cultural barriers to women accessing contraception formation and services. FP2020 is a global movement that supports the rights of women to decide for themselves whether, when and how many children they want to have.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.familyplanning2020.org/microsite/about-us|title=Family Planning 2020|website=www.familyplanning2020.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> The commitments of the program are specific to each country, as compared to the generalized main goals of the 1995 conference program of action. FP2020 is hosted by the United Nations Foundation and operates in support of the UN Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescent's Health.

The world's largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs is the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA). In 1994, the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] set the main goals of its Program of Action as:
* Universal access to [[reproductive health]] services by 2015
* Universal primary education and ending the gender gap in education by 2015
* Reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015
* Reducing [[infant mortality]]
* Increasing life expectancy at birth
* Reducing [[HIV]] infection rates in persons aged 15–24 years by 25% in the most-affected countries by 2005, and by 25% globally by 2010

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[World Bank]] estimate that $3 per person per year would provide basic family planning, maternal and neonatal health care to women in developing countries.  This would include [[contraception]], prenatal, delivery, and post-natal care in addition to postpartum family planning and the promotion of [[condoms]] to prevent [[sexually transmitted infections]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | title = Promises to Keep: The Toll of Unintended Pregnancies on Women's Lives in the Developing World | access-date = 2009-02-03 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206063342/http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | archive-date = 2008-12-06 }}</ref>

==Coercive interference with family planning==

===Forced sterilization===
{{Main|Forced sterilization}}
Compulsory or forced sterilization programs or government policy attempt to force people to undergo surgical sterilization without their freely given consent. People from marginalized communities are at most risk of forced sterilization.<ref name="stopvaw.org">http://www.stopvaw.org/forced_coerced_sterilization{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Forced sterilization has occurred in recent years in Eastern Europe (against Roma women),<ref name="stopvaw.org"/><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8375960.stm{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> and in [[Peru]] (during the 1990s against indigenous women).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15891372|title=Peru women fight for justice over forced sterilisation|first=Mattia|last=Cabitza|date=6 December 2011|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[China's one-child policy]] was intended to limit the rise in population numbers, but in some situations involved forced sterilisation.

===Sexual violence===
{{Main|Pregnancy from rape}}
Rape can result in a pregnancy. Rape can occur in a variety of situations, including [[war rape]], [[forced prostitution]] and [[marital rape]].

In [[Rwanda]], the National Population Office has estimated that between 2,000 and 5,000 children were born as a result of sexual violence perpetrated during the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], but victims' groups gave a higher estimated number of over 10,000 children.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Caring for Children Born of Rape in Rwanda |first=Marie Consolée |last=Mukangendo |title=Born of War: Protecting Children of Sexual Violence Survivors in Conflict Zones |editor-first=R.

If no data was available for a country from IMF,  data from the [[World Bank]] is used.</ref>]]
Some consider access to safe, voluntary family planning to be a human right and to be central to gender equality, women's empowerment and [[poverty reduction]]. Over the past 50 years, right-based family planning has enabled the cycle of poverty to be broken resulting in millions of women and children's lives being saved.<ref name="unfpa2" />

The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) says that “Some 225 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using safe and effective family planning methods, for reasons ranging from lack of access to information or services to lack of support from their partners or communities.” <ref name="unfpa2">[http://www.unfpa.org/publications/choices-not-chance Choices not chance] UNFPA</ref> The UNFPA says that “Most of these women with an unmet need for contraceptives live in 69 of the poorest countries on earth.” <ref name="unfpa2" />

The UNFPA says,

{{blockquote|Global consensus that family planning is a human right was secured at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, in Principle 8 of the Programme of Action: All couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education, and means to do so.<ref name=unfpa2/>}}

[[File:CO2 emission pie chart.svg|thumb|190px|Global [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] by jurisdiction]]

As part of the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) universal access to family planning is one of the key factors contributing to development and reducing poverty. Family planning creates benefits in areas such as, gender quality and women's health, access to sexual education and higher education, and improvements in maternal and child health.<ref name=unfpa2/> Note that the Millennium Development Goals have been superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

UNFPA and the Guttmacher Institute say,

{{block quote|Serving all women in developing countries that currently have an unmet need for modern contraceptives would prevent an additional 54 million unintended pregnancies, including 21 million unplanned births, 26 million abortions and seven million miscarriages; this would also prevent 79,000 maternal deaths and 1.1 million infant deaths.<ref>[http://www.unfpa.org/publications/family-planning-health-and-development Family planning, health and development] UNFPA</ref>}}

Since [[climate change]] is directly proportional to the number of humans, family planning has a significant impact on climate change. The [[Project Drawdown|research project Drawdown]] estimates that family planning is the seventh most efficient action against climate change (ahead of [[solar farms]], [[nuclear power]], [[afforestation]] and many other actions).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/women-and-girls/family-planning|title=FAMILY PLANNING|publisher=Drawdown|access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>

==Quality-quantity trade-off==
Having children produces a quality-quantity trade-off: parents need to decide how many children to have and how much to invest in the future of each child.<ref name=":0">Gregory Casey and Oded Galor, "Population and Demography Perspective Paper" Copenhagen Consensus Center, Post-2015 Consensus, October 3, 2014. http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/population_and_demography_perspective_-galor_casey.pdf</ref> The increasing marginal cost of quality (child outcome) with respect to quantity (number of children) creates a trade-off between quantity and quality.<ref name=pmid18390301>{{cite journal |pmid=18390301 |pmc=2831373 |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=H |title=The quantity-quality trade-off of children in a developing country: Identification using Chinese twins |journal=Demography |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=223–43 |last2=Zhang |first2=J |last3=Zhu |first3=Y |doi=10.1353/dem.2008.0006}}</ref> The quantity-quality trade-off means that policies that raise benefits of investing in child quality will generate higher levels of human capital, and policies that lower the costs of having children may have unintended adverse consequences on long-run economic growth. When deciding how many children, parents are influenced by their income level, perceived return to human capital investment, and cultural norms related to gender equality. Controlling birth rates allows families to raise the future earnings power of the next generation. Many empirical studies have tested the quantity-quality trade-off and either observed a negative correlation between family size and child quality or did not find a correlation.<ref name="pmid18390301" /> Most studies treat family size as an exogenous variable because parents choose childbearing and child outcome and therefore cannot establish causality. They are both influenced by typically non-observable parental preferences and household characteristics, but some studies observe proxy variables such as investment in education.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Developing countries===
[[File:Total Fertility Rate Map by Country.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the [[Population Reference Bureau]]]]
High fertility countries have 18% of the world's population but contribute 38% of the [[population growth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/post-2015-consensus-population-and-demography-assessment-kohler-behrman|title=Post-2015 Consensus: Population and Demography Assessment, Kohler Behrman {{!}} Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> In order to become rich, resources must be re-appropriated to increase income per person rather than supporting larger populations. As populations increase, governments must accommodate increasing investments in health and human capital and institutional reforms to address demographic divides. Reducing the cost of human capital can be implemented by subsidizing education, which raises the earning power of women and the opportunity cost of having children, consequently lowering fertility.<ref name=":0" /> Access to contraceptives may also yield lower fertility rates: having more children than expected constrains the individual from attaining their desired level of investment in child quantity and quality.<ref name=":0" />  In high fertility contexts, reduced fertility may contribute to economic development by improving child outcomes, reducing maternal mortality and increasing female human capital.

Dang and Rogers (2015) show that in Vietnam, family planning services increased investment in education by lowering the relative cost of child quality and encouraging families to invest in quality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dang|first1=Hai-Anh H.|last2=Rogers|first2=F.

[[File:Demand for private tutoring.jpg|thumb|Demand for Private Tutoring with and without access to family planning]]

===Developed countries===
Currently, developed countries have experienced rising economic growth and falling fertility. As a result of the demographic transition that takes place when countries become rich, developed countries have an increasing proportion of retired people which raises the burden on the workforce population to support pensions and social programs. Encouraging higher fertility as a solution may risk reversing the benefits for increased child investment and female labor force participation have had on economic growth. Increasing high skill migration may be an effective way to increase the return to education leading to lower fertility and a greater supply of highly skilled individuals.<ref name=":0" />

214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries who do not want to become pregnant are not using a modern contraceptive method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> This could be a result of a limited choice of methods, limited access to contraception, fear of side-effects, cultural or religious opposition, poor quality of available services, user or provider bias, or gender-based barriers. In Africa, 24.2% of women of reproductive age do not have access to modern contraction. In Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, the unmet need is 10–11%. Meeting the unmet need for contraception could prevent 104,000 maternal deaths per year, a 29% reduction of women dying from postpartum hemorrhage or unsafe abortions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2015/12/17/09/14/universal-access-to-contraception|title=Universal Access to Contraception|website=www.apha.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref>

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Population Division, 64% of the world uses contraceptives, 12% of the world population's need for contraceptives is unmet. In the least developed countries, 22% of the population do not have access to contraceptives, and 40% use contraceptives.<ref>United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Population Division, "Trends in Contraceptive Use Worldwide 2015" New York: United Nations, 2015. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/family/trendsContraceptiveUse2015Report.pdf</ref> The unmet need for modern contraceptives is very high in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and western Asia. Africa has the lowest rate of contraceptive use (33%) and highest rate of unmet need (22%). Northern America has the highest rate of contraceptive use (73%) and the lowest unmet need (7%). Latin America and the Caribbean follows closely behind with 73% contraceptive use and 11% unmet need. Europe and Asia are on par: Europe has a 69% contraceptive use rate and 10% unmet need, Asia has a 68% contraceptive use and 10% unmet need. Although unmet need is lower in Asia because of the large population in this region, the number of women with unmet need is 443 million, compared to 74 million in Europe  Oceania has a 59% contraceptive use rate and 15% unmet need. When comparing the regions within these continents, Eastern Asia ranks the highest rate of contraceptive use (82%) and lowest unmet need (5%). Western Africa ranks the lowest rate of contraceptive use (17%). Middle Africa ranks the highest unmet need (26%). Unmet need is higher among poorer women; in Bolivia and Ethiopa unmet need is tripled and doubled among poor populations.<ref name="prb.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-unmet-need.aspx|title=Fact Sheet: Unmet Need for Family Planning|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303164449/http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-unmet-need.aspx|archive-date=2018-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia the rates of unmet need are different by 1–2 percentage points.<ref name="prb.org"/> This suggests that as wealthier women begin to want smaller families, they will increasingly seek out family planning methods.<ref name="prb.org"/>

Substantial unmet need has provoked family planning programs by governments and donors, but the impact of family planning programs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bestfamilylife.com|title=For a long lasting relationship|date=17 January 2020|website=Best Family Life}}</ref> on fertility and contraceptive use remains somewhat unsettled. "Demand theory" argues that in traditional agricultural societies, fertility rates are driven by the desire to offset high mortality, thus as society modernizes, the costs of raising children increases, reducing their economic value, and resulting in a decline in desired number of children. Under this theory, family planning programs will have a marginal impact. Bongaarts (2014) shows that using a country case study approach, both stronger and weaker family programs reduce the unmet need for contraceptives and increases use by making modern contraceptives more widely available and removing obstacles to use.<ref name=pmid24931078/> Also, the demand that is satisfied and the proportion of women using modern methods increased. The programs may have an additional effect of diffusing the ideas related to family planning and thus raising the demand for contraception. As a result, a small decrease in unmet need may be offset by a rise in demand. Nonetheless, even in countries where it is assumed that family programs will make a marginal impact, Bongaarts shows that family planning programs can potentially increase contraceptive use and increase/decrease demand depending on the preexisting attitudes of the community.

{{Main|Family planning policy}}
[[People's Republic of China|China]]'s ''Family planning policy'' forced couples to have no more than [[One-child policy|one child]]. Beginning in 1979 and being officially phased out in 2015,<ref name=pmid10514169>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7215.992 |pmid=10514169 |pmc=1116810 |title=China's one child family policy |journal=BMJ |volume=319 |issue=7215 |pages=992–4 |year=1999 |last1=Kane |first1=P |last2=Choi |first2=C. Y }}</ref> the policy was instated to control the rapid population growth that was occurring in the nation at that time. With the rapid change in population, China was facing many impacts, including poverty and homelessness. As a developing nation, the Chinese government was concerned that a continuation of the rapid population growth that had been occurring would hinder their development as a nation. The process of family planning varied throughout China, as people differed in their responsiveness to the one-child policy, based on location and socioeconomic status. For example, many families in the cities accepted the policy more readily based on the lack of space, money, and resources that often occurs in the cities. Another example can be found in the enforcement of this rule; people living in rural areas of China were, in some cases, permitted to have more than one child, but had to wait several years after the birth of the first one.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chan|first=Elaine|title=Cultures of the World China|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International}}</ref>  However, the people in rural areas of China were more hesitant in accepting this policy. China's population policy has been credited with a very significant slowing of China's population growth which had been higher before the policy was implemented. However, the policy has come under criticism that it has resulted in the abuse of women. Often implementation of the policy has involved [[forced abortion]]s, [[forced sterilization]], and infanticides. That families desired a male child had a part to play in the number of infanticides. The number of girls that die within their first year of birth is twice that of boys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infanticides in China|url=http://www.allgirlsallowed.org/infanticide-china-statistics|publisher=All Girls Allowed|access-date=March 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101014043/http://www.allgirlsallowed.org/infanticide-china-statistics|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another drawback of the policy is that China's elderly population is now increasing rapidly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today's Research on Aging|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf10/todaysresearchaging20.pdf|website=prb.org/|publisher=Population Reference Bureau|access-date=1 April 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110110142744/http://www.prb.org/pdf10/todaysresearchaging20.pdf |archive-date=10 January 2011}}</ref> However, while the punishment of "unplanned" pregnancy is a large fine, both forced abortion and forced sterilization can be charged with intentional assault, which is punished with up to ten years' imprisonment.
Another issue that is raised in the one-child policy in China is the information in regards to naturally giving birth to twins or triplets. If this situation arises, the family is allowed to keep the children because of the natural causes of this impregnation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Iran===
{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}
While Iran's population grew at a rate of more than 3% per year between 1956 and 1986, the growth rate began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the government initiated a major population control program. By 2007 the growth rate had declined to 0.7 percent per year, with a birth rate of 17 per 1,000 persons and a death rate of 6 per 1,000.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567300_3/Iran.html MSN Encarta Encyclopedia entry on Iran - People and Society] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc3Hf9W?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567300_3/Iran.html |date=2009-10-31 }}, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#People CIA World factbook 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |date=2012-02-03 }}.

In late July 2012, [[Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] described Iran's contraceptive services as "wrong," and Iranian authorities are slashing birth-control programs in what one Western newspaper ([[USA Today]]) describes as a "major reversal" of its long standing policy. Whether program cuts and high-level appeals for bigger families will be successful is still unclear.<ref name=boom>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-07-29/iran-baby-boom/56576830/1 Iran urges baby boom, slashes birth-control programs] usatoday.com 30 July 2012</ref>

===Ireland===

The sale of contraceptives was illegal in Ireland from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalized with strong restrictions, later loosened. It has been argued that the resulting [[demographic dividend]] played a role in the economic boom in Ireland that began in the 1990s and ended abruptly in 2008 (the [[Celtic tiger]]) was in part due to the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|legalisation of contraception in 1979]] and subsequent decline in the fertility rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author-link1= David E.

According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed "desired and timely" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as "desired, but untimely", and 19% said they were "undesired".  As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal).<ref name="und">[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/europethecis/russia/NHDR_Russia_2008_Eng.pdf National Human Development Report Russian Federation 2008], [[UNDP]],''pages 47–49'', Retrieved on 10 October 2009</ref>  During the Soviet era high quality contraceptives were difficult to obtain, and abortion became the most common way of preventing unwanted births. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union abortion rates have fallen considerably, but they are still higher than rates in many developed countries.

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the [[Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012]] guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care. While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

===Thailand===
In 1970, Thailand's government declared a population policy that would battle the country's rapid population growth rate. This policy set a 5-year goal to reduce Thailand's population growth rate from 3 percent to 2.5 percent through methods such as spreading family planning awareness to rural families, or integrating family planning activities into maternal and child healthcare education.<ref>{{cite book|author1=United Nations.

A 2017 paper found that parents' access to family planning programs had a positive economic impact on their subsequent children: " Using the county-level introduction of U.S. family planning programs between 1964 and 1973, we find that children born after programs began had 2.8% higher household incomes. They were also 7% less likely to live in poverty and 12% less likely to live in households receiving public assistance.

==Obstacles to family planning==
There are many reasons as to why women do not use contraceptives. These reasons include logistical problems, scientific and religious concerns, limited access to transportation in order to access health clinics, lack of education and knowledge and opposition by partners, families or communities plus the fact that no one is able to control their fertility beyond basic behavior involving conception.

The UNFPA says that “efforts to increase access must be sensitive to cultural and national contexts, and must consider economic, geographic and age disparities within countries.” <ref name=unfpa1/>

The UNFPA states, "Poorer women and those in rural areas often have less access to family planning services. Certain groups — including adolescents, unmarried people, the urban poor, rural populations, sex workers and people living with HIV  also face a variety of barriers to family planning. This can lead to higher rates of unintended pregnancy, increased risk of HIV and other STIs, limited choice of contraceptive methods, and higher levels of unmet need for family planning."<ref name=unfpa1/>

For national, international, or local health programs involved in family planning, the use of standard indicators<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators|title=Family Planning and Reproductive Health Indicators Database — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref> is increasingly encouraged, to track barriers to effective family planning along with the efficacy, uptake, and provision of family planning services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eval/indicators/index.htm|title=Indicators - Program Evaluation - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>

=== COVID-19 ===
As of March 2020, there were an estimated 450 million women using modern contraceptives across 114 priority low- and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic as well as social distancing and other strategies to reduce transmission are anticipated to impact the ability of these women to continue using contraception. The number of unintended pregnancies will increase as the lockdown continues and services disruptions are extended.<ref name="unfpa">{{cite web |title=Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Planning and Ending Gender-based Violence, Female Genital Mutilation and Child Marriage |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/COVID-19_impact_brief_for_UNFPA_24_April_2020_1.pdf |website=UNFPA |date=27 April 2020 |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Some 47 million women in 114 low- and middle-income countries are projected to be unable to use modern contraceptives if the average lockdown, or COVID-19-related disruption, continues for 6 months with major disruptions to services. For every 3 months the lockdown continues, assuming high levels of disruption, up to 2 million additional women may be unable to use modern contraceptives. If the lockdown continues for 6 months and there are major service disruptions due to COVID-19, an additional 7 million unintended pregnancies are expected to occur.<ref name="unfpa" />

==World Contraception Day==
September 26 is designated as World Contraception Day, devoted to raising awareness of contraception and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, with a vision of "a world where every pregnancy is wanted".<ref name=WorldContraceptionDay>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-life.com/en/home/world-contraception-day/ |title=World Contraception Day |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818081827/http://www.your-life.com/en/home/world-contraception-day/ |archive-date=2014-08-18 }}</ref>  It is supported by a group of international NGOs, including:

==Abortion==
The United Nations Population Fund explicitly states it “never promotes abortion as a form of family planning.”<ref name="Family planning"/> The World Health Organization states that "Family planning/contraception reduces the need for abortion, especially unsafe abortion."<ref name="Family planning/Contraception"/>

The campaign to conflate contraception and abortion is rooted on the assertion that contraception ends, rather than prevents, pregnancy. This is due to the notion that preventing implantation implies an abortion, when considering fertilization as the initial moment of pregnancy. According to an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2013 led by Physicians for Reproductive Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a contraceptive method prevents pregnancy by interfering with fertilization, or implantation. Abortion, separate from contraceptives, ends an established pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2014/12/contraception-not-abortion-strategic-campaign-antiabortion-groups-persuade-public|title=Contraception Is Not Abortion: The Strategic Campaign of Antiabortion Groups to Persuade the Public Otherwise|date=2014-12-12|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref>
