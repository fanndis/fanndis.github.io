A member of the [[United States Senate]] can [[resignation|resign]] by writing a letter of resignation to the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of the state that the senator represents.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lalor |first1=John Joseph |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-J3vOPWd50C&dq |title=Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States |volume=3 |publisher=C.E. Merrill & Company |year=1893 |page=614 |accessdate=July 23, 2019 }}</ref> Under Article I, Section 3 of the [[Constitution of the United States]], and under the Seventeenth Amendment, in case of a vacancy in the Senate resulting from resignation, the executive authority of the state (today known in every state as the governor) can fill the vacancy by appointment unless the state legislature has provided for some other means of filling the vacancy, such as a special election. Whenever a senator needs to be appointed or elected, the [[Secretary of the Senate]] mails one of three forms to the state's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new Senator.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Term of A Senator – When Does It Begin and End? – Senate 98-29|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/termofasenator.pdf|website=United States Senate|publisher=United States Printing Office|accessdate=November 13, 2015|pages=14–15|format=PDF}}</ref>

The first resignation from the Senate was that of [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] of New Jersey on November 13, 1790, who resigned in order to accept the office of [[Governor of New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} His resignation was only the third time a person ceased to hold a seat in the Senate, which had first convened during the preceding year, 1789. The earlier ones resulted from the death of Senator [[William Grayson]] of [[Virginia]], and the expiration of the term of the temporary senator [[John Walker (Virginia politician)|John Walker]] of Virginia, who was appointed by the [[Governor of Virginia]] to hold that office until a successor could be elected in November.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Before 1796, eight senators resigned. Nine senators resigned during that year—a record-high number that stands to this day.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Most resignations have been motivated either by declining health or a decision to accept another office.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Sixteen persons have resigned from the Senate twice and two have resigned three times.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
