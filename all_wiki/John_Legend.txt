In 2001, [[Devo Springsteen]] introduced Legend to [[Kanye West]], then an up-and-coming hip-hop artist; Legend was hired to sing during the [[hook (music)|hooks]] of West's music. After signing to West's label, he chose his stage name from an idea that was given to him by poet [[J. Ivy]], due to what he perceived as an "old-school sound". J.

I'm going to call you John Legend." After J. Ivy continued to call him by the new moniker "John Legend", others quickly caught on, including Kanye West. Despite Stephens' reluctance to adopt a stage name, he eventually announced his new artist name as John Legend.<ref name="NY Times" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/john-legend-legend-in-his-lifetime-483776.html |title=John Legend: Legend in his lifetime |date=February 18, 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] |accessdate=July 22, 2009 |location=London}}</ref>
