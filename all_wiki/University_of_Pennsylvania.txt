The University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.{{refn|group=note| Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia (later Penn), [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey (later Princeton University)]] and [[Columbia University|King's College (later Columbia College, now Columbia University)]] all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century, including alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the "Intercollegiate Commission" at the invitation of [[John James McCook (lawyer)|John J. McCook]], a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the [[Academic regalia in the United States|Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume]]. This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's ''The Alumni Register'' magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the University's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally.

All twelve members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the "[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]" or "[[Old and New Light|New Light]]" wing of the [[Presbyterian Church]] in the [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]] areas.<ref>[https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105013448/http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml |date=November 5, 2013 }}</ref> This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740.

Even Penn's account of its early history agrees that the original secondary school (the Academy of Philadelphia) did not add an institution of higher learning (the College of Philadelphia) until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began as a colonial-era, early version of secondary schools such as [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] (founded as "King William's School" in 1696) and the [[University of Delaware]] (founded as "the Free Academy" in 1743) choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896-1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.  According to Cheyney's later history of the event, the university did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Commissioner of Education]] written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that "it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature) resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a "School or College". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant. Except for Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation <ref>Edgar Potts Cheyney, "History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940: pp. 45-52.</ref>}}  The university also considers itself as the [[first university in the United States]] with both undergraduate and graduate studies.

In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the traveling [[evangelism|evangelist]] [[George Whitefield]], who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons. The building was designed and built by [[Edmund Woolley]] and was the largest building in the city at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time it was preached in.<ref name="MontgomeryHistory">{{cite book|title=A History of the University of Pennsylvania from Its Foundation to A.

According to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, "thinking the Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]] a fit person to superintend such an institution". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin and nothing further was done for another six years.<ref name="MontgomeryHistory"/>{{rp|30}} In the fall of 1749, now more eager to create a school to educate future generations, [[Benjamin Franklin]] circulated a pamphlet titled "[[commons:File:Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania (UC) - Benjamin Franklin (1931 1749).djvu|Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania]]", his vision for what he called a "Public Academy of Philadelphia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/brief.html|title=A Brief History of the University, University of Pennsylvania Archives|first=Steven Morgan|last=Friedman|publisher=Archives.upenn.edu|accessdate=December 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102143449/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/brief.html|archive-date=January 2, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike the other [[colonial colleges]] that existed in 1749—[[Harvard]], [[College of William & Mary|William & Mary]], [[Yale]], and [[Princeton]]—Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy.

The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|William Smith]] (1727-1803), who became the first [[provost (education)|provost]], and other [[Board of Trustees|trustees]] strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.<ref name="Penn's Heritage">{{cite web|title=Penn's Heritage|url=http://www.upenn.edu/about/history|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=May 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422090345/http://www.upenn.edu/about/history|archive-date=April 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>N.

Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749), the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House (later renamed and famously known since 1776 as "[[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]"), was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the "Academy of Philadelphia", using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,<ref name="WoodHistory"/>{{rp|12}} by the intentions of the original "New Building" donors, although it lasted only a few years.

The institution of higher learning was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Reverend William Smith]]'s [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|"Loyalist"]] tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a [[University of the State of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=Penn in the 18th Century, University of Pennsylvania Archives|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|publisher=Universdity of Pennsylvania|accessdate=April 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|archive-date=April 28, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia.

After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the [[Schuylkill River]] to property purchased from the [[Blockley Almshouse]] in [[West Philadelphia]] in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]]. Although Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date; this is the year that appears on the first iteration of the university seal.

===Early campuses===
The Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church building at 4th and Arch Streets which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia. In 1801, the University moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at 9th and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the temporary national capital.<ref name="WoodHistory">{{cite book|lccn=07007833|oclc=760190902|title=The History of the University of Pennsylvania, from Its Origin to the Year 1827|publisher= McCarty and Davis|author=Wood, George Bacon|author-link=George Bacon Wood|year=1834|title-link=:s:en:The History of the University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> Classes were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.

From its founding until construction of the [[Quadrangle Dormitories (University of Pennsylvania)]], which started construction in 1895, the student body did not live in University owned housing as, with minor exceptions, there was none.

After World War II, Penn began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, especially student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the GI Bill, and the resultant increase in Penn's student population, highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Depression-era.

===Motto===
Penn's motto is based on a line from [[Horace]]'s [[s:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber III/Carmen XXIV#line33|III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), {{lang-la|quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?|lit=of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?|link=no|label=none|cat=no}}]]. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read ''{{lang|la|Sine Moribus Vanae}}''. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to {{lang-la|literae sine moribus vanae|lit=Letters without morals [are] useless|link=no|label=none}}. In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto "mutilated" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, {{lang-la|Leges Sine Moribus Vanae|lit=Laws without morals [are] useless|link=no|label=none}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Samuel|year=2002|url=https://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history|journal=Pennsylvania Gazette|volume=100|issue=3|access-date=February 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113054610/http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|archive-date=November 13, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>

Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the [[Cope and Stewardson]] firm (same architects who designed [[Princeton University]] and a large part of [[Washington University in St. Louis]]) known for having combined the [[Gothic architecture]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] with the local landscape to establish the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style. The present core campus covers over {{convert|299|acre|ha}} in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the [[University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District]]. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn borders [[Drexel University]] and is near the [[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]]. The renowned cancer research center [[Wistar Institute]] is also located on campus.

Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage|url=http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/4/7/|publisher=BLT Architects|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812175412/http://blta.com/#/3/0/4/7/|archive-date=August 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Parks and fitness===
In 2007, Penn acquired about {{convert|35|acre|ha}} between the campus and the Schuylkill River (the former site of the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] and a nearby {{convert|24|acre|ha|adj=on}} site owned by the United States Postal Service). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011. {{Update inline span|text=Penn also plans new connections between the campus and the city, including a pedestrian bridge.|reason=Have these been built yet?|?=yes|date=November 2018}} In 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue from [[DuPont]] for storage and office space.

In September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets. The University also owns the {{convert|92|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Morris Arboretum]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]] in northwestern Philadelphia, the official arboretum of the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. 

Penn also owns the {{convert|687|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[New Bolton Center]], the research and large-animal health care center of its Veterinary School. Located near [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Barbaro (horse)|Barbaro]] underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the [[Preakness Stakes]].

===Libraries===<!-- This section is linked from [[NeXT]] -->
[[File:FisherFineArtsLibrary.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fisher Fine Arts Library]], also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]]

Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]]. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later. It has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48&nbsp;million. The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million [[microform]] items and 1.11 million e-books.<ref name="Penn: Penn Facts"/> It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|title=Penn Library Data Farm|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= Data Farm|url =http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317083950/http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|archive-date=March 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Art installations and The Penn Museum===
The campus has several notable art installations. The ''Covenant'', better known to the student body as "The Tampons,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/blog/under-the-button/2015/01/the-tampons-look-like-tampons-a-public-reminder|title=The Tampons Look Like Tampons: A Public Reminder|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=May 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042010/http://www.thedp.com/blog/under-the-button/2015/01/the-tampons-look-like-tampons-a-public-reminder|archive-date=June 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> is a large red structure located on Locust Walk between the high rise residences. It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel. A larger-than-life white button, known as ''[[The Button (sculpture)|The Button]]'', is another popular sculpture. It sits at the south entrance of [[Van Pelt Library]] and has button holes large enough to stand in. Penn also has a replica of the ''[[Love (sculpture)|Love]]'' sculpture, part of a series created by [[Robert Indiana]]. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998.

===Residences===
{{Main|University of Pennsylvania College Houses}}
Every College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.<ref name="College House PDF">{{cite web|title=College Houses at Penn|url=http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/collegehouses_11-12.pdf|work=College Houses and Academic Services|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archive-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001225828/http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/collegehouses_11-12.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.

The College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill, Kings Court English, Lauder College House, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. In 2019, Penn announced the construction of New College House West. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the Fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.<ref>{{cite web|title=College Houses & Academic Services: University of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/index.asp|website=Collegehouses.upenn.edu|accessdate=July 23, 2013|archive-date=August 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812121818/http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/index.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called "The Quad".

==Academics and interdisciplinary focus==

{{Graduate schools of the University of Pennsylvania}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PENN 043.jpg|thumb|Lower Quad from Riepe College House]] -->
The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the [[Fels Institute of Government]], the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing|School of Nursing]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)]].

Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's "One University" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Haverford College|Haverford]], and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] under a reciprocal agreement known as the [[Quaker Consortium]].

===Coordinated dual-degree and interdisciplinary programs===
Penn offers specialized [[double degree|coordinated dual-degree]] (CDD) programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:
* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology
* Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science
* [[The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business]]
* Nursing and Health Care Management
* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management
* [[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]]
* Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)
* Accelerated 7-year Bio-Dental Program
* [[Singh Program in Networked & Social Systems Engineering (NETS)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=NETS Homepage|url=http://www.nets.upenn.edu/|publisher=Penn Engineering|accessdate=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024753/http://www.nets.upenn.edu/|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, "dual degree" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and an M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.

For graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.
[[University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice]], commonly known as '''Penn SP2''', is a school of [[social policy]] and [[social work]] that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/programs/index.html|title= SP2 Programs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/university-of-pennsylvania-school-of-social-policy-and-practice-program-in-social-work-000_10013879.aspx|title=Peterson's National Guide University of Pennsylvania SP2|publisher=Petersons}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/degree-programs/dual-degree-programs/overview/about-the-programs/|title=About the Programs {{!}} School of Social Policy & Practice |website=www.sp2.upenn.edu |access-date=2016-06-30}}</ref> Penn SP2's vision is: "The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and [[justice]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/about/index.html|title=About SP2|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy & Practice}}</ref>

Originally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/about/index.html|title=SP2 Vision}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graduateguide.com/university_of_pennsylvania_school_of_social_policy__and__practice.html|title= SP2 School of Social Policy & Practice |publisher=Graduate Guide}}</ref>

The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]] offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hackett |first=Martin |title=Penn Vet expands timely dual degree during COVID-19 pandemic {{!}} Penn Today |url=https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-vet-expands-timely-dual-degree-during-covid-19-pandemic |website=Penn Today |date=September 11, 2020}}</ref>

However, the size of Penn's biomedical research organization adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and [[Medicare and Medicaid]] program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]], thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.

[[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|[[ENIAC]], the first general-purpose electronic computer, was born at Penn in 1946.]]
Penn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments. In 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called ''The American Law Register,'' now the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review|Penn Law Review]]'', one of the most cited law journals in the world).<ref>{{cite web|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|publisher=Washington and Lee University School of Law|accessdate=November 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121012415/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lj/index.aspx|archive-date=November 21, 2011}}</ref> Under the deanship of [[William Draper Lewis]], the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.<ref>Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 89 U.

Several major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]].<ref name="Moore Engineering">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|title=Important Milestones and Fascinating Innovations During the Last Fifty Years of Computing Research at the University of Pennsylvania|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009144750/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|archive-date=October 9, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular [[COBOL]] programming language.<ref name="Moore Engineering"/> Penn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine.

Heeger]], [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]], an invention that earned them the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. On faculty since 1965, [[Ralph L. Brinster]] developed the scientific basis for [[in vitro fertilization]] and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 2010. The theory of [[BCS theory|superconductivity]] was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member [[John Robert Schrieffer]] (along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Leon Cooper]]). The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are [[conjoint analysis]], widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, [[Simon Kuznets]]'s method of measuring [[Gross National Product]],<ref name="125 Influential People and Ideas">{{cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|title=125 Influential People and Ideas|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610064028/http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|archive-date=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the [[Penn effect]] (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the "Wharton Model"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|title=Wharton Model (economics) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|accessdate=March 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919212318/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|archive-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> developed by Nobel-laureate [[Lawrence Klein]] to measure and forecast economic activity.

===Rugby===
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2020}}
The Penn men's [[rugby football]] team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States.  Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid 1870s playing by rules much closer to the [[rugby union]] and [[Association Football]] code rules (relative to [[American football]] rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented<ref name="SASH-Farnsworth">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ussoccerhistory.org/the-origins-of-soccer-in-philadelphia-part-5-local-college-based-football-after-the-1863-laws-of-the-game/ |title=The origins of soccer in Philadelphia, part 5: Local college-based football after the 1863 Laws of the Game – Society for American Soccer History |last=Farnsworth |first=Ed |date=April 16, 2020 |publisher=Society for American Soccer History}}</ref>). Among its earliest games was a game against [[College of New Jersey (18th Century)|College of New Jersey]] (which in 1895 changed its name to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876 with [[Harvard]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.<ref name="Fight song">[[Rottenberg, Dan]] (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pp. 25, 28, 33, 34.</ref><ref name="SASH-Farnsworth" /> Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association Football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in [[English public schools]].<ref name=CompleterugbyUSA>Bath (1977) p77</ref> and by 1869 Princeton was playing with rules substantially identical to rugby.<ref name=CompleterugbyUSA /> 

Among the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby (rules that did not allow forward passes or center snaps) was [[John Heisman]], namesake of the [[Heisman Trophy]] and an 1892 graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]]. Heisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to present rules of American football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/fredbiletnikoff|title=History of the Forward Pass|website=biletnikoffaward.com|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>

Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.<ref>October 22, 1910, ''The Daily Pennsylvanian''</ref>}}

The player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] was [[Alan Valentine]], who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a Master's degree at Wharton.<ref>https://archives.upenn.edu/exhibits/penn-people/notables/athletics/olympics/athletes</ref>

As early as fall of 1959 Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry "Joe" Edwin Reagan III<ref>https://archives.upenn.edu/media/2017/06/1960record.pdf with a team photo and erroneous report that the then newly founded rugby club was first rugby team Penn had ever fielded</ref> Penn's College Class of 1962 and Penn Law Class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of [[USA Rugby]] and Oreste P.

In the early 1980s, Penn women's rugby, led by women such as Penn Law alumna [[Gigi Sohn]], began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick, a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the [[University of Arizona]] and who was a four year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.

The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni [[Jay Clayton (attorney)|Jay Clayton]], Penn Law Class of 1993, and the chair of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref name=gao>{{cite journal|last=Ekstrand|first=Laurie E. |title=DOJ's Public Integrity Section: Case Management Policies Followed, but Closing Some Matters Took Too Long |journal=[[U.S. Government Accountability Office|U.S. General Accounting Office]] |date=January 2001|series=Report to the Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives (GAO-01-122) |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/160/157010.pdf}}</ref> The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wharthogs.com/ |title=Wharton Rugby Football Club |website=www.wharthogs.com/ |access-date=August 13, 2020}}</ref>

===Cricket===
In the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th Philadelphia was the center of [[cricket in the United States]]. Cricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club|Philadelphia]], the [[Merion Cricket Club|Merion]] and the [[Germantown Cricket Club|Germantown]]). Many East Coast universities and colleges fielded cricket teams with the University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College being two of the best in the country.  (Cricket was the first organized sport at Pennsylvania.) The Penn Cricket Team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles and even defeated a combined Oxford-Cambridge team in 1895.<ref name="Penn Cricket">{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/cricket/histy.html | title=Penn Cricket in the 1800s: Penn's first organized sport: Historical overview | publisher=University of Pennsylvania | work=University Archives and Records Center | date=February 2006 | accessdate=July 4, 2018 | author=Seth S.

Following the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months, but to this day the University still fields a cricket team.

===Football===
{{Main|Penn Quakers football}}
[[File:FranklinFieldPenn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franklin Field]], home to football, field hockey, lacrosse and track and field]]
Penn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.<ref name="Fight song"/>

Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus [[George Washington Woodruff]] introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the [[forward pass]], as well as the [[Placekicker|place-kick]] from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name="Fight song" /> The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and [[John Outland]], a [[Penn Med]] alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (gridiron football)|interior lineman]] of the year.

Also, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (Class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], becoming the [[National Football League|NFL's]] last 60-minute man. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, [[Harold Stassen]] attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time [[college football]], but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.

[[ESPN]]'s ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' traveled to Penn to highlight the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.

===Basketball===
[[File:The Palestra.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palestra]], "Cathedral of Basketball"]]
{{Main|Penn Quakers men's basketball}}
Penn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]] and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].

===Facilities===
[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]] and track and field (and formerly soccer and rugby). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of 18 [[Army–Navy Game|Army–Navy]] games between 1899 and 1935.<ref>Didinger, Ray; Lyons, Robert S. (2005). ''The Eagles Encyclopedia''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p.&nbsp;205. {{ISBN|1-59213-449-1}}. Retrieved 2009-01-08</ref>

Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as [[intramural sports|intramural]] and club sports, including [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event "the [[Penn Relays]]."

Penn's home court, the [[Palestra]], is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, [[wrestling]] team and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn baseball plays its home games at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]].

The [[1980 Olympic boycott|Olympic Boycott Games]] of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] following the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet incursion in Afghanistan]]. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.
