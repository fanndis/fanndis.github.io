{{Politics of Ukraine}}
A '''People's Deputy of [[Ukraine]]''' (''[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]'': народний депутат України, narodnyi deputat Ukrayiny) is a [[member of parliament]], [[legislator]] elected by a [[Direct election|popular vote]] to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the [[parliament]] of Ukraine). Often People's Deputies of Ukraine are referred to simply as the "deputies". However it should be distinguished that regular deputies are members of regional and local councils, while people's deputies are elected to the national parliament, Verkhovna Rada. Prior to 1991, it was named the '''Supreme Council of People's Deputies of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]'''.

The main statutes that define the order of elections, rights and duties of the People's Deputies of Ukraine are outlined in Articles 76 - 81 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. There are 450 people's deputies of Ukraine who are elected based on the general, equal and direct electoral right. The deputies may be appointed to various parliamentary positions such as the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|chairperson (speaker)]] of parliament, a head of a committee or a parliamentary faction, etc. Upon its appointment to the office each people's deputy of Ukraine receives a ''deputy mandate''.

People's Deputies that ran for the parliament as self-nominated candidates will join factions if they wish.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukovych-signs-law-on-open-voting-to-elect-parliamentary-chairman-316360.html Yanukovych signs law on open voting to elect parliamentary chairman], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 November 2012)</ref>

Since 2016 (In line with new anti-[[corruption in Ukraine|corruption]] rules) all senior public officials (thus also people's deputies) must declare their wealth in an electronic database.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37785741 Ukraine politicians' huge cash piles exposed in reform drive], [[BBC news]] (28 October 2016)<br>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/380965.html Lutsenko says MPs who failed to submit e-declaration face up to 2 years in prison], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (2 November 2016)</ref>

==Requirements==
===Requirements to candidates===
The People's Deputy of Ukraine may be elected a citizen of [[Ukraine]] who at the day of elections turned 21, has the right to vote, and resides within Ukraine for the last five (5) years.<ref>{{in lang|uk}}
[http://www.unian.ua/news/497594-chlen-tsvk-salamatin-zakonno-stav-nardepom.html Член ЦВК: Саламатін законно став нардепом], [[UNIAN]] (12 April 2012)</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/04/12/6962584/ Скандальний міністр незаконно був обраний до Верховної Ради], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (12 April 2012)</ref> There were number of deputies who before being elected to parliament held the [[citizenship of Ukraine]] no more than two years. Among them were [[Dmytro Salamatin]], [[Vadim Novinsky]], and others.

A citizen of Ukraine cannot be elected to the Verkhovna Rada if he has a conviction for committing a crime and that conviction is neither extinguished nor taken out of records by the law established order.

===Requirements to the deputy's mandate===
Each deputy carries out his/hers duties on a continuous base.

A deputy may not possess any other representative mandates, be appointed to the state service, be placed in other salaried positions, participate in other paid or entrepreneurial activity (except for teaching, scientific or artistic), be a member of a governing body or a supervisory council of a company or organization that are for profit. A candidates that was elected into parliament has to submit to the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]] documents confirming their dismissal from their previous work place within 20 days after the election.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/azarov-ministers-elected-to-parliament-should-decide-on-work-place-taking-into-account-presidents-opinion-316370.html Azarov: ministers elected to parliament should decide on work place taking into account president's opinion], [[Kyiv Post]] (20 November 2012)</ref>

The requirements for the incompatibility of a deputy's mandate with other types of activities are established by the Law.

In case of appearance of circumstances that breach the requirements for the incompatibility of a deputy's mandate with other types of activities, the People's Deputy of Ukraine in a 20-day term from the day of appearance of such circumstances stops that activity or submits a personal statement of resignation as the People's Deputy of Ukraine.

On 13 March 2012 the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] declared unconstitutional a ban on the participation of public officials and people's deputies in general meetings of companies or organizations that work for profit.<ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/98376/ Constitutional Court allows officials, MPs to have corporate rights, according to court ruling], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 March 2012)</ref>

In October 2016 a requirement was placed upon deputies to declare their wealth. In the first register the 413 deputies cumulatively declared wealth of about $460 million. Reacting to public criticism, deputies cancelled a salary rise that would have doubled their salary.<ref name=ft-20161101>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/210393c2-a02f-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Ukraine's MPs forgo pay rise as public balks at scale of wealth |author=Roman Olearchyk |newspaper=Financial Times |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> This measure was part of an Anti-Corruption Package passed into law in October 2014, which was a requirement of international financial support for Ukraine.<ref name=foreignpolicy-20161104>{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/04/ukraine-corruption-declaration-poroshenko-clinton-trump-russia-oligarch/ |title=Ukraine Has Opened Pandora's Database of Corruption |author=Reid Standish, Ian Bateson |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=kp-20141023>{{cite news |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/business-wire/ukraine-parliament-passes-important-laws-to-tackle-corruption-369122.html |title=Ukraine: parliament passes important laws to tackle corruption |publisher=Kyiv Post |date=23 October 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}</ref>

==Oath of office==
Before assuming office, the Verkhovna Rada's deputies must take the following oath before the parliament:

In original Ukrainian:
{{cquote|Присягаю на вірність Україні. Зобов'язуюсь усіма своїми діями боронити суверенітет і незалежність України, дбати про благо Вітчизни і добробут Українського народу.<br/>Присягаю додержуватися Конституції України та законів України, виконувати свої обов'язки в інтересах усіх співвітчизників.<ref name="s-uk">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.wikisource.org/wiki/Конституція_України#Стаття_79|title=Стаття 79|accessdate=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource|Ukrainian Wikisource]]}}</ref>}}

In English translation:
{{cquote|I swear allegiance to Ukraine. I commit myself with all my deeds to protect the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, to provide for the good of the Motherland and for the welfare of the Ukrainian people.<br/>I swear to abide by the Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine, to carry out my duties in the interests of all compatriots.<ref name="s-en">{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine#Article_79|title=Article 79|accessdate=2007-10-11|work=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref>}}

Prior to the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] the oath was read by the eldest deputy before the opening of the first session of the newly elected Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada), after which deputies affirm the oath by their signatures under its text.<ref name=VRoath14/> At the first session of the newly elected Ukrainian Parliament on 27 November 2014 all the deputies simultaneously read out the oath.<ref name=VRoath14>[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/en/148/583500/ CEC registers 357 newly elected deputies of 422] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126114422/http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/en/148/583500/ |date=2014-11-26 }}, [[National Radio Company of Ukraine]] (25 November 2014)</ref>

A refusal of taking the oath is followed by the loss (forfeiture) of a deputy's mandate.

An authority of the People's Deputy of Ukraine starts from the moment of taking the oath.

==Immunity==
Until December 2019 [[parliamentary immunity]] was guaranteed to the peoples' deputies of Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/parliament-rejects-opposition-bill-to-lift-immunity-of-deputies-and-judges/ Parliament rejects opposition bill to lift immunity of deputies and judges], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (14 April 2013)</ref>  This meant that deputies could not be held criminally liable, detained or arrested without the agreement of the Verkhovna Rada.

In December 2019, deputies’ immunity was dismantled except that a lawmakers are not legally liable for the results of voting or statements in parliament and its bodies.<ref name="10799630bill">[https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10799630-bill-stripping-ukrainian-lawmakers-of-immunity-passes-its-second-reading.html Bill stripping Ukrainian lawmakers of immunity passes its second reading], [[UNIAN]] (18 December 2019)<br>[https://112.international/politics/verkhovna-rada-finally-restricts-mps-parliamentary-immunity-46657.html Verkhovna Rada finally restricts MPs' parliamentary immunity], [[112 Ukraine]] (18 December 2019)</ref>

==Termination of office==
The authority of peoples' deputies of Ukraine lapses at the end of the official session (convocation) of the Verkhovna Rada.

The authority of a People's Deputy of Ukraine is terminated early in case of:
* resignation via personal statement
* entry into legal force of a conviction
* court recognition of him/her being either disabled or absent without notice
* renouncing citizenship or leaving Ukraine for permanent residence abroad

==Problems among People's Deputies==
Deputy's absence from parliamentary meetings is being countered by withholding salary.<ref>[https://economics.unian.info/m/10331709-ukrainian-lawmakers-fall-short-of-half-a-million-dollars-in-salaries-in-jan-sept-for-being-absent.html Ukrainian lawmakers fall short of half a million dollars in salaries in Jan-Sept for being absent], [[UNIAN]] (9 November 2018)</ref>
