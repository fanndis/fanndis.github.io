== Early life ==
[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 02.jpg|thumb|left|Marina Silva in [[Xapuri]], Acre]]
[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 01.jpg|thumb|left|Silva in [[Amazon rainforest]], Acre]]
Marina Silva was born '''Maria Osmarina da Silva''' in the small village of Breu Velho, 70&nbsp;km outside [[Rio Branco, Acre]]. Silva is a descendant of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Black people|black African]] ancestors in both her maternal and paternal lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI88634-15223,00.html|title=Brasil - NOTÍCIAS - Marina Silva deixa o PT|website=revistaepoca.globo.com|accessdate=17 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124023657/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI88634-15223,00.html|archive-date=24 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She was one of eleven children in a community of [[Rubber tapping|rubber tappers]] on the ''Bagaço'' rubber tree plantation ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Seringal Bagaço''), in the western state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. Growing up, she survived five bouts of malaria in addition to cases of hepatitis and metal poisoning.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3149004/the-green-activist-who-might-become-brazils-next-president/ |title=The Green Activist Who Might Become Brazil's Next President |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823203007/http://time.com/3149004/the-green-activist-who-might-become-brazils-next-president/ |archive-date=23 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ea83371c-26b4-11e4-bc19-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904011315/https://www.ft.com/content/ea83371c-26b4-11e4-bc19-00144feabdc0|archive-date=4 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Orphaned at age 16, young Marina moved to the state capital, Rio Branco, to study and receive treatment for hepatitis. She was taken in by nuns in a convent and received a Catholic education. There, she became the first person in her family to learn to read and write. After leaving the convent, she went to work as a housemaid in exchange for lodging.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-28865958|title=Tragedy puts Marina Silva at heart of Brazil campaign|first=Julia|last=Carneiro|work=BBC News|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=3 September 2018|via=www.bbc.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628163825/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-28865958|archive-date=28 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She completed her undergraduate degree in History from the [[Federal University of Acre]] at 26 and became increasingly politically active.

She led demonstrations called ''empates'' with [[Chico Mendes]] to warn against [[deforestation]] and the outplacement of forest communities from their traditional locations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/162 |title=Marina Silva |publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize |year=2008 |accessdate=28 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821103758/http://goldmanprize.org/node/162 |archive-date=21 August 2008 }}</ref>

== Silva as a Senator ==
In 1994, Silva was the first rubber tapper ever elected to the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. As a native Amazonian and a senator, she built support for environmental protection of the reserves as well as for social justice and [[sustainable development]] in the [[Amazon region]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/162 |title=Marina Silva |accessdate=8 August 2008 |publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821103758/http://goldmanprize.org/node/162 |archive-date=21 August 2008 }}</ref>
Deforestation decreased by 59% from 2004 to 2007, during which she implemented an integrated government policy. It simultaneously fostered sustainable development, favored territorial zoning, and attached greater value to standing forests. It also incorporated elements from international conventions and documents.<ref name="Embassy of Brazil in London">{{cite web |url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/environment/deforestation.html |title=Fall in Amazon deforestation rates (2004–2007) |accessdate=8 August 2008 |publisher=Embassy of Brazil in London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006034747/http://www.brazil.org.uk/environment/deforestation.html |archive-date=6 October 2008  }}</ref> "All of this demonstrates that, when there is integrated planning and effort, it is truly possible to change the picture," Silva said in a statement to the Embassy of Brazil in London.<ref name="Embassy of Brazil in London" />

== Lula's minister ==
A member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], Marina Silva was appointed Environment Minister by [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] in his first term (2003). She remained in office until 2008 and received several criticisms from entrepreneurs (mainly related to [[agribusiness]]) on account of delays in granting permits for projects with large environmental impact. In early 2005, however, she stated that she would not give up upon facing challenges even if they were imposed by the government to which she belonged, like the controversy over the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco River Diversion Project]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8575010.stm|title=Brazil's huge river diversion project divides opinion|author=Henry Mance|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418034500/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8575010.stm|archive-date=18 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and the building of the BR-163 highway through the [[rainforest]]: "I don't admit defeat, just challenges that must be overcome".<ref name="IPS">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsterraviva.net/tv/wsf2005/viewstory.asp?idnews=146|title=ENVIRONMENT – THE FRAGILE BALANCE OF A MINISTRY|last=Wodianer Marcondes|first=Adalberto|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=29 January 2005|accessdate=2 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713170317/http://www.ipsterraviva.net/TV/WSF2005/viewstory.asp?idnews=146|archive-date=13 July 2010}}</ref>

Also in 2005, Silva established her main lines of action for the next two years: social participation, [[sustainable development]], creation of a National Environmental System, and an Integrated Environmental Policy. As she said, "Our ministry is new. It's only 13 years old, and it needs to be rebuilt".<ref name="IPS" />

In the same year, Silva was confronted by Paulo Adário, coordinator of [[Greenpeace]] Brazil, over her environmental actions during her tenure in the ministry. Since her tenure began, Silva, together with the [[Federal Police (Brazil)|Federal Police]], the [[Brazilian Army]] and the [[Federal Highway Police (Brazil)|Federal Highway Police]], performed 32 operations against illegal [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]]. However, Adário claims that his organization monitors the Amazon region and that only one such operation was conducted in October 2004, in the town of [[Itaituba]], Pará. According to him, even if the 32 operations had actually been carried out, they would represent only half of what was anticipated in the National Plan to Combat Deforestation.<ref name="IPS" />

== Resignation ==
Silva resigned from the Lula government in May 2008. She was replaced by [[Carlos Minc]].<ref name="Barrionuevo">{{cite news |last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/americas/16brazil.html?ref=world |title='Stagnation' Made Brazil's Environment Chief Resign |work=New York Times |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804075845/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/americas/16brazil.html?ref=world |archive-date=4 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Silva cited "the growing resistance found by our team in important sectors of the government and society" as the reason for her resignation.<ref name="Phillips" /> Tension between her and the rest of the Lula administration increased when President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] chose Minister of Strategic Affairs [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] to coordinate a sustainable development plan for the Amazon, instead of her. She had become increasingly isolated in [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]]'s government due to her views against hydroelectric dams, [[biofuels]], and genetically modified crops.<ref name="Barrionuevo" />

In her campaign, Silva defended the "exercise of citizen-based political principles and values", "education for the knowledge society", "economy applied to a sustainable society", "social protection, health, welfare and 3rd generation of social programs", "[[quality of life]] and safety for all Brazilians", and "strengthening of culture and diversity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minhamarina.org.br/home/home_campanha.php|title=Marina Silva – Official Site|language=pt|accessdate=1 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728202331/http://www.minhamarina.org.br/home/home_campanha.php|archive-date=28 July 2012}}</ref>

With her speech against the endemic corruption in Brazil (see ''[[A Privataria Tucana]]'' and ''[[Mensalão scandal]]''), and in favor of sustainable development (with a due consideration to environmental issues), Silva managed to attract the middle class sectors disillusioned with the government of the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s [[Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira|PSDB]] and dissatisfied with the compensatory social policies of Lula da Silva's administration.
