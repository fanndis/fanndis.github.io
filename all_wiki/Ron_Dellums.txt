'''Ronald Vernie Dellums''' (November 24, 1935&nbsp;– July 30, 2018) was an American politician who served as [[Mayor of Oakland]] from 2007 to 2011. He had previously served thirteen terms as a Member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[California's 9th congressional district]], in office from 1971 to 1998, after which he worked as a [[lobbyist]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Dellums was born into a family of labor organizers, and enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] before serving on the [[Berkeley, California]], City Council.  He was the first [[African American]] elected to Congress from [[Northern California]] and the first successful openly [[socialist]] non-incumbent Congressional candidate after World War II.<ref name=dsa>{{cite news

When President [[Ronald Reagan]] vetoed Dellums's [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]] of 1986, a [[99th United States Congress|Democratic-controlled]] House and a [[99th United States Congress|Republican-controlled]] Senate overrode Reagan's [[veto]], the first override of a presidential foreign-policy veto in the 20th century.<ref name=ebony>{{cite news

==U.S. Congress==
Dellums was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1970 after being recruited by anti-[[Vietnam War]] activists to run against the incumbent, [[Jeffery Cohelan]], a white [[American liberalism|liberal]] close to [[organized labor]] who had not opposed the war early enough to win reelection in the district.

===Foreign policy===
During his tenure in Congress, Dellums opposed every major American [[Interventionism (politics)|military intervention]], except for emergency relief in Somalia in 1992.<ref name="nytobit"/> Dellums also supported the restriction of foreign aid to repressive African governments in [[Zaire]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]), [[Burundi]], [[Liberia]] and [[Sudan]].<ref>http://www.okayafrica.com/ron-dellums-us-congressman-south-african-apartheid-has-died/</ref>

====Anti-apartheid campaign====
[[File:Dellums-CBC.jpg|thumb|Dellums in the 1970s]]
In 1972, Dellums began his campaign to end the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] policies of [[South Africa]]. Fourteen years later, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Dellums's anti-apartheid legislation, calling for a trade restriction against South Africa and immediate [[divestment]] by American corporations. The bill, the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]] of 1986, had broad bipartisan support. It called for sanctions against South Africa and stated preconditions for lifting the sanctions, including the release of all political prisoners. President Reagan called for a policy of "constructive engagement" and [[veto]]ed the bill; however, his veto was overridden. It was the first override in the 20th century of a presidential foreign policy veto.<ref name="ebony" />

Dellums's fight against apartheid in South Africa was the subject of a [[Disney Channel]] made-for-TV film, ''[[The Color of Friendship (2000)|The Color of Friendship]]'', released in 2000. The role of Congressman Dellums was played in the film by actor [[Carl Lumbly]].<ref name=starpulse>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/movie/The_Color_of_Friendship/V184737/0/0/|title=The Color of Friendship Summary, Cast & Crew - Starpulse.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

====Cold War conflicts in southern Africa====
As part of the [[Cold War]] struggle for influence in southern Africa, the [[United States]] joined with the apartheid government of South Africa in support of [[UNITA]], led by [[Jonas Savimbi]], against the ultimately victorious [[Angola]]n forces of the [[MPLA]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. Dellums was criticized for his support of [[Fidel Castro]]'s involvement with the [[MPLA]] in Angola and was called "the prototype of the Castroite congressman" by the conservative press.<ref name=NR1>{{cite news

====''Dellums v. Bush'' (1990)====
In 1990, Dellums and 44<ref>Martin Tolchin, "MIDEAST TENSIONS; 45 in House Sue to Bar Bush From Acting Alone", ''The New York Times'', November 21, 1990.</ref> of his congressional colleagues sued then-president [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States District Court|D.C. Federal District Court]] in 1990, in the case ''[[Dellums v. Bush]]'', 752 F. Supp. 1141 (1990) attempting to halt a preemptive military buildup in the Middle East in response to [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's invasion]] of [[Kuwait]].<ref name="DVB">{{cite web |title=Dellums v Bush |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/752/1141/1588277/ |website=Justia, US LAW |access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref> The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without a [[declaration of war]] would be unlawful under [[United States Constitution|U.S. Const. art.

The Court in ''Dellums v. Bush'' indicated that, in that instance, it was, but because Congress had not yet acted as a majority, the lawsuit was premature.<ref name="DVB" />

====Military budgets and arms control====
Throughout his career Dellums led campaigns against an array of military projects, arguing that the funds would be better spent on peaceful purposes, especially in American cities. Programs he opposed included the [[Pershing II]] and [[MX missile]]s, and the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2 bomber]] (popularly known as the "stealth bomber").<ref name="SF4">{{cite news |last1=Raine |first1=George |title=Dellums, retiring, says "that fire' still burns |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Dellums-retiring-says-that-fire-still-burns-3089040.php |access-date=31 July 2018 |publisher=SFGate |date=17 November 1997}}</ref> Because of his commitment to the [[Base Realignment and Closure|closing of unneeded military bases]], Dellums did not oppose the closing of the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in his own district.<ref name=EBE>{{cite news

The [[B-2 Spirit|B-2 Stealth Bomber]] is a long-range [[strategic bombing|strategic bomber]], that features [[stealth technology]] that makes it far less visible to [[radar]]. The B-2 was a major technological advance; however, it was designed during the [[Cold War]] for military scenarios that some argued were less relevant following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].  Its total program cost was estimated in 1997 at over US$2.2 billion per airplane.<ref name=FAS>{{cite news

|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-2.htm
}}</ref>

Although Dellums opposed the B-2 project from the start, Congress approved initial funding for production of 135 bombers in 1987. However, with the winding down of the [[Cold War]], total B-2 production was reduced to 21 aircraft in the early 1990s. But in 1997, seven former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretaries of Defense]] signed a letter urging Congress to buy more B-2s, citing the difficulty of assembling a similar engineering team in the future should the B-2 project be terminated.<ref name=opensecret>{{cite news

}}</ref> Dellums, citing five independent studies consistent with his position, offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers with the existing 21 aircraft. The amendment was narrowly defeated;<ref name=Amendment>[https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/970623-b2.htm Debate on Dellums Amendment to 1998 Defense Authorization Act] June 23, 1997.</ref> nonetheless, Congress never approved funding for additional B-2 bombers.

====Vietnam war crimes hearings====
In January 1971, just weeks into his first term, Dellums set up an exhibit of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] [[war crime]]s in an annex to his Congressional office, coordinated with the  [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry]] (CCI).<ref name=uhl /> The exhibit featured four large posters depicting atrocities committed by American soldiers, embellished with red paint.

The [[My Lai massacre]] was followed shortly thereafter by a series of [[Congressional hearings|hearings]] on war crimes in Vietnam, which began April 25, 1971. Dellums had called for formal investigations into the allegations, but Congress chose not to endorse the proceedings. As such, the hearings were ''ad hoc'' and only informational in nature. As a condition of room use, press and camera presence were not permitted; however, the proceedings were transcribed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vietnam War Crimes Hearings |url=http://members.aol.com/warlibrary/vwch1.htm}}</ref> A small number of other anti-Vietnam War congressional representatives also took part in the hearings.

===Integration of gays and lesbians in the military===
In 1993, Dellums was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Though he argued in favor of integration, Dellums was the sole sponsor of H.R. 2401, introduced on June 14, 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h103-2401|title=H.R. 2401: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994.|publisher=Govtrack.us}}</ref> adding language to the Defense Authorization Act of 1994 to ensure continued support for [[unit cohesion]] in the military. Although the bill contained that language, Dellums pointed out that he personally found the language unacceptable, stating in the Congressional Record on August 4, 1993: "The bill also contains at least one policy that, while unacceptable to this Member in substantive terms, is not as retrograde as it might have been: It supports the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the issue of allowing gay and lesbian service members to serve their country." Remaining in the bill was Title V Section G "[e]xpresses as congressional policy the prohibition against homosexual conduct or activity in the armed forces. Requires separation from the armed forces for such conduct or activity. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the standards for military appointments and enlistments reflect such policy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr2401eh/pdf/BILLS-103hr2401eh.pdf|pages=230–238|title=H. R. 2401}}</ref>  Dellums's "yes" vote on the bill with the unit cohesion support language was the first time in his 22-year congressional tenure that he voted in favor of any defense spending bill, previously opposing them on economic principles.<ref name="CON8493">{{cite web |title=Congressional Record - 8/4/93 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/GPO-CRECB-1993-pt13/GPO-CRECB-1993-pt13-1-2 |website=USGov |access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref> However, Dellums gave several economic reasons in the Congressional Record for his "yes" vote, on H.R. 2401, including that "It cuts ballistic missile defense to $3 billion—less than one-half the level planned by the Bush administration ..." and: "it devotes a record $11.2 billion to environmental cleanup and improvement, and does so in a way that will stimulate the development of new technologies and new markets for American firms".<ref name="CON8493" />

===U.S. House Committee positions===
Dellums served as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia|House Committee on the District of Columbia]] and the [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]].<ref>https://history.house.gov/Congressional-Overview/Profiles/103rd/</ref>

[[File:Rondellums105th.jpg|left|170px|thumb|Dellums's official portrait in the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]], 1993.]]
Dellums was reelected 11 times from this Oakland-based district, which changed numbers twice during his tenure–from the 7th (1971–75) to the 8th (1975–93) to the 9th (1993–98). He only dropped below 57 percent of the vote twice, in 1980 and 1982. In his last House election race, in 1996, Dellums bested his opponent, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Deborah Wright, by a 77%–18% margin.<ref name=rand>{{cite news

Millender-McDonald described Dellums as a "distinguished, principled <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> educated man." Her tribute went on:

<blockquote>Congressman Ron Dellums is revered on both sides of this aisle because of his integrity and his commitment to progressive ideas. He was always on the cutting edge of the issues. California will miss him in the ninth district, but the State has been enriched by Ron Dellums. While he towers above most of us physically, this attribute is matched by his intellect, faith in the process and optimism for peaceful resolution of conflict.<ref name=LOC2>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r105:H04FE8-643:|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov|access-date=30 July 2018}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Congressman [[Danny K. Davis|Danny Davis]] of Illinois described Dellums:
<blockquote>A creative, piercing, probing, incisive, thought-provoking, inspiring, charismatic, careful, considerate and deliberative mind. The mind to stand up when others sit down. The mind to act when others refuse to act. The mind to stand even when you stand alone, battered, bruised and scorned, but still standing. Standing on principle, standing tall and standing for the people.<ref name=LOC3>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r105:H11FE8-235:|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov|access-date=30 July 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] described Dellums as "...one of the most giving, open and stalwart, a real stalwart man when he was Chairman"
<blockquote>We are losing one of its finest Members, a Member that I have great respect for, because he always did his homework, was so articulate and eloquent on this floor.
He always got my attention when he stood up and took the microphone. He would stop every Member in their tracks to hear what he had to say, and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that both sides of the aisle had for the gentleman from California.
And the incredible reputation that the gentleman from California has brought to this House; he has elevated this House. He has elevated the distinction of this House by serving here, and this House will greatly miss him when he leaves.<ref name=LOC4>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r105:1:./temp/~r1051D58xM:e45:|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov|access-date=30 July 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Ron Dellums 1996.jpg|thumb|Dellums in 1996]]
Dellums's voting records in Congress were "almost without exception straight As" from groups such as the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[AFL-CIO]].<ref name=EBE /> He received 100% on consumer group [[Public Citizen]]'s scorecard.<ref name=gsenet>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsenet.org/library/10gov/lcv104th.php |title=de beste bron van informatie over g senet.

===Dismissal of drug use allegations===
An eight-month investigation cleared Dellums of allegations that he had used [[cocaine]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], finding there was no basis for the allegations. The investigation of Dellums and two other congressmen, [[Texas]] Democrat [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] and California [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Barry Goldwater Jr.]], began in 1983, based on a complaint from a House doorkeeper,<ref name=WaPo1 /> who pleaded guilty to drug charges on Capitol Hill himself in March 1983.<ref>{{cite news

==Lobbyist==
Dellums worked as a legislative lobbyist, which drew criticism described in the ''[[East Bay Express]]'', a local newspaper.<ref name=EBE /> Shortly after leaving office, Dellums began consulting for an international health-care company, Healthcare Management International which invests in health insurance programs in developing countries.<ref name="EASJ">{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Gary |title=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1452265650 |page=442 }}</ref>

Dellums worked in Washington, D.C., as a [[lobbyist]] for clients such as the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] [[Peralta Community College District]] and [[AC Transit]], the public transit district charged with offering [[mass transit]] throughout the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]].  Dellums's firm lobbied for [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]], a company that manufactures aircraft engines.  He also worked on behalf of the [[San Francisco International Airport]] during its attempts to build additional runway capacity, which has been vigorously opposed by environmental groups.  His company was engaged in community relations work for the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] which conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department of Energy, and has long had a contentious relationship with its residential neighbors and the Berkeley city council.  In addition he lobbied for [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], a multinational pharmaceutical corporation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=NcDonald |first1=Heather |title=Dellums takes hit for lobbying |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2006/03/20/dellums-takes-hit-for-lobbying/ |access-date=31 July 2018 |publisher=East Bay Times}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Bill Browder]] testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that representatives of Vladimir Putin had hired "Howard Schweitzer of [[Cozen O'Connor]] Public Strategies and former Congressman Ronald Dellums to lobby members of Congress on Capitol Hill to repeal the [[Magnitsky Act]] and to remove Sergei's name from the Global Magnitsky bill."

A former East Bay Express columnist once wrote a column titled "Dellums for Dollars" criticizing Dellums's lobbying.<ref name=EBE /> Speaking in defense of Dellums, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson said that, if asked, Dellums would likely say "just because I'm advocating for a company that may be paying me consulting fees, I'm not selling out my beliefs."<ref name=EBE />

==Mayor of Oakland==

===2006 Oakland mayoral election===
{{see main|2006 Oakland mayoral election}}
After Oakland Council President [[Ignacio De La Fuente]] and District 3 City Council member [[Nancy Nadel]] declared their mayoral candidacies, Dellums was recruited to run for Mayor of Oakland.  An informal committee, "Draft Dellums", collected 8,000 signatures and presented them to the former Congressman at a public meeting at Laney College.  Crowds of Oaklanders chanted "Run, Ron, Run".<ref>Heather MacDonald, "Ex-rep. thrills backers by entering Oakland mayoral race" ''Oakland Tribune'', October 8, 2005.</ref>

In October 2005, reportedly after weeks of deliberation and speculation, Dellums announced that he would run for mayor of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. The incumbent mayor, former [[California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]], was prohibited by [[term limits]] from running again.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Allen-Taylor |first1=Douglas |title=Page One Oakland in 2005: Campaigns for Mayor Begin as Brown Plans Exit |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2006-01-03/article/23123 |access-date=31 July 2018 |newspaper=Berkeley Daily Planet |date=3 January 2006}}</ref>

On June 16, 2006, after a careful ballot count, and a dispute over whether votes for unqualified write-in candidates such as [[George W. Bush]] and [[Homer Simpson]] counted towards the total, Dellums was unofficially declared the winner in the Oakland mayoral race. Dellums garnered a 50.18 percent majority to win the election.  This was 155 votes more than needed to avoid a runoff. Dellums received 41,992 votes, while his nearest challengers received 27,607 votes, and 10,928 votes respectively.<ref name=sfgate2>{{cite news

===Transition and citizen task forces===
Mayor-Elect Dellums's transition to office involved 800 Oaklanders who joined 41 task forces to make recommendations on issues ranging from public safety to education and affordable housing.<ref>{{cite news|first=Heather|last=MacDonald|title=Dellums Makes 4 Additions to His Staff|work=Oakland Tribune|date=February 27, 2007}}</ref>
Many of these recommendations helped to shape the policy agenda of the Dellums administration. The task forces recommended a land use policy which would emphasize zoning for job-creating business. This policy was adopted in 2007, and the city is being zoned. The task forces recommended a stronger policy on the hiring of local residents, and the City Council appointed a group to pursue this change.  The task forces recommended a focus on the green economy, and the Mayor, along with a variety of community organizations created the Green Jobs Corps, an office of sustainability and the [[East Bay Green Corridor]].  Mayor Dellums reported that approximately two-thirds of the recommendations had been implemented as of the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Quan |url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/Mayor/index.htm |title=Mayor ~ City of Oakland, California |publisher=.oaklandnet.com |access-date=August 26, 2012}}</ref>  The Task Forces and the Inauguration itself, which included hundreds of the city's least affluent residents, were considered examples of [[grassroots democracy]].<ref>Mayfield, Kimberly (January 4, 2007), "Grassroots Democracy Sprouts in Oakland", ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref>

===Public safety initiatives===
Crime rates were high when Dellums took office in January 2007 and at his first State of the City Address in January 2008, Dellums called for hiring more police officers.  Dellums promised that by year's end, the police department would be fully staffed at 803 officers.<ref>{{cite news

In addition, to follow through on his calls for hiring more officers, Dellums offered Measure NN on the November 2008 ballot, a voter initiative parcel tax to hire 70 additional police officers at a hiring and training cost of $250,000 each.  Though 55 percent of Oakland voters supported Measure NN, this failed to meet California's "two thirds" constitutional requirement for the enactment of a new tax.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heredia |first1=Christopher |title=Oakland police tax fails |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-police-tax-fails-3186942.php |access-date=31 July 2018 |publisher=SFGate |date=6 November 2008}}</ref>

Dellums's administration negotiated the passage of a new police contract which was especially noteworthy, as it broke the Oakland Police Officers Association's opposition to the civilianization of certain OPD positions which were previously staffed by "sworn," uniformed police officers, with concomitant payrolls and police academy training costs.  OPD then hired "non-sworn" personnel to work some of its desk jobs and administrative jobs, freeing up academy uniformed officers for street patrol and investigative work.<ref name="daily planet 2">{{cite news

On Saturday, March 21, 2009, during the [[2009 Oakland police shootings]] incident, the Oakland Police Department lost three sergeants and one officer.   One of the officers left instructions in his emergency packet that if he were killed in the line of duty that Dellums not be permitted to speak at his funeral.  Two of the officers' families requested the same, and when Dellums attended the March 28 public memorial service at the [[Oracle Arena]] he honored the requests.<ref name=nongrata>{{citation

In his State of the City address in 2008 Dellums promised to reduce the crime rate by 10% during 2009;  the crime rate actually went down by 13%.<ref>V. Smoothe, [http://www.abetteroakland.com/oakland-crime-stats-november-2009/2009-11-16 "A Better Oakland"], Oakland Crime Stats, November 2009.</ref>

In 2009 Dellums hired the highly regarded [[Anthony Batts]], formerly the [[Long Beach Police Department (California)|Long Beach police]] chief. Batts had a record of reducing both crime and police shootings in that Southern California city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matier |first1=Ross |title=Dysfunctional politics on display in Oakland |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Dysfunctional-politics-on-display-in-Oakland-3183861.php |access-date=31 July 2018 |publisher=SFGate |date=23 June 2010}}</ref>

===Education initiatives===
Noting that reducing teacher turn-over and improving the engagement of teachers with the families of their students would require increasing the number of teachers who came from the local community, Dellums initiated a program  to create more teachers who were diverse local residents.  He held teacher recruitment summits in City Hall, helped the [[Teach Tomorrow in Oakland]] program to obtain $2.7 million in federal funding, and spoke to the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] about the national potential of such programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schoolweb.ousd.k12.ca.us/NewTeacherResource/Teach%20Tomorrow.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713062421/http://schoolweb.ousd.k12.ca.us/NewTeacherResource/Teach%20Tomorrow.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |title=New Teacher Resources |publisher=Schoolweb.ousd.k12.ca.us |access-date=August 26, 2012 }}</ref> The Community Task Forces remained active in these efforts.

In 2009 Dellums launched an anti-drop-out initiative which included sponsoring back to school rallies at City Hall and participating with the school district in truancy reduction efforts.  He accepted an invitation from the national organization, America's Promise,  to join their efforts at drop-out prevention.  As part of this effort, he started Oakland's Promise,  recruited several dozen community-based organizations to participate, held a Summit with 350 participants, and adopted an Action Plan to cut Oakland's drop-out rate in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americaspromise.org/Our-Work/Community-Action/~/media/Files/Our%20Work/Dropout%20Prevention/Grad%20Nation%20Action%20Forum/Oakland%20Overview%20Brief.ashx |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620203407/http://americaspromise.org/Our-Work/Community-Action/~/media/Files/Our%20Work/Dropout%20Prevention/Grad%20Nation%20Action%20Forum/Oakland%20Overview%20Brief.ashx |archive-date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref>

===Promoting Oakland===
As Mayor, Dellums proposed the idea of Oakland as a "Model City". He argued that Oakland is "big enough to be significant and small enough to get your arms around", and that the federal government needs a city like Oakland on which to try out new urban policy inventions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rayburn |first1=Kelly |title=Mayor Dellums outlines agenda for Oakland |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/01/14/mayor-dellums-outlines-agenda-for-oakland/ |access-date=31 July 2018 |newspaper=Mercury News |date=14 January 2008}}</ref>

From 2008, Dellums campaigned to bring millions in [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] federal stimulus funding to Oakland, using both his extensive Washington D.C. contacts and the idea of the Model City.  By the end of 2009, his efforts had yielded US$65 million in stimulus funding for Oakland, including the largest police grant of any city in the country, and the second largest amount in competitive funding after [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Callahan |first=Lauren |url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2009/12/10/mayor-and-staff-bask-in-the-glow-of-the-stimulus/ |title=Mayor and staff bask in the glow of the stimulus – Oakland North : North Oakland News, Food, Art and Events |publisher=Oaklandnorth.net |date=December 10, 2009 |access-date=August 26, 2012}}</ref>
