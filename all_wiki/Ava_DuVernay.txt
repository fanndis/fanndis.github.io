==Career==
DuVernay's first interest was in journalism, a choice influenced by an internship with [[CBS News]]. She was assigned to help cover the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]].<ref name=UCLAMag-MoN-2012/> DuVernay became disillusioned with journalism, however, and decided to move into public relations, working as a junior publicist at [[20th Century Fox]], [[Savoy Pictures]], and a few other PR agencies. She opened her own public relations firm, The DuVernay Agency, also known as DVAPR, in 1999.<ref name=Vulture-Selma-Interview-2014>{{cite news|last1=Yuan|first1=Jada|title=With Her MLK Drama Selma, Ava DuVernay Is Directing History|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/12/ava-duvernay-on-the-long-road-to-selma.html|work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=2 December 2014|language=en}}</ref>

Through DVAPR she provided marketing and PR services to the entertainment and lifestyle industry, working on campaigns for movies and television shows, such as ''[[Lumumba (film)|Lumumba]]'', ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'', ''[[Shrek 2]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'', and ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''.<ref name=Biography-Profile-2018 /><ref name=UCLAMag-MoN-2012 /><ref name=Agoralumiere-SaturdayNight-2006 /><ref name=CNN-MoN-2012>{{cite news|first1=Alicia W.|last1=Stewart|title=Filmmaker Ava DuVernay uses a lens of legacy|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/25/filmmaker-ava-duvernay-uses-a-lens-of-legacy/|work=[[CNN]]|date=October 25, 2012|format=Includes video and transcript}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes-MoN-2012>{{cite news|last1=Rickey|first1=Carrie|title=She's a Graduate of an Unusual Film School|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/movies/ava-duvernay-and-middle-of-nowhere.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Filmmaker-MoN-Interview-2012>{{cite news|first1=Nekisa|last1=Cooper|title=Love on the Outside|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/57145-love-on-the-outside/|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=November 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Source-Profile-2016>{{cite news|first1=Da'ryl|last1=Victoria|title=Breaking Barriers: Ava DuVernay Directs Things Her Way|url=http://thesource.com/2016/03/23/breaking-barriers-ava-duvernay-directs-things-her-way/|work=[[The Source]]|date=March 23, 2016}}</ref>

Other ventures launched by DuVernay include Urban Beauty Collective, a promotional network that began in 2003 and had more than 10,000 African-American beauty salons and barbershops in 16 (20 since 2008) U.S. cities.

===Film===
[[File:DuVernaySanFranFilmFest.jpg|left|thumb|276x276px|DuVernay at the 2010 [[AFI Film Festival]]]]
In 2005, over the Christmas holiday, DuVernay decided to take $6,000 and make her first film, a short called ''Saturday Night Life''.<ref name=Agoralumiere-SaturdayNight-2006 /><ref name=Filmmaker-MoN-2012 /> Based on her mother's experiences,<ref name=Agoralumiere-SaturdayNight-2006 /> the 12-minute film was about an uplifting trip by a struggling single mother ([[Melissa De Sousa]]) and her three kids to a local Los Angeles discount grocery store. The film toured the festival circuit and was broadcast on February 6, 2007, as part of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''Black Filmmaker Showcase''.<ref name=NewsBlaze-SaturdayNight-2009>{{cite news|first1=Kam|last1=Williams|title=Ava DuVernay 'This Is the Life' Interview with Kam Williams|url=https://newsblaze.com/entertainment/interviews/ava-duvernay-this-is-life-interview-with-kam-williams_8672/|work=NewsBlaze|date=March 17, 2009}}</ref>

DuVernay next explored making documentaries, because they can be done on a smaller budget than fiction films, and she could learn the trade while doing so.<ref name=Interview-MoN-2012>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Emma|title=In the Middle of Somewhere with Ava DuVernay and Emayatzy Corinealdi|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/ava-duvernay-emayatzy-corinealdi/|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|date=October 11, 2012}}</ref> In 2007, she directed the short ''Compton in C Minor,'' for which she "challenged herself to capture [[Compton, California|Compton]] in only two hours and present whatever she found." The following year, she made her feature directorial debut with the [[alternative hip hop]] documentary ''[[This Is the Life (2008 film)|This Is the Life]],'' a history of LA's [[Good Life Cafe]]'s arts movement, in which she participated as part of the duo [[Figures of Speech]].

In 2011, DuVernay's first narrative feature film, ''[[I Will Follow (film)|I Will Follow]]'', a drama starring [[Salli Richardson-Whitfield]], was released theatrically. DuVernay's aunt Denise Sexton was the inspiration for the film.<ref name=Filmmaker-MoN-2012>{{cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/37878-middle-of-nowhere-writer-director-ava-duvernay/|title=Middle of Nowhere – Writer/Director Ava DuVernay|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The film cost DuVernay $50,000 and was made in 14 days.<ref name=NYTimes-MoN-2012 /> [[Roger Ebert]] called it "one of the best films I've seen about coming to terms with the death of a loved one."<ref name=Ebert-IWF-Review-2012>{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=I Will Follow (2010).

DuVernay was commissioned by the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] to create a film about [[African-American history]]. Her ''August 28: A Day in the Life of a People'' explores six significant events that happened on the same date, [[August 28]]; it debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. The 22-minute film stars [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Regina King]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Michael Ealy]], [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]], [[André Holland]] and [[Glynn Turman]]. Events depicted include [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'s [[royal assent]] to the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|UK Slavery Abolition Act]] in 1833, the 1955 lynching of 14-year-old [[Emmett Till]] in [[Mississippi]], the release of [[Motown]]'s first number-one song, "[[Please Mr. Postman]]" by [[The Marvellettes]], Rev.

The film features several prominent activists, politicians, and public figures, such as [[Bryan Stevenson]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Van Jones]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], and others, who discuss such issues as convict leasing, the war on drugs, and disproportionate arrests, convictions and sentencing of minorities.<ref name=Guardian-13th-2016>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Nigel M.|title=The 13th: inside Ava DuVernay's Netflix prison documentary on racial inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/the-13th-trailer-ava-duvernay-netflix-prison-race|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref>
