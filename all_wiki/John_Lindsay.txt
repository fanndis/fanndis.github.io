'''John Vliet Lindsay''' ({{IPAc-en|v|l|iː|t}}; November 24, 1921 – December 19, 2000) was an American politician and lawyer. During his political career, Lindsay was a U.S. congressman, mayor of [[New York City]], and candidate for U.S. president. He was also a regular guest host of ''[[Good Morning America]]''. Lindsay served as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from January 1959 to December 1965 and as [[mayor of New York]] City from January 1966 to December 1973. He switched from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in 1971, and launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the [[1972 United States presidential election#Democratic Party nomination|1972 Democratic presidential nomination]] as well as the 1980 Democratic nomination for Senator from [[New York (state)|New York]]. He died from Parkinson's disease and pneumonia in [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]] on December 19, 2000.

== Military service and legal career ==

With the outbreak of World War II, Lindsay completed his studies early and in 1943 joined the [[United States Navy]] as a [[gunnery officer]]. He obtained the rank of [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]], earning five [[battle stars]] through action in the [[invasion of Sicily]] and a series of landings in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0D15F63D5A117B93C1A81783D85F4C8585F9|title=Lindsay Lacked Party's Backing; Surprise G.

Back in [[New York City]], Lindsay met his future wife, Mary Anne Harrison (1926-2004), at the wedding of [[Nancy Walker Bush Ellis|Nancy Walker Bush]] (daughter of [[Connecticut]]'s Senator [[Prescott Bush]] and sister of future President [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] and aunt of [[George W.

==U.S. Representative==

Lindsay began gravitating toward politics as one of the founders of the Youth for [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] club in 1951 and as president of [[The New York Young Republican Club]] in 1952.<ref name="congress">{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00717FF3F59107B93C7A9178AD95F4C8585F9|title=Lindsay Victory Puts Him In Fore; He Is Seen as G.O.P.

In 1958, with the backing of Brownell as well as [[Bruce Barton]], [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt]], and [[Wendell Willkie|Edith Willkie]],<ref name="Cannato"/> Lindsay won the Republican primary and went on to be elected to Congress as the representative of the "[[Upper East Side|Silk Stocking]]" 17th district, exemplified by [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]] but also encompassing the diverse [[Lower East Side]] and historically bohemian [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="congress" />

While in Congress, Lindsay established a liberal voting record increasingly at odds with his own party.<ref name="Weaver">{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20D15FF385812738DDDA90B94DD405B858AF1D3|title=Lindsay's Voting Veers From G.O.P.; House Record Also Shows a Shift From Conservatives|author=Weaver, Warren|date=May 30, 1965|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|page=30|access-date=May 19, 2009}}</ref> He was an early supporter of federal aid to education and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]];<ref name="Cannato" /> and advocated the establishment of a federal [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and a [[National Endowment for the Humanities|National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities]].<ref name="Cannato" />  He was called a maverick,<ref name="Obit" /> casting the lone dissenting vote for a Republican-sponsored bill extending the power of the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] to impound obscene mail<ref name="Cannato" /> and one of only two dissenting votes for a bill allowing federal interception of mail from [[Communism|Communist]] countries.<ref name="Cannato" /> Also known for his wit, when asked by his party leaders why he opposed legislation to combat Communism and [[pornography]], he replied that the two were the major industries of his district and if they were suppressed then "the 17th district would be a depressed area".<ref name="winner" />

==Mayoralty==
In [[1965 New York City mayoral election|1965]], Lindsay was elected [[Mayor of New York City]] as a Republican with the support of the [[Liberal Party of New York]] in a three-way race. He defeated Democratic mayoral candidate [[Abraham D. Beame]], then City Comptroller, as well as ''[[National Review]]'' founder [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], who ran on the [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] line. The unofficial motto of the campaign, taken from a [[Murray Kempton]] column, was "He is fresh and everyone else is tired".<ref name="Cannato">{{cite book|last=Cannato|first=Vincent|title=The Ungovernable City|publisher=Basic Books|date=June 20, 2001|page=720|isbn=978-0465008438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Upv5ezVPBOMC&q=The+Ungovernable+City}}</ref><ref name="Remembering">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/metro-matters-remembering-a-mayor-faults-and-all.html|title=Metro Matters; Remembering A Mayor, Faults and All|last=Purnick|first=Joyce|author-link=Joyce Purnick| date=December 21, 2000|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=May 23, 2009}}</ref>

===Labor issues===
{{further|1966 New York City transit strike|New York City teachers' strike of 1968}}
[[File:Lindsaybehinddesk.jpg|thumb|Lindsay speaking at City Hall in January 1966]]
On his first day as mayor, January 1, 1966, the [[Transport Workers Union of America]], led by [[Mike Quill]] shut down the city with a [[1966 New York City transit strike|complete halt of subway and bus service]]. As New Yorkers endured the transit strike, Lindsay remarked, "I still think it's a fun city," and walked four miles (6&nbsp;km) from his hotel room to City Hall in a gesture to show it.<ref name="Schaap"/> [[Dick Schaap]], then a columnist for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', popularized the term in an article titled ''Fun City''.<ref name="Schaap">The Fun City, ''New York Herald Tribune'', January 7, 1966, pg. 13:</ref><ref name="FYI Fun">Schneider, Daniel B.

In 1966 the settlement terms of the transit strike, combined with increased welfare costs and general economic decline, forced Lindsay to lobby the New York State legislature for a new municipal [[income tax]] and higher water rates for city residents, plus a new [[commuter tax]] for people who worked in the city but resided elsewhere.

The transit strike was the first of many labor struggles. In 1968, in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city complete control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the [[United Federation of Teachers]], however, saw the breakup as a way of [[union busting]], as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of [[Ocean Hill, Brooklyn|Ocean Hill]]-[[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without [[due process]]. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968|protracted citywide teachers' strike]] that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November.<ref>Stetson, Damon.

The summer of 1971 ushered in another devastating strike as over 8,000 workers belonging to [[AFSCME]] District Council 37 walked off their jobs for two days. The strikers included the operators of the city's [[drawbridge]]s and [[sewage treatment plant]]s. Drawbridges over the [[Harlem River]] were locked in the "up" position, barring automobile travel into Manhattan, and hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage flowed into local waterways.

===Racial and civil unrest===
[[File:John Lindsay Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|Lindsay meets with [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the [[Oval Office]], August 1967]]
Lindsay served on the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the [[Kerner Commission]]. This body was established in 1967 by President Johnson after riots in urban centers of the US, including Newark and Detroit. Lindsay maximized publicity and coverage of his activities on the commission, and while other commissioners made inconspicuous visits to riot-damaged sites, Lindsay would alert the press before his fact-finding missions. Nonetheless, he was especially influential in producing the Kerner Report; its dramatic language of the nation "moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal" was his rhetoric.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpbvsXCdtVIC&q=lindsay%20kerner%20commission&pg=PA78 |title=The News Media and Disorders: The Kerner Commission's Examination of Race|author=Hrach, Thomas J.|year=2008|isbn=9780549689546|access-date=2013-07-17}}</ref>

===Re-election===
In 1969, a backlash against Lindsay caused him to lose the Republican mayoral [[primary election|primary]] to [[New York State Senate|state Senator]] [[John Marchi|John J. Marchi]], who was enthusiastically supported by Buckley and the party's conservative wing. In the Democratic primary, the most conservative candidate, City Comptroller [[Mario Procaccino]], defeated several more liberal contenders and won the nomination with only a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes. "The more the Mario", he quipped.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The More the Mario|last=Pileggi|first=Nicholas|date=April 14, 1969|magazine=[[New York Magazine]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdt2As2SaF4C&q=%22the+more+the+mario%22page%3D34&pg=PA34}}</ref> Procaccino, who ran to Lindsay's right, went on to coin the term "[[limousine liberal]]" to describe Lindsay and his wealthy [[Manhattan]] backers.

Despite losing the Republican nomination, Lindsay remained on the ballot as the candidate of the [[New York Liberal Party]]. In his campaign he said "mistakes were made" and called being mayor of New York City "the second toughest job in America."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive |title=Campaign|last=Dougherty|first=Philip|date=November 11, 1969|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|page=73|access-date=September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>Lindsay was not the first to refer to the office in this way; see the list of references in Popik, Barry.

But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a [[Watts Riots|Watts]] or [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]]. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it." The second opened with a drive through the [[Holland Tunnel]] from lower Manhattan toward [[New Jersey]] and suggested that, "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..." followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thirteen.org/lindsay/video/sample-3/|title=1969 Campaign Commercials from WNET-TV13|year=2011|publisher=PBS station Thirteen|website=Thirteen.org|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref>

While narrowly losing [[Brooklyn]] and [[the Bronx]] due to Procaccino's entrenched support among ethnic, working class whites (with Marchi winning his native [[Staten Island]]), Lindsay was able to vanquish his opponents with support from three distinct groups.<ref name="lizzi" /> First were the city's minorities, mostly African Americans and Puerto Ricans, who were concentrated in [[Harlem]], the [[South Bronx]] and various Brooklyn neighborhoods, including [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] and [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]].<ref name="lizzi" /><ref name="KIHSS" /> Second were the white and economically secure residents of certain areas of Manhattan.<ref name="lizzi" /><ref name="KIHSS" /> Third were the whites in the boroughs outside Manhattan who had a similar educational background and "cosmopolitan" attitude, namely residents of solidly middle-class neighborhoods, including [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] and [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]] in [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn Heights]] in Brooklyn.<ref name="lizzi" /> This third category included many traditionally Democratic Jewish Americans who were repelled by Procaccino's conservatism. This created a plurality coalition (42%) in Lindsay's second three-way race. His margin of victory rose from just over 100,000 more votes than his Democratic opponent in 1965 to over 180,000 votes over Procaccino in 1969, despite appearing on just one [[Third party (United States)|third party]] ballot line (see [[New York City Mayoral Elections]]).<ref name="lizzi">{{cite journal|last=Lizzi|first=Maria C.|date=September 18, 2008|title='My Heart Is as Black as Yours': White Backlash, Racial Identity, and Italian American Stereotypes in New York City's 1969 Mayoral Campaign|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=27|issue=3|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.3/lizzi.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202085609/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.3/lizzi.html|archive-date=December 2, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=KIHSS>Kihss, Peter [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60816FA3E591A7493C4A9178AD95F4D8685F9 Poor and Rich, Not Middle-Class, The Key to Lindsay Re-Election] November 6, 1969.</ref>

===Hard-hat riots===
[[File:John Lindsay NYWTS 2.jpg|thumb|Lindsay speaking at a senior citizens rally in October 1965]]
{{main|Hard Hat Riot}}
On May 8, 1970, near the intersection of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] and at [[New York City Hall]], a [[riot]] started when about 200 [[construction worker]]s mobilized by the New York State [[AFL-CIO]] labor federation attacked about 1,000 high school and college students and others [[Student Strike of 1970|protesting]] the [[Kent State shootings]], the [[Cambodian Campaign]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Some attorneys, bankers, and investment analysts from nearby Wall Street investment firms tried to protect many of the students but were themselves attacked, and some onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing. Although more than seventy people were injured, including four policemen, only six people were arrested.<ref name="Foner">Foner, ''U.S. Labor and the Vietnam War'', 1989.</ref><ref name="Mcfadden">{{cite news|author=[[Robert D.

===Police corruption===

In 1970, ''The New York Times'' printed [[New York City Police Department]] Patrolman [[Frank Serpico]]'s claims of widespread [[police corruption]].  As a result, the [[Knapp Commission]] was eventually formed that April by Lindsay, with investigations beginning in June, although public hearings did not start until October 18, 1971.  Its preliminary report was not issued until August 1972, and final recommendations only released on December 27, 1972. Because of his forming of the Knapp Commission, many NYPD officers disliked him and didn't want him to attend their [[funeral]]s in case they died on duty and [[heckle]]d, hissed and booed him when he did appear. The wife of Rocco Laurie, one of two city police officers who were murdered by black revolutionaries in 1972, specifically stated that she did not want Lindsay to attend her husband's funeral that year.

==Party switch and presidential campaign==
In 1971, Lindsay and his wife cut ties with the Republican Party by registering with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Lindsay said, "In a sense, this step recognizes the failure of 20 years in progressive Republican politics. In another sense, it represents the renewed decision to fight for new national leadership."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title=1971 Year in Review |publisher=Upi.com |date=1971-12-28 |access-date=2013-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503142809/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |archive-date=May 3, 2009 }}</ref> Lindsay then launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the [[1972 United States presidential election#Democratic Party nomination|1972 Democratic presidential nomination]]. He attracted positive media attention and was a successful fundraiser. Lindsay did well in the early [[Arizona]] [[caucus]], coming in second place<ref>Apple, R.W.

==Assessment==
[[File:John Lindsay NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Lindsay at the first [[public hearing]] on proposed executive capital budget in February 1966]]

In a 1972 Gallup poll, 60% of New Yorkers felt Lindsay's administration was working poorly, nine percent rated it good, and not one person thought its performance excellent.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Jeff Greenfield]]|title=3 Hail and farewell; Reading John Lindsay's face Lindsay |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/07/29/404916231.pdf|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=July 29, 1973 |access-date=March 17, 2010 }}</ref> By 1978, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Lindsay "an exile in his own city".<ref name="exile">{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00710FB385A13728DDDA10894D9405B888BF1D3|title=An Exile In His Own City; Lindsay|last=Stein|first=Howard|date=January 8, 1978|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|pages=New York Times Magazine, p. SM3|access-date=May 19, 2009}}</ref>

Lindsay's record remained controversial after he left politics. Conservative historian [[Fred Siegel]], calling Lindsay the worst New York City mayor of the 20th century, said "Lindsay wasn't incompetent or foolish or corrupt, but he was actively destructive".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/the-big-city-the-greatest-give-mayor-a-mirror.html|title=The Big City; The Greatest? Give Mayor A Mirror|author=[[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]]|date=January 15, 2000|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=June 8, 2009}}</ref> Journalist Steven Weisman observed "Lindsay's congressional career had taught him little of the need for subtle bureaucratic maneuvering, for understanding an opponent's self-interest, or for the great patience required in a sprawling government."<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Lindsay Failed as Mayor|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/WashingtonMonthly-1972apr-00043|last=Weisman|first=Steven R.|date=April 1972|work=The Washington Monthly|page=50|access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>

Lindsay's budget aide [[Peter C. Goldmark, Jr.]] told historian Vincent Cannato that the administration "failed to come to grips with what a neighborhood is. We never realized that crime is something that happens to, and in, a community." Assistant Nancy Seifer said "There was a whole world out there that nobody in City Hall knew anything about ... If you didn't live on [[Central Park West]], you were some kind of lesser being."<ref>Cannato, p. 391.</ref> While many experts traced the city's mid-1970s fiscal crisis to the Lindsay years, Lindsay disagreed, insisting that it may have come sooner if he had not imposed new taxes.<ref name="Obit"/>

An alternate assessment was made by journalist Robert McFadden who said that "By 1973, his last year in office, Mr. Lindsay had become a more seasoned, pragmatic mayor."<ref name="Obit" /> McFadden also credited him for reducing racial tensions, leading to the prevention of riots that plagued Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark and other cities.<ref name="Obit" />

==Legacy==
[[Mario Cuomo]], [[Carl McCall]], and [[Carter F. Bales]] were among the many people who started their careers in public service in the Lindsay administration.<ref name=nymag>{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/greatest-new-york/70474/|date=January 9, 2011|magazine=[[New York Magazine]]|title=How Would Dinkins Have Done, Had He Come After Giuliani?}}</ref> [[Rev. Al Sharpton]] has said that he still remembers Lindsay having walked the streets of [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] and [[Harlem]] when these neighborhoods were doing poorly economically.<ref name=nymag />

Lindsay also fought to transform the [[Civilian Complaint Review Board]] from an internal police-run department, into a public-minded agency with a citizen majority board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barkan|first1=Ross|title=Too Tall to be Mayor? The Shadow of John Lindsay Bill de Blasio Can't Acknowledge|url=http://observer.com/2015/01/too-tall-to-be-mayor-a-long-shadow-of-john-lindsay-bill-de-blasio-wont-acknowledge/|access-date=25 November 2016|work=[[New York Observer]]|date=12 January 2015}}</ref> Initially and vociferously opposed by the police union, citizen oversight of police—which sprung from the American [[Civil Rights Movement]]—has since become an established institution in civic life, and Lindsay was a leader for it.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Lindsay returned to the law, but remained in the public eye as a commentator and regular guest host for ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]''. In 1975, Lindsay made a surprise appearance on ''[[The Tony Awards]]'' telecast in which he, along with a troupe of celebrity male suitors in tuxedos, sang "[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]" to [[Angela Lansbury]]. He presented the award for [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play|Best Director Of A Play]] to [[John Dexter]] for the play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]''. Lindsay also tried his hand at acting, appearing in [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Rosebud (1975 film)|Rosebud]]'';<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512245/bio</ref> the following year his novel, ''The Edge'', was published (Lindsay had earlier authored two non-fiction memoirs): the ''[[New York Times]]'', in its contemporary review of the novel, said it was "as dead-serious as a $100-a-plate dinner of gray meat and frozen candidates' smiles."<ref>{{cite news|title=New York Today: The Ex-Mayors|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/category/new-york-today/|access-date=17 October 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=17 October 2013|author=Andy Newman|author2=Sam Roberts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005060334/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/category/new-york-today/|archive-date=October 5, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Attempting a political comeback in 1980, Lindsay made a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, and finished third. He was also active in New York City charities, serving on the board of the Association for a Better New York, and as chairman of the [[Lincoln Center Theater]]. On his death, ''[[New York Times]]'' credited Lindsay with a significant role in the rejuvenation of the theatre.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/john-v-lindsay-mayor-and-maverick-dies-at-79.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=John V. Lindsay, Mayor and Maverick, Dies at 79|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden|date=December 21, 2000|access-date=May 6, 2010}}</ref>

Medical bills from his [[Parkinson's disease]], heart attacks, and [[stroke]] depleted Lindsay's finances, as did the collapse of two law firms where he worked, and he found himself without health insurance. Lindsay's eight years of service as mayor left him seven years short of qualifying for a city pension. In 1996, with support from City Council Speaker [[Peter Vallone]], Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] appointed Lindsay to two largely ceremonial posts to make him eligible for municipal health insurance coverage.<ref>Van Gelder, Lawrence. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E4D61739F930A35756C0A960958260&scp=1&sq=lindsay+giuliani+lawyer&st=nyt Ailing Lindsay Is Given Posts To Get City Health Insurance], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 3, 1996.</ref> He and his wife, Mary, moved to a retirement community in [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head Island]], [[South Carolina]], in November 1999, where he died on December 19, 2000 at the age of 79 of complications from [[pneumonia]] and Parkinson's disease.<ref name="Mcfadden" />

In 2000, Yale Law School created a fellowship program named in Lindsay's honor. In 1998, a park in Brooklyn, Lindsay Triangle, was named in his honor,<ref>[http://forgotten-ny.com/2014/01/lindsay-triangle-williamsburg/#comment-154952 Lindsay Triangle, Williamsburg], ''Forgotten-NY'', January 2, 2014.</ref> and in 2001, the [[East River Park]] was renamed in his memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2001b/pr389-01.html |title=Mayor Giuliani Signs Bill Renaming Manhattan's East River Park John V.
