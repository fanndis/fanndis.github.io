'''Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena ''' (born 18 October 1959) is a Salvadoran politician who was [[President of El Salvador|President]] of [[El Salvador]] from 1 June 2009 to 1 June 2014. He won the [[2009 Salvadoran presidential election|2009 presidential election]] as the candidate of the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) [[political party]] and took office on 1 June 2009. In July 2019, Funes (along with his wife and two sons) became a naturalized citizen of [[Nicaragua]], where he and his immediate family have been residing in exile since 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/americas/fugitive-salvadoran-former-president-given-nicaragua-citizenship|title=Fugitive Salvadoran Former President Given Nicaragua Citizenship|website=Voice of America|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>

==Early life and education ==
Funes was born in [[San Salvador]]. He received his high school diploma (Bachillerato) from the [[Externado San José]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mauriciofunespresidente.com/biografia_mauricio_funes.php?position=militancia |title=Mauricio Funes (Biography) |work=Mauricio Funes: Un cambio seguro |language=es |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319033016/http://mauriciofunespresidente.com/biografia_mauricio_funes.php?position=militancia |archivedate=19 March 2009 }}</ref> and studied at Universidad Centroamericana "José Simeón Cañas"(UCA) but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1525333/Mauricio-Funes |title=Mauricio Funes (president of El Salvador)|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopaedia  }}</ref> Both Externado and UCA are [[Jesuit]] institutions, something that has deeply influenced president Funes. In this respect, Funes has mentioned his relationship to the [[1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador|Jesuits murdered by the Salvadoran military in 1989]] as of particular significance in his professional and personal development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uca.edu.sv/web_martires/nota.php?id=19|title=Mártires jesuitas reciben Orden José Matías Delgado |accessdate=25 April 2011 |language=es}}</ref> In 1994 he was awarded the [[Maria Moors Cabot prize]] from [[Columbia University]] for promoting press freedom and inter-American understanding.<ref>{{Cite news|title=4 awards for Latin American Coverage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/world/4-awards-for-latin-american-coverage.html | work=The New York Times | date=27 October 1994 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> 

Funes' brother was killed during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref name=R1/> His oldest son, Alejandro Funes Velasco, who was 27 years old, died after being attacked in [[Paris]], where he was studying [[photography]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chichicaste.blogcindario.com/2007/10/00682-comunicado-oficial-sobre-la-muerte-de-alejandro-funes-hijo-de-mauricio-funes.html |title=Fallece en París Alejandro Funes, hijo del periodista Mauricio Funes |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=11 March 2009 |work=Chichicaste|language=es}}</ref>

==Career in journalism==
Prior to his involvement with [[politics of El Salvador]], Funes was a [[journalist]] who hosted a popular interview show on television.<ref name=G1/> He made appearances on Channel 12 and [[CNN en Español]],<ref name=W1>{{Cite news|first=William |last=Booth |title=In El Salvador Vote, Big Opportunity for Leftists |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/08/AR2009030801775.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=11 March 2009}}</ref> and also hosted local news programs which were critical of previous governments. He was a reporter during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] and interviewed leftist rebel leaders. It was during this time that he became more sympathetic to leftists in El Salvador, and he considers himself to be center-left.<ref name=R1>[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE52F1CC20090316?sp=true Factbox: Salvadoran President-elect Mauricio Funes]. [[Reuters]] 16 March 2009. Retrieved on 2009-03-16.</ref>

==Political career==
Funes was nominated to be the [[FMLN]] candidate on 28 September 2007 and competed against the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]]'s candidate [[Rodrigo Ávila]], a former deputy director of the National Police. Funes won the [[2009 Salvadoran presidential election|2009 presidential election]] with 51.32% of the popular vote, thus winning election in a single round.  He was the country's second left-leaning president (the first being [[Arturo Araujo]]), as well as the first FMLN party leader not to have fought in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].  His swearing-in on 1 June marked only the third time in the country's history that a governing party peacefully transferred power to the opposition.

His presidential campaign was highlighted by statements endorsing moderate political policies.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7944899.stm Left-winger wins El Salvador poll].

Upon his inauguration on 1 June 2009, Funes resumed Salvadoran [[Foreign relations of El Salvador|diplomatic relations]] with [[Cuba]]. El Salvador previously suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba 50 years ago due to the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.org/Embajadas/eeuu/Prensa2.nsf/67c8b047c4924b4a85256997006cc1ff/573d8acfc91c4a0e852575d70078029e?OpenDocument |title=EL SALVADOR AND CUBA REESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615235246/http://www.elsalvador.org/Embajadas/eeuu/Prensa2.nsf/67c8b047c4924b4a85256997006cc1ff/573d8acfc91c4a0e852575d70078029e?OpenDocument |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}.

In November 2009, President Funes had to face the [[natural disaster]] that greatly affected communities in Cuscatlán, San Salvador and San Vicente as a result of the rain brought by [[Hurricane Ida (2009)|Hurricane Ida]].  A community in San Vicente called [[Verapaz, El Salvador|Verapaz]] disappeared because it was buried by huge rocks that fell from the nearby [[volcano]].  Civil Protection, which is the government entity in charge of handling catastrophes, rehabilitated public schools in which refugees stayed for more than 3 months while they found a place to stay from family or friends. The Army and the [[Red Cross]] of El Salvador rescued many people from the communities.

Funes has been criticized<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_opinion.asp?idCat=6342&idArt=4505386 |title=La batalla presidencial contra la delincuencia |publisher=Elsalvador.com |date= 9 February 2010|author=Ponce, Carlos }}</ref> for lack of a plan to fight El Salvador's increased [[crime in El Salvador]].  In response, the President has ordered the deployment of the army to cooperate with police authorities in their fight against crime.<ref>Ayala, Edgardo (13 November 2009) [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49251 EL SALVADOR: More Troops on the Streets to Fight Crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610220801/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49251 |date=10 June 2011 }}. ipsnews.net</ref>
More recently, there have been reports of newly formed [[Death squad#El Salvador|Death Squads]] operating in El Salvador, due in part to a lack of response of the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/sp/?p=3052 |title=Grupos de exterminio vuelven a El Salvador|publisher=Havanatimes.org |date= 16 February 2010 | author=Ayala, Edgardo }}</ref>

In January 2010, after a public denouncement of Funes' former cabinet member Francisco Gómez, local Salvadoran media uncovered plans whereby almost all government publicity and advertising were to be carried, without any previous public solicitation (as required by Salvadoran Law), by [[advertising agency]] Polistepeque, S.A. de C.V. Some advisers to the president are members of its board of directors, and allegedly Funes himself has some participation through stock in that agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/25133/Mauricio-Funes-le-daria-toda-la-publicidad-del-gobierno-a-empresa-de-amigos |title=Mauricio Funes le daría toda la publicidad del gobierno a empresa de amigos|publisher=Lapagina.com.sv |date= 10 January 2010}}</ref>

The President reacted to these accusations by stating that no other [[advertising agency]] in El Salvador has the experience or capacity to manage government publicity and advertising, despite the fact that El Salvador has many local and international advertising agencies such as [[BBDO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/25355/Funes-defiende-asignacion-publicitaria-a-Polistepeque |title=Funes defiende asignación publicitaria a Polistepeque|publisher=Lapagina.com.sv |date= 12 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/25471/Publicistas-en-El-Salvador-piden-a-Funes-cancelar-contrato-con-empresa-de-su-amigo-personal |title=Publicistas en El Salvador piden a Funes cancelar contrato con empresa de su amigo personal |publisher=Lapagina.com.sv |date= 14 January 2010}}</ref>
