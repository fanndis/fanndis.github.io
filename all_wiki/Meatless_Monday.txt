'''Meatless Monday''' is an international campaign that encourages people to not eat meat on [[Monday]]s to improve their [[Health effects of meat consumption|health]] and the [[Environmental effects of meat production|health of the planet]].

Meatless Monday is a non-profit initiative of The Monday Campaigns Inc. in association with the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] [[Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future|Center for a Livable Future]]. Meatless Monday was founded in 2003 by marketing professional Sid Lerner. The program follows the nutrition guidelines developed by the USDA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/ |title=United States Department of Agriculture - Home |publisher=MyPyramid.gov |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726014831/http://www.mypyramid.gov/ |archive-date=July 26, 2007 }}</ref> Meatless Monday is part of the Healthy Monday initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthymonday.org/ |title=Healthy Monday |publisher=Healthy Monday |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Healthy Monday encourages Americans to make healthier decisions at the start of every week. Other Healthy Monday campaigns include: The Kids Cook Monday, Monday 2000, Quit and Stay Quit Monday, Move it Monday, The Monday Mile, and others.

Meatless Monday focuses its initiative on Mondays for several reasons.  Friday is traditionally already a meat-free day among Catholics and Orthodox.  Monday is typically the beginning of the work week, the day when individuals settle back into their weekly routine. Habits that prevailed over the weekend can be forgotten and replaced by other choices.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mondaycampaigns.org/about/research/ |title= The Science behind The Monday Campaigns |website= The Monday Campaigns |quote= Health promotions at the beginning of the week have the potential to reduce negative health events. There’s a spike in heart problems, occupational injuries, strokes, suicides and referrals to secondary care on Monday, which researchers believe is caused by stress, unhealthy weekend behaviors and disruption of sleep cycles.}}</ref> A weekly reminder to restart healthy habits also encourages success. A 2009 trial published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine provided individuals with weekly health prompts and encouragement. Approximately two thirds of participants responded with improvements in their overall health, eating habits and physical activity levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/05/19/BA4917MKAP.DTL&type=health |title=Trial: E-nagging can increase healthy activity |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 | first=Victoria | last=Colliver}}</ref>

== History ==
During [[World War I]], US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a proclamation calling for every Tuesday to be meatless and for one meatless meal to be observed every day, for a total of nine meatless meals each week.<ref>{{cite news |last= Wilson |first= Woodrow |author-link= Woodrow Wilson |date= January 18, 1918 |title= President's Proclamation Calling Upon People of Nation to Reduce Consumption of Wheat and Meat Products in Order to Feed America's Associates in the War |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LW49AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PR10 |editor-last= Rochester |editor-first= Edward S. |newspaper= Official Bulletin |volume= 2 |issue= 219 |location= [[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher= United States [[Committee on Public Information]] |publication-date= January 28, 1918 |page= 3 |quote= In both homes and public eating places, in order to reduce the consumption of beef, pork, and sheep products, Tuesday should be observed as meatless day in each week, one meatless meal should be observed in each day, while, in addition, Saturday in each week should further be observed as a day upon which there should be no consumption of pork products.}}</ref> The [[United States Food Administration]] (USFA) urged families to reduce consumption of key staples to help the war effort and avoid rationing. Conserving food would support U.S. troops as well as feed populations in Europe where food production and distribution had been disrupted by the war. To encourage voluntary rationing, the USFA created the slogan “Food Will Win the War” and coined the terms "Meatless Tuesday" and "Wheatless Wednesday” to remind Americans to reduce intake of those products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/hooveronline/hoover_bio/archive/food/wheat.htm |title=Wheatless Wednesdays |publisher=Hoover Museum - Digital Archives |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911213710/http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/hooveronline/hoover_bio/archive/food/wheat.htm |archive-date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref>

[[Herbert Hoover]] was the head of the Food Administration as well as the American Relief Association during Woodrow Wilson's presidency, and played a key role implementing the campaign, which was one of Hoover's many attempts to encourage volunteerism and sacrifice among Americans during the war. The USFA provided a wide variety of materials in addition to advertising, including recipe books and menus found in magazines, newspapers and government-sponsored pamphlets.<ref>http://exhibits.mannlib.cornell.edu/meatlesswheatless/images/large/Foods%20That%20Will%20Win%20115.jpg</ref>

The campaign returned with the onset of [[World War II]], calling upon women on the home front to play a role in supporting the war effort. During this time, meat was being rationed, along with other commodities like sugar and gasoline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1674.html |title=World War II Rationing |publisher=U-s-history.com |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> The Truman administration, through the Citizens Food Committee, encouraged "Meatless Tuesdays" and "Poultryless Thursdays" throughout the autumn of 1947; backlash was swift, noncompliance was rampant, and the poultry lobby responded with the [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]], the forerunner of the modern "turkey pardon."<ref>{{cite web|last=Humes |first=Michele |url=https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/the-way-we-ate-the-year-harry-truman-passed-on-pumpkin-pie/ |title=The Way We Ate: The Year Harry Truman Passed on Pumpkin Pie |work=Dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com |date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2019}}</ref>

Meatless Monday was restarted in 2003 as a public health awareness program. The campaign was endorsed by the Center for a Livable Future (a division of the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]) as well as over twenty public health schools. In April 2009, Meatless Monday launched an informational video noting the [[effects of meat consumption on climate change]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Meatless Monday is based in the United States, but meatless days (Monday in particular) are gaining popularity worldwide.

Several other countries have meat-free days as well, including [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/plant-based-plates/|title=Plant-Based Plates}}</ref>

In March 2012, the [[Government of Croatia]] also supported the initiative, excluding meat from the menu of the [[Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection]] on Mondays.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

In 2017, the [[Casa Rosada]] of Argentina instituted, for one lunch of the day, meat-free Mondays, serving only vegan options to its approximately 500 employees, including Argentinian President [[Mauricio Macri]].<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|author=A.L.|title=Argentina's vegan Mondays|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/10/economist-explains-13|work=[[The Economist]]|date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

Meatless Mondays is related to efforts to add daily vegetarian and [[Vegan school meal|vegan school meals]].
