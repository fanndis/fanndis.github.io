[[File:US tax rates 2018.jpg|thumb|340px|US Federal marginal income tax rates: comparison of 2018, 2017, 2016 rates for individual and married filers]]

Under the law, there are numerous changes to the individual income tax, including changing the income level of individual [[tax bracket]]s, lowering [[tax rate]]s, and increasing the [[standard deduction]]s and family [[tax credit]]s while [[itemized deduction]]s are reduced and the [[personal exemption]]s are eliminated.

Most individual income taxes are reduced, until 2025. The number of income tax brackets remain at seven, but the income ranges in several brackets have been changed and each new bracket has lower rates. These are marginal rates that apply to income in the indicated range as under current law (i.e., prior Public Law 115-97 or the Act), so a higher income taxpayer will have income taxed at several different rates.<ref name="CNBC_Brackets">{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/find-your-new-tax-brackets-under-the-final-gop-tax-plan.html | publisher=CNBC | first=Darla | last=Mercado | title=Find your new tax brackets under the final GOP tax plan | date=December 15, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Pages/Tax-Analysis-and-Research.aspx|title=Office of Tax Analysis|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> A different inflation measure ([[United States Chained Consumer Price Index|Chained CPI]] or C-CPI) will be applied to the brackets instead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), so the brackets increase more slowly. This is effectively a tax increase over time, as people move more quickly into higher brackets as their income rises; this element is permanent.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-16-55.pdf|title=2017 IRS Tax}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1eas.pdf|title=H.R.1 — 115th Congress (2017-2018)}}</ref>

The standard deduction nearly doubles, from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. For single filers, the standard deduction will increase from $6,350 to $12,000. About 70% of families choose the standard deduction rather than itemized deductions; this could rise to over 84% if doubled. The personal exemption is eliminated—this was a deduction of $4,050 per taxpayer and dependent, unless it is in an estate or trust.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1eas.pdf|title=H.R.1 — 115th Congress (2017-2018) - Sec. 11041, subsection (b)}}</ref>

The child tax credit is doubled from $1,000 to $2,000, $1,400 of which will be refundable. There is also a $500 credit for other dependents, versus zero under current law. The lower threshold for the high-income phaseout for the Child Tax Credit changes from $110,000 AGI to $400,000 for married filers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/tax-reform/new-child-tax-credit/|title=New Child Tax Credit: Changes for 2018}}</ref>

Mortgage interest deduction for newly purchased homes (and second homes) was lowered from total loan balances of $1{{nbsp}}million under current law to $750,000. Interest from home equity loans (aka second mortgages) is no longer deductible, unless the money is used for home improvements.

The deduction for state and local income tax, sales tax, and property taxes ("SALT deduction") will be capped at $10,000. This has more impact on taxpayers with more expensive property, generally those who live in higher-income areas, or people in states with higher rates for state tax.<ref>Reilly, Peter J.

The act zeroed out the federal tax penalty for violating the individual mandate of the [[Affordable Care Act]], starting in 2019.

No changes are made to major education deductions and credits, or to the teacher deduction for unreimbursed classroom expenses, which remains at $250. The bill initially expanded usage of [[529 plan|529 college savings accounts]] for both K–12 private school tuition and homeschools, but the provision regarding homeschools was overruled by the Senate parliamentarian and removed. The 529 savings accounts for K-12 private school tuition provision was left intact.<ref>Egger, Andrew (December 19, 2017).

Alimony paid to a former spouse will no longer be deductible by the payer, and alimony payments will no longer be included in the recipient's gross income.

The corporate tax rate was changed from a tiered tax rate ranging from 15% to as high as 39% depending on taxable income<ref>{{cite web |title=IRS 2017 Instructions for Form 1120 |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1120--2017.pdf}}</ref> to a flat 21%, while some related business deductions and credits were reduced or eliminated. The Act also changed the U.S. from a global to a territorial tax system with respect to corporate income tax. Instead of a corporation paying the U.S. tax rate for income earned in any country (less a credit for taxes paid to that country), each [[subsidiary]] pays the tax rate of the country in which it is legally established. In other words, under a territorial tax system, the corporation saves the difference between the generally higher U.S. tax rate and the lower rate of the country in which the subsidiary is legally established. ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'' journalist Matt Levine explained the concept, "If we're incorporated in the U.S. [under the old global tax regime], we'll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we're incorporated in Canada [under a territorial tax regime, proposed by the Act], we'll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands."<ref name="Levine20142">Levine, Matt (August 25, 2014).

The [[Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax]] was eliminated.<ref name= Korving/>

The law also eliminated the [[Net operating loss#Loss carry back and carry forward mechanisms|net operating loss carryback]], an procedure by which a company with significant losses could receive a [[tax refund]] by counting the losses as part of the previous year's tax return.  They were considered important in providing liquidity during a recession.

=== Churches and nonprofit organizations ===

==== Employee compensation ====
There is a 25% [[Excise|excise tax]] on compensation paid to certain employees of churches and other tax-exempt organizations.<ref name= cla-excise>Davis, Kelly (April 19, 2019). "[https://www.claconnect.com/resources/articles/2019/irs-guidance-clarifies-new-excise-tax-on-nonprofit-executive-compensation?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7Tnka2BhqIPMMdALKqWCPySRzmIo8hVZpUNQc-GGPvTfkCg0FewMB3oqzNvtL-HSn1Mu-eHNZSBGBbpQRU1vNnVbSjA&_hsmi=72269875 IRS Guidance Clarifies New Excise Tax on Nonprofit Executive Compensation]". ''[[CliftonLarsonAllen LLP]]''.</ref> The excise tax applies to any organization that is tax-exempt under [[501(c) organization|501(c)]] or [[501(d) organization|501(d)]], a Section 521(b)(1) [[Agricultural cooperative|farmer's cooperative]], [[527 organization|Section 527 political organization]]s, and organizations that have Section 115(1) income that is earned by performing essential government functions.<ref name= n-10-09>"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-19-09.pdf Notice 2019-09]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. December 31, 2018.</ref>

The excise tax applies to compensation paid to certain employees in excess of $1,000,000 during the year. The employees covered under this rule are the organization's five highest-compensated employees and any employees who previous had this status after 2016.<ref name= n-10-09/> Compensation is exempt from the excise tax if the compensation is paid to medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians, nurse practitioners, and other licensed professionals providing medical or veterinary services.

==== University investment tax ====
There is a 1.4% [[Excise|excise tax]] on investment income of certain private tax-exempt colleges and universities. The excise tax applies only if the institution has at least 500 tuition-paying students and more than half the students are located in the United States. The excise tax applies if the institution and its related organizations have an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] with an aggregate [[fair-market value]] at the end of the preceding tax year of at least $500,000 per full-time student, excluding assets used directly in carrying out institution's tax-exempt purpose.<ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-55.pdf Notice 2018-55: Guidance on the Calculation of Net Investment Income for Purposes of the Section 4968 Excise Tax Applicable to Certain Private Colleges and Universities]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. 2018.</ref><ref name= grfcpa>"Update on Tax Reform and the Impact on Tax-Exempt Organizations". ''Gelman, Rosenberg & Freedman CPAs''. July 10, 2018.</ref>

This provision has been referred to as an [[endowment tax]], and it has been estimated that it applies to around 32 universities.

Some provisions from the earlier House bill were dropped that would have taxed graduate student tuition waivers, tuition benefits for children and spouses of employees, and student loan interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/18/large-endowments-would-be-taxed-under-final-gop-tax-plan|title=Large endowments would be taxed under final GOP tax plan|last=Kreighbaum|first=Andrew|date=December 18, 2017 |work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=December 19, 2017 }}</ref> A [[Senate Parliamentarian]] ruling on December 19 changed the exemption threshold from 500 tuition-paying students to 500 total students.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/house-vote-on-trump-republican-tax-reform-bill-senate-byrd-rule-2017-12|title=The House will be forced to revote on the massive tax bill because of provisions that break Senate rules|last=Bryan|first=Bob|date= December 19, 2017 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date= December 19, 2017 }}</ref> Endowment funds used to carry out a college's tax-exempt purpose are excluded from the asset threshold, but Internal Revenue Service has not issued regulations specifically defining this term.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/22/harvard-tax-college-endowments-252892|title=The new tax on Harvard|last1=Stratford|first1=Michael|date= December 22, 2017 |work=Politico|access-date=December 25, 2017 |last2=Wermund|first2=Benjamin}}</ref>

In addition, a tax deduction is now disallowed entirely for charitable contributions if the donor receives rights to receive seats to college athletic events.<ref name= grfcpa/> Formerly, 80% of the charitable contribution was considered to be a tax-deductible charitable contribution.<ref name =grfcpa/>

==== Parking and public transportation provided to employees ====
Unrelated business income is now increased by the amount a church or other tax-exempt organization pays or incurs for [[Internal Revenue Code section 132(a)#Qualified Transportation Fringe|qualifying parking or qualifying transportation benefits]] for its employees. This type of unrelated business income includes only tax-free transportation benefits provided to employees, not transportation benefits that are included in the employee's taxable wages.<ref name=n-18-99>"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-99.pdf Notice 2018-99]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. December 10, 2018.</ref>

Unrelated business income does not result if the employer provides free parking for employees, the majority of the parking spaces are available to the general public during the organization's normal business hours, and none of the parking spots reserved for its employees.<ref name=n-18-99/> If some parking spots are reserved for employees, then unrelated business income results from a portion of the total parking expenses, based on the percentage of parking spots that are reserved for its employees.<ref name=n-18-99/>

The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that the employer should use a reasonable method to determine the value of parking benefits provided to its employees.<ref name=n-18-99/> The value of the parking spaces should include repairs, maintenance, utility costs, insurance, property taxes, interest, snow and ice removal, leaf removal, trash removal, cleaning, landscape costs, parking attendant expenses, security, and rent or lease payments, but not depreciation expense.<ref name=n-18-99/>

A church or other tax-exempt organization would need to file Form 990-T and pay unrelated business income tax if its total unrelated business income exceeds $1,000 during the fiscal year.<ref name=n-18-99/><ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-guidance-for-determining-nondeductible-amount-of-parking-fringe-expenses-and-unrelated-business-taxable-income-provides-penalty-relief-to-tax-exempt-organizations IRS issues guidance for determining nondeductible amount of parking fringe expenses and unrelated business taxable income; provides penalty relief to tax-exempt organizations]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. December 10, 2018.</ref> Netting the unrelated business income from transportation with other unrelated business income in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of tax due is allowed.<ref name=n-18-99/>

Some states and jurisdictions require all employers to provide these benefits to their employees, which may result in an organization being required to choose between paying unrelated business income tax to the federal government or being in noncompliance with state and local laws.<ref name= grfcpa/>

==== Unrelated business income ====
Unrelated business income is now separately computed for each trade or business activity of the church or other tax-exempt organization. Losses on one trade or business can no longer be used to offset gains on another trade or business for unrelated business income purposes. [[Net operating loss]]es generated before January 1, 2018, and carried forward to other tax years are not affected and can be used to offset gains from any trade or business activity. Some affected organizations are considering incorporating for-profit subsidiaries and then moving all unrelated business income to the for-profit subsidiaries, which might make all the unrelated business income count as the same category of trade or business activity, namely "income from for-profit subsidiaries".<ref>"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.513-1 26 CFR 1.513-1 - Definition of unrelated trade or business]".

==== Charitable contributions ====
More individuals will choose to take the standard deduction rather than itemize their tax deductions because of the increase in standard deduction and limitation on itemized deduction for state and local taxes. As a result, these individuals will not see a tax savings from donations to churches or other eligible nonprofit organizations, and churches and other organizations may receive fewer charitable contributions.<ref name= grfcpa/><ref>Burgess, Patti Brandt (July 15, 2018).

The [[Estate tax in the United States|indexed estate tax exemption]] was doubled, which means that people may not need to include charitable contributions being written into their will in order to reduce the estate tax paid, which is expected to reduce the amount of charitable contributions given to churches and nonprofit organizations overall.<ref name= grfcpa/>

==== Tax credit for paid family and medical leave ====
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allows a tax credit for employers that provide paid family and medical leave to employees. A 501(c)(3) organization is not eligible for the tax credit.<ref name= notice2018-71>"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-71.pdf Notice 2018-71]". ''Internal Revenue Service''.

===Miscellaneous tax provisions===
{{Update|section|date=December 2017}}

The Act contains a variety of miscellaneous tax provisions, many advantaging particular special interests.<ref name="PetullaHansler">Sam Petulla & Jennifer Hansler, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/senate-tax-bill-amendments-special-interests-industry-groups/index.html Sparkling wine, jets, the unborn and other special-interest wins in the tax bill], CNN (November 16, 2017).</ref> Miscellaneous provisions include:

* The extension of "full expensing," a favorable tax treatment provision for film and television production companies, to 2022. The provision allows such companies "to write-off the full cost of their investments in the first year."

* A provision ending a corporate tax exemption for certain international airlines with commercial flights to the United States (specifically, in cases where "the country where the foreign airline is headquartered doesn't have a tax treaty with the U.S., and if major U.S. airliners make fewer than two weekly trips to that foreign country"). This provision is seen as likely to disadvantage Gulf airlines (such as [[Etihad Airways|Etihad]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] and [[Qatar Airways]]); major U.S. airlines have complained that the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf state]]s provide unfair subsidies to those carriers.<ref name="Vinik"/>

== Impact ==
===Financial impact===
The tax cuts are expected to increase deficits thereby stimulating the economy, increasing GDP and employment, relative to a forecast without those tax cuts. CBO reported on December 21, 2017: "Overall, the combined effect of the change in net federal revenue and spending is to decrease deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in spending) allocated to lower-income tax filing units and to increase deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in taxes) allocated to higher-income tax filing units".<ref name="CBO_DistFinal">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53429|title=Distributional Effects of Changes in Taxes and Spending Under the Conference Agreement for H.R. 1 - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> The nonpartisan [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] also estimated that the [[GDP]] level would be 0.7% higher (in aggregate, not per annum) during the 2018–2027 period relative to the CBO baseline forecast, employment level would be 0.6% higher and personal consumption level would be 0.6% higher during the 2018–2027 period on average due to the Act.<ref name="JCT_Econ1"/> These are higher levels, not higher annual growth rates, so these are relatively minor economic impacts over 10 years.<ref name="TPC_Levels">{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/comparing-estimates-macroeconomic-effects-tax-policy-growth-rates-vs-levels|title=Comparing Estimates of the Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Policy: Growth Rates vs. Levels|date=December 14, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

The distribution of impact by individual income group varies significantly based on the assumptions involved and point in time measured. In general, businesses and upper income groups will benefit, while lower income groups will see the initial benefits fade over time or be adversely impacted. For example, the CBO and JCT estimated that:

* During 2019, income groups earning under $20,000 (about 23% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction (i.e. incur a cost), mainly by receiving fewer subsidies due to the repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Other groups would contribute to deficit increases (i.e. receive a benefit), mainly due to tax cuts.
* During 2021, 2023 and 2025, income groups earning under $40,000 (about 43% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction, while income groups above $40,000 would contribute to deficit increases.
* During 2027, income groups earning under $75,000 (about 76% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction while income groups above $75,000 would contribute to deficit increases.<ref name="CBO_DistFinal"/><ref name="JCT_DistNum">{{cite web|url=https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5040|title=JCX-58-17|website=www.jct.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

The [[Tax Policy Center]] (TPC) estimated that the bottom 80% of taxpayers (income under $149,400) would receive 35% of the benefit in 2018, 34% in 2025 and none of the benefit in 2027, with some groups incurring costs.<ref name="TPC_CC1"/> TPC also estimated 72% of taxpayers would be adversely impacted in 2019 and beyond, if the tax cuts are paid for by spending cuts separate from the legislation, as most spending cuts would impact lower- to middle-income taxpayers and outweigh the benefits from the tax cuts.<ref name="Vox_PaidFor"/>

In 2018, companies spent a record-setting $1.1 trillion to buy back their own stock, and a majority of major firms (84%, as polled by the National Association for Business Economics) did not alter their hiring practice or their investment in their business in response to the tax cuts they received.

[[File:U.S. Federal Revenue Collection Forecasts 2018-2025.png|thumb|450px|right|Comparison of U.S. federal revenues for two CBO forecasts, one from January 2017 (based on laws at the end of the Obama Administration) and the other from April 2018, which reflects Trump's policy changes. Key insights include: 1) Tax cuts reduce revenue collections relative to a baseline without them; 2) Tax revenues rise each year under both forecasts as the economy grows; and 3) The gap is larger initially, indicating larger stimulus effects in the earlier years.<ref name="CBO_BEO17"/><ref name="CBO_April2018Update"/>]]

The non-partisan [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] of the U.S. Congress published its macroeconomic analysis of the final version of the Act, on December 22, 2017:
*Gross domestic product would be 0.7% higher on average each year during the 2018–2027 period relative to the CBO baseline forecast, a cumulative total of $1,895{{nbsp}}billion, due to an increase in labor supply and business investment.
*The Act would increase the total budget deficits (debt) by about $1{{nbsp}}trillion over ten years including macro-economic feedback effects. The effect of the tax cuts is only partially offset by incremental revenue due to the higher GDP levels. The initial deficit increase estimate without feedback effects of $1,456{{nbsp}}billion, less $384{{nbsp}}billion in feedback effects ($451{{nbsp}}billion less $66{{nbsp}}billion in higher debt service costs), results in a $1,071{{nbsp}}billion net debt increase over the 2018–2027 period. This increase is in addition to the $10{{nbsp}}trillion debt increase already in the CBO current law baseline projected over the 2018–2027 period, and the approximately $20{{nbsp}}trillion [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] that already exists.
*Employment would be about 0.6% higher each year during the 2018–2027 period than otherwise. The lower marginal tax rate on labor would provide "strong incentives for an increase in labor supply."
*Personal consumption, the largest component of GDP, would increase by 0.7%.<ref name="JCT_Econ1">{{cite web|url=https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5055|title=JCX-69-17|website=www.jct.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>
*Note that for GDP, employment, and consumption, these are higher levels, not higher annual growth rates, so these are relatively minor economic impacts over ten years.<ref name="TPC_Levels"/> The [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]] (CRFB) summarized several studies that indicated a boost to annual GDP growth rates would be about 0.01% each year rather than the Administration's claims of 0.4% per year. In other words, a 2.0% annual GDP growth rate typical during the Obama era would rise to 2.01%-2.02% and not 2.4% as claimed, other things equal. The CRFB estimated that the JCT analysis implied a 0.02% annual growth rate increase, to arrive at a cumulative 0.7% GDP increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crfb.org/blogs/official-analysis-finds-tax-bill-will-produce-marginal-growth-cost-11-trillion|title=Official Analysis Finds Tax Bill Will Produce Marginal Growth, Cost $1.1 Trillion|date=January 3, 2018|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

The [[Tax Policy Center]] (TPC) reported its macroeconomic analysis of the November 16 Senate version of the Act on December 1, 2017:
*Gross domestic product would be 0.4% higher on average each year during the 2018-2027 period relative to the CBO baseline forecast, a cumulative total of $961{{nbsp}}billion higher over ten years. TPC explained that since most tax reductions would benefit high-income households (who spend a smaller share of tax reductions than lower-income households) the effect on GDP would be modest. Further, TPC reported that: "Because the economy is currently near full employment, the impact of increased demand on output would be smaller and diminish more quickly than it would if the economy were in recession."
*The Act would increase the total budget deficits (debt) by $1,412{{nbsp}}billion, less $179{{nbsp}}billion in feedback effects, for a $1,233{{nbsp}}billion net debt increase (excluding higher interest costs).
*The lower marginal tax rates would increase labor supply, mainly by encouraging lower-earning spouses to work more. This effect would reverse after 2025 due to expiration of individual tax provisions.<ref name=TPC_Senate_Macro>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/macroeconomic-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-passed-senate-finance-committee|title=Macroeconomic Analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as Passed by the Senate Finance Committee|date=December 1, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

The Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) estimated relative to a prior law baseline that by 2027:

=== Budget deficits and debt ===
[[File:CBO - 2017 Tax Act Table.png|thumb|right|450px|CBO forecasts that the 2017 Tax Act will increase the budget deficit by $2.289 trillion over the 2018-2027 decade, or $1.891 trillion after macro-economic feedback.<ref name="CBO_April2018Update"/>]]

====Fiscal year 2018 results====
CBO reported that the budget deficit was $779{{nbsp}}billion in fiscal year 2018, up $113{{nbsp}}billion or 17% from 2017. The budget deficit increased from 3.5% GDP in 2017 to 3.9% GDP in 2018. Revenues fell by 0.8% GDP due in part to the Tax Act, while spending rose by 0.4% GDP. Total tax revenues in dollar terms were similar to 2017, but fell from 17.2% GDP to 16.4% GDP (0.8% GDP), below the 50-year average of 17.4%. Individual income tax receipts rose by $96{{nbsp}}billion as the economy grew, rising from 8.2% GDP in 2017 to 8.3% GDP in 2018. Corporate tax revenues fell by $92{{nbsp}}billion (31%) due primarily to the Tax Act, from 1.5% GDP in 2017 to 1.0% GDP in 2018, half the 50-year average of 2.0% GDP. Fiscal year 2018 ran from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018, so the deficit figures did not reflect a full year of tax cut impact, as they took effect in January 2018.<ref name="CBO_FY2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2018-11/54647-MBR.pdf|title=Monthly Budget Review:Summary for Fiscal Year 2018|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]}}</ref>

CBO forecast in January 2017 (just prior to Trump's inauguration) that revenues in fiscal year 2018 would be $3.60 trillion if laws in place as of January 2017 continued.<ref name=CBO>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#3|title=Budget and Economic Data - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov}}</ref> However, actual 2018 tax revenues were $3.33 trillion, a shortfall of $270{{nbsp}}billion (7.5%) relative to the forecast.<ref name="CBO_FY2018"/> The CBO claimed that because of offsetting changes in different sources of revenue caused by the Act, the level of revenue for the fiscal year 2018 remained similar rather than declining,<ref name="CBO_FY2018"/> despite the fact that the CBO had also amended its forecasts to state that there would be $3.53 trillion in June 2017 (making the approximate shortfall $216{{nbsp}}billion) and annual tax revenues experienced a similar shortfall the previous year, when the CBO predicted $3.51 trillion in revenues,<ref name=CBO/> and a shortfall of $196{{nbsp}}billion occurred.<ref name="CBO_FY2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53286-mbr.pdf|title=Monthly Budget Review: Summary for Fiscal Year 2017|publisher=Congressional Budget Office}}</ref> However, the CBO similarly revised its predictions for 2017 revenues in August 2016, making the shortfall $106{{nbsp}}billion for 2017.<ref name=CBO/>

====Ten-year forecasts====
The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated in April 2018 that implementing the Act would add an estimated $2.289{{nbsp}}[[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] to the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] over ten years,<ref name="CBO_April2018Update"/> or about $1.891{{nbsp}}trillion after taking into account macroeconomic feedback effects, in addition to the $9.8{{nbsp}}trillion increase forecast under the current policy [[Baseline (budgeting)|baseline]] and existing $20{{nbsp}}trillion national debt.<ref name="CBO_BEO17"/>

CBO reported on December 21, 2017, that: "Overall, the combined effect of the change in net federal revenue and spending is to decrease deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in spending) allocated to lower-income tax filing units and to increase deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in taxes) allocated to higher-income tax filing units."<ref name="CBO_DistFinal"/>

The [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] estimated the Act would add $1,456{{nbsp}}billion total to the annual deficits (debt) over ten years and described the deficit effects of particular elements of the Act on December 18, 2017:

Individual and Pass-Through (total: $1,127{{nbsp}}billion deficit increase)
*Add to the deficit: Reducing/consolidating individual tax rates $1,214{{nbsp}}billion; doubling the standard deduction $720{{nbsp}}billion; modifying the Alternative Minimum Tax $637{{nbsp}}billion; reduce taxes for pass through business income $415{{nbsp}}billion; modification of child care tax credit $573{{nbsp}}billion.
*Reduce the deficit: Repealing personal exemptions $1,212{{nbsp}}billion, repeal of itemized deductions $668{{nbsp}}billion; reduce ACA subsidy payments $314{{nbsp}}billion; alternative (slower) inflation measure for brackets $134{{nbsp}}billion.
*The pass through changes represent a net $265{{nbsp}}billion deficit increase, so the remaining individual elements are a net $862{{nbsp}}billion increase.
Business/Corporate and International (total: $330{{nbsp}}billion deficit increase)
*Add to the deficit: Reduce corporate tax rate to 21% $1,349{{nbsp}}billion; deductions for certain international dividends received $224{{nbsp}}billion; repeal corporate AMT $40{{nbsp}}billion.
*Reduce the deficit: Enact one-time tax on overseas earnings $338{{nbsp}}billion; and reduce limit on interest expense deductions $253{{nbsp}}billion.<ref name=JCT_BudgetConf>{{cite web|url=https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=5053|title=JCX-67-17|website=www.jct.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

====By income level====
On December 21, 2017, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) released its distribution estimate of the Act:
*During 2019, income groups earning under $20,000 (about 23% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction (i.e., incur a cost), mainly by receiving fewer subsidies due to the repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Other groups would contribute to deficit increases (i.e., receive a benefit), mainly due to tax cuts.
*During 2021, 2023, and 2025, income groups earning under $40,000 (about 43% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction, while income groups above $40,000 would contribute to deficit increases.
*During 2027, income groups earning under $75,000 (about 76% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction, while income groups above $75,000 would contribute to deficit increases.<ref name="CBO_DistFinal"/><ref name="JCT_DistNum"/>
CBO stated that lower income groups will incur costs, while higher income groups will receive benefits: "Overall, the combined effect of the change in net federal revenue and spending is to decrease deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in spending) allocated to lower-income tax filing units and to increase deficits (primarily stemming from reductions in taxes) allocated to higher-income tax filing units."<ref name="CBO_DistFinal"/>

The [[Tax Policy Center]] (TPC) reported its distributional estimates for the Act. This analysis excludes the impact from repealing the ACA individual mandate, which would apply significant costs primarily to income groups below $40,000. It also assumes the Act is deficit financed and thus excludes the impact of any spending cuts used to finance the Act, which also would fall disproportionally on lower income families as a percentage of their income.<ref name="TPC_CC1">{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act|title=Distributional Analysis of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|date=December 18, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>
*Compared to current law, 5% of taxpayers would pay more in 2018, 9% in 2025, and 53% in 2027.
*The top 1% of taxpayers (income over $732,800) would receive 8% of the benefit in 2018, 25% in 2025, and 83% in 2027.
*The top 5% (income over $307,900) would receive 43% of the benefit in 2018, 47% in 2025, and 99% in 2027.
*The top 20% (income over $149,400) would receive 65% of the benefit in 2018, 66% in 2025 and all of the benefit in 2027.
*The bottom 80% (income under $149,400) would receive 35% of the benefit in 2018, 34% in 2025 and none of the benefit in 2027, with some groups incurring costs.
*The third quintile (taxpayers in the 40th to 60th percentile with income between $48,600 and $86,100, a proxy for the "middle class") would receive 11% of the benefit in 2018 and 2025, but would incur a net cost in 2027.

The TPC also estimated the amount of the tax cut each group would receive, measured in 2017 dollars:
*Taxpayers in the second quintile (incomes between $25,000 and $48,600, the 20th to 40th percentile) would receive a tax cut averaging $380 in 2018 and $390 in 2025, but a tax increase averaging $40 in 2027.
*Taxpayers in the third quintile (incomes between $48,600 and $86,100, the 40th to 60th percentile) would receive a tax cut averaging $930 in 2018, $910 in 2025, but a tax increase of $20 in 2027.
*Taxpayers in the fourth quintile (incomes between $86,100 and $149,400, the 60th to 80th percentile) would receive a tax cut averaging $1,810 in 2018, $1,680 in 2025, and $30 in 2027.
*Taxpayers in the top 1% (income over $732,800) would receive a tax cut of $51,140 in 2018, $61,090 in 2025, and $20,660 in 2027.<ref name="TPC_CC1"/>

In December 2019, CBO forecast that inequality would worsen between 2016 and 2021, due in part to the Trump tax cuts and policies regarding means-tested transfers. Their report had several conclusions:
*After taxes and transfers, the income of the top 1% would grow more than other income groups, continuing previous trends.
*Income of households in the bottom 99% percent would be higher than at any time in the past, adjusted for inflation, also continuing previous trends.
*For the top 1%, average federal tax rates would fall from 33% in 2016 to 30% (3 percentage points) in 2021. For the 81st to 99th percentiles, the rate would fall from 24% to 22%, and for the middle three quintiles, the rate would fall from 15% to 14%. These trends indicate worsening inequality, with larger tax reductions for higher incomes.
* The gini index would rise, indicating increasing inequality, reversing a trend from the latter part of the Obama administration.
* Means-tested transfer programs would contribute less to reducing inequality in 2021 than they did in 2016.<ref name="CBO_IE_Fcst">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55941 |title=Projected Changes in the Distribution of Household Income, 2016 to 2021|publisher=CBO|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>

==== Individual vs. business ====
According to the CBO, under the Senate version of the bill, businesses receive a $890{{nbsp}}billion benefit or 63%, individuals $441{{nbsp}}billion or 31%, and estates $83{{nbsp}}billion or 6%.<ref name="CBO_Senate1"/> U.S. corporations would likely use the extra after-tax income to [[Share repurchase|repurchase shares]] or pay more dividends, which mainly flow to wealthy investors. According to the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP), "Mainstream estimates conclude that more than one-third of the benefit of corporate rate cuts flows to the top 1% of Americans, and 70% flows to the top fifth.

In 2017, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) compared the U.S. corporate tax rates (statutory and effective rates) as of 2012 across the G20 countries:
*The U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate of 35% (combined with state elements that add another 4% for a total of 39%), was the highest in the G20 countries. It was 10 percentage points higher than the average. While the U.S. made no changes in federal corporate tax rates between 2003 and 2012, nine of G20 countries reduced their rates.
*The U.S. average corporate tax rate of 29.0% (taxes actually paid as a share of income, after deductions and exemptions) was the third highest in the G20.
*The effective corporate tax rate of 18.6% (a measure of the percentage of income from a marginal investment) was the fourth highest in the G20.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52419|title=International Comparisons of Corporate Income Tax Rates - Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

''Bloomberg News'' reported in January 2020 that the top six American banks saved more than $32 billion in taxes during the two years after enactment of the tax cut, while they reduced lending, cut jobs and increased distributions to shareholders.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-16/trump-tax-cut-hands-32-billion-windfall-to-america-s-top-banks</ref>

==== By state ====
An [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] analysis indicated the Act has more of a tax increase impact on "upper-middle-class families in major metropolitan areas, particularly in Democratic-leaning states where taxes, and usually property values, are higher. While only about one-in-five families between the 80th and 95th income percentiles in most red states would face higher taxes by 2027 under the House GOP bill, that number rises to about one-third in Colorado and Illinois, around two-fifths or more in Oregon, Virginia, Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, and half or more in New Jersey, California and Maryland..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/14/politics/gop-tax-plans-could-fuel-the-suburban-revolt-against-trump/index.html|title=GOP tax plans could fuel the suburban revolt against Trump|first=Ronald |last=Brownstein|publisher=CNN|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

==== If the tax cuts are paid for ====
The scoring by the organizations above assumes the tax cuts are deficit-financed, meaning that over ten years the deficit rises by $1.4{{nbsp}}trillion relative to the current law baseline; or $1.0{{nbsp}}trillion after economic feedback effects. However, if one assumes the tax cuts are paid for by spending cuts, the distribution is much more unfavorable to lower- and middle-income persons, as most government spending is directed to them; the higher income taxpayers tend to get [[tax expenditures|tax breaks]], not direct payments. According to the [[Tax Policy Center]], if the Senate bill were financed by a $1,210 per household cut in government spending per year (a more likely scenario than focusing cuts proportionally by income or income taxes paid), then during 2019:
*Approximately 72% of taxpayers would be worse off than current law, meaning benefits from tax cuts would be more than offset by reduced spending on their behalf.

The Senate bill repeals the individual mandate that requires all Americans under 65 to have health insurance or pay a penalty, effective starting in 2019.<ref>{{Cite document|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20171220.323429/full/|title=The Tax Bill And The Individual Mandate: What Happened, And What Does It Mean?|doi=10.1377/hblog20171220.323429|doi-broken-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref> The CBO initially estimated that 13{{nbsp}}million fewer persons would have health insurance by 2025, including 8{{nbsp}}million fewer on the [[Affordable Care Act]] exchanges and 5{{nbsp}}million fewer on Medicaid.

===Claims made by the Administration===
The Administration and its [[Council of Economic Advisors]] have made several claims in advocating the Act during 2017, including:
*Reduction in corporate tax rates from 35 to 20%. Also, immediate full expensing of non-structure investments (e.g., IT investments) will increase [[GDP]] growth rates by 3 to 5 percentage points over the current baseline projections of around 2%. This could begin as early as 3–5 years from the tax cuts or further out in time. This projection excludes other tax cuts in the Act, such as those for individuals and pass-through entities, which may have additional GDP impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/cea-report-growth-effects-corporate-tax-reform-implications-wages/|title=CEA Report: The Growth Effects of Corporate Tax Reform and Implications for Wages|website=The White House|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>
*The mechanism for this increased growth is at higher business investment levels (one of the components of GDP) due to the additional after-tax income available.
*Further, this GDP growth (a measure of income and production) would represent an average $4,000 annual increase in wage and salary income for households.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/27/cea-report-growth-effects-corporate-tax-reform-and-implications-wages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210111820/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/27/cea-report-growth-effects-corporate-tax-reform-and-implications-wages|url-status=dead|title=CEA Report-The Growth Effects of Corporate Tax Reform and Implications for Wages-October 27, 2017|archive-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref>

*Trump economic advisor [[Gary Cohn (investment banker)|Gary Cohn]] stated that "The wealthy are not getting a tax cut under our plan" and that the plan would cut taxes for low- and middle-income households. Further, Trump stated that the tax plan "...was not good for [him] [personally]."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/09/trump-tax-plan-benefit-rich/541584/ | work=The Atlantic | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=Trump Says His Tax Plan Won't Benefit the Rich—He's Exactly Wrong | date=September 29, 2017 }}</ref>

===Minor impact on economic growth===
[[Paul Krugman]] disputed the Administration's primary argument that tax cuts for businesses will stimulate investment and higher wages:<ref name="Krugman_Everybody">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/trump-tax-plan-hate.html|work=The New York Times|first=Paul|last=Krugman|title=Everybody Hates the Trump Tax Plan|date=November 16, 2017}}</ref>
*Foreigners own about 35% of U.S. equities, so as much as $700{{nbsp}}billion of the tax cut will go overseas, as corporate after-tax income will flow to these investors as stock buybacks and dividends.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/trump-taxes-wealthy-foreigners.html|work=The New York Times|first=Paul|last=Krugman|title=Trump's $700{{nbsp}}Billion Gift to Wealthy Foreigners|date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

In November 2017, the University of Chicago asked over 40 economists if U.S. GDP would be substantially higher a decade from now, if either the House or Senate bills were enacted, with the following results: 52% either disagreed or strongly disagreed, while 36% were uncertain and only 2% agreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reform-2|title=Tax Reform - IGM Forum}}</ref>

The [[Tax Policy Center]] estimated that GDP would be 0.3% higher in 2027 under the House bill versus current law, while the University of Pennsylvania Penn Wharton budget model estimates approximately 0.3–0.9% for both the House and Senate bills. The very limited effect estimated is due to the expectation of higher interest rates and trade deficits. These estimates are both contrary to the Administration's claims of 10% increase by 2027 (about 1% per year) and Senator Mitch McConnell's estimate of a 4.1% increase.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/the-republican-tax-on-the-future.html|work=The New York Times|department=Editorial|title=The Republican Tax on the Future|date=November 25, 2017}}</ref>

Federal Reserve Bank of NY President and CEO [[William C. Dudley]] stated in January 2018: "While this legislation will reduce federal revenues by about 1 percent of GDP in both 2018 and 2019, I anticipate the boost to economic growth will be less than that. Most importantly, most of the tax cuts accrue to the corporate sector and to higher-income households that have a relatively low marginal propensity to consume. This suggests that a significant portion of the tax cuts will be saved, not spent."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2018/dud180111|title=The Outlook for the U.S. Economy in 2018 and Beyond - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK|website=www.newyorkfed.org|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

The Trump administration predicted the tax cut would spur corporate capital investment and hiring. One year after enactment of the tax cut, a [[National Association for Business Economics]] survey of corporate economists found that 84% reported their firms had not changed their investment or hiring plans due to the tax cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-investment-idUSKCN1PM0B0|title=$1.5 trillion U.S. tax cut has no major impact on business capex...|date=January 28, 2019|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> Later in 2019, the [[Economic Policy Institute]] analyzed the data on business investment from the federal [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] and concluded that, "if the TCJA’s corporate rate cuts were working, we would be seeing a permanent rise in investment. Instead, investment growth is cratering."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.epi.org/blog/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-isnt-working-and-theres-no-reason-to-think-that-will-change/ | title = The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn't working and there's no reason to think that will change | last = Blair | first = Hunter | date = October 31, 2019  | website = epi.org | publisher = [[Economic Policy Institute]]  | access-date = 2019-11-30}}</ref> Analysis conducted by ''The New York Times'' in November 2019 found that average business investment was lower after the tax cut than before, and that firms receiving larger tax relief increased investment less than firms receiving smaller tax relief. The analysis also found that since the tax cut firms increased dividends and stock buybacks by nearly three times as much as they increased capital investments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html|title=How FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0|first1=Jim|last1=Tankersley|first2=Peter|last2=Eavis|first3=Ben|last3=Casselman|date=November 17, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Corporate executives indicated that raising wages and investment were not priorities should they have additional funds due to a tax cut. A survey conducted by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch of 300 executives of major U.S. corporations asked what they would do with a corporate tax cut. The top three responses were that they would pay down debt, conduct stock buybacks, and conduct mergers. An informal survey of CEOs by Trump advisor [[Gary Cohn (investment banker)|Gary Cohn]] resulted in a similar response, with few hands raised in response to his request for them to do so if their company would invest more.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/14/why-arent-the-other-hands-up-a-top-trump-advisers-startling-response-to-ceos-not-doing-what-hed-expect/|work=The Washington Post|first=Heather|last=Long|title='Why aren't the other hands up?'

Former [[Clinton cabinet]] Treasury Secretary [[Larry Summers]] referred to the analysis provided by the Trump administration of its tax proposal as "...some combination of dishonest, incompetent, and absurd." Summers wrote that the Trump administration's "central claim that cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent would raise wages by $4,000 per worker" lacked peer-reviewed support and was "absurd on its face."<ref name="Summers1">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/17/lawrence-summers-trumps-top-economists-tax-analysis-isnt-just-wrong-its-dishonest/|work=The Washington Post|first=Lawrence|last=Summers|title=Trump's Top Economist's Analysis Isn't Just Wrong, It's Dishonest|date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>

On December 20, 2017, the day the final bill was passed by the House, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp announced they would raise the minimum wage of its workers to $15 an hour upon signing of the bill. A number of companies announced bonuses for workers, including AT&T which said it will give a $1,000 bonus to every single one of its 200,000 employees as a result of the Tax Cut bill. Democratic Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] stated that these were the exception to the rule and that AT&T was in litigation with the government over a pending merger. He stated: "There is a reason so few executives have said the tax bill will lead to more jobs, investments, and higher wages—because it will actually lead to share buybacks, corporate bonuses, and dividends."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/wells-fargo-at-t-try-to-prove-unpopular-tax-cut-goes-to-workers?te=1&nl=dealbook&emc=edit_dk_20171221|title=Wells Fargo, AT&T Try to Show Unpopular Tax Cut Helps Workers|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

In the immediate aftermath of the passage of the Act, a relatively small number of corporations&mdash;many of them involved in mergers disputed by the government or regulatory difficulties&mdash;announced pay raises or bonuses to employees, although it is not clear they would not have done so without the tax cut (many companies award raises and bonuses early each year in the normal course of business, after their prior year earnings are known and their new budgets are put in place). About 18 companies in the [[S&P 500 Index|S&P]] did so; when companies paid awards to employees, these were usually a small percentage of corporate savings from the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/02/investing/tax-cuts-bonus-trump/index.html|title=Only a small slice of corporate America has shared tax savings with workers so far|first=Matt|last=Egan|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> A January 2018 study from the firm [[Willis Towers Watson]] found that 80% of companies were not "considering giving raises at all."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/what-companies-are-really-doing-with-their-tax-windfall-so-far|title=What Companies Are Really Doing With Their Tax Windfall (So Far)|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> Bloomberg reported in March 2018 that an estimated 60% of corporate tax savings were going to shareholders, while 15% was going to employees, based on analysis of 51 S&P 500 companies.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/> In July 2018, Bloomberg reported that [[real wages]] have actually fallen in the first quarter after the tax bill went into effect.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Noah |date=July 18, 2018 |title=Trump's Tax Cut Hasn't Done Anything for Workers|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-18/trump-s-tax-cut-hasn-t-done-anything-for-workers|work=Bloomberg|access-date=July 27, 2018 }}</ref>

''The New York Times'' editorial board explained the tax bill as both consequence and cause of [[Income inequality in the United States|income]] and [[Wealth inequality in the United States|wealth inequality]]: "Most Americans know that the Republican tax bill will widen economic inequality by lavishing breaks on corporations and the wealthy while taking benefits away from the poor and the middle class. What many may not realize is that growing inequality helped create the bill in the first place. As a smaller and smaller group of people cornered an ever-larger share of the nation's wealth, so too did they gain an ever-larger share of political power. They became, in effect, kingmakers; the tax bill is a natural consequence of their long effort to bend American politics to serve their interests." The corporate tax rate was 48% in the 1970s and is 21% under the Act. The top individual rate was 70% in the 1970s and is 37% under the Act. Despite these large cuts, incomes for the working class have stagnated and workers now pay a larger share of the pre-tax income in payroll taxes.<ref name="NYT_Kingmakers">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/opinion/sunday/tax-bill-inequality-created.html|work=The New York Times|department=Editorial|title=the Tax Bill that Inequality Created|date=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

The share of income going to the top 1% has doubled, from 10% to 20%, since the pre-1980 period, while the share of wealth owned by the top 1% has risen from around 25% to 42%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2015.pdf|title=Emmanuel Saez-Striking it Richer-June 30, 2016|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/SaezZucman2016QJE.pdf|title=Saez&Zucman-Quarterly Journal of Economics-Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913-May 2016|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> Despite President Trump promising to address those left behind, the House and Senate bills would increase economic inequality:

*In 2019, a person in the bottom 10% would average a $50 tax cut, while a person in the top 1% gets a $34,000 tax cut;
*Up to 13{{nbsp}}million persons losing health insurance or subsidies are overwhelmingly in the bottom 30% of the income distribution;
*The top 1% receives approximately 70% of the pass-through income, which will be subject to much lower taxes;

===International tax standards===
In November 2017, the [[OECD]] reported that the U.S. tax burden was lower in 2016 than the OECD country average, measured as a percentage of GDP:
*Overall taxes, including many state and local taxes, were 26.0% GDP in 2016, versus the OECD average of 34.3%.
*Income taxes were 8.5% GDP in 2016, versus the OECD average of 8.9%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-2522770x.htm|title=Revenue Statistics: 1965-2016 - en - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>
*Corporate taxes were 2.3% GDP in 2011, versus the OECD average of 3.0% GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/u-s-tax-rates-the-big-picture/|title=U.S. Tax Rates: The Big Picture|date=April 15, 2014|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> Despite this, the US corporate tax rate was 35% prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, ten percentage points higher than the OECD average of 25%; the TCJA reduced the American corporate tax rate to 21%, four percentage points lower than the OECD average at the time.<ref name=XinhuaBDI/>
Journalist Justin Fox wrote in [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] that Americans may feel financial pressure due to healthcare and college tuition costs, which are much higher than other OECD countries measured as a share of GDP, offsetting the benefit of the already lower tax structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-27/taxes-are-low-in-the-u-s-but-other-stuff-is-expensive|publisher=Bloomberg|first=Justin|last=Fox|title=Taxes are Low in the U.S., but other stuff is expensive|date=November 27, 2017}}</ref>

====International trade issues====
A potential consequence of the proposed tax reform, specifically lowering business taxes, is that (in theory) the U.S. would be a more attractive place for foreign capital (investment money). This inflow of foreign capital would help fund the surge in investment by corporations, one of the stated goals of the legislation. However, a large inflow of foreign capital would drive up the price of the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive, thus increasing the [[trade deficit]]. Paul Krugman estimated this could adversely impact up to 2.5{{nbsp}}million U.S. jobs.<ref name="Krugman_TD"/>

According to ''The New York Times'', "wide range of experts agree that cutting taxes is likely to increase the trade deficit" with other countries, which conflicts with the stated priority of the White House to reduce the trade deficit.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/us/politics/tax-cuts-trade-deficit-trump.html|title=Trump's Tax Cuts Are Likely to Increase Trade Deficit|last=Appelbaum|first=Binyamin|date=2017-11-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-19|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> However, Economists widely reject that reducing the trade deficit necessarily has to be good for the economy. So the fact that this bill may increase the trade deficit will not necessarily decrease American welfare.<ref name=":0"/>

====Foreign objections====
The finance ministers of the five largest European economies ([[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]]) wrote a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Steve Mnuchin]], expressing concern that the tax reforms could trigger a [[trade war]], as they would violate [[World Trade Organization]] rules and distort international trade.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/11/philip-hammond-sides-eu-demand-donald-trump-drops-tax-reforms/|title=Philip Hammond sides with EU to demand Donald Trump drops tax reforms that risk trade war|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> Similar concerns were voiced by China.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/europeans-tell-mnuchin-u-s-tax-plan-may-break-treaties-trade|title=Europeans Tell Mnuchin the GOP Tax Plan May Break Treaties, Hurt Trade|last=Deen|first=Mark|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref> In response to the Act, German economists called for the German government to enact tax reform and additional subsidies to prevent a loss of jobs and investments to the US.<ref name=XinhuaBDI>{{cite news|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/21/c_136841275.htm|title=U.S. tax reform poses threat to German jobs, investment, say leading economists|last=Yurou|agency=Xinhua|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>

===Tax complication===
According to ''The New York Times'', "economists and tax experts across the political spectrum warn that the proposed system would invite tax avoidance. The more the tax code distinguishes among types of earnings, personal characteristics or economic activities, the greater the incentive to label income artificially, restructure or switch categories in a hunt for lower rates."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/business/economy/tax-plans-may-give-your-co-worker-a-better-deal-than-you.html|title=Tax Plans May Give Your Co-Worker a Better Deal Than You|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=2017-12-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', the bill's changes to "business and individual taxation could lead to a new era of business reorganization and tax-code gamesmanship with unknown consequences for the economy and federal revenue collection."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-pass-through-businesses-let-the-tax-games-begin-1513161000|title=For Pass-Through Businesses, Let the (Tax) Games Begin|last1=Rubin|first1=Richard|date=2017-12-13|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-12-13|last2=Simon|first2=Ruth|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

Republicans justified the tax reform initially as an effort to simplify the tax code. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Speaker Paul Ryan said in November 2017 that they would simplify the tax code so much that 9 in 10 Americans would be able to file their taxes on a postcard.<ref name=":5">{{cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-tax-bill-doesnt-actually-simplify-the-tax-code/|title=The Republican Tax Bill Doesn't Actually Simplify The Tax Code|last=Carmichael|first=Kevin|date=2017-12-20|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2017-12-20}}</ref> President Donald Trump said on December 13, 2017, that people would be able to file their taxes "on a single, little, beautiful sheet of paper".<ref name=":5"/> However, when the final version of the tax legislation passed through houses of Congress, the legislation kept most loopholes intact and did not simplify the tax code.<ref name=":5"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/17/pf/taxes/gop-tax-plan-simplify/index.html|title=New tax code will still be complicated despite GOP promise to simplify|last=Sahadi|first=Jeanne|publisher=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-12-20}}</ref> The announcements by the House leaders hurt the stock prices of [[Tax preparation in the United States|tax preparers]], but upon the release of the actual bill, the stock prices of tax preparers sharply increased.<ref name=":5"/>

===Name of the law===
The Short Title reference of "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" was not approved by Senate in the final enactment of the reconciliation law due to a dispute that was settled by the [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate|Senate Parliamentarian]].<ref name="Watkins"/> The tax act is, officially, a set of tax law changes to the Internal Revenue Code that were appended to a budget reconciliation law without Short Title, and its proper reconciliation name (either, the Long Title, or Public Law 115–97, or some generic abbreviation) is currently used in referring to the actual law. Nevertheless, {{as of|2018|lc=on}}, the proposed rejected Short Title name had gained currency within some political and professional circles who continue to use "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" to refer to Public Law 115–97, and so the Act may be inaccurately referred to by its rejected Short Title in some instances.

===Federal Reserve===
Federal Reserve officials had indicated earlier in 2017 that aggressive tax cuts could increase the pace of interest rate increases already planned. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, slowing economic growth (GDP), other things equal. The Fed also raises interest rates to help offset the risk of inflation in a growing economy near full employment. However, as the tax plan became clearer and its impact on the economy was judged to be relatively minor, the Fed indicated that a plan to raise interest rates incrementally as many as three times in 2018 would not be changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/business/economy/fed-interest-rates.html|title=Fed Predicts Modest Economic Growth From Tax Cut|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>Binyamin Appelbaum, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html A Trump Economic Boom?

==Averted concerns==
This section is for concerns regarding the law that were discussed prior to its passage, but that were excluded from the final bill or were otherwise confirmed would not occur.

===Tuition waiver exemption===
The bill that passed the House had been criticized for its significant negative impact on graduate students. Graduate students in private universities could have seen their effective tax rate go above 41.9%, a rate higher than what even the richest of Americans typically pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/07/the-gop-tax-plan-will-destroy-graduate-education/#66f68ac63d2f|title=The GOP Tax Plan Will Destroy Graduate Education|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref> The change was due to a provision in the bill that would have repealed the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses, meaning that graduate students' waived tuition would be viewed as taxable income. Given that their stipends are significantly less than the waived tuition, this would typically increase their taxes by 30–60% for public universities and hundreds of percent for private ones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16619246/tax-bill-trump-gop-cuts-and-jobs-act-graduate-students-tuition-waiver-reductions|title=The Republican tax plan could financially devastate graduate students|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/07/grad-students-and-policy-experts-say-taxing-graduate-students-tuition-waivers-would|title=Taxing a Coupon|work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref> The Senate version of the bill did not contain these provisions.<ref name="Timmer">{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/tax-bill-that-passed-the-house-would-cripple-training-of-scientists/|work=Ars Technica|first=John|last=Timmer|title=Tax bill that passed the House would cripple training of scientists|date=November 17, 2017}}</ref>

The House bill's disadvantageous treatment of graduate students was criticized because of its projected negative effect on the training of U.S. scientists.<ref name="Timmer"/> The bill's impact on U.S. science and innovation had been criticized by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor emeritus [[Burton Richter]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] and the [[National Medal of Science]], who critiqued the bill's negative impact on Americans seeking advanced degrees and wrote that the budget impact of the tax cuts would force a dramatic reduction in federal funding for scientific research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/360662-why-the-tax-bill-is-bad-for-science-innovation-and-america|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|first1=Michael|last1=S.

===Automatic spending cuts averted/PAYGO===
Under the [[Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010|Statutory Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010]] (PAYGO), laws that increase the federal deficit will trigger automatic spending cuts unless Congress votes to waive them. Because the Act adds $1.5{{nbsp}}trillion to the deficit, automatic cuts of $150{{nbsp}}billion per year over ten years would have applied, including a $25{{nbsp}}billion annual cut to Medicare. Because the PAYGO waiver is not allowed in a reconciliation bill, it requires separate legislation which requires 60 votes in the Senate to end a filibuster.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/14/how-the-gop-tax-plan-could-leave-the-party-in-need-of-democrats-help/|title=Democrats have leverage in one part of the GOP tax cut process|last=Long|first=Heather|date=2017-11-14|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2017-12-21|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/29/upshot/paygo-medicare-cuts-tax-bill.html|title=The Tax Bill's Automatic Spending Cuts|last=Sanger-Katz|first=Margot|date=2017-11-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-21|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> If Congress had not passed the waiver, it would have been the first time that statutory PAYGO sequestration would have occurred.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/30/tax-bill-spending-cuts-gop-congress-274337|title=Tax bill could trigger historic spending cuts|last1=Cancryn|first1=Adam|date=2017-11-30|work=Politico|access-date=2017-12-21|last2=Ferris|first2=Sarah}}</ref> However, the PAYGO waiver was included in the [[continuing resolution]] passed by Congress on December 22 and signed by President Trump.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/republican-squabbles-resurface-on-funding-after-unity-on-taxes|title=House GOP Pushes Funding Gambit Day Ahead of Shutdown Deadline|last1=Edgerton|first1=Anna|date=2017-12-21|work=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=2017-12-22|last2=Wasson|first2=Erik}}</ref><ref name="PAYGO_Waived">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/22/trump-signs-gop-tax-plan-short-term-government-funding-bill.html|title=Trump signs GOP tax plan and short-term government funding bill on his way out of town|first=Christina|last=Wilkie|date=December 22, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>

===Differences between the House and Senate bills===
There were important differences between the House and Senate versions of the bills, due in part to the Senate reconciliation rules, which required that the bill impact the deficit by less than $1.5 trillion over ten years and have minimal deficit impact thereafter. (The [[Byrd Rule]] allows Senators to block legislation if it would increase the deficit significantly beyond a ten-year period.<ref name="TPC_Nov8">{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/preliminary-distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act|title=Preliminary Distributional Analysis of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"|date=November 8, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name="LevitzFilibuster">{{cite news | url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/the-gop-tax-plan-is-dead-unless-the-filibuster-dies-first.html | work=New York | first=Eric | last=Levitz | title=The GOP Tax Plan Is Dead – Unless the Filibuster Dies First | date=November 10, 2017 }}</ref>) For example: 
*The House plan had four income tax brackets ranging from 12% to 39.6%, while the Senate bill kept seven brackets ranging from 10% to 38.5%.<ref name="sticking">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568329807/9-sticking-points-the-house-and-senate-have-to-work-out-in-their-tax-bills|title=9 Sticking Points The House And Senate Have To Work Out In Their Tax Bills|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>
*The House plan cut the corporate tax immediately, while the Senate plan delayed it until 2019.
*The House plan made both individual and corporate taxes "permanent" (i.e., no set expiration) while the Senate bill had most of the individual tax cuts expiring (but not the business cuts).
*The House plan did not repeal the health insurance individual mandate, while the Senate bill and final Act did.

==Support and opposition==
===Notable supporters===
Leading Republicans supported the bill, including President [[Donald Trump]] and Vice President [[Mike Pence]], and Republicans in Congress, such as:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/11/republicans_finally_unveil_the.html|title=Republicans roll out their long-awaited tax reform plan|work=cleveland.com|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>

A number of Republican senators who initially expressed trepidation over the bill, including [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] of Wisconsin, [[Susan Collins]] of Maine, and [[Steve Daines]] of [[Montana]], ultimately voted for the Senate bill.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://bangordailynews.com/2017/12/01/politics/susan-collins-says-three-of-her-amendments-are-in-senate-gops-tax-bill/ | work=Bangor Daily News | first=Michael | last=Shepherd | title=Susan Collins says she supports Senate GOP's tax bill | date=December 2, 2017 }}</ref><ref>Jacob Pramuk, [https://bangordailynews.com/2017/12/01/politics/susan-collins-says-three-of-her-amendments-are-in-senate-gops-tax-bill/ Ron Johnson and Steve Daines, two of the last Senate GOP holdouts, will back tax bill after pass-through tweak], CNBC (December 1, 2017).</ref>

Republican supporters of the tax bill characterized it as a simplification of the tax code. While some elements of the legislation would simplify the tax code, other provisions would add additional complexity.<ref name="VinikSimplify">{{cite news | url=https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/11/02/trump-republican-tax-plan-not-simple-000569 | publisher=Politico | first=Danny | last=Vinik | title=Simpler taxes under the GOP plan?

=== Notable opponents ===
[[File:Tammy Duckworth speaking against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Tammy Duckworth]] and then House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] press conference opposing the bill in 2017.]]
Democrats opposed the legislation, viewing it as a giveaway to corporations and high earners at the expense of middle class communities.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/politics/democrats-tax-reform-middle-class.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jim | last=Tankersley | title=Democrats Attack Tax Bill as a 'Middle-Class Con Job' | date=October 29, 2017 }}</ref> Every House Democrat voted against the bill when it came to the House floor; they were joined by 13 Republicans who voted against it.<ref name="NYTimesHouse"/>

The top congressional Democrats&mdash;[[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Chuck Schumer]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]]&mdash;strongly oppose the bill. Schumer said of the bill that "The more it's in sunlight, the more it stinks."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/11/02/public-will-turn-against-gop-tax-bill-schumer-predicts-the-more-its-in-sunlight-the-more-it-stinks/|title=Public will turn against GOP tax bill, Schumer predicts: 'The more it's in sunlight, the more it stinks'|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|date=2017-11-02|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-03|last2=Paletta|first2=Damian|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Pelosi said the legislation was "designed to plunder the middle class to put into the pockets of the wealthiest 1 percent more money. ...

The 13 House Republicans who voted against the bill were mostly from New York, New Jersey, and California, and were opposed to the bill's elimination of the state and local income tax deduction in the bill, which benefits those states.<ref>Sam Petulla, Sean O'Key and Hannah Lang, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/politics/house-republicans-vote-no-tax-bill/index.html The House Republicans who voted 'no' on tax reform], CNN (November 16, 2017).</ref>

Billionaire and former Mayor of New York [[Michael Bloomberg]] called this tax bill an "economically indefensible blunder" arguing that companies would not invest more because of the tax cuts: "Corporations are sitting on a record amount of cash reserves: nearly $2.3 trillion. That figure has been climbing steadily since the recession ended in 2009, and it's now double what it was in 2001. The reason CEOs aren't investing more of their liquid assets has little to do with the tax rate."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/5066014/billionaire-michael-bloomberg-the-tax-bill-is-an-economically-indefensible-blunder/|title=Billionaire Michael Bloomberg: 'The Tax Bill Is an Economically Indefensible Blunder'|website=Money|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>

[[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]] also thought that Trump's tax cut would not help businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-bill-gates-say-trump-tax-cut-plan-wont-help-business-2017-5|title=Warren Buffett and Bill Gates don't think Trump's tax cut will help business|website=Business Insider |access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref> In a [[CNBC]] interview, Buffett even said: "I don't need a tax cut in a society with so much inequality".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/04/billionaire-warren-buffett-i-dont-need-a-tax-cut.html|title=Billionaire Warren Buffett: 'I don't need a tax cut'|last=Clifford|first=Catherine|date=2017-10-04|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>

In a letter made public on the November 12, 2017, more than 400{{nbsp}}millionaires and billionaires (which include [[George Soros]] and [[Steven Clark Rockefeller|Steven Rockefeller]]) asked Congress to reject the Republican tax plan. They note that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while adding at least $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the current national debt. This deficit "would leave us unable to meet our country's current needs and restrict us in advancing any future investments," the letter continues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.responsiblewealth.org/read_the_letter|title=Read the Letter|work=Responsible Wealth Project|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republican-tax-plan-rich-tell-congress-dont-tax-us-soros-letter-trump-reform-a8053281.html|title=More than 400 millionaires and billionaires have called on Republicans not to cut their taxes|date=2017-11-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/12/more-than-400-millionaires-tell-congress-dont-cut-our-taxes/|title=More than 400 millionaires tell Congress: Don't cut our taxes|last=Long|first=Heather|date=2017-11-12|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-02|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' has also been critical of the tax cut and its lack of long-term vision : "The expiry of tax cuts for individuals is a ticking time-bomb in the tax code. It will explode just as America approaches a budget crisis, driven by rising spending on health care and pensions for the elderly. This gap will probably eventually be plugged by a combination of tax rises and spending cuts. But by cutting taxes now, Republicans have moved the starting point for any future negotiations.".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/12/20/tax-reform-has-passed-what-now|title=Tax reform has passed. What now?|date=2017-12-20|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

''[[The Financial Times]]'' argued that this bill was "built for [[Plutocracy|plutocrats]]" as it would mainly benefit very high income households ("45 per cent of the tax reductions in 2027 would go to households with incomes above $500,000 - fewer than 1 per cent of filers"). It concluded by stating : "The US the world once knew is drowning in a tide of unconscionable and apparently unlimited [[greed]]. We are all now doomed to live with the unhappy consequences.".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e494f47e-ce1a-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6|title=A Republican tax plan built for plutocrats|last=Wolf|first=Martin|date=November 21, 2017|work=Financial Times}}</ref>

The Editorial Board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' vigorously opposed the bill : "This bill is bad enough.

===Views of economists===
While there is no clear consensus among [[Economist|academic economists]] as to whether the tax plan would benefit the economy to the degree that [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] predicted, there is a consensus that it will widen [[public deficit]]s and [[economic inequality]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/business/how-to-improve-the-trump-tax-plan.html|title=How to Improve the Trump Tax Plan|last=Mankiw|first=N.

The article did not support the claim, but seemed to offer a non-committal acknowledgement of support for both proponents for and detractors from the benefits of tax cuts on growth. I retained the citation and altered the sentence to reflect the ambivalent tone in the article.

I also altered 'economic inequalities' to 'economic inequality'.  -->

In a survey conducted by the [[University of Chicago]]'s Initiative on Global Markets, 37 out of 38 economists interviewed stated that they thought the Act would cause a rapid increase in the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]].

==Results==
Analysis of first-year results released by the [[Congressional Research Service]] in May 2019 found:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/28/new-report-further-undermines-trumps-claim-that-tax-cuts-were-economic-rocket-fuel/|title=Analysis &#124; A new report further undermines Trump's claim that the tax cuts were economic 'rocket fuel'|website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>The Economic Effects of the 2017 Tax
Revision: Preliminary Observations, Congressional Research Service, May 22, 2019: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45736.pdf</ref>

* "a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy"
* "a feedback effect of 0.3% of GDP or less," such that the tax cut did not pay for itself
* "pretax profits and economic depreciation (the price of capital) grew faster than wages," meaning shareholders benefited more than workers
* inflation-adjusted wage growth "is smaller than overall growth in labor compensation and indicates that ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates"
* "the evidence does not suggest a surge in investment from abroad in 2018"
*  "While evidence does indicate significant repurchases of shares, either from tax cuts or repatriated revenues, relatively little was directed to paying worker bonuses"

The tax cut was enacted three months into the 2018 fiscal year. Corporate tax receipts for the full fiscal year ended September 2018 were down 31% from the prior fiscal year, the largest decline since records began in 1934, except for during the [[Great Recession]] when corporate profits, and hence corporate tax receipts, plummeted. Analysts attributed the fiscal 2018 decline to the tax cut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/with-corporate-tax-receipts-sagging-federal-deficit-hits-monthly-high/|title=Analysis: With corporate tax receipts sagging, the federal deficit hits a monthly high|website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2018/10/corporate-tax-receipts-were-down-by-nearly-one-third-in-fiscal-year-2018|title=Corporate Tax Receipts Took an Unprecedented Drop This Year|website=www.pgpf.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itep.org/corporate-profits-up-corporate-federal-tax-collections-down/|title=Corporate Profits 🠉, Corporate Federal Tax Collections 🠋|website=ITEP}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tax-revenue-declined-0-4-in-2018-11550084426|title=U.S. Tax Revenues Fall, Deficit Widens in Wake of New Tax Law|first=Kate|last=Davidson|date=February 14, 2019|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>

The Council of Economic Advisers had estimated in October 2017 that the corporate tax cut of the TCJA would increase real median household income by $3000 to $7000 annually,<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Tax%20Reform%20and%20Wages.pdf</ref> but during the first year following enactment of the tax cut the figure increased by $553, which the Census Bureau characterized  as statistically insignificant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/10/median-household-income-stagnant-last-year-poverty-fell/2271025001/|title=More Americans go without health insurance for the first time in a decade|first=Paul Davidson and Charisse|last=Jones|website=USA TODAY}}</ref>

==Follow-on bills==
House Republicans have written follow-on bills that would extend the individual tax cuts beyond their current expiration date, simplify the rules for [[Individual Retirement Account]]s, and add new tax deductions for small businesses.<ref>Kaeding, Nicole; York, Erica (July 24, 2018).

The follow-on bills were written as three separate bills, named the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 (H.R. 6760), the Family Savings Act (H.R. 6757), and the American Innovation Act of 2018 (H.R. 6756).<ref>York, Erica (September 14, 2018).

On September 27, the House of Representatives passed the Family Savings Act by a vote of a 240–177, and then it passed the American Innovation Act by a vote of 260–156.,<ref>"[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6757?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+6757%22%5D%7D&r=1 H.R.6757: Family Savings Act]".

The Senate has no plans{{when?|date=July 2019}} to consider the bills.<ref name=cutspermanent/>

==Subsequent events==
The elimination of the individual mandate, the tax penalty for not having health insurance, through this Act led to several states led by Texas to challenge the constitutionality of the entire ACA based on the Supreme Court's prior decision in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' (2012) which justified the individual mandate as an allowable tax. In December 2018, Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|District Court of Northern Texas]] issued his opinion in agreement with the states that without the individual mandate, the whole of the ACA had no standing. California and several other states led the appeal of the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court]]. The Fifth Circuit affirmed in part with O'Connor's opinion on the unconstitutionality of the ACA without the individual mandate in December 2019. The case was raised to the Supreme Court to be heard as ''[[California v. Texas]]'' during the court's 2020–21 term.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/supreme-court-obamacare-appeal.html | title = Supreme Court to Hear Obamacare Appeal | first = Adam | last = Liptak | date = March 2, 2020 | access-date = March 2, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
