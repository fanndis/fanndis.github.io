{{Monarchism |Concepts}}

An '''heir apparent'''{{Efn|Sometimes '''heiress apparent''' is used for a female heir apparent; however, ''heir'' is an equally valid term for a man, woman or child.|name=|group=note}} is a person who is first in an [[order of succession]] and cannot be displaced from inheriting by the birth of another person. An [[heir presumptive]], by contrast, is someone who is first in line to inherit a title but who can be displaced by the birth of a more eligible heir.

Today these terms most commonly describe heirs to [[hereditary title]]s (e.g. titles of nobility) or offices, especially when only inheritable by a single person. Most monarchies refer to the heir apparent of their thrones with the descriptive term of ''[[crown prince]]'' [[crown prince|or ''crown princess'']], but they may also be accorded with a more specific [[substantive title]]:{{Efn|Note that the substantive titles do not usually correspond exactly with the status of ''heir apparent.'' See ''[[crown prince]]'' for more examples and information.|name=|group=note}} such as [[Prince of Orange]] in the Netherlands, [[Duke of Brabant]] in Belgium, [[Prince of Asturias]] in Spain (also granted to heirs presumptive), or [[Prince of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (former titles include ''[[Dauphin of France|le Dauphin]]'' during the ''[[Kingdom of France]]'' and [[Tsesarevich]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]).

The term is also used metaphorically to indicate an expected successor to any position of power, e.g. a political or corporate leader.

This article primarily describes the term ''heir apparent'' in a hereditary system regulated by laws of [[primogeniture]]—it may be less applicable to cases where a monarch has a say in naming the heir (performed either while alive, e.g. crowning the heir as a {{Lang|la|rex iunior}}, or through the monarch's [[Will and testament|will]]).

== Heir apparent versus heir presumptive ==
[[File:Crowd awaiting Crown Prince Tokyo Dec1916.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Throngs before the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] in Japan awaiting the appearance of the [[Crown Prince]] [[Hirohito]] for the recent proclamation of his official recognition as the heir apparent to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne|Japanese Imperial Throne]] &ndash; ''New York Times'', 1916.]]

In a hereditary system governed by some form of [[primogeniture]], an heir apparent is easily identifiable as the person whose position as first in the [[line of succession]] to a title or office is secure, regardless of future births. An [[heir presumptive]], by contrast, can always be "bumped down" in the succession by the birth of somebody more closely related in a legal sense (according to that form of primogeniture) to the current title-holder.

The clearest example occurs in the case of a childless bearer of a [[hereditary title]] that can only be inherited by one person. If at any time the title bearer were to produce children, those children would rank ahead of any person who had formerly been heir presumptive.

Many legal systems assume [[Illustrations of the rule against perpetuities#The fertile octogenarian|childbirth is always possible]] regardless of age or health. In such circumstances a person may be, in a practical sense, the heir apparent but still, legally speaking, heir presumptive. Indeed, when [[Queen Victoria]] succeeded her uncle [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], the wording of the proclamation even gave as a [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]:

{{quote|...saving the rights of any issue of his late Majesty King William IV, which may be born of his late Majesty's consort.}}

This provided for the possibility that William's wife, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], was pregnant at the moment of his death, since such a [[Posthumous birth|posthumous]] child, regardless of its sex, would have displaced Victoria from the throne.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/brit-proclamations.htm#Introduction Proclamations of Accessions of British Sovereigns (1547-1952)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Adelaide was 44 at the time, so pregnancy was possible even if unlikely.

=== Daughters in male-preference primogeniture ===
Daughters (and their lines) may inherit titles that descend according to male-preference primogeniture, but only in default of sons (and their heirs).  That is, both female and male offspring have the right to a place somewhere in the order of succession, but when it comes to what that place is, a female will rank behind her brothers regardless of their ages or her age.

Thus, normally, even an only daughter will not be heir apparent, since at any time a brother might be born who, though younger, would assume that position. Hence, she is an heir presumptive. For example, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] was heir presumptive during the reign of her father, [[George VI|King George VI]], because at any stage up to his death, George could have fathered a legitimate son.

=== Women as heirs apparent ===
In a system of absolute primogeniture that disregards gender, female heirs apparent occur. As succession to titles, positions, or offices in the past most often favoured males, females considered to be an heir apparent were rare. Absolute primogeniture was not practised by any modern monarchy for succession to their thrones until the late twentieth century, with Sweden being the first to adopt absolute primogeniture in 1980 and other Western European monarchies following suit.

Since the adoption of absolute primogeniture by contemporary Western European monarchies, examples of female heirs apparent include: [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Crown Princess Victoria]] of Sweden, [[Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange|Princess Catharina-Amalia]] of the Netherlands, and [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant|Princess Elisabeth]] of Belgium; they are, respectively, the oldest children of Kings [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]], and [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]]. [[Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway]] is heir apparent to her father, who is heir apparent to the Norwegian throne, and Victoria herself has a female heir apparent in her oldest child, [[Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland|Princess Estelle]]. Victoria was not heir apparent from birth (in 1977), but gained the status in 1980 following a change in the [[Swedish Act of Succession]]. Her younger brother [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Carl Philip]] (born 1979) was thus heir apparent for a few months (and is a rare example of an heir apparent losing this status without a death occurring).

In 2015, pursuant to the 2011 [[Perth Agreement]], the [[Commonwealth realm]]s changed the rules of succession to the 16 thrones of [[Elizabeth II]] to absolute primogeniture, except for male heirs born before the Perth Agreement. The effects are not likely to be felt for many years; the first two heirs at the time of the agreement ([[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and his son [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]) were already eldest born children, and in 2013 William's first-born son [[Prince George of Cambridge]] became the next apparent successor.

But even in legal systems that apply male-preference primogeniture, female heirs apparent are by no means impossible: if a male heir apparent dies leaving no sons but at least one daughter, then the eldest daughter would replace her father as heir apparent to whatever throne or title is concerned, but only when it has become clear that the widow of the deceased is not pregnant. Then, as the representative of her father's line she would assume a place ahead of any more distant relatives. Such a situation has not to date occurred with the English or British throne; several times an heir apparent has died, but each example has either been childless or left a son or sons. However, there have been several female heirs apparent to British peerages (e.g. [[Frances Ward, 6th Baroness Dudley]], and [[Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth]]).

In one special case, however, England and Scotland had a female heir apparent. The [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution]] [[Bill of Rights 1689|settlement]] that established [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] as joint monarchs in 1689 only gave the power to continue the succession through issue to Mary II, eldest daughter of the previous king, [[James II of England|James II]].  William, by contrast, was to reign for life only, and his (hypothetical) children by a wife other than Mary would be placed in his original place (as Mary's first cousin) in the line of succession – after Mary's younger sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].  Thus, although after Mary's death William continued to reign, he had no power to beget direct heirs,<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=37644 "King James’ Parliament: The succession of William and Mary - begins 13/2/1689"] ''The History and Proceedings of the House of Commons: volume 2: 1680-1695 (1742)'', pp. 255-77.  Accessed: 16 February 2007.</ref> and Anne became the heir apparent for the remainder of William's reign. She eventually succeeded him as Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland.

== Displacement of heirs apparent ==
The position of an heir apparent is normally unshakable: it can be assumed they will inherit. Sometimes, however, extraordinary events&mdash;such as the death or the deposition of the parent&mdash;intervene.

=== People who lost heir apparent status ===
* Parliament deposed [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the infant son of King [[James II of England|James II & VII]] (of England and Scotland respectively) whom James II was raising as a Catholic, as the King's legal heir apparent&mdash;declaring that James had, de facto, [[abdicate]]d&mdash;and [[Invitation to William|offered the throne]] to James II's oldest daughter, the young prince's much older [[Protestant]] half-sister, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] (along with her husband, Prince [[William III of England|William of Orange]]).  When the exiled King James died in 1701, his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters proclaimed the exiled Prince James Francis Edward as King James III of England and James VIII of Scotland; but neither he nor his descendants were ever successful in their bids for the throne.
* Crown Prince [[Gustav, Prince of Vasa|Gustav]] (later known as Gustav, Prince of Vasa), son of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]], lost his place when his father was deposed and replaced by Gustav IV Adolf's aged uncle, the Duke Carl, who became [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] in 1809.  The aged King Charles XIII did not have surviving sons, and Prince Gustav was the only living male of the whole dynasty (besides his deposed father), but the prince was never regarded as heir of Charles XIII, although there were factions in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] and elsewhere in Sweden who desired to preserve him, and, in the subsequent constitutional elections, supported his election as his grand-uncle's successor.  Instead, the government proceeded to have a new crown prince elected (which was the proper constitutional action, if no male heir was left in the dynasty), and the Riksdag elected first [[August, Prince of Augustenborg]], and then, after August's death, the Prince of [[Ponte Corvo]] (Marshal [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], who acceded as Charles XIV John in 1818). The two lines united later, when Charles XIV John's great-grandson Crown Prince [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf]] (who acceded as Gustaf V in 1907) married Gustav IV Adolf's great-granddaughter [[Victoria of Baden]], who became Crown Princess of Sweden. Thus, from [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustav VI Adolf]] onwards, the kings of Sweden are direct descendants of both Gustav IV Adolf and his son's replacement as crown prince, Charles XIV John.
* Prince [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland|Carl Philip of Sweden]], at his birth in 1979, was heir apparent to the throne of Sweden.  Less than eight months later, a change in that country's succession laws instituted absolute [[primogeniture]], and Carl Philip was supplanted as heir apparent by his elder sister [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Victoria]].
* [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz]] became Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in January 2015 upon the death of his half-brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] and the accession of another half-brother, [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], to the Saudi throne. In April of that year, Salman removed Muqrin as Crown Prince, replacing him with their nephew [[Muhammad bin Nayef]]. Muhammad bin Nayef himself was later replaced as Crown Prince by the king's son [[Mohammad bin Salman]].

=== Breaching legal qualification of heirs apparent ===
In some jurisdictions, an heir apparent can automatically lose that status by breaching certain constitutional rules. Today, for example:

* A British heir apparent would lose this status if he or she became a Catholic. This is the only religion-based restriction on the heir-apparent. (Previously, marrying a Catholic also equated to losing this status, however, in October 2011, the governments of the 16 Commonwealth realms —of which Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is monarch— agreed to [[Perth Agreement|remove the restriction on marriage to a Catholic]]. All of the Commonwealth realms subsequently passed [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|legislation to implement the change]], which fully took effect in March 2015.)
* Swedish Crown Princes and Crown Princesses would lose heir apparent status, according to the [[Swedish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], if they married without approval of the monarch and the [[Government of Sweden|Government]], abandoned the "[[Church of Sweden|pure Evangelical faith]]", or accepted another throne without the approval of the [[Riksdag]].
* Dutch Princes and Princesses of Orange would lose status as heir to the throne if they married without the approval of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]], or simply renounced the right.
* Spanish Princes and Princesses of Asturias would lose status if they married against the express prohibition of the monarch and the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]].
* Belgian Dukes and Duchesses of Brabant would lose heir apparent status if they married without the consent of the monarch, or became monarch of another country.
* Danish Crown Princes and Princesses would lose status if they married without the permission of the monarch. When the monarch grants permission for a dynast to enter marriage, he may set conditions that must be met for the dynasts and/or their children to gain or maintain a place in the line of succession; this also applies for Crown Princes and Princesses.
