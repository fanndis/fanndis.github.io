{{Politics of Norway}}

[[Norway]]'s elongated shape, its numerous internal geographical barriers, and the often widely dispersed and separated settlements are all factors that have strongly influenced the structure of the country's administrative subdivisions. This structure has varied over time and is subject to continuous review. As of late 2018, plans are nearing completion for a reform of the country's administrative divisions intended to lead, most notably, to the replacement of Norway's current 19 ''fylker'' (counties) by 11 new ''regioner''.

==Formal subdivisions==
There are three levels of political administration in Norway:

* The Kingdom, covering all of [[metropolitan regions of Norway|Metropolitan Norway]], including its integral overseas areas of [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]]. Whereas Svalbard is subject to an international treaty with some limits to Norwegian sovereignty, [[Jan Mayen]] shares county governor (''fylkesmann'') with [[Nordland]] county.
* The [[Counties of Norway|Counties]], known in Norwegian as ''fylker'' (singular ''fylke''), of which there are 18. These derive in part from divisions that preceded Norway's constitution in 1814 and independence in 1905. The counties also function as [[electoral district|constituencies]] in elections for [[Stortinget|Parliament]].
* The [[list of municipalities of Norway|Municipalities]], known in Norwegian as ''kommuner'' (singular ''kommune'') of which there are 422.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ks.no/templates/Page.aspx?id=46423 |title=Kristiansund + Frei = Sant |accessdate=2008-01-09 |publisher=www.ks.no |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220195046/http://www.ks.no/templates/Page.aspx?id=46423 |archivedate=20 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition the [[Longyearbyen]] local authority has some similarities to a municipality.
* External [[Dependencies of Norway|dependencies]]

As the infrastructure for travel and communication has improved over the years, so the benefits of further consolidation have remained under review. The number of municipalities has decreased from 744 in the early 1960s to today's 442, and more mergers are planned. Similarly, the political responsibilities of the counties have decreased, and there was talk earlier of combining them into 5–9 regions by 2010. Although those specific plans did not come to fruition, a similar scheme is again under consideration in 2018.<ref>[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/kommuner-og-regioner/kommunereform/regionreform/id2477186/ Notwegian government website: ''Regionreform''] (in Norwegian)</ref>

Within the government administration, there are a few exceptions to the county subdivisions:
* The [[Courts of Justice of Norway|Norwegian court system]] is divided into six appellate districts.
* The state [[Church of Norway]] is divided into eleven dioceses.
* The [[Sami Parliament of Norway#Elections|13 constituencies]] for elections to the [[Sami Parliament of Norway|Sámi Parliament of Norway]], which is a part of the Norwegian state apparatus, do not follow the county borders – sometimes encompassing several counties. They do, however, follow municipality borders.

===County===
{{Main|Counties of Norway}}

====County municipality====
{{Main|County municipality (Norway)}}
[[File:Map Norway political-geo.png|thumb|275px|right|A geopolitical map of Norway, exhibiting its 19 first-order [[administrative division|subnational divisions]] (''fylker'' or "counties") with [[Svalbard]] and [[Jan Mayen]]]]

A county municipality ({{lang-no|Fylkeskommune}}) is the public elected body that is responsible for certain public administrative and service tasks within a [[Counties of Norway|county]]. Each county is governed as a county municipality, with the exception of [[Oslo]], which is both a municipality and a county municipality. The main responsibility of the county municipalities are [[education in Norway|upper secondary schools]], [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[public transport]], [[road|county roads]], [[culture]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[land use planning]] and business development.

The main body of each county municipality is the [[County council (Norway)|county council]] (''fylkesting''), elected by direct election by all legal residents every fourth year. The county councils typically have 30-50 members and meet about six times a year. They are divided into standing committees and an executive board (''fylkesutvalg''), that meet considerably more often. Both the council and executive board are led by the [[Chairman of the County Council]] or County Mayor (''fylkesordfører'').

The [[Government of Norway|national government]], formally [[Norwegian monarchy|the King]], is represented in each county by a county governor ({{lang-no|[[Fylkesmann]]}}). This office mainly functions as a supervising authority over the county and municipality administrations, and their decisions can be appealed to him.

===Municipality===
{{Main|Municipalities of Norway}}

Municipalities are the atomic unit of local government and are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, some social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. Law enforcement and [[Church of Norway|church services]] are provided at a national level in Norway. The main body of each municipality is the municipality council (''kommunestyre''), elected by direct election by all legal residents every fourth year.

====Borough====
Three municipalities, Oslo, [[Bergen]] and [[Stavanger]], are divided into boroughs. In Oslo and Stavanger, they elect their own political council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They are part of the municipal organization, but have a certain amount of influence in issues regarding health, education and naming.

===Integral territories===

==Informal subdivisions==

===Regions===
{{main|Regions of Norway}}

Norway is generally divided into five regions ({{lang-no|landsdel}}), which largely represent areas with a common language and culture: [[Northern Norway]], [[Trøndelag]], [[Western Norway]], [[Southern Norway]] and [[Eastern Norway]]. Regions hold no official status in the government, but is used for organizing some public organizations, including the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]] and the [[regional health authority (Norway)|regional health authorities]]. [[Central Norway]] is a region which consists of [[Trøndelag]] and [[Møre og Romsdal]]. Trøndelag and Northern Norway is collectively known as [[Nordenfjells]]. [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]] is an area which spans into Sweden, Finland and Russia and is defined as the "homeland" of the [[Sami people|Sami]]. The [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]] uses different regions, corresponding to the weather patterns.

===Districts===
{{main|Districts of Norway}}
Districts ({{lang-no|distrikt}}) represent an unofficial area organized by common language, culture or geographical barriers. Their boundaries are subjective and some areas may be regarded as belonging to multiple districts. Districts are larger than municipalities and smaller than counties, although some districts may span across county borders. Some districts form a hierarchy where a district can be subdivided into multiple lesser districts.

===Settlements and rural areas===
[[Statistics Norway]] uses the term "settlement" for any collection of at least 200 people who live close together. Outside of these there may be rural areas which have an unofficial border. Sometimes these are defined by school districts. Cities are often divided into boroughs, which may or may not have{{clarify|date=January 2020}}

==History==
[[Formannskapsdistrikt|Municipal independence]] was established in 1838. The introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The [[Norwegian farm culture]] (''bondekultur'') that emerged came to serve as a symbol of national resistance to the forced [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]]. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities.

The composition and number of municipalities, their functions, and the existence and functions of the counties are being continuously debated. However, there are currently no plans for reform.
