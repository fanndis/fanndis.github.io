It effectively nullified the constitution and established [[martial law in Taiwan]], where [[civil liberties|civil]] and [[political freedoms]] were curtailed. The official rationale for the provisions was the ongoing [[Chinese Civil War]], but with the demise of the [[Dang Guo|Kuomintang single-party system]], the provisions were repealed.

==History==
The current [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] was adopted by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] in 1947, when the [[Nationalist Government]] was based in [[Nanjing]]. Since 1945, China was engulfed [[Chinese Civil War|in a civil war]] that pitted the Nationalist Government against the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). In March 1948, the first National Assembly met in Nanjing, and after some deliberation, decided to invoke Article 174 of the Constitution to amend the Constitution".<ref name="Feldman"/> On 10 May 1948, the Assembly adopted the first set of Temporary Provisions that was set to expire after three years. In 1949, the Communists [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|expelled the Nationalist Government]] from mainland China, and [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the establishment]] of the People's Republic of China while Chiang's government [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|retreated]] to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]. In 1954, the National Assembly indefinitely renewed the Temporary Provisions in view of the [[Kuomintang]]'s plans to [[Project National Glory|recapture the mainland]]. The Temporary Provisions from then on were amended in accordance with the needs of the [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], or his son [[Chiang Ching Kuo]]. In 1966, the Temporary Provisions were revised to allow for supplementary elections to the National Assembly from the [[Taiwan Area]]. In 1971, the ROC was [[China and the United Nations|expelled from the United Nations]] and replaced with representatives from the [[People's Republic of China]]; the Temporary Provisions were amended again in 1972. However in 1979, the United States [[Taiwan–United States relations|severed diplomatic relations]] with the ROC and recognized the PRC.

===Abolition===
It became clear that retaking the mainland was not a real possibility. On 22 April 1991, the National Assembly resolved to abolish the Temporary Provisions, and on April 30 of the same year, President [[Lee Teng-hui]] declared the end of the Mobilization for Suppression of Communist Rebellion as of May 1.<ref name="Sino">{{cite web | url = http://www.sino.gov.tw/en/show_issue.php?id=200068906052e.txt&cur_page=2&table=2&distype=&h1=About%20Taiwan&h2=Politics&search=&height=&type=&scope=&order=&keyword=&lstPage=&num=&year=2000&month=06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011337/http://www.sino.gov.tw/en/show_issue.php?id=200068906052e.txt&cur_page=2&table=2&distype=&h1=About%20Taiwan&h2=Politics&search=&height=&type=&scope=&order=&keyword=&lstPage=&num=&year=2000&month=06 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2011-07-20 | title = A Pivotal President-- Lee Teng-hui's 12 Years | publisher = Taiwan Panorama (Sino) | date = 2000-06-05 }}</ref> The repeal of the provisions caused some ambiguity in [[cross-strait relations]] and the [[political status of Taiwan]], raising questions such as whether the "Communist rebellion" has "succeeded" and so the PRC government is recognized as legitimate by the ROC, or whether it would be legal now for the CPC to operate in Taiwan.<ref name="Feldman"/>

==Provisions==
The Temporary Provisions allowed for the creation of the [[Taiwan Garrison Command]] and the [[National Security Council (Republic of China)|National Security Council]], both for the purpose of enforcing martial law.<ref name="Feldman">{{cite book|title=Constitutional Reform and the Future of the Republic of China|editor1-first=Harvey|editor1-last=Feldman|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|series=Taiwan in the Modern World|year=1991|pages=1, 3–7, 39|isbn=9780873328807}}</ref> The provisions also allowed the President and [[Vice President of the Republic of China]] to be exempted from the two-[[term limit|term office limit]].<ref name="Sino"/> Extensive powers given to the president by the Temporary Provisions turned the ROC into a ''de facto'' [[presidential system]], where the President [[Dang Guo|also held the post of chairman of the Kuomintang]], although the Constitution originally laid out a [[parliamentary system]].<ref name="Feldman"/> Specifically, the provision relating to the president said:<ref name="Feldman"/>
<blockquote>
In this Period of Communist Rebellion, for the sake of avoiding the emergent political crisis, and addressing the mammoth economic change, the president is empowered to adopt emergency measures through a resolution of a cabinet meeting of the Executive Yuan. The president's power will not be limited by the regular procedures of Articles 39 and 43 of the constitution.
