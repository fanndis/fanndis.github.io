The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at [[Saqqara]], northwest of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh [[Anedjib]], with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others.<ref>''Archaic Egypt'', Walter B Emery p144-145</ref> The otherwise earliest among these is the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] built {{circa}}&nbsp;2630‚Äì2610&nbsp;BC during the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Helen|authorlink=Helen Gardner (art historian)|title=[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages|Art through the Ages]]|publisher=Harcourt Brave Jovanovitch|location=New York|editor1-last=De La Croix|editor1-first=Horst|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=Richard G.|edition=7th|year=1980|origyear=1926|isbn=0-15-503758-7|page=68}}</ref> This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of [[ashlar|dressed masonry]].<ref name="Lehner 1997 p84">{{cite book |last1=Lehner |first1=Mark |title=The Complete Pyramids |year=1997 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=New York |isbn=978-0-500-05084-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/completepyramids00lehn/page/84 84] |url=https://archive.org/details/completepyramids00lehn/page/84 }}</ref>

The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at [[Giza Plateau|Giza]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]]. Several of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza pyramids]] are counted among the largest structures ever built.<ref>{{cite book |last=Watkin |first=David |year=2005 |title=A History of Western Architecture |edition=4th |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39T1zElEBrQC&q=giza+pyramids+largest+structures&pg=PA14 |isbn=978-1-85669-459-9 |quote=The Great Pyramid...is still one of the largest structures ever raised by man, its plan twice the size of St. Peter's in Rome}}</ref> The [[Pyramid of Khufu]] is the largest Egyptian pyramid.

== Historical development ==
[[File:Mastaba-faraoun-3.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mastabat al-Fir‚Äôaun]] at [[Saqqara]]]]
The design of the Egyptian pyramid seems to have been a progression from the [[Sumer|Sumerian]] [[ziggurat]], a stepped pyramidal structure with a temple on top, which dated to as early as 4000‚Äì3500 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuels |first1=Charlie |title=Ancient Science (Prehistory ‚Äì A.D. 500): Prehistory-A.D. 500 |date=2010 |publisher=Gareth Stevens Publishing LLLP |isbn=978-1-4339-4137-5 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KQCscrPDgUC&pg=PA23 |language=en}}</ref> 

From the time of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3150‚Äì2686 BC), Egyptians with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as [[mastaba]]s.<ref>[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/mastaba.html] Burial customs: mastabas. University College London (2001) Retrieved 14 April 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/earlydynastic.html |title=Early Dynastic burial customs |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref> At Saqqara, Mastaba 3808, dating from the latter part of the 1st Dynasty, was discovered to contain a large, independently-built step-pyramid-like structure enclosed within the outer palace facade mastaba. Archaeological remains and inscriptions suggest there may have been other similar structures dating to this period.<ref>Archaic Egypt, Walter B Emery p144-145</ref>

The first historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed by Egyptologists to the 3rd Dynasty pharaoh [[Djoser]]. Although Egyptologists often credit his vizier [[Imhotep]] as its architect, the dynastic Egyptians themselves, contemporaneously or in numerous later dynastic writings about the character, did not credit him with either designing Djoser's pyramid or the invention of stone architecture.<ref>A History of Ancient Egypt: From the First Farmers to the Great Pyramid, John Romer p294-295</ref> The [[Pyramid of Djoser]] was first built as a square mastaba-like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and was expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers, to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today.<ref>''The Pyramids'', Miroslav Verner p109-124</ref> Egyptologists believe this design served as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens.<ref>Quirke, Stephen (2001). ''The Cult of Ra: Sun Worship in Ancient Egypt''. Thames & Hudson, pp. 118‚Äì120.</ref>

Though other pyramids were attempted in the 3rd Dynasty after Djoser, it was the [[4th Dynasty]], transitioning from the [[step pyramid]] to true pyramid shape, which gave rise to the great pyramids of [[Meidum]], [[Dahshur]], and Giza. The last pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty, [[Shepseskaf]], did not build a pyramid and beginning in the [[5th Dynasty]]; for various reasons, the massive scale and precision of construction decreased significantly leaving these later pyramids smaller, less well-built, and often hastily constructed. By the end of the [[6th Dynasty]], pyramid building had largely ended and it was not until the Middle Kingdom that large pyramids were built again, though instead of stone, [[mudbrick]] was the main construction material.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Old Kingdom of Egypt|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Old_Kingdom_of_Egypt/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

Long after the end of Egypt's own pyramid-building period, a burst of pyramid building occurred in what is present-day [[Sudan]], after much of Egypt came under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which was then based at [[Napata]]. Napatan rule, known as the [[25th Dynasty]], lasted from 750 BCE to 664 BCE, and during that time Egyptian culture made an indelible impression on the Kushites. The Meroitic period of Kushite history, when the kingdom was centered on [[Mero√´]], (approximately in the period between 300 BCE and 300 CE), experienced a full-blown [[Nubian pyramids|pyramid-building revival]], which saw more than two hundred Egyptian-inspired indigenous royal pyramid-tombs constructed in the vicinity of the kingdom's capital cities.

[[Al-Aziz Uthman]] (1171‚Äì1198), the second Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt, tried to destroy the Giza pyramid complex. He gave up after only damaging the [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] because the task proved too large.<ref>Lehner, Mark. ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson (1997), p.41. {{ISBN|0-500-05084-8}}</ref>

== Pyramid symbolism ==
[[File:Great Pyramid Diagram.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram of the interior structures of the Great Pyramid. The inner line indicates the pyramid's present profile, the outer line indicates the original profile.]]

The shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the [[Benben|primordial mound]] from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is also thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the [[Bent Pyramid]] at [[Dahshur]] was ''The Southern Shining Pyramid'', and [[Pyramid of Senusret II|that of Senusret II]] at [[El Lahun]] was ''Senusret Shines''.

While it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them. One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of "resurrection machine."<ref name="Peeters">{{cite book |first=Toby |last=Wilkinson |title=Egypt at its Origins. Studies in Memory of Barbara Adams Proceedings of the International Conference "Origin of the State. Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt", Krakow, 28th August - 1st September 2002 |date=2004 |publisher=Peeters |isbn=978-90-429-1469-8 |page=1142 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z169xREnHQwC&q=pyramids+%22resurrection+machine%22&pg=PA1141 |accessdate=18 June 2015 |chapter=Before the Pyramids |quote=A final echo of earlier practices is seen in the domain established by Djoser to supply his mortuary cult. He called it Hr-sb3-/mti-pt, "Horus, the foremost star in the sky". We could not wish for a clearer statement of the belief underlying the Step Pyramid: that it was a resurrection machine designed to propel its royal owner, Horus, to the pre-eminent place among the undying stars.}}</ref>

The Egyptians believed the [[circumpolar star|dark area]] of the [[night sky]] around which the stars [[diurnal motion|appear to revolve]] was the physical gateway into the heavens. One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards [[celestial pole|the center]] of this part of the sky. This suggests the pyramid may have been designed to serve as a means to magically launch the deceased pharaoh's soul directly into the abode of the gods.<ref name="Peeters"/>

All Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the [[sunset|setting sun]], was associated with the realm of the dead in [[Egyptian mythology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/hiddenhistoryofegypt/feature6.shtml |title=Discovery Channel Nederland |publisher=Discoverychannel.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205175232/http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/hiddenhistoryofegypt/feature6.shtml |archivedate=5 December 2004}}</ref>

== Number and location of pyramids ==
{{mainlist|List of Egyptian pyramids}}

In 1842, [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] produced the first modern list of pyramids ‚Äì now known as the [[Lepsius list of pyramids]] ‚Äì in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. As of November 2008, 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identified.<ref name=reuters1>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |date=11 November 2008 |title=Egypt says has found pyramid built for ancient queen |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-pyramid/egypt-says-has-found-pyramid-built-for-ancient-queen-idUSTRE4AA3ID20081111 |accessdate=2 November 2017 |quote=The pyramid, which Hawass said was the 118th found in Egypt, was uncovered near the world's oldest pyramid at Saqqara, a burial ground for the rulers of ancient Egypt.}}</ref> The location of Pyramid 29, which Lepsius called the "Headless Pyramid", was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands after Lepsius's survey.

Many pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.

The most recent pyramid to be discovered was that of [[Sesheshet]] at [[Saqqara]], mother of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] pharaoh [[Teti]], announced on 11 November 2008.<ref name=shadow/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081111-new-pyramid-egypt.html |title=New Pyramid Found in Egypt: 4,300-Year-Old Queen's Tomb |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

All of Egypt's pyramids, except the small Third Dynasty pyramid at [[Zawyet el-Maiyitin]], are sited on the west bank of the [[Nile]], and most are grouped together in a number of pyramid fields. The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below.

=== Abu Rawash ===
{{Main|Abu Rawash}}
[[File:Abu Rawash Pyramid.jpg|thumb|The largely destroyed [[Pyramid of Djedefre]] ]]

Abu Rawash is the site of Egypt's most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one),<ref name="Ritter2003"/> the mostly ruined [[Pyramid of Djedefre]], son and successor of [[Khufu]]. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the [[Pyramid of Menkaure]], which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.

Its location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying, which began in Roman times, has left little apart from about fifteen courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid's core. A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.

=== Giza ===
{{Main|Giza pyramid complex}}
[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Giza pyramid complex]]]]
[[File:Giza-pyramids.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of the Giza pyramid complex]]

The [[Giza Plateau]] is the location of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Pyramid of Khufu]] (also known as the "Great Pyramid" and the "Pyramid of Cheops"), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as "Queen's pyramids", and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]. Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction ‚Äì it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume.

The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by [[Antipater of Sidon]] as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.

=== Zawyet el-Aryan ===
{{See also|Zawyet el'Aryan}}

This site, halfway between Giza and [[Abusir]], is the location for two unfinished Old Kingdom pyramids. The northern structure's owner is believed to be pharaoh [[Nebka]], while the southern structure, known as the [[Layer Pyramid]], may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh [[Khaba]], a close successor of [[Sekhemkhet]]. If this attribution is correct, Khaba's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid. Today it stands around {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; had it been completed, it is likely to have exceeded {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Abusir ===
{{Main|Abusir}}
[[File:SahurePyramid.jpg|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Sahure]] at Abusir, viewed from the pyramid's causeway]]

There are a total of fourteen pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]]. The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty ‚Äì perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low-quality local limestone.

The three major pyramids are those of [[Pyramid of Niuserre|Niuserre]], which is also the best preserved, [[Pyramid of Neferirkare|Neferirkare Kakai]] and [[Pyramid of Sahure|Sahure]]. The site is also home to the incomplete [[Pyramid of Neferefre]]. Most of the major pyramids at Abusir were built using similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of [[mudbrick]]s with a limestone outer casing. The largest of these Fifth Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and then later transformed into a "true" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry.

=== Saqqara ===
{{Main|Saqqara}}
[[File:Saqqara stepped pyramid.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Djoser]] ]]

Major pyramids located here include the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] ‚Äì generally identified as the world's oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone ‚Äì the [[Pyramid of Userkaf]], the [[Pyramid of Teti]] and the [[Pyramid of Merikare]], dating to the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. Also at Saqqara is the [[Pyramid of Unas]], which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt. Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by [[Khaemweset]], a son of [[Ramesses II]].<ref>[[Kenneth Kitchen]]: ''Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated & Annotated, Translations, Volume II'', Blackwell Publishers, {{ISBN|0-631-18435-X}}, 1996</ref> Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser's successor [[Sekhemkhet]], known as the [[Buried Pyramid]]. Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser's.

South of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of [[Pepi I]], [[Djedkare Isesi]], [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I|Merenre]], [[Pepi II]] and [[Qakare Ibi#Pyramid complex|Ibi]]. Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.

The [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] pharaoh [[Shepseskaf]] either did not share an interest in, or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors. His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex. It is commonly known as the [[Mastabat al-Fir‚Äôaun]].<ref>[http://egyptphoto.ncf.ca/pyramid%20of%20shepseskaf.htm] The Mastaba of Shepseskaf</ref>

A previously unknown pyramid was discovered at north Saqqara in late 2008. Believed to be the tomb of Teti's mother, it currently stands approximately {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, although the original height was closer to {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Dahshur ===
{{Main|Dahshur}}
[[File:Snofru's-Red-Pyramid.jpg|thumb|[[Sneferu|Sneferu's]] [[Red Pyramid]] ]]

This area is arguably the most important pyramid field in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was inaccessible due to its location within a military base and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.

The southern Pyramid of [[Sneferu]], commonly known as the [[Bent Pyramid]], is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a "true" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier [[Meidum|pyramid at Meidum]] had smooth sides in its finished state, but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone. As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success ‚Äì albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look. Several kilometres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last ‚Äì and most successful ‚Äì of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the [[Red Pyramid]] is the world's first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid. The structure is also the third largest pyramid in Egypt, after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza.

Also at Dahshur is one of two pyramids built by [[Amenemhat III]], known as the [[Pyramid of Amenemhat III (Dahshur)|Black Pyramid]], as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids.

=== Mazghuna ===
{{Main|Mazghuna}}

Located to the south of Dahshur, several [[mudbrick]] pyramids were built in this area in the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], perhaps for [[Amenemhat IV]] and [[Sobekneferu]].

[[File:AmenemhetIPyramid.jpg|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Amenemhet I]] at [[Lisht]]]]

=== Lisht ===
{{Main|Lisht}}

Two major pyramids are known to have been built at Lisht: those of [[Amenemhat I]] and his son, [[Senusret I]]. The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids. One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat's cousin, Khaba II.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Allen | first1 = James | author-link = James P.

=== Meidum ===
{{Main|Meidum}}
[[File:02 meidum pyramid.jpg|thumb|The pyramid at [[Meidum]] ]]
The pyramid at [[Meidum]] is one of three constructed during the reign of [[Sneferu]], and is believed by some to have been started by that pharaoh's father and predecessor, [[Huni]]. However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni's name has been found at the site. It was constructed as a [[step pyramid]] and then later converted into the first "true" smooth-sided pyramid, when the steps were filled in and an outer casing added. The pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times. Medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps, although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature, it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.

=== Hawara ===
{{Main|Hawara}}
[[File:pyramid of amenemhet hawarra 01.jpg|right|thumb|The Pyramid of [[Amenemhet III]] at [[Hawara]] ]]

[[Amenemhat III]] was the last powerful ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawara, near the Faiyum, is believed to post-date the so-called "[[Pyramid of Amenemhat III (Dahshur)|Black Pyramid]]" built by the same ruler at Dahshur. It is the Hawara pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place.

=== El Lahun ===
{{Main|El Lahun}}
[[File:El Lahun Pyramid 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pyramid of Senusret II]]. The pyramid's natural limestone core is clearly visible as the yellow stratum at its base.]]

The [[Pyramid of Senusret II]] at [[El Lahun]] is the southernmost royal-tomb pyramid structure in Egypt. Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.

=== El-Kurru ===
{{Main|El-Kurru}}
[[File:Al-Kurru,main pyramid.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piye|Piye's]] pyramid at [[El-Kurru]] ]]

[[Piye]], the king of Kush who became the first ruler of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty]], built a pyramid at El-Kurru. He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.

=== Nuri ===
{{Main|Nuri}}
[[File:Nuri main pyr.northeast.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taharqa|Taharqa's]] pyramid at [[Nuri]] ]]

[[Taharqa]], a Kushite ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, built his pyramid at Nuri. It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).

[[File:Colosse-dj√©houtih√©tep2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Drawing showing transportation of a colossus. The water poured in the path of the sledge, long dismissed by Egyptologists as ritual, but now confirmed as feasible, served to increase the stiffness of the sand, and likely reduced by 50% the force needed to move the statue.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/05/02/the-surprisingly-simple-way-egyptians-moved-massive-pyramid-stones-without-modern-technology/ |title=The surprisingly simple way Egyptians moved massive pyramid stones without modern technology |author=Terrence McCoy |date=2014-05-02 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>]]
Constructing the pyramids involved moving huge quantities of stone. In 2013, papyri discovered at the Egyptian desert near the Red Sea by archaeologist Pierre Tallet revealed the [[Diary of Merer]], an official of Egypt involved in transporting limestone along the Nile River. These papyri reveal processes in the building of the Great Pyramid at Giza, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, just outside modern Cairo.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stille |first1=Alexander |title=The World's Oldest Papyrus and What It Can Tell Us About the Great Pyramids |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ancient-egypt-shipping-mining-farming-economy-pyramids-180956619/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref> 

Rather than overland transport of the limestone used in building the pyramid, there is evidence‚Äîin the Diary of Merer and from preserved remnants of ancient canals and transport boats‚Äîthat limestone blocks were transported along the Nile River.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holloway |first1=April |title=Archaeologists Announce that New Discoveries Solve Mystery of How the Great Pyramid Was Built |url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/archaeologists-announce-new-discoveries-solve-mystery-how-great-pyramid-was-021628 |website=Ancient Origins |accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref> It is possible that quarried blocks were then transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce [[friction]]. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.livescience.com/45285-how-egyptians-moved-pyramid-stones.html|title=Solved!
