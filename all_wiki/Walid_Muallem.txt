===Syrian Civil War===
Early on in the [[Syrian Civil War]], Muallem held frequent press conferences with [[media of Syria|Syrian media]] and Arab outlets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/views/2011/12/03/180564.html|title=Walid Muallem: A mistake or a masterstroke?|newspaper=Al Arabiya|first=Diana|last=Mukkaled|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Muallem gave his first interview with a Western journalist since the start of the civil war,<ref name = "independentint">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/exclusive-we-believe-that-the-usa-is-the-major-player-against-syria-and-the-rest-are-its-instruments-8082457.html|title=Exclusive: 'We believe that the USA is the major player against Syria and the rest are its instruments'|first=Robert|last=Fisk|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> in English, saying that the United States slogan of "fighting international terrorism when ... supporting this terrorism in Syria" and stating the government's position that the United States was "the major player against Syria" as it sought to contain [[Iran]]. He denied the existence of the [[Shabiha]], pro-government, paid militiamen alleged to have committed atrocities early on during the civil war while blaming 60% of Syria's violence on [[Turkey]], [[Qatar]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] "with the United States exercising its influence over all others."<ref name = "independentint"/>

In October 2012, after [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] urged Syria to show compassion in light of the growing humanitarian crisis, Muallem spoke at the [[United Nations]] and blamed the United States, [[France]], Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar for "aid[ing] terror" and "blatant interference" in Syria's affairs, mainly by supplying rebel groups with arms and money calling for Bashar al-Assad to step down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19788780|title=States backing Syria rebels 'aid terror' – Walid Muallem|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/55460-ban-urges-syria-to-show-compassion-to-its-people|title=Ban Urges Syria to Show 'Compassion' to Its People|work=Nahar Net online|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> He called Western concerns over [[chemical weapons]] use "a joke" and a pretext for an [[Iraq War]]-like campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/10/01/241218.html|title=U.S. wants to repeat Iraqi chemical weapons scenario in Syria: Muallem|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> Later that month, Muallem also rejected calls by Ban to declare a unilateral ceasefire, insisting that governments that "finance, train and deliver weapons to the armed groups, notably Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey" be stopped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Oct-10/190885-damascus-rejects-un-chief-call-for-unilateral-ceasefire.ashx|title=Damascus rejects UN chief call for unilateral ceasefire|newspaper=The Daily Star |date=10 October 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, he further blamed United States and [[European Union]] sanctions for the suffering in Syria.<ref name=Naharnet1>{{cite news|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/64749|title=Muallem Says 'Sanctions behind Syrians' Suffering'|newspaper=Naharnet|date=15 December 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

In January 2013, after United Nations and [[Arab League]] envoy [[Lakhdar Brahimi]] said Bashar al-Assad should not take part in a transitional government, Muallem called on opposition groups to join a new cabinet under al-Assad, so long as they "reject foreign intervention."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21106163|title=Syria crisis: Foreign Minister Muallem calls for talks|newspaper=BBC News|date=19 January 2013|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

During his speech during the [[Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] in September 2013, Muallem claimed that [[Foreign fighters in the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars|"terrorists from more than 83 countries"]] are killing Syrian soldiers and civilians and compared the recent events of the [[Syrian Civil War]] to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. In a separate interview with [[BBC]] correspondent [[Jeremy Bowen]], Muallem said that the international peace talks were vital for Syria's future while these talks in Geneva "cannot succeed" while Turks, Saudis and Qataris are helping the rebels.<ref>{{cite web|title='Foreign terrorists' fighting in Syria – Walid Muallem|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24338060|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=30 September 2013}}</ref>

In January 2014, Muallem participated in the [[Geneva II Conference on Syria]] at [[Montreux]].  He described the opposition as traitors and terrorists in his initial speech while accusing a number of states of supporting terrorism and deliberately attempting to destabilize Syria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25836827|title=Syria Geneva II peace talks witness bitter exchanges|date=22 January 2014|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Despite the conference rules permitting only ten minutes to each speaker, Muallem talked for over forty minutes before finishing and repeatedly ignored Ban Ki-moon attempts to conclude his speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/variety/2014/01/22/-It-took-me-12-hours-to-get-here-Syrian-FM-bickers-with-Ban-Ki-moon|title=‘It took me 12 hours to get here!’ Syrian FM bickers with Ban Ki-moon|date=22 January 2014|website=Al Arabiya English}}</ref>

In February 2016, after [[Saudi Arabia]] was planning to send its troops to [[Syria]] in order to fight against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], Muallem warned that any foreign army soldiers who enter [[Syria]] without government consent would "return home in wooden coffins".<ref>{{cite web|title=Syria says any foreign troops would 'return in coffins'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/syria-foreign-troops-return-coffins-160206192130276.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=7 February 2016}}</ref>

Following the [[September 2016 Deir ez-Zor air raid]] which killed up to 100 Syrian soldiers, Muallem said that the Syrian government "holds the United States fully responsible because facts show that it was an intentional attack, and not an error, even if the United States claims otherwise."<ref>{{cite web|title=Syria at UN says confident of military victory|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2016/09/un-assembly-syria-conflict.html|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|date=24 September 2016}}</ref>

From 2012 until his death, he was listed on the [[European Union|EU]] [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|sanction list]]. According to the EU as a government minister, he shared responsibility for the Syrian regime's violent repression of the civilian population.<ref>{{Cite EU regulation|serial=2020/716|date=28 May 2020|description=implementing Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation
