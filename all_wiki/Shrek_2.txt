'''''Shrek 2''''' is a 2004 American [[computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Andrew Adamson]], [[Kelly Asbury]] and [[Conrad Vernon]]. It is the [[sequel]] to 2001's ''[[Shrek]]'' and the second installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' film franchise]]. The film stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Cameron Diaz]], who reprise their respective [[Voice acting|voice roles]] of [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]]. They are joined by new characters voiced by [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[John Cleese]], [[Rupert Everett]], and [[Jennifer Saunders]]. Like its predecessor, ''Shrek 2'' also [[parody film|parodies]] other films based on fairy tales and features references to American popular culture.<ref name="firstpost.com">{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Devansh|title=Remembering Shrek 2: How Kelly Asbury and team played around with the idea of a subversive Disney fairy tale|website=[[Firstpost]]|url=https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/remembering-shrek-2-how-kelly-asbury-and-team-played-around-with-the-idea-of-a-subversive-disney-fairy-tale-8541281.html|date=June 30, 2020|accessdate=August 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name="slashfilm.com">{{cite web|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|title=You May Have Forgotten How Many Movies 'Shrek' Parodied|website=[[Slashfilm]]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/shrek-movie-references-video/|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=August 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name="ew.com">{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Dalton|title=Shrek 2|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/2004/11/05/shrek-2-6/|date=November 5, 2004|accessdate=August 13, 2020}}</ref> ''Shrek 2'' takes place following the events of the first film, with Shrek and Donkey meeting Fiona's parents as her zealous Fairy Godmother, who wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming, plots to destroy Shrek and Fiona's marriage. Shrek and Donkey team up with a swashbuckling cat named [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] to foil her plans.

Development began in 2001, and following disagreements with producers, the screenwriters from the first film were replaced with Adamson. The story was inspired by ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), and new animation tools were utilized to improve the visual appearance of each character, particularly Puss in Boots. The lead actors also received a significant bump in salary to $10&nbsp;million, which at the time was among the highest contracts in their respective careers.

''Shrek 2'' premiered at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]], and it was released in theaters on May 19, 2004. Met with favorable reviews like its predecessor, the film grossed $919.8 million worldwide. It scored the second-largest three-day opening weekend in U.S. history and the largest opening for an animated film at the time of its release.<ref name=Boxofficemojo.com>{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Brandon |title='Shrek 2' Lands Far, Far Ahead of Summer Pack |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1384&p=.htm |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |newspaper=Box Office Mojo |date=May 24, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105203054/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1384&p=.htm |archivedate=November 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Box Office History for Digital Animation Movies |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |work=The Numbers |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/DigitalAnimation.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610000605/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/DigitalAnimation.php |archivedate=June 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It went on to become the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2004]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2004&p=.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |title=2004 DOMESTIC GROSSES |archivedate=April 25, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425035744/http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2004&p=.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Shrek 2'' is also [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s most successful film to date, and it held the title of being the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]] of all time worldwide until ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' surpassed it in 2010.<ref name=EWTS3Highest/> The film received two Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], and its associated [[Shrek 2: The Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] reached the Top 10 on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]].

==Plot==
<!-- 400-700 words only. See WP:FILMPLOT for more details. -->
Newlyweds [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]] return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek refuses to go at first, but Fiona talks him into it, and along with [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.

Harold is reprimanded by the [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]] and her son Prince Charming, as Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for Harold's own happy ending. She implores him to find a way to get rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory by pretending to be representatives of a worker's union and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.

Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man, while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, has already sent Charming to pose as Shrek and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.

To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Man's monster-sized [[gingerbread man]], which breaks through the castle's defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a [[headbutt]]. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother tries to kill Shrek. Harold tries to save Shrek, and his shiny armor reflects the spell back at the Fairy Godmother, disintegrating her into teardrops; however, he is turned back into the [[The Frog Prince|Frog Prince]], his true form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love. Lillian assures Harold that she loves him and not his appearance.

As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well. In the mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had previously romanced Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies, much to his surprise.

The screenwriters for the first film, [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], insisted the film be a traditional fairytale, but after disagreements with the producers, they left the project and were replaced by director [[Andrew Adamson]]. His writing of the film was inspired from ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', with the help of the co-directors for the film, who had spent most of the film's production in [[Northern California]] while Adamson spent most of the time with the voice actors in [[Glendale, California]].<ref name = "George Luca's Blockbusting">{{cite book |author=Alex Ben Block, Lucy Autrey Wilson |title=George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-by-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success |date=March 30, 2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |oclc=310398975 |lccn=2010279574 |isbn=978-0061778896 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/976 976]|url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/976}}</ref>

In an early version of ''Shrek 2'', Shrek abdicated the throne, and called for a fairy tale election. Pinocchio's campaign was the "honesty" campaign, while Gingy's was a "smear" campaign. Director [[Andrew Adamson]] said it was overtly satiric and political, with many funny ideas, but "it was more intellectual than emotional".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=John |title=Shrek: From the Swamp to the Screen |date=2004 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=978-0810943094 |page=163}}</ref>

According to production designer Guillaume Aretos, ''Shrek 2'' appeared to be a lot darker than the original film; "There are a lot of medieval paintings and illustrations that we used quite a bit also. Other than that there are my own influences, which are classical paintings from the 15th and 16th centuries, but those are not as direct. In fact, nothing was absolutely direct. The design of Shrek is always a twist on reality anyway, so we tried to [pack] as much detail and interest as we could in the imagery."<ref>{{cite web |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |date=May 14, 2004 |url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/shrek-2-visual-development-gallery |title=Shrek 2: A Visual Development Gallery |publisher=[[Animation World Network]] |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224193638/http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/shrek-2-visual-development-gallery |archivedate=February 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The film's soundtrack features the song "[[Accidentally in Love]]" by [[Counting Crows]], which the band's singer and songwriter [[Adam Duritz]] believes "fits into the movie because it's the story of people who fall in love who weren't supposed to fall in love." The soundtrack was composed by [[Harry Gregson Williams]].<ref name="George Luca's Blockbusting"/>{{clarify|date=May 2016|reason=This line originally said something about Powell not being available, but soundtrack appears to be credited partly to him.

''Far Far Away Idol'' is a special feature on the DVD and VHS release based on ''[[American Idol]]'' and guest starring [[Simon Cowell]]. Taking place right after ''Shrek 2'' ends, the short features characters from ''Shrek'' compete in a sing-off while being judged by Shrek, Fiona, and Cowell.<ref name=DVDVHS/>

After the performances, on the DVD release, the viewer gets to pick the winner. However, if any character outside of Shrek (along with Princess Fiona), Donkey, or Puss were selected, Cowell would refuse to accept the winner and proclaim himself the victor, leaping onto a table and performing his "own" rendition of "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". At the end of the VHS release, it gives a link to a website where the viewer can vote for their favorite to determine the ultimate winner.<ref name=DVDVHS/> DreamWorks Animation announced on November 8, 2004, three days after the DVD and VHS release, that after over 750,000 votes cast, the winner of the competition was Doris.<ref>{{cite news |title=In a Come From Behind Upset, an Ugly Step-Sister Becomes a Cinderella Story |url=http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=154865 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |newspaper=[[DreamWorks Animation]] |date=November 8, 2004 |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062027/http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=154865|url-status=dead}}</ref>
