==Plot==
<!-- Plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400–700 words. Please see WP: FILM PLOT for more information. -->
In 1968, as an audience of inmates at [[Folsom State Prison]] cheer for [[Johnny Cash]], he waits backstage near a [[table saw]], reminding him of his early life.

In 1944, 12-year-old Johnny is raised on a cotton farm in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], with his brother Jack, father Ray, and mother Carrie. One day, Jack is killed in a sawmill accident while Johnny is out fishing; Ray blames Johnny for Jack’s death, saying that the Devil “took the wrong son”.

In 1950, Johnny enlists in the Air Force and is stationed in [[West Germany]]. He purchases a guitar, and in 1952, finds solace in writing songs, one of which he develops as "[[Folsom Prison Blues]]".

After his discharge, Cash returns to the United States and marries his girlfriend, Vivian Liberto. The couple moves to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where Cash works as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family. He walks past a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play [[gospel music]]. Cash's band auditions for [[Sam Phillips]], the owner of [[Sun Records]]. Phillips signs them after they play "Folsom Prison Blues", and the band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]], alongside fellow rising stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. 

On tour, Johnny meets [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], with whom he falls in love. They become friends, but June gently rebuffs his attempts to woo her. As Johnny’s fame grows, he starts abusing drugs and alcohol.

Over Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to go tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian becomes critical of June's influence. After one performance in [[Las Vegas]], Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, she notices Johnny taking pills, and doubts her choices. At that evening's concert, Johnny, upset by June's apparent rejection, behaves erratically and eventually passes out on stage. June disposes of Johnny's drugs, and begins to write "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", describing her feelings for him and her pain at watching him descend into addiction.

Returning to [[California]], Johnny travels to [[Mexico]] to purchase more drugs and is arrested. Johnny’s marriage to Vivian implodes; they divorce and he moves to [[Nashville]] in 1966. Trying to reconcile with June, Johnny purchases a large house near a lake in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]]. His parents and the extended Carter family arrive for [[Thanksgiving]], at which time Ray and an intoxicated Johnny get into a bitter argument. After the meal, June's mother encourages her daughter to help Cash. He goes into detox and wakes with June; she says they have been given a second chance. They begin a tentative relationship, but June rebuffs his marriage proposals.

Johnny discovers that most of his fan mail is from prisoners. He proposes to skeptical [[Columbia Records]] executives that he will record an [[At Folsom Prison|album live inside Folsom Prison]]. The performance is a success, and Johnny embarks on a tour with June and his band. He later performs "Ring of Fire" on stage. After the song, Cash invites June to a duet and stops in the middle, saying he cannot sing "[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]" any more unless June agrees to marry him. June accepts and they share a passionate embrace on stage. Johnny and his father reconciled their relationship.

==Development and pre-production==
The film has its origins in a [[List of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman episodes#Season 1 (1993)|1993 episode]] of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''.<ref name="nytwax">{{cite web| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/movies/16waxm.html?pagewanted=all | title= The Secrets That Lie Beyond the Ring of Fire| first= Sharon|last= Waxman|author-link= Sharon Waxman| date= October 16, 2005 | work= The New York Times| access-date=2015-02-10}}</ref> That year, Cash was a guest star on the show, where he and June Carter became friends with [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], the star of the show, and Seymour's husband [[James Keach]] who was directing the episode. By the mid-1990s, Cash had asked Keach to make a film of his life; he and Seymour began the process with a series of interviews.<ref name="nytwax"/> In 1997, the interviews had been the basis of a screenplay written by [[Gill Dennis]], with input from Keach; two years later, still lacking any studio interest, Keach contacted [[James Mangold]], who had been "angling to become involved in the project for two years."<ref name="nytwax"/>  Mangold and his wife, producer [[Cathy Konrad]], developed the script for [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]], and by 2001, they had a script they thought they could [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch to a studio]]. Sony and others turned it down, but [[Fox 2000]] agreed to make the film.<ref name="nytwax"/>

The film was in part based on two autobiographies, both of which were [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]]: ''[[Man in Black: His Own Story in His Own Words|Man in Black]]'' (1975) and ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]'' (1997), though the film "burrows deep into painful territory that Mr. Cash barely explored."<ref name="nytwax"/>

Phoenix met Cash months before hearing about the film. When Phoenix read the script, he felt there were at least ten other actors who would be better in the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/walktheline/a/walkline111505.htm |title=Joaquin Phoenix Talks About 'Walk the Line' |access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> All of Cash's vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/17/joaquin.phoenix/|title=Finding the voice, spirit of Johnny Cash|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 8, 2018}}</ref> To prepare for her role as June Carter, Witherspoon studied videos of the singer; she also listened to her singing and telling stories to get her voice right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/walktheline/a/walkline090305.htm |title=Reese Witherspoon Talks About 'Walk the Line' |access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>

The website's critical consensus states, "Superior acting and authentic crooning capture the emotional subtleties of the legend of Johnny Cash with a freshness that is a pleasure to watch".<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/walk_the_line</ref>
[[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>https://www.metacritic.com/movie/walk-the-line</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] praised Witherspoon for her "boundless energy" and predicted her to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Regarding Phoenix, Ebert wrote "Knowing Johnny Cash's albums more or less by heart, I closed my eyes to focus on the soundtrack and decided that, yes, that was the voice of Johnny Cash I was listening to. The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked".<ref name="ebert">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=November 18, 2005|title=Walk the Line|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/walk-the-line-2005|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 18, 2006|title=Ebert's Oscar Predictions (2006)|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals/eberts-oscar-predictions-2006|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref> In her review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Carina Chocano wrote, "Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do first-rate work{{snd}} they sing, they twang, they play new-to-them instruments, they crackle with wit and charisma, and they give off so much sexual heat it's a wonder they don't burst into flames".<ref name="chocano">{{cite news | last=Chocano | first=Carina | title=Walk the Line | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=November 18, 2005 | url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-walk18nov18,0,6996272.story | access-date=2009-01-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616103218/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-walk18nov18,0,6996272.story | archive-date=2008-06-16}}</ref>

[[A. O. Scott]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', had problems with Phoenix's performance: "Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original{{snd}} how could it?{{snd}} he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and he cocks his head to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck in the kind of off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses".<ref>{{cite news | last=Scott | first=A. O. | title=The Man in Black, on Stage and Off | work=The New York Times | date=November 18, 2005 | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/11/18/movies/18walk.html?_r=1 | access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref> In his review for ''Time'', [[Richard Corliss]] wrote, "A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously".<ref>{{cite news | last=Corliss | first=Richard | title=A Phoenix in the Ring of Fire | url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1132428,00.html | work=Time | date=November 18, 2005 | access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref>

[[Andrew Sarris]], in his review for ''[[The New York Observer]]'' praised Witherspoon for her "spine-tingling feistiness", and wrote, "This feat has belatedly placed it (in my mind, at least) among a mere handful of more-than-Oscar-worthy performances this year".<ref>{{cite news | last=Sarris | first=Andrew | title=Funny, Fiftysomething Pierce Returns as ''The Matador'' | work=[[The New York Observer]] | date=January 8, 2006 | url=http://www.observer.com/node/51692 | access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B+" rating and [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote, "while Witherspoon, a fine singer herself, makes Carter immensely likable, a fountain of warmth and cheer, given how sweetly she meshes with Phoenix her romantic reticence isn't really filled in".<ref>{{cite news | last=Gleiberman | first=Owen | title=Walk the Line | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=November 16, 2005 | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1131189,00.html | access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref> ''Baltimore Sun'' reviewer [[Michael Sragow]] wrote, "What Phoenix and Witherspoon accomplish in this movie is transcendent. They act with every bone and inch of flesh and facial plane, and each tone and waver of their voice. They do their own singing with a startling mastery of country music's narrative musicianship".<ref>{{cite news | last=Sragow | first=Michael | title=A ''Walk'' to see and remember | work=Baltimore Sun | date=November 18, 2005}}</ref> In his review for ''[[Sight and Sound]]'', [[Mark Kermode]] wrote, "Standing ovations, too, for Witherspoon, who has perhaps the tougher task of lending depth and darkness to the role of June, whose frighteningly chipper stage act{{snd}} a musical-comedy hybrid{{snd}} constantly courts (but never marries) mockery".<ref>{{cite news | last=Kermode | first=Mark | title=Walk the Line | work=Sight and Sound | date=February 2006 | url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/3138 | access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref>

Some critics found the film too constrained by Hollywood plot formulas of love and loss, ignoring the last twenty years of Cash's life and other more socio-politically controversial reasons he was considered "the man in black".<ref>{{cite web | first=Jayson|last= Harsin | title=Walking the Fine Line | work=Bright Lights Film Journal | url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/52/walk.htm | access-date=2012-04-14}}</ref>

[[Rosanne Cash]] was critical of the film. She was upset "because it had the three most damaging events of [her] childhood: [her] parent's divorce, [her] father's drug addiction, and something else bad that [she] can't remember now". Furthermore, she said, "The movie was painful. The three of them [in the film] were not recognizable to me as my parents in any way. But the scenes were recognizable, and the storyline, so the whole thing was fraught with sadness because they all had just died, and I had this resistance to seeing the screen version of my childhood".<ref>{{cite web | last=Garfield | first=Simon | title=Family ties | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/05/popandrock.johnnycash | date=February 5, 2006 | access-date=March 7, 2018}}</ref>
