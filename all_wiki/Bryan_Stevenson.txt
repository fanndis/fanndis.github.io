'''Bryan Stevenson''' (born November 14, 1959) is an American lawyer, social justice activist, founder/executive director of the [[Equal Justice Initiative]], and a law professor at [[New York University School of Law]]. Based in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Stevenson has challenged bias against the poor and [[minorities]] in the criminal justice system, especially children. He has helped achieve United States Supreme Court decisions that prohibit sentencing children under 18 to death or to life imprisonment without parole.<ref name="TheGuardian2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/i-went-to-death-row-for-28-years-through-no-fault-of-my-own- |title=I went to death row for 28 years through no fault of my own |last=McGreal |first=Chris |date=2018-04-01 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en |access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> Stevenson has assisted in cases that have saved dozens of prisoners from the death penalty, advocated for the poor, and developed community-based reform litigation aimed at improving the administration of criminal justice.

He was depicted in the [[legal drama]] ''[[Just Mercy]]'' which is based on his memoir ''Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,'' which tells the story of [[Walter McMillian]].

He initiated the [[National Memorial for Peace and Justice]] in Montgomery, which honors the names of each of more than 4,000 African Americans [[Lynchings in the United States|lynched]] in the 12 states of the South from 1877 to 1950. He argues that the history of slavery and lynchings has influenced the subsequent high rate of death sentences in the South, where it has been disproportionately applied to minorities. A related museum, [[The Legacy Museum|The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration]], offers interpretations to show the connection between the post-[[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction period]] of lynchings to the high rate of executions and incarceration of people of color in the United States.

In November 2018, Stevenson received the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (American Philosophical Society)|Benjamin Franklin Award]] from the [[American Philosophical Society]] as a "Drum major for justice and mercy."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amphilsoc.org/2018-benjamin-franklin-medal |title=2018 Benjamin Franklin Medal |last=American Philosophical Society |date=2018 |website=www.amphilsoc.org |access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> This is the most prestigious award the society gives for distinguished public service. In 2020, he shared the [[Right Livelihood Award]], widely known as the "Alternative Nobel Prize", with [[Nasrin Sotoudeh]], [[Ales Bialiatski]], and [[Lottie Cunningham Wren]].

==Early life==

Born on November 14, 1959, Stevenson grew up in [[Milton, Delaware]], a small rural town located in southern Delaware.<ref name="NYU">{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.law.nyu.edu/magazine/2007/bryan-stevenson%E2%80%99s-death-defying-acts/ |title=Bryan Stevenson's Death-Defying Acts |last=Barrett |first=Paul |date=2007 |website=NYU Law Magazine |access-date=September 27, 2015}}</ref> His father Howard Carlton Stevenson, Sr., had grown up in Milton, and his mother Alice Gertrude (Golden) Stevenson was born and grew up in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=NYU/> Her family had moved to the city from [[Virginia]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early 20th century.<ref name="Toobin">{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/bryan-stevenson-and-the-legacy-of-lynching |title=The Legacy of Lynching, on Death Row |last=Toobin |first=Jeffrey |date=2016-08-15 |work=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |department=Profiles |publication-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Stevenson has two siblings: an older brother Howard, Jr. and a sister Christy.<ref name="people">{{Cite news |url=https://people.com/archive/bryan-stevenson-vol-44-no-22/ |title=A Stubborn Alabama Lawyer Stands Alone Between Death and His Clients |last=Grant |first=Meg |date=1995-11-27 |work=People |access-date=2019-10-29 |language=en}}</ref>

Both parents commuted to the northern part of the state for work, with Howard, Sr., working at a General Foods processing plant as a laboratory technician<ref name="NYU" /> and Alice as an equal opportunity officer at [[Dover Air Force Base]].<ref name="NYU" /><ref name="Toobin" /> She particularly emphasized the importance of education.<ref name="Toobin" />

Stevenson's family attended the Prospect [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], where as a child, Stevenson played piano and sang in the choir.<ref name="NYU" /> His later views were influenced by the strong faith of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, where churchgoers were celebrated for "standing up after having fallen down".<ref name="NYU" /> These experiences informed his belief that "each person in our society is more than the worst thing they’ve ever done.”<ref name="NYU" />

When Stevenson was 16, his maternal grandfather, Clarence L. Golden, was stabbed to death in his Philadelphia home during a robbery. The killers received life sentences, an outcome Stevenson thought fair. Stevenson said of the murder: "Because my grandfather was older, his murder seemed particularly cruel. But I came from a world where we valued redemption over revenge."<ref name=people/>

As a child, Stevenson dealt with segregation and its legacy. He spent his first classroom years at a "colored" elementary school.<ref name=NYU/> By the time he entered the second grade, his school was formally desegregated, but the old rules from segregation still applied. Black kids played separately from white kids, and at the doctor's or dentist's office, black kids and their parents continued to use the back door, while whites entered through the front.<ref name=NYU/> Pools and other community facilities were informally segregated.<ref name=Toobin/> Stevenson's father, having grown up in the area, took the ingrained racism in stride, but their mother noted that this was not right.<ref name=NYU/> In an interview in 2017, Stevenson recalled how his mother protested the day the black children from town lined up at the back door of the polio vaccination station to receive their shots, waiting hours while the white children went in first.<ref name="The Ezra Klein Show 5/16/2017">{{Cite podcast |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bryan-stevenson-on-why-opposite-poverty-isnt-wealth/id1081584611?i=1000385493360&mt=2 |title=Bryan Stevenson on why the opposite of poverty isn't wealth; it's justice |website=The Ezra Klein Show |publisher=Vox Podcast Media Network |host=Exra Klein |date=2017-05-16 |access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>

== Education ==
Stevenson attended [[Cape Henlopen High School]] and graduated in 1978. He played on the soccer and baseball teams.<ref name=NYU/> He also served as president of the student body and won [[American Legion]] public speaking contests.<ref name=NYU/> His brother, Howard, takes some credit for helping hone Stevenson's rhetorical skills: “We argued the way brothers argue, but these were serious arguments, inspired I guess by our mother and the circumstances of our family growing up.”<ref name=NYU/> Stevenson earned straight A's and won a scholarship to [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]] in [[St. Davids, Pennsylvania|St. Davids]], Pennsylvania.<ref name=people/> On campus, he directed the campus gospel choir.<ref name=NYU/> Stevenson graduated in 1981.<ref name=people/>

Stevenson earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] and a master's degree in Public Policy at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. During law school, as part of a class on race and poverty litigation with [[Elizabeth Bartholet]], he worked for [[Stephen Bright]]'s [[Southern Center for Human Rights]], an organization that represents death-row inmates throughout the South.<ref name=people/> During this work, Stevenson found his career calling.<ref name=people/>

==Career==

===Southern Center for Human Rights===
After graduating from Harvard in 1985, Stevenson moved to [[Atlanta]], and joined the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]] full-time.<ref name=people/> The center divided work by region and Stevenson was assigned to Alabama. In 1989 he was appointed to run the Alabama operation, a resource center and death-penalty defense organization that was funded by Congress.<ref name=Toobin/> He had a center in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], the state capital.

===Equal Justice Initiative===

When the [[United States Congress]] eliminated funding for death-penalty defense, Stevenson converted the center and founded the non-profit [[Equal Justice Initiative]] (EJI) in Montgomery. In 1995, he was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Grant]] and put all the money toward supporting the center.<ref name="Toobin" /> He guaranteed a defense of anyone in Alabama sentenced to the death penalty, as it was the only state that did not provide legal assistance to people on death row.<ref name="ea">{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3465 |title=Equal Justice Initiative |last=Moorer |first=Regina |date=2018-11-28 |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama |publication-date=2013-06-14 |access-date=3 April 2015}}</ref> It also has the highest per capita rate of death penalty sentencing.

One of EJI’s first cases was the [[Post conviction|post-conviction]] appeal of McMillian, who had spent months on death row before being convicted of murder.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=How accurate is 'Just Mercy'? The real case behind Michael B. Jordan's Bryan Stevenson movie|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/01/08/just-mercy-michael-b-jordan-real-case-bryan-stevenson-movie/2836560001/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref> Stevenson was able to discredit every element of the prosecution’s initial case, which led to McMillian being exonerated and released from jail in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|date=1993-03-03|title=Alabama Releases Man Held On Death Row for Six Years|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/us/alabama-releases-man-held-on-death-row-for-six-years.html|access-date=2020-07-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Stevenson has been particularly concerned about overly harsh sentencing of persons convicted of crimes committed as children, under the age of 18.<ref name=TheGuardian2018/> In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' that the death penalty was unconstitutional for persons convicted of crimes committed under the age of 18. Stevenson worked to have the court's thinking about appropriate punishment broadened to related cases applying to children convicted under the age of 17.

EJI mounted a litigation campaign to gain review of cases in which convicted children were sentenced to life-without-parole, including in cases without homicide. In ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' (2012), the US Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that mandatory sentences of life-without-parole for children 17 and under were unconstitutional; their decision has affected statutes in 29 states. In 2016, the court ruled in ''[[Montgomery v. Louisiana]]'' that this decision had to be applied retroactively, potentially affecting the sentences of 2300 people nationwide who had been sentenced to life while still children.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eji.org/children-prison/death-in-prison-sentences |title=Death in Prison Sentences |website=Equal Justice Initiative |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001080454/http://www.eji.org/childrenprison/deathinprison |archive-date=2012-10-01 |access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

By August 2016, EJI has saved 125 men from the death penalty. In addition, it has represented poor people, defended people on appeal and overturned wrongful convictions, and worked to alleviate bias in the criminal justice system.<ref name=Toobin/>

===Acknowledging slavery===

The EJI offices are near the landing at the [[Alabama River]] where slaves were unloaded in the domestic slave trade; an equal distance away is Court Square, "one of the largest slave auction sites in the country."<ref name="Toobin" /> Stevenson has noted that in downtown Montgomery, there were "dozens" of historic markers and numerous monuments related to Confederate history, but nothing acknowledging the history of slavery, on which the wealth of the South was based and for which it fought the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="Toobin" /> He proposed to the state and provided documentation to three slavery sites with historic markers; the [[Alabama Department of Archives and History]] told him that it did not want to "sponsor the markers given the potential for controversy."<ref name="Toobin" /> Stevenson worked with an African-American history group to gain sponsorship for this project; they gained state approval for the three markers in 2013, and these have been installed in Montgomery.

===National Memorial for Peace and Justice===

Stevenson acquired six acres of former public housing land in Montgomery for the development of a new project, the [[National Memorial for Peace and Justice]], to commemorate the nearly 4,000 persons who were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in the South from 1877 to 1950. Many lynchings were conducted openly in front of mobs and crowds in county courthouse squares. Stevenson argues this history of extrajudicial lynchings by white mobs is closely associated with the subsequent high rate of death sentences imposed in Alabama and other southern states, and to their disproportionate application to minority people. He further argues that this history influences the bias against minorities as expressed in disproportionately high mass incarceration rates for them across the country.<ref name=Toobin/> The memorial opened in April 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial |title=The National Memorial for Peace and Justice |website=Equal Justice Initiative}}</ref>

Associated with the Memorial is the [[The Legacy Museum|Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration]], which also opened in April 2018.<ref name="nbc">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/legacy-museum-opens-montgomery-alabama-highlight-slavery-lynchings-n869686 |title=New museum on America's history of lynchings invokes powerful emotions |last=Ortiz |first=Erik |date=2018-04-28 |access-date=2020-01-12 |language=en}}</ref> Exhibits in the former slave warehouse include materials on lynching, racial segregation, and mass incarceration since the late 20th century. Stevenson articulates how the treatment of people of color under the criminal justice system is related to the history of slavery and later treatment of minorities in the South.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://atlantablackstar.com/2016/06/20/social-justice-activist-smashes-myth-that-slavery-ended-in-1865-with-brilliant-examination/ |title=Social Justice Activist Smashes Myth that Slavery Ended in 1865 With Brilliant Examination |last=Riley |first=Ricky |date=2016-06-20 |website=Atlanta Black Star |language=en-US |access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

Stevenson conducts an active public speaking schedule, in large part for fundraising for the work of EJI. His speech at [[TED (conference)|TED2012]] in [[Long Beach, California]] brought him a wide audience on the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/03/01/all-of-our-survival-is-tied-to-the-survival-of-everyone-bryan-stevenson-at-ted2012 |title=All of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone: Bryan Stevenson at TED2012 |last=Lillie |first=Ben |date=2012-03-01 |website=TED Blog |publisher=TED Conferences |access-date=2012-03-06}}</ref> Following his presentation, attendees at the conference contributed more than $1 million to fund a campaign run by Stevenson to end the practice of placing convicted children to serve sentences in adult jails and prisons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/03/05/teds-first-response-to-bryan-stevensons-talk-on-injustice/ |title=TED's first response to Bryan Stevenson's talk on injustice |last=Anderson |first=Chris |date=2012-03-05 |website=TED Blog |publisher=TED Conferences |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> His talk is available on the TED website; by April 2020, it had been viewed more than 6.5 million times.<ref>{{TED talk | bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice | We need to talk about an injustice | Bryan Stevenson }}</ref>
