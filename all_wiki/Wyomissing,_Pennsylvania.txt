==History==

=== 1685 to 1906===
The original inhabitants of Wyomissing are [[Lenape]] (Delaware) Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name ''Wyomissing'' is from the [[Delaware language]], meaning "the land of flats".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref> Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to [[William Penn]] in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.
 
In 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired {{convert|600|acre}}. Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and [[Levi Walter Mengel]] joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the [[Reading Railroad]] just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as "The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.<ref name=Reading>[https://www.readingeagle.com/resources/article/ferdinand-thun-and-henry-k-janssen-were-destined-for-shared-success Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success] 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle</ref> Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills.<ref name=Reading/> This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.
 
In 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. 
 
On July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing.

===1907 to present===
Between 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949-1950 saw the largest annexation, With the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.
 
From that point forward, the borough changed from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called "Woodmill Commons", where DSW Shoes, Old Navy and other businesses now are located.

In 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.

==Economy==
Wyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] and its highway access. The [[Berkshire Mall (Pennsylvania)|Berkshire Mall]] is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 422|422]] and [[U.S. Route 222|222]], providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater [[Philadelphia]] and Berks County region. Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including [[Penn National Gaming]], the second largest [[gambling|gaming]] company in the U.S., [[Boscov's]] Inc., one of the last family-owned department store chains in the U.S., and [[Carpenter Technology Corporation]]. [[UGI Corporation|UGI]] and [[VF Corporation]] have major operations in the borough. [[Sovereign Bank]] was previously headquartered here. Sovereign was acquired by [[Banco Santander|Santander Group]] which maintains its regional office at the same location in the borough. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citibank]] are developing data backup centers using the region's close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].
