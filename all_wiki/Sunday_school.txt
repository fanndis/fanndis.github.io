A '''Sunday school'''  is an [[educational institution]], usually (but not always) [[Christianity|Christian]] in character. 

Sunday school classes usually precede a Sunday [[church service]] and are used to provide [[catechesis]] to Christians, especially children and teenagers, and oftentimes adults as well. Churches of many [[Christian denomination]]s have classrooms attached to the [[church (building)|church]] used for this purpose. Many Sunday school classes operate on a set curriculum, with some teaching attendees a [[catechism]]. Members often receive certificates and awards for participation, as well as attendance. 

Due to the fact that Sunday school classes precede morning worship on the [[Lord's Day]], many provide a light breakfast, such as doughnuts and coffee, except on days in which [[Holy Communion]] is being celebrated due to the fact that many Christian denominations encourage [[fasting#Christianity|fasting]] before receiving the Eucharistic elements.<ref name="Kanel2005">{{cite book |last1=Kanel |first1=Danny Von |title=Building Sunday School by the Owner's Design |date=2005 |publisher=CSS Publishing |isbn=978-0-7880-2353-8 |page=69 |language=en}}</ref>  

Sunday schools were first set up in the 18th century in England to provide education to working children.<ref name="MSS">{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Louanne|title=Macclesfield Sunday School 1796- 1996|publisher=Macclesfield Museums Trust|location=Macclesfield, Cheshire|year=1996|isbn=1-870926-09-9}}</ref> William King <!-- (see memorial in Dursley Tabernacle Church) -->started a Sunday school in 1751 in [[Dursley]], Gloucestershire, and suggested that [[Robert Raikes]] start a similar one in [[Gloucester]]. Raikes was editor of the [[Gloucester Journal]].  He wrote an article in his journal, and as a result many clergymen supported schools, which aimed to teach the youngsters reading, writing, cyphering (doing arithmetic) and a knowledge of the Bible.<ref name=Dav>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Stella|title=History of Macclesfield|publisher=E.J. Morten|location=Didsbury, Manchester and Macclesfield|year=1961|edition=Reprint 1976|isbn=0-85972-034-9|pages=219–225}}</ref>

In 1785, 250,000 English children were attending Sunday school.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> There were 5,000 in [[Manchester]] alone. By 1835, the Society for the Establishment and Promotion of Sunday Schools had distributed 91,915 spelling books, 24,232 New Testaments and 5,360 <!--complete?-->Bibles.<ref name="MSS"/> The Sunday school movement was cross-denominational. Financed through subscription, large buildings were constructed that could host public lectures as well as providing classrooms. Adults would attend the same classes as the [[infant]]s, as each was instructed in basic reading. In some towns,{{which|date=February 2019}} the [[Methodists]] withdrew from the large Sunday school and built their own. The [[Anglican]]s set up their own National schools that would act as Sunday schools and day schools.<ref name="MSS"/> These schools were the precursors to a national system of education.<ref name=Dav/>

The role of the Sunday schools changed with the [[Education Act 1870]]<ref name=Dav/> which provided universal elementary education. In the 1920s they also promoted sports, and ran Sunday School Leagues. They became social centres hosting amateur dramatics and concert parties.<ref name="MSS"/> By the 1960s, the term ''Sunday school'' could refer to the building and rarely to education classes. By the 1970s even the [[Stockport Sunday School|largest Sunday school]] had been demolished. The locution today chiefly refers to catechism classes for children and adults that occur prior to the start of a church service. In certain Christian traditions, in certain grades, for example the second grade or eighth grade, Sunday School classes may prepare youth to undergo a [[rite]] such as [[First Communion]] or [[Confirmation]]. The doctrine of [[Sunday Sabbatarianism]] held by many Christian denominations encourages practices such as Sunday School attendance as it teaches that the entirety of the Lord's Day should be devoted to God; as such many children and teenagers often return to church in the late afternoon for [[Youth ministry|youth group]] before attending an evening service of worship.

In 18th-century England, education was largely reserved for a weathly, male minority and was [[compulsory education|not compulsory]]. The wealthy educated their children privately at home, with hired [[governess]]es or tutors for younger children. The town-based middle class may have sent their sons to [[grammar school]]s, while daughters were left to learn what they could from their mothers or from their fathers' libraries<ref>{{Cite book|title=Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life|publisher=Random House|year=1965|location=USA}}</ref>. The children of factory workers and farm labourers received no formal education, and typically worked alongside their parents six days a week, sometimes for more than 13 hours a day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=When I was a Child|publisher=Churnet Valley Books|year=1903|location=Stafford}}</ref>

By 1785 over 250,000 children throughout England attended schools on Sundays.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  In 1784 many new schools opened, including the interdenominational [[Stockport Sunday School]], which financed and constructed a school for 5,000 scholars in 1805. In the late-19th century this was accepted{{by whom|date=March 2019}} as being the largest in the world.  By 1831 it was reported that attendance at Sunday schools had grown to 1.2 million.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  Robert Raikes's schools were seen{{by whom|date=March 2019}}{{when|date=March 2019}} as the precursors of the English state education system.<ref name=Watson>{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/stream/thefirstfiftyyea00watsuoft/thefirstfiftyyea00watsuoft_djvu.txt|title= Full text of "The first fifty years of the Sunday school"|website= archive.org}}</ref>

The first Sunday school in London opened at [[Surrey Chapel]] under [[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]]. By 1831 1,250,000 children in Great Britain, or about 25 per cent of the eligible population, attended Sunday schools weekly.  The schools provided basic lessons in literacy alongside religious instruction. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Development of the Sunday School Movement in England, 1780-1980|publisher=Christian Education Council|year=1986}}</ref>

In 1833, "for the unification and progress of the work of religious education among the young", the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] founded their Sunday School Association, as "junior partner" to the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]], with which it eventually set up offices at [[Essex Hall]] in [[Central London]].<ref>{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc= chpt. 3}}</ref>

The work of Sunday schools in the industrial cities was increasingly supplemented by "[[ragged schools]]" (charitable provision for the industrial poor), and eventually by publicly funded education under the terms of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]].  Sunday schools continued alongside such increasing educational provision, and new forms also developed such as the [[Socialist Sunday Schools]] movement, which began in the United Kingdom in 1886<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Development of the Sunday School Movement in England, 1780-1980|publisher=Christian Education Council|year=1986}}</ref>

===Ireland===
The earliest recorded Sunday school programme in Ireland goes back to 1777 when Roman Catholic priest Daniel Delany - later (1787)  [[Daniel Delany|Bishop Daniel Delany]] of Kildare and Leighlin - started a school in Tullow, County Carlow.<ref>Matthew, Russell, “Sketches in Irish Biography, No. 28, Dr. Daniel Delany”, ''The Irish Monthly'', Volume 23, 1895.</ref> This was a very sophisticated system which involved timetables, lesson plans, streaming, and various teaching activities.<ref>Rev. Martin Brenan, ''Schools of Kildare and Leighlin, A.D. 1775 - 1835'', M.H. Gill and Son, Ltd, Dublin, 1935.</ref> This system spread to other parishes in the diocese. By 1787 in Tullow alone there were 700 students, boys and girls, men and women, and 80 teachers. The primary intent of this Sunday School system was the teaching of the Catholic faith; the teaching of reading and writing became necessary to assist in this.  With the coming of Catholic Emancipation in Ireland (1829) and the establishment of the [[National Schools]] system (1831), which meant that the Catholic faith could be taught in school, the Catholic Sunday School system became unnecessary.

The [[Church of Ireland]] Sunday School Society was founded in 1809.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sundayschoolsociety.ie/sunday-school-society/|title=About the Sunday School Society}}</ref> The Sabbath School Society of the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] was founded in 1862.<ref>John M Barkley, ''The Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1862 - 1962'' (Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1961).</ref>

The American Sunday school system was first begun by [[Samuel Slater]] in his textile mills in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in the 1790s. Notable 20th-century leaders in the American Sunday School movement include: Clarence Herbert Benson, [[Henrietta Mears]], founder of  Gospel Light,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospellight.com|title=Welcome - Gospel Light|website=www.gospellight.com}}</ref> Dr. Gene A. Getz,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bibleprinciples.org/about-gene/|title=About Gene - Bible Principles}}</ref> [[Howard Hendricks]], Lois E. LeBar, Lawrence O. Richards and [[Elmer Towns]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Philanthropist [[Lewis Miller (philanthropist)|Lewis Miller]] was the inventor of the "[[Akron Plan]]" for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, conceived with Methodist minister [[John Heyl Vincent]] and architect [[Jacob Snyder]].

[[John Heyl Vincent]] collaborating was Baptist layman B. F. Jacobs, who devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the "Uniform Lesson Plan". By the 1800s 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.<ref>"Sunday School Movement", Dictionary of Christianity in America, InterVarsity Press, 1990, p 1147</ref>

In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the [[Chautauqua Institution]] on the shores of [[Chautauqua Lake]], New York.

==Form==
[[File:Saddleback Church Children's Building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saddleback Church]] Children's Building in [[Lake Forest, California]].]]
In [[Evangelical]] churches, during worship service, children and young people receive an adapted education, in Sunday school, in a separate room. <ref> Jeanne Halgren Kilde, ''When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-century America'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2005, p. 159, 170, 188</ref><ref> George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, ''Encyclopedia of Christian Education, Volume 3'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2015, p. 229</ref>

Historically, Sunday schools were held in the afternoons in various communities, and were often staffed by workers from varying denominations. Beginning in the United States in the early 1930s, and Canada in the 1940s, the transition was made to Sunday mornings. Sunday school often takes the form of a one-hour or longer [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] which can occur before, during, or after a [[church service]]. While many Sunday schools are focused on providing instruction for children (especially those sessions occurring during service times), adult Sunday-school classes are also popular and widespread (see [[RCIA]]). In some traditions, the term "Sunday school" is too strongly associated with children, and alternate terms such as "Adult Electives" or "religious education" are used instead of "Adult Sunday school". Some churches only operate Sunday school for children concurrently with the adult worship service. In this case, there is typically no adult Sunday school.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Publishers==
In Great Britain an agency was formed called the [[Religious Tract Society]] which helped provide literature for the Sunday School.
In the United States the [[American Sunday School Union]] was formed (headquartered in Philadelphia) for the publication of literature. This group helped pioneer what became known as the International Sunday School Lessons.  The ''Sunday School Times'' was another periodical they published for the use of Sunday schools.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Little, Ellen|title=Periodicals published by The American Sunday-School Union|publisher=University Library System, University of Pittsburgh|url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/is/enroom/ASSU/assu_per.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204053406/http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/is/enroom/ASSU/assu_per.html|archive-date=4 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[LifeWay Christian Resources]], Herald and Banner Press, [[David C Cook]], and Group Publishing are among the widely available published resources currently used in Sunday schools across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Anderson, Don|title=Choosing Sunday School Curriculum: How Effectively Do You Want to Teach the Bible?|publisher=Faith.edu|url=http://www.faith.edu/resources/publications/faith-pulpit/message/choosing-sunday-school-curriculum-how-effectively-do-you-want-to-teach-the-bible/read|date=11 November 2013}}</ref>

==Teachers==
Sunday school teachers are usually [[Laity|lay people]] who are selected for their role in the church by a designated coordinator, board, or a committee.  Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education. Some Sunday school teachers, however, do have a background in [[education]] as a result of their occupations. Some churches require Sunday school teachers and catechists to attend courses to ensure that they have a sufficient understanding of the faith and of the teaching process to educate others.  Other churches allow volunteers to teach without training; a profession of faith and a desire to teach is all that is required in such cases.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It is also not uncommon for [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] [[pastors]] ([[Minister of religion|church ministers]]) to teach such classes themselves. Some well-known public figures who teach, or have taught, Sunday school include astronaut [[Ron Garan]], comedian [[Stephen Colbert]],<ref>{{Citation
