"'''Work'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] for her eighth studio album, ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'' (2016), featuring Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. The song was released as the lead single on January 27, 2016 through [[Westbury Road Entertainment|Westbury Road]] and [[Roc Nation]]. The song was written by [[PartyNextDoor]], Rihanna, Drake, [[Monte Moir]], [[Sevn Thomas|Rupert "Sevn" Thomas]], Allen Ritter and [[Boi-1da|Matthew Samuels]], and was produced by [[Boi-1da]], Sevn Thomas, Ritter, [[Kuk Harrell]] and [[Noah "40" Shebib]]. The [[dancehall]], [[Reggae fusion|reggae-pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, contains an interpolation of "[[If You Were Here Tonight]]" (1985) performed by [[Alexander O'Neal]]. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of working for money, as well as discussing fragile relationships. The song is in the [[Jamaican Patois]] language and three of its writer-producers: Rupert "Sevn" Thomas, Matthew "Boi-1da" Samuels, and Jahron "PartyNextDoor" Brathwaite, are [[Jamaican Canadians|Jamaican-Canadians]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|website=Billboard |access-date= March 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaicans.com/jamaican-patois-mistaken-for-gibberish-on-rihannas-new-single/|title=American Music Critics Mistake Jamaican Patois for "Gibberish" on Rihanna's New Single|website=Jamaicans Magazine |access-date= March 27, 2018}}</ref>

Critical response to "Work" was mixed upon release; critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to return to her earlier themes of [[Dancehall music|dancehall]] music, while others were more skeptical of the song's potential as a comeback for the singer. Critical opinion improved over time; the song was included on several year-end lists and nominated for two awards at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|59th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]. The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number-one single and making her the act with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart (after [[The Beatles]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Elvis Presley]]). The song remained at the top for nine weeks. The song also peaked at number one in nine additional countries and is [[Music recording certification|certified]] Platinum or higher in thirteen countries, including 7x Platinum in the US and Diamond in France.

The song was accompanied by two music videos, which both premiered on February 22, 2016. The first of the two versions was directed by Rihanna's previous collaborator [[Director X]], while the second was directed by [[Tim Erem]]. The song was further promoted with live performance's at the [[2016 BRIT Awards]] which featured guest appearances from [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[SZA (singer)|SZA]], the [[2016 MTV Video Music Awards]], as well as being performed on the [[Anti World Tour]]. "Work" became the first dancehall song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 since [[Sean Paul]]'s "[[Temperature (song)|Temperature]]" (2006) and was succeeded three weeks later by another dancehall song, Drake's "[[One Dance]]".

==Background and release==
Following the release of Rihanna's seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'', and its accompanying tour, Rihanna took a step back from music.<ref name=nmeinterview>{{cite web|title=NME interview|url=https://www.nme.com/features/rihanna-exclusive-interview-i-break-the-rules-even-when-i-dont-intend-to|website=NME|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>
Rihanna aimed to take a hiatus from recording music stating; "I wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively," Rihanna went on to state that this hiatus lasted a week and she had returned to the recording studio. Following the release of three singles in 2015—"[[FourFiveSeconds]]" (with [[Kanye West]] and [[Paul McCartney]]), "[[Bitch Better Have My Money]]" and "[[American Oxygen]]"—''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' announced that Rihanna was set to premiere a new single on January 27, 2016 at 8 am [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/27/rihanna-work-drake|title=Rihanna drops 'Work,' featuring Drake amid Anti release rumors|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Goodman|first=Jessica|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> That same day, "Work" premiered on several radio stations worldwide including the [[BBC Radio 1]] in the United Kingdom. Subsequently, it was made available for [[Music download|digital download]] in most countries worldwide via the [[iTunes Store]] and was added for streaming on [[Apple Music]], [[Spotify]], and [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10840012/rihanna-drake-work-anti-new-single-listen|title= Listen to Rihanna and Drake's new single 'Work'|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Cox|first=Jamieson|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>  <!--- WRITING CREDITS FROM ITUNES METADATA --->

== Writing and recording ==
"Work" was written by [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Rihanna]], [[Monte Moir]], [[Sevn Thomas|Rupert "Sevn" Thomas]], Allen Ritter and [[Boi-1da|Matthew Samuels]], and was produced by [[Boi-1da]], Sevn Thomas, Ritter, [[Kuk Harrell]] and [[Noah "40" Shebib]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/01/rihanna-drake-work-song-credits|title=Here's Everyone Listed in the Song Credits for Rihanna and Drake's 'Work'|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=Ortiz|first=Edwin|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> In the summer of 2015, Thomas, Ritter, Boi-1da, and Martin Mason, among others, stayed at Drake's house in [[Los Angeles]] for a mid-week period. Thomas described the time spent at the home as a "beat factory, everyone was sitting there working and collaborating with each other."<ref name="complexwriting">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/01/producer-sevn-thomas-details-the-process-of-making-rihanna-and-drakes-new-single-work?sr_share=facebook|title=How a Studio Session at Drake's House in Los Angeles Turned Into Rihanna's Next Big Hit|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=Frydenlund|first=Zach|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

Thomas created a beat which was [[dancehall]]-influenced; he later played it for Boi-1da to which he positively responded, "We're both Jamaican-Canadian. It was just something in our DNA, so it woke him up, and we started remembering all these old dancehall songs from the '90s." Boi-1da came with up idea for sampling an "old school dancehall rhythm" and after that the chords were made with Ritter and past it, "everything went organically". The most recognizable sampling found in the "Work" [[riddim]] is from the 1998 riddim "Sail Away" which was produced by [[Richie Stephens (musician)|Richie Stephens]] and Mikey 2000,<ref name="complexwriting"/> interpolating [[Alexander O'Neal]]'s "[[If You Were Here Tonight]]".
When the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to PartyNextDoor who wrote the lyrics, "he's an incredible writer, and he's Jamaican as well. I think so that's how he's able to come up with those vibes and feels," noted Thomas. After Drake heard the song he loved it and decided to write and record a verse on it. Shortly after Braithwaite stayed at Rihanna's home in Malibu, where he played her the song.<ref name="complexwriting"/>

Rihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar and [[Kuk Harrell]] at the [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles; the latter also served as a vocal producer. Drake's vocals were recorded by Noel Cadastre and [[Noah "40" Shebib]] at the Sandra Gale Studios in California and the SOTA Studios in Toronto. The vocal recording was assisted by Thomas Warren, while additional vocals were provided by PartyNextDoor. Manny Marroquin [[Mixing engineer|mixed]] "Work" at the Larrabee Studios, while Noel "Gadget" Campbell and Shebib did the mixing at the Studio 360 and SOTA Studios in Toronto. The [[Mastering engineer|mastering]] was done by Chris Gehringer at the [[Sterling Sound Studios|Sterling Sound]] in New York City.<ref name="credits"/> "Work" marks the third collaboration between Rihanna and Drake, following "[[What's My Name (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" in 2010 and "[[Take Care (song)|Take Care]]" in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/62844-rihanna-and-drake-team-for-work/|title=Rihanna and Drake Team for 'Work'|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|last=Camp|first=Zoe|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

== Reception ==

"Work" has received mixed reviews from critics. Editor Joe Lynch wrote that the track finds Rihanna "reteaming with frequent collaborator/ex Drake, but that's the only predictable thing about this song—while it's hardly a 180-degree turn for Rih, its minimal production subverts expectations of what you'd expect a major pop star to release when they're gearing up to drop their long-delayed new album."<ref name="billboardreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6858259/drake-rihanna-work|title=Rihanna & Drake Reteam for 'Work'|work=Billboard|date=January 27, 2016|last=Lynch|first=Joe|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> Alexa Camp of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote: "the new track has the potential to at least partly justify the gold crown on the album's cover."<ref name=slantmag/> [[BET]]'s Kathy Iandoli called the song "comfortable, but still good."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Iandoli|first1=Kathy|title=Rihanna And Drake Give Us Some 'Work' off ANTI|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2016/01/27/rihanna-and-drake-give-us-some--work--off--anti-.html|website=[[BET]]|accessdate=January 29, 2016|date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']]'s Brennan Carley thought Rihanna made the "lackadaisical song gel."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spin.com/2016/01/rihanna-drake-work-anti-lead-single-tidal/ | title=Rihanna Just Dropped the Lead 'Anti' Single, 'Work,' Featuring Drake | work=Spin| date=January 27, 2016 | accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> Other critics were more skeptical.

Taj Rani of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' stated "Work" has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music (again), as it became the first dancehall song to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 since Sean Paul's "[[Temperature (song)|Temperature]]" in 2006. She opined that the song is a prime example of "an unapologetic black woman proudly showing her heritage at a time when our politics are dominated by #BlackLivesMatter and Donald Trump's racist, xenophobic and misogynistic tirades." Rani continued to state that although mainstream critics are uncomfortable with Rihanna's use of patois (describing it as "gibberish"), she is able to display West Indian culture front and center without appropriation from mainstream culture.<ref name="Rani">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6889497/rihanna-work-dancehall-essay|title=How Rihanna's 'Work' Made Dancehall Reign in Pop (Again)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Rani|first=Taj|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named "Work" one of the 30 best songs of the first half of 2016: "What would even you call a [[minimalist]] banger? One of America's most reliable singles artists created [[Anti (album)|an arch, moody album]] instead of a handful of chart-ready pop confections, but we still couldn't resist this barely-there tune with a beat like a dancehall wisp and lyrics like a freestyle."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/30-best-songs-of-2016-so-far-20160622|title=30 Best Songs of 2016 So Far|first=Christopher R. |last=Weingarten|publisher=Billboard|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>
[[The Guardian]] named it "Best track of 2016", writing: "Work was off-kilter, lacked a big chorus and weaved in a dubious 80s ballad.

The second video for the single directed by [[Tim Erem]] was discussed between the director, Rihanna and Drake in the studio at 4 a.m., where they were attempting to come up with ideas to add a tropical vibe to their already existing footage. After thirty minutes they came up with the idea of shooting a video in a whole pink room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6889358/director-tim-erem-rihanna-work-video-drake-dj-khaled-interview|title=Rihanna & Drake's 'Work' Video: Director Discusses Original Treatment & DJ Khaled Snapping on Set|publisher=}}</ref>

The first video opens with a shot of "The Real Jerk" carpark, in which Rihanna and Drake enter separately. The shot switches to Rihanna dancing in the nightclub, in front of a mirror. Drake enters the scene in which he raps. The video ends with credits written in a red, green and yellow typeface. The second video is shot in one piece, as it shows Rihanna and Drake in a room full of neon pink lights and styled with sofas and house plants [[aesthetics]].
Hazel Cills of MTV noted Rihanna's and Drake's chemistry as "playful and confrontational", which was "ultimately made for the viewer's pleasure". Cills continued to state that the second video "luxuriates in our voyeurism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2748235/video-voyeurism-rihanna-ciara-and-madonna-dance-4-u/|title=Video Voyeurism: Rihanna, Ciara, And Madonna Dance 4 U|publisher=}}</ref> Christopher Hooton from The Independent also picked upon the videos sense of [[voyeurism]] and compared the second video to Drake's previous single "[[Hotline Bling]]" and [[Nicki Minaj]]'s "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rihanna-and-drake-drop-two-work-music-videos-separated-by-a-buffering-bar-a6891056.html|title=Rihanna and Drake drop two 'Work' music videos separated by a buffering bar|publisher=}}</ref>
