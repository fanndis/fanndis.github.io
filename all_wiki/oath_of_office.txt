An '''oath of office''' is an [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] a person takes before assuming the duties of an [[Public office|office]], usually a position in government or within a religious body, although such oaths are sometimes required of officers of other organizations. Such oaths are often required by the laws of the state, religious body, or other organization before the person may actually exercise the powers of the office or organization. It may be administered at an [[inauguration]], [[coronation]], [[throne|enthronement]], or other ceremony connected with the taking up of office itself, or it may be administered privately.  In some cases it may be administered privately and then repeated during a public ceremony.

Some oaths of office are statements of allegiance and loyalty to a [[constitution]] or other legal text or to a person or office-holder (e.g., an oath to support the constitution of the state, or of loyalty to the king) (see [[Oath of allegiance]]). Under the laws of a state, it may be considered [[treason]] or a [[High crimes and misdemeanours|high crime]] to betray a sworn oath of office.

The word 'oath' and the phrase 'I swear' refer to a solemn vow. For those who choose not to, the alternative terms 'solemn promise' and 'I promise' are sometimes used.

Depending on the oath's interpretation, the following translation is also possible:

{{quote|I swear to serve loyally the Federal Republic of Germany and to defend bravely the justice and the freedom of the German people. So help me God{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

In both of the above, conscripts say "vow" instead of "swear", and the religious affirmation is not added for conscripts since the vow is not an actual oath.

==Indonesia==
===President and Vice President===
Based on the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia Article 9 about the Oath of Office and Promise of the [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]]:

Before assuming office, the President and the Vice-President shall take the oath of office according to their religions, or solemnly promise before the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR) or the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) session as follows:

The President's/Vice-President's Oath of Office (for Muslims):

{{quote|In the name of Allah, I swear that I will perform the duties of the President (''or'' Vice-President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my ability and as justly as possible, and that I will strictly observe the Constitution and consistently implement the law and regulations in the service of the country and the people.}}

The President's/Vice-President's Promise:

{{quote|I solemnly promise that I will perform the duties of the President (''or'' Vice-President) of the Republic of Indonesia to the best of my ability and as justly as possible, and that I will strictly observe the constitution and consistently implement the law and regulations in the service of the country and the people.<ref>''Indonesian Constitutional Reform, 1999-2002: An Evaluation of Constitution-making in Transition'' {{ISBN|978-9-79709-394-5}} p. 439</ref>}}

In case any sessions can not be held, like one in 1998 when the protesters took control of the parliament building, the oath can be performed before the MPR chairperson and vice chairpersons, as well as the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia|Chief Justice]] and his/her deputies with presence of the chairperson of every chambers.

===Cabinet members and Presidential Work Units (UKP)===
{{quote|In the name of Allah (for Muslims) ''or'' Om Atah Paramawisesa (for Hindus) ''or'' In the name of [[Sanghyang Adi Buddha]] (for Buddhists) I swear (''or'' in the name of God I promise (for Protestants and Catholics)) that I will be faithful to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]], and will execute any laws consistently for my service to the nation and the country. That I, when executing the duties of this office, will highly honor office ethics, perform to the best of my ability, and with full responsibility. That I will maintain my integrity, never abuse my power, and avert myself from despicable actions. (''for Christians and Catholics:'' So help me God.) (''for Hindus'': Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Om.) (''for Buddhists:'' Sadhu Sadhu Sadhu.)}}

In the past, between the pronunciation of God according to each religions and "so help me God" expression, the oath will be like this (note that before the second and third sentence, they will be started with "I swear", regardless of the religions): 
{{quote|that I, being appointed to this office, directly or indirectly, by any name or excuse, will not grant or promise or give something to anyone. That I, for doing or not doing something, will never receive from anyone, directly or indirectly, any promise or givings. That I, will be faithful to the Constitution and will preserve any laws and rulings that valid for the state of the Republic of Indonesia. That I, with all my strength, will seek the welfare of the Republic of Indonesia. That I will be faithful to the people and the country, and will fulfill any obligations that were passed on me because of this office. That I will execute the duties and obligations with full responsibility to the people and the country.}}

To refer the god in Hindu, the oath used to use sentence "In the name of [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi]]", and later "Om Swastiastu". There was also a time when Christian and Catholic ministers said "I swear" instead of promise at the beginning of the oath, did not mention any reference to God. The verses "to seek the welfare" was removed since it reflected the dictatorial [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order era]].

=== Armed Forces/Police oath of commissioning/enlistment===
For officers:

{{quote|In the name of Allah (for Muslims) ''or'' Om Atah Paramawisesa (for Hindus) ''or'' In the name of [[Sanghyang Adi Buddha]] (for Buddhists) I swear (''or'' in the name of God I promise (for Protestants and Catholics)) that with the best of my ability for the unitary nation and people of Indonesia, living the spirit of Pancasila and in obedience to the 1945 Constitution, serve the duties of an officer of the National Armed Forces/National Police. That I will uphold the dignity and honor of an officer and thus remain faithful to (''for officers of the National Armed Forces'':the Armed Forces Pledge and our Oath of Service.) (''for officers of the National Police'': the Police Pledge and our Constables' Oath.) That I thus will be responsible for my subordinates by becoming an example, building morale and confidence, and making right and honest decisions, and that I will, for the sake of the nation and people, will be prepared to sacrfice my body and spirit. (''for Christians and Catholics:'' So help me God.) (''for Hindus'': Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Om.) (''for Buddhists:'' Sadhu Sadhu Sadhu.)}}

For enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces and new cadets to the military academies and the Army Officer Candidate School:

{{quote|In the name of Allah (for Muslims) ''or'' Om Atah Paramawisesa (for Hindus) ''or'' In the name of [[Sanghyang Adi Buddha]] (for Buddhists) I swear (''or'' in the name of God I promise (for Protestants and Catholics)) that with the best of my ability serve with loyalty the unitary nation and people of Indonesia on the basis of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. That I will be faithful to the laws and regulations placed upon me and to uphold military discipline. That I will do my best to obey any orders issued by our superiors.  That I thus, to the nation and the National Armed Forces, will carry out all obligations with full responsibility. And that I will as long as I can do maintain the secrecy of the National Armed Forces. (''for Christians and Catholics:'' So help me God.) (''for Hindus'': Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Om.)

==United Kingdom==

===Oaths taken by the monarch===
In the United Kingdom, no formal oath is essential to be taken by the monarch in relation to his or her accession. He or she is, however, required to take an oath regarding the security of the Church of Scotland. At a coronation, the monarch usually takes an oath but as a coronation is inessential, Monarchs need not take a similar oath in order to discharge their duties, as with the case of Edward VIII. The exact wording of the coronation oath of various monarchs has altered throughout the years without statutory authority but remain based on the oath as prescribed by the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]].

====Coronation Oath====
The following was the oath taken by Queen Elizabeth II at her coronation on 2 June 1953:

Queen: I solemnly promise so to do.

Archbishop: Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?

Queen: I will.

Archbishop: Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel? Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the United Kingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law? Will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in England? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of England, and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them?

Queen: All this I promise to do.

Then the Queen arising out of her Chair, supported as before, the Sword of State being carried before her, shall go to the Altar, and make her solemn Oath in the sight of all the people to observe the premisses: laying her right hand upon the Holy Gospel in the great Bible (which was before carried in the procession and is now brought from the Altar by the Arch-bishop, and tendered to her as she kneels upon the steps), and saying these words:

The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep.

{{quote|You do swear by Almighty God to be a true and faithful Servant unto the Queen's Majesty, as one of Her Majesty's Privy Council. You will not know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against Her Majesty's Person, Honour, Crown, or Dignity Royal, but you will lett and withstand the same to the uttermost of your Power, and either cause it to be revealed to Her Majesty Herself, or to such of Her Privy Council as shall advertise Her Majesty of the same.

==United States==

===History of the oath===
While the oath-taking dates back to the First Congress in 1789, the current oath is a product of the 1860s, drafted by [[American Civil War|Civil War]]–era members of Congress intent on ensnaring traitors.

In 1789, the [[1st United States Congress]] created an oath to fulfill the requirement of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the [[United States Constitution]]:

{{quote|I, A. B. do solemnly swear or affirm (as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=146 Chap. I. 1 Stat. 23] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.</ref>}} It also passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which established an additional oath taken by federal judges:

{{quote|I do solemnly swear (or affirm), that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me, according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the Constitution, and laws of the United States. [So help me God.]}}

The outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] quickly transformed the routine act of oath-taking into one of enormous significance. In April 1861, a time of uncertain and shifting loyalties, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ordered all federal civilian employees within the executive branch to take an expanded oath. When Congress convened for a brief emergency session in July, members echoed the president's action by enacting legislation requiring employees to take the expanded oath in support of the Union. This oath is the earliest direct predecessor of the modern version of the oath.

When Congress returned for its regular session in December 1861, members who believed that the Union had as much to fear from northern traitors as southern soldiers again revised the oath, adding a new first section known as the "Ironclad Test Oath". The war-inspired Test Oath, signed into law on July 2, 1862, required "every person elected or appointed to any office ... under the Government of the United States ... excepting the President of the United States" to swear or affirm that they had never previously engaged in criminal or disloyal conduct.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=012/llsl012.db&recNum=533 Chap. CXXVIII. 12 Stat. 502] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.</ref> Those government employees who failed to take the 1862 Test Oath would not receive a salary; those who swore falsely would be prosecuted for [[perjury]] and forever denied federal employment.

The Iron Clad oath signed into law under President Johnson's term as mandatory for members of Congress as well as federal employees.

<blockquote>I, A.B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily borne arms against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel or encouragement to person engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have neither sought not accepted nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in hostility to the United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government, authority, power, or constitution within the United States, hostile or inimical thereto. And I do further swear (or affirm) that, to the best of my knowledge and ability, I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.<ref>https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=012/llsl012.db&recNum=533</ref></blockquote>

The 1862 oath's second section incorporated a different rendering of the hastily drafted 1861 oath. Although Congress did not extend coverage of the Ironclad Test Oath to its own members, many took it voluntarily. Angered by those who refused this symbolic act during a wartime crisis, and determined to prevent the eventual return of prewar southern leaders to positions of power in the national government, congressional hard-liners eventually succeeded by 1864 in making the Test Oath mandatory for all members.

The Senate then revised its rules to require that members not only take the Test Oath orally, but also that they "subscribe" to it by signing a printed copy. This condition reflected a wartime practice in which military and civilian authorities required anyone wishing to do business with the federal government to sign a copy of the Test Oath. The current practice of newly sworn senators signing individual pages in an oath book dates from this period.

As tensions cooled during the decade following the Civil War, Congress enacted [[Public and private bills|private legislation]] permitting particular former Confederates to take only the second section of the 1862 oath. An 1868 public law prescribed this alternative oath for "any person who has participated in the late rebellion, and from whom all legal disabilities arising therefrom have been removed by act of Congress."<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=118 Chap. CXXXIX. 15 Stat. 85] from [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/ "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875"]. [[Library of Congress]], [[Law Library of Congress]]. Retrieved March 24, 2012.</ref> Northerners immediately pointed to the new law's unfair double standard that required loyal Unionists to take the Test Oath's harsh first section while permitting ex-Confederates to ignore it. In 1884, a new generation of lawmakers quietly repealed the first section of the Test Oath, leaving intact the current affirmation of constitutional allegiance.

===Federal executive and legislative branch oaths===
In the [[United States]], the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] for the [[President of the United States|President]] is specified in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] ([[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Article II, Section 1]]):

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.<ref>[http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A2Sec1 Article II - The Executive Branch: Section 1 - The President], The Constitution of the United States.</ref>}}

The oath may be sworn or affirmed (in which case it is called an ''affirmation'' instead of ''oath''). Although not present in the text of the Constitution, it is customary for modern presidents to say "So help me God" after the end of the oath. For officers other than the President, the expression "So help me God" is explicitly prescribed, but the Judiciary Act of 1789 also explains when it can be omitted (specifically for oaths taken by court clerks): "Which words, so help me God, shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath."<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/judiciary_1789.htm Judiciary Act of 1789], Sec. 7. Retrieved 2009-01-24.</ref>

The Constitution (Article VI, clause 3) also specifies:
{{quote|The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.}}

At the start of each new [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], in January of every odd-numbered year, newly elected or re-elected Members of Congress – the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate – must recite an oath:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. [So help me God.]<ref name=usc5.3331 />}}

This oath is also taken by the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], members of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], federal judges and all other civil and military officers and federal employees other than the President.

===Federal judiciary oaths===
In the United States, [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] are required to take two oaths. The first oath is this:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as (office) under the Constitution and laws of the United States. [So help me God.]<ref name=usc28.453>{{usc|28|453}}, ''Oaths of justices and judges''</ref>}}

The second is the same oath that all other officers of the United States (save the President) take:

{{quote|I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. [So help me God.]<ref name=usc5.3331>{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office''</ref>}}

Federal statute specifically says that the latter oath "does not affect other oaths required by law."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{usc|5|3331}}, ''Oath of Office''.</ref>

===Military oaths – federal and state===
{{See|United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office}}

The military oath is the same as the one taken by members of the Congress, judicial officers, and all other officers except for the President. Members of the [[United States National Guard]], however, take an additional oath as well.

===State and local oaths===
The oaths of state and local officials are largely patterned on the federal oath of constitutional allegiance. Typical would be the oath taken by all New York government officials:

{{quote|I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of New York, (and the Charter of the City of New York, e.g.), and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of (mayor of the City of New York, e.g.) to the best of my ability.<ref>[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm New York State Constitution, Article 8 Section 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110017/http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm |date=2010-07-23 }}</ref>}} (''So help me God'' is traditionally added.)

====Tennessee (county offices)====
All elected county officials and the appointed officers such as clerk and master, and deputies to these officers, are required to take an oath of office which actually consists of two oaths: the
constitutional oath, and an oath for the particular office or fidelity oath (Tenn. Const. Art. X, Sec. 1).  The following is combination fidelity and constitutional oath:

{{quote|I do solemnly swear that I will perform with fidelity the duties of the office to which I have been elected, and which I am about to assume.  I do solemnly swear to support the constitutions of Tennessee and the United States and to faithfully perform the duties of the office of ____________  for ____________  County, Tennessee.<ref name="tennessee oaths">[http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu/public/web/ctas.nsf/EntriesWeb/8900D65183E0B278862570F200540438/$FILE/OATHS2006.pdf OATHS OF OFFICE (2006)], [http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu County technical Assistance Servise], [[University of Tennessee]]</ref>}}

The simple constitutional oath and fidelity oath are taken by persons who do not have a more specific oath prescribed by law (T.C.A. § 8-18-111). This basic oath is used upon entering the following offices:

* County Executive/Mayor
* County Clerk (or deputy county clerk by substituting the word "appointed" for "elected")
* County Register (or deputy register by substituting the word "appointed" for "elected")
* Chief administrative officer of the county highway department

County commissioners may use the same basic oath as noted above, but phrased as follows:

{{quote|I do solemnly swear that I will perform with fidelity the duties of the office to which I have been elected, and which I am about to assume.  I do solemnly swear to support
the constitutions of Tennessee and the United States and to faithfully perform the duties of the office of county commissioner representing the ____________ district of ____________  County, Tennessee.<ref name="tennessee oaths" />}}

Clerks of court, deputy clerks of court, sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, assessors of property and deputy assessors, constables with law enforcement powers, constables without law enforcement powers, general sessions court judges, and school board members in Tennessee all have specific variations of their oaths of office.<ref name="tennessee oaths" />

== Venezuela ==
The [[President of Venezuela]], upon assumption of the office on his inauguration, is asked by the President of the National Assembly (until 1999, the Senate President, on behalf of the entire National Federal Congress), holding a copy of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]], the following:

{{quote|Before God and the Fatherland, Do you swear therefore to perform the duties of the position of Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and in the performance of your duties fulfill the Constitution and laws of the Republic?}}

With the right hand on the shoulder level he answers with a "Yes I swear" and the President then responds: "If you do so, before God and the Fatherland your duties will be performed, and it will be demanded of you if you not. Therefore, in the name of the Republic and by the authority of the law, I investiture you as Constitutional President of the Republic as of this moment for this term period." Then the Presidential Sash (with the colors and coat of arms from the [[Flag of Venezuela]] and the collar of the Order of the Liberatiors is turned over to him from the outgoing President, but if the case is that of succession due to death of office of his predecessor both items are cased and are given to him by the National Assembly President instead. If reelected the method is the same as after the sudden death of the President while in office.

== Catholic Church==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] requires all of its [[Holy Orders|clergy]] before ordination and most of those promoted to positions of authority to make a "Profession of Faith," as below. It is very similar to the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]] (referred to as the Symbol of Faith).

{{quote|I, (name), with firm [[faith]] believe and profess everything that is contained in the Symbol of Faith: namely:

I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, one in Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our [[salvation]], he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look forward to resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. [[Amen]].

With firm faith, I also believe everything contained in the Word of God, whether written or handed down in Tradition, which the Church, either by a solemn judgement or by the ordinary and universal Magisterium, sets forth to be believed as divinely revealed.

I also firmly accept and hold each and everything definitively proposed by the Church regarding teaching on faith and morals.

Moreover, I adhere with religious submission of will and intellect to the teachings which either the [[Roman Pontiff|Roman pontiff]] or the [[College of Bishops]] enunciate when they exercise their authentic Magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim these teachings by a definitive act.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}

Further, all of those promoted to positions of authority (vicars general, judicial vicars, episcopal vicars, pastors of parishes and superiors within religious orders) or with teaching responsibilities (rectors of seminaries, professors at seminaries, heads or Catholic universities or professors on the faculties of Catholic colleges and universities who teach subjects involving religion), and all those ordained deacons (and therefore all those who will also later be ordained priests) to take the following "Oath of Fidelity"

{{quote|I, (name), in assuming the office of (office), promise that in my words and in my actions I shall always preserve [[Full communion|communion with the Catholic Church]].

With great care and fidelity I shall carry out the duties incumbent on me toward the Church, both universal and particular, in which, according to the provisions of the law, I have been called to exercise my service.

In fulfilling the charge entrusted to me in the name of the Church, I shall hold fast to the deposit of faith in its entirety; I shall faithfully hand it on and explain it, and I shall avoid any teachings contrary to it.

I shall follow and foster the common discipline of the entire Church and I shall maintain the observance of all [[Canon law|ecclesiastical laws]], especially those contained in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]].

With Christian obedience I shall follow what the Bishops, as authentic [[Doctor of the Church|doctors]] and [[Church Fathers|teachers of the faith]], declare, or what they, as those who govern the Church, establish.

I shall also faithfully assist the diocesan Bishops, so that the apostolic activity, exercised in the name and by mandate of the Church, may be carried out in communion with the Church.

So help me God, and God's Holy Gospels on which I place my hand.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}}}
