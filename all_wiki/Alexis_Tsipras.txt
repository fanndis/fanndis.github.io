{{Alexis Tsipras sidebar}}
'''Alexis Tsipras''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξης Τσίπρας}}, {{IPA-el|aˈleksis ˈt͡sipras|pron}}; born 28 July 1974) is a Greek politician serving as [[Leader of the Opposition (Greece)|Leader of the Majority Opposition]] since 2019. The leader of left-wing party [[Syriza]] since 2009, he served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 2015 to 2019.<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news|title=What You Need To Know About Alexis Tsipras, The Greek Leader Who Wants To Change Europe|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/alex-tsipras-profile_n_6547474.html|work=HuffPost| date=26 January 2015}}</ref>

Tsipras has been Leader of the Coalition of the Radical Left ([[Syriza]]), a [[left wing]] [[List of political parties in Greece|political party]], since 2009. He was the fourth Greek Prime Minister who has governed in the course of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|2010s government-debt crisis]]. Originally an outspoken critic of the austerity policies implemented during the crisis, his tenure in office was marked by an intense austerity policy, mostly in the context of the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third EU bailout to Greece]] (2015–2018).

Tsipras was born in [[Athens]] in 1974. He joined the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] in the late 1980s and in the 1990s was politically active in student protests against education reform plans, becoming the movement's spokesperson. He studied civil engineering at the [[National Technical University of Athens]], graduating in 2000, later undertaking post-graduate studies in urban and regional planning. He worked as a civil engineer in the construction industry, based primarily in Athens.

From 1999 to 2003, Tsipras served as the secretary of [[Synaspismos Youth]]. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee of [[Synaspismos]] in 2004 and later the Political Secretariat. In the 2006 local election, he ran as [[Syriza]]'s candidate for [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]], winning 10.5%. In 2008, he was elected as Leader of Syriza, succeeding [[Alekos Alavanos]]. He was first elected to the [[Hellenic Parliament]] representing [[Athens A]] in the 2009 election and was re-elected in May and June 2012, subsequently becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (Greece)|Leader of the Opposition]] and appointing his own shadow cabinet.

In January 2015, Tsipras led Syriza to victory in a [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|snap legislative election]], winning 149 out of 300 seats in the Hellenic Parliament and forming a coalition with the [[Independent Greeks]]. On 20 August 2015, seven months into his term as prime minister he lost his majority after intraparty defections, announced his resignation, and called for a snap election to take place the following month. In the [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|September 2015 election]] that followed, Tsipras led Syriza to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks. During his premiership, he has overseen negotiations regarding the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], initiated the [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|Greek bailout referendum]] and responded to the [[European migrant crisis]]. In 2015, he was named by [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] globally.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://time.com/3823031/alexis-tsipras-2015-time-100/|title = Time 100 - Alexis Tsipras, by Pablo Iglesias - time.com|date = 16 April 2015|website = Alexis Tsipras {{!}} TIME}}</ref>

As Prime Minister of Greece, the opposition parties have accused Tsipras among other things of having capitulated to enacting increasingly harsh austerity measures to keep his country on the surface in contrast with his pre-election promises and also of having exacerbated problems that already existed in the Greek economy, with the country having lost about 25% of its GDP since the start of the crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2017/05/23/eidiseis-diethnes-politiki-o-tsipras--sti-lista-me-tous-pente-ligotero-dimofileis-arxigous-meta-ton-trump_n_16762864.html|title=Τime: O Tσίπρας στη λίστα με τους πέντε λιγότερο δημοφιλείς αρχηγούς, μετά τον Τραμπ|date=23 May 2017|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref>

==Early life and career==

Tsipras joined the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, as a student at [[Ambelokipi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]] Multi-disciplinary High School, he was politically active in the student uprising and the school occupations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-greek-prime-minister-alexis-tsipras-2015-7|title=How Greece's prime minister rose from high school activist to high politics|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref> against the controversial law of [[Minister for Education (Greece)|Education Minister]] Vasilis Kontogiannopoulos. He rose to prominence as a representative of the student movement when he was featured as a guest on a television show hosted by journalist Anna Panagiotarea. During the interview, Panagiotarea implied that Tsipras was being disingenuous in defending middle and high school students' right to [[absenteeism]] without parental notification in the context of protests.<ref name="CV syn.gr"/> Newspapers and opposition politicians contrasted his early activism for the free state education to his choice to enroll his children in private schools when he became prime-minister.<ref>[http://en.protothema.gr/tsipras-exploits-his-state-school-education-but-chooses-elitism-for-sons-pics/ "Tsipras exploits his state school education but chooses elitism for sons (pics)", ''Proto Thema'', Sep, 14 2015]</ref><ref>[https://www.eleftherostypos.gr/politiki/39399-aphonos-o-tsipras-stin-omilia-mitsotaki-sti-vouli-gia-tin-paideia/ "Άφωνος ο Τσίπρας στην ομιλία Μητσοτάκη στη Βουλή για την Παιδεία" (Speechless Tsipras during Mitsotakis' talk in the Parliament on education), Elefteros Typos, 28/09/16.] In Greek language.</ref>

Tsipras studied civil engineering at the [[National Technical University of Athens]], graduating in 2000, before undertaking postgraduate studies in [[Urban and Regional Planning]] following an inter-departmental MPhil at the School of Architecture of NTUA. Alongside his postgraduate studies, he began working as a civil engineer in the [[construction industry]]. He wrote three studies and projects on the theme of the city of Athens.<ref name="CV syn.gr">{{cite web|url=http://www.syn.gr/en/tsipras_alexis.htm |title=Alexis Tsipras |work=[[Synaspismos]] |publisher=syn.gr |accessdate=22 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612152851/http://www.syn.gr/en/tsipras_alexis.htm |archivedate=12 June 2011 }}</ref><ref name="studies-career syn.gr">{{cite web|script-title=el:Σχόλιο Γραφείου Τύπου του ΣΥΝ για τις προσωπικές επιθέσεις εναντίον του Προέδρου του ΣΥΝ – Επισύναψη επιστολών |url=http://www.syn.gr/gr/keimeno.php?id=12438|publisher=syn.gr|accessdate=16 October 2010|language=Greek|date=21 November 2008}}</ref><ref name="cv greek (studies-projects)">{{cite web|script-title=el:Αλέξης Τσίπρας |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&id=89175|publisher=enet.gr|accessdate=16 October 2010|language=Greek|date=9 October 2009}}</ref>

As a university student, Tsipras joined the ranks of the renascent left-wing movement, particularly the "Enceladus" ({{lang-el|links=no|Εγκέλαδος}}) group, and as member of it, he was elected to the executive board of the [[students' union]] of the Civil Engineering School of [[NTUA]] and also served as student representative on the University Senate. From 1995 to 1997 he was an elected member of the Central Council of the National Students Union of Greece (EFEE).<ref name="CV syn.gr"/>

==Political career, 1999–2015==

[[File:Alexis Tsipras3.jpg|thumb|200px|Tsipras in [[Bologna]] giving a speech for [[The Other Europe]] (L'Altra Europa) Alliance in 2014]]

After the departure of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] from [[Synaspismos]] in 1991, Tsipras remained in the coalition. In May 1999 he became the first political secretary of ''Synaspismos''' youth-wing, the [[Synaspismos Youth]]. During this period he was described as a centrist, different from the very clear radical, left-wing profile he would later maintain as leader of Synaspismos. He won many awards during this time. In November 2003, he was succeeded by Tasos Koronakis and moved on to the mother party. He managed quite efficiently to maintain a strong adherence to the policy of the party, effectively out talking both the left and right political wings. As secretary of Synaspismos Youth, he took an active part in the process of creating the ''Greek Social Forum'' and attended many of the international protests and marches against [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]]. In December 2004, at the 4th Congress of Synaspismos, he was elected a member of the party's Central Political Committee and consequently to the Political Secretariat, where he was responsible for educational and youth issues.<ref name="CV syn.gr"/>

Tsipras first entered the limelight of mainstream Greek politics during the [[2006 Greek local elections|2006 local election]] when he ran for [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]] under the "Anoikhti Poli" (Greek: Ανοιχτή Πόλη, "Open City") [[Syriza]] ticket that gained 10.51% of the Athenian vote, finishing third overall. Tsipras won a seat on the [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Municipality of Athens]] council by virtue of him being first on the Syriza [[Electoral list|list]].<ref name="CV syn.gr" /><ref name="ANA-MPA candidate">{{cite news|url=http://www.ana.gr/anaweb/user/showplain?maindoc=3561435&maindocimg=3486542&service=102|title=Coalition selects A.

[[File:SYN 5th Congress.jpg|thumb|Alexis Tsipras giving his speech as a presidential candidate at the 5th Congress of Synaspismos.]]

In December 2013, Tsipras was the first candidate proposed for the position of president of the Commission of the [[European Union]] by the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL). The vote was an [[European Union|EU]] member states election to the European Parliament in May 2014.

Tsipras campaigned as the only candidate of the south periphery countries. At the beginning of May 2014, in a speech in [[Berlin]], he clarified many of his positions, in opposition to the allegedly [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]]-dominated neoliberal political course in Europe. Tsipras declared a substantial change for a better future for all Europeans is visible within 10 years. He addressed those who lost out in the fallout of the financial crises from 2008 to 2014, which produced unexpectedly high jobless rates in most of the EU. The speech was given in English to a German audience and intended to be listened to throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alexistsipras.eu/index.php/8-news/163-tsipras-to-speak-at-die-linke-party-congress-in-berlin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517214721/http://www.alexistsipras.eu/index.php/8-news/163-tsipras-to-speak-at-die-linke-party-congress-in-berlin |archivedate=17 May 2014}}</ref> Although the GUE/NGL won in Greece, winning six of the 21 Greek seats in the [[European Parliament]], it finished fifth in Europe overall.

===First term (January–August 2015)===
[[File:Alexis Tsipras at the National Resistance Memorial, Kaisariani.jpg|thumb|Alexis Tsipras laying down red roses at the [[1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions|Kaisariani Memorial]].]]

Tsipras led Syriza to victory in the [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|general election]] held on 25 January 2015, falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats. The following morning, Tsipras reached an agreement with the [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Independent Greeks]] party to form a coalition.

On the same day he was sworn in by [[President of Greece|President]] [[Karolos Papoulias]] as the youngest [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] in Greek history since 1865, using the words "I declare in my name, honour and conscience to uphold the Constitution and its laws."<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek Elections: Alexis Tsipras sworn in as the new Greek Prime Minister|work=newsit.gr|url=http://www.newsit.gr/politikh/greek-elections-alexis-tsipras-sworn-in-2601|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Tsipras was also the first prime minister to take a civil oath rather than a religious [[oath of office]], marking a rupture with [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek orthodox]] ceremonial culture.<ref>{{cite news|title=A courteous distance|work=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2015/01/church-and-state-greece|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> While reaffirming the good relations between his party and the Church, he generated further religious controversy during a meeting with [[List of archbishops of Athens|Archbishop]] [[Ieronymos II of Athens|Ieronymos]]. Tsipras explained that as an [[atheist]] who neither married in a religious ceremony nor baptised his children, he would not take a religious oath of office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tsipras explanation to Archbishop over lack of religious oath of office|work=[[Proto Thema]]|url=http://en.protothema.gr/alexis-tsipras-met-with-archbishop-ieronymos/|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

In his first act after being sworn in, Tsipras visited the Resistance Memorial in [[Kaisariani]], laying down red roses to commemorate the 200 members of the [[Greek Resistance]] executed by the German [[Wehrmacht]] on [[1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions|1 May 1944]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/26/alexis-tsipras-greece-syriza-kaisariani-nazi-german|title=Alexis Tsipras pays homage to Greek communists at site of Nazi atrocity|author=Helena Smith|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

During the first meeting of the new cabinet, Tsipras declared the priorities of his government to be the fight against the "[[humanitarian crisis]]" in Greece, negotiations with the EU and the [[International Monetary Fund]] on restructuring the Greek debt, and the implementation of promises made by SYRIZA such as the abolition of the previous government's privatization policies.<ref>{{cite web|title="Ανατροπές παντού -Αλλάζουν όλα σε ΔΕΗ, Παιδεία, Δημόσιο, ιδιωτικοποιήσεις" (Total recall - Everything changes in Public Power Corp., Education, Public Sector and privatizations) |url=http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/188956/anatropes-pantoy-allazoyn-ola-se-dei-paideia-dimosio-idiotikopoiiseis|website=iefimerida.gr|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>

On 3 February, Tsipras made his first official state visit, meeting with his [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian]] counterpart [[Matteo Renzi]] in [[Rome]]. They held a joint press conference expressing concerns about austerity measures imposed by the [[Juncker Commission]] and stated that economic growth is the only way to exit from the crisis. After the press conference, Renzi presented Tsipras with an Italian [[Necktie|tie]] as a gift. Tsipras, who is notable for never wearing ties, thanked Renzi and said that he would wear the gift in celebration when Greece had successfully renegotiated the austerity measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2015/02/03/news/tsipras_continua_il_tour_anti-austerit_oggi_a_palazzo_chigi_incontra_renzi-106424199/|title=Tsipras, il tour anti-austerità a Roma.

[[File:Tsipras and Junker.jpg|thumb|Tsipras and President of the European Commission [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], 13 March 2015]]
On 20 February, the Eurogroup came to an agreement with Greece to extend the Greek bailout for four months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eurozone chiefs strike deal to extend Greek bailout for four months |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/20/eurozone-chiefs-meet-for-last-ditch-talks-to-avert-greece-cash-crunch|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> Tsipras had also announced a trip to Moscow on 8 April, in a bid to secure Russian support.<ref>{{cite news|title=Isolated Greece pivots east to Russia, China and Iran.

On 31 May, Tsipras laid out his complaints and outlined his plan in a recap of events since his election. He concluded that there were at least two competing visions for the integration of Europe, both of which he seemed to reject, and that certain unnamed institutional actors had "an obsession" with their own technocratic programme.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2015/05/31/alexis-tsipras-l-europe-est-a-la-croisee-des-chemins_4644263_3234.html lemonde.fr: "Alexis Tsipras : « Non à une zone euro à deux vitesses »"], 31 May 2015</ref>

On 22 June, Tsipras presented a new Greek proposal, which included raising the retirement age gradually to 67 and curbing early retirement. It also offered to reform the value-added-tax system to set the main rate at 23 percent.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/22/us-eurozone-greece-idUSKBN0P10JN20150622 "Greece offers new plan to avert default, creditors see some hope"], Reuters, 22 June 2015</ref> On 29 June Greek banks stayed shut and Tsipras said they would remain so to impose capital control.

====Bailout referendum====
{{Main|2015 Greek bailout referendum}}
On 27 June 2015, Tsipras announced a [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|referendum]] to decide whether or not [[Greece]] should accept the bailout conditions proposed jointly by the [[Juncker Commission]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Central Bank]].

Tsipras recommended a "No" vote. On 3 July, during an address to at least 250,000 people gathered in the capital's [[Syntagma Square]] in front of parliament, he rejected some leaders' warnings that a "No" result in Sunday's plebiscite could see Greece forced to leave the eurozone. He declared "On Sunday, we are not simply deciding to remain in Europe—we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/greece-pm-urges-no-vote-live-dignity-europe-182709597.html|title=Greece PM urges 'No' vote to 'live with dignity in Europe'|date=3 July 2015|publisher=Yahoo News UK}}</ref> The result of the referendum was 61.3 percent voting "No."<ref name="refresults">[http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/e/public/index.html Δημοψήφισμα Ιούλιος 2015], [[Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction]].

[[Fidel Castro]] sent a letter to Tsipras congratulating him for the victory of "NO". In that letter he said that the courage of Greece was admired by the people of Latin America and Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|title="Συγχαρητήρια επιστολή Φιντέλ Κάστρο στον Αλέξη Τσίπρα" (Congratulation letter by Fidel Castro to Alexis Tsipras) |url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/822463/article/epikairothta/politikh/sygxarhthria-epistolh-fintel-kastro-ston-ale3h-tsipra|publisher=kathimerini.gr|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref>

====Bailout agreement====
After several days of negotiation, on 13 July 2015, Tsipras came to an agreement with lenders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Αναλυτικά τι προβλέπει η συμφωνία της Συνόδου Κορυφής |url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/977809/analutika-ti-problepei-i-sumfonia-tis-sunodou-korufis|website=news247.gr|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref> Greece was to get a loan of 82 to 86 billion euros, which would be handed to Greece gradually from 2015 until June 2018. In return, Greece would have to increase the VAT, reform the pension system, assure the independence of [[ELSTAT]], automatically cut public spending to get primary surpluses, reform justice so decisions can be made faster, follow the reforms proposed by [[OECD]], revoke the laws passed by Tsipras except for the one concerning the "humanitarian crisis", recapitalize the banks, privatize 50 billion of state assets, and decrease the cost of the public sector. In return, Greece would be given the [[Juncker Commission|Juncker]] package, 35 billion euros, which is meant to help the Greek economy grow.<ref>{{cite web|title=A new start for jobs and growth in Greece: Commission mobilises more than €35 billion from the EU budget |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5373_en.htm|website=europa.eu|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref> The Syriza-led government of Greece accepted a bailout package that contains larger pension cuts and tax increases than the one rejected by Greek voters in the referendum.<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/12/thisisacoup_n_7781736.html German-Led Eurozone Launching Coup Against Greek Government].

On 14 August, the Greek parliament backed the country's new bailout deal, although more than 40 MPs from Syriza voted against the deal and Tsipras had to rely on the support of the pro-EU opposition: [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], [[To Potami]] and [[PASOK]]. Tsipras told MPs they were facing a choice between "staying alive or suicide". He also said: "I have my conscience clear that it is the best we could achieve under the current balance of power in Europe, under conditions of economic and financial asphyxiation imposed upon us."<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek MPs back €85bn bailout after marathon talks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33925781|website=bbc.com|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>

====Resignation====
On 20 August 2015, Tsipras resigned from position of the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] due to the rebellion of MPs from his own party [[Syriza]] and called for a snap election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greece crisis: PM Alexis Tsipras quits and calls early polls |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34007859|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> He made the announcement in a televised state address. After opposition parties failed to form a government, [[Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]] was appointed as an interim prime minister until elections can be held.

===Second term (September 2015–July 2019)===
====Re-election====
Despite a low turnout of only 57% versus 64% in previous elections, at the [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|20 September election]], Tsipras received a solid vote of confidence, with Syriza achieving 35.50% of the vote,<ref name="Greek Elections 20th September 2015">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/20/greek-general-election-results-alexis-tsipras-syriza-meimarakis-new-democracy-live | title=Guardian | accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> enough to form a coalition with [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]].<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Voter Turnout in Greek Elections Drops to New Historic Low|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/09/21/voter-turnout-in-greek-elections-drops-to-new-historic-low-infographic/|newspaper=[[Greek Reporter]]|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Among others, Tsipras appointed in his new government Dimitris Kammenos, a politician from ANEL, as deputy minister for infrastructure, transport and networks, causing reactions because of Kammenos' anti-Semitic, racist and homophobic comments on Twitter, such as accusations of 9/11 being a 'Jewish' plot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras just appointed a minister with a horrendous record of anti-Semitic comments |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/greek-prime-minister-alexis-tsipras-just-made-a-man-with-a-horrendous-record-of-comments-about-jews-2015-9|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> The outcry against him eventually forced Kammenos to resign, being a minister for less than 12 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title= "Dimitris Kammenos resigns" Παραιτήθηκε ο Δημήτρης Καμμένος |url=http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/227597/paraitithike-o-dimitris-kammenos|website=iefimerida.gr|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref>

In May 2016, new austerity measures proposed by Tsipras passed Parliament. The legislation increased taxes to middle- and high-level income earners; make across-the-board budget cuts amounting to about 3% of Greece's GDP; removed value-added-tax discounts; cut pensions; and increase deregulation. Tsipras called for calm on the streets and defended the austerity package, saying it fell in line with the agreement reached with the EU the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tsipras defies protesters, austerity measures pass |url=http://thebricspost.com/tsipras-defies-protesters-austerity-measures-pass/#.V0JbJSFa50x|website=thebricspost|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref> Further austerity legislation included a provision for "contingency" measures, including wage and pension cuts, that would take effect automatically if budget targets were derailed next year. Taxes on cigarettes, coffee and craft beer were also raised, while an unpopular property tax was restructured to increase revenues from larger buildings. A new privatisation agency was set up which would have a 99-year remit to develop and sell state-owned property. Tsipras defended his adoption of new fiscal measures, telling Parliament: "Spring may be almost over but we are looking forward to an economic spring and a return to growth this year."<ref>{{cite web|title= Athens agrees fiscal measures in exchange for debt relief talks |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/78343842-2058-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d.html|website=Financial Times|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>

In a July 2017, Tsipras opined that the Greek economy was "on the up" and that "the worst is clearly behind us." He also expressed confidence that Greece will no longer have to rely on bailouts and international oversight in 2018. According to media reports from mid-July, Greece was considering rejoining the bond market for the first time since 2014 to borrow from the capital market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/greece-could-return-to-the-bond-markets-as-early-as-next-week.html|title=Greece could return to the bond markets as early as next week|last=Amaro|first=Silvia|date=2017-07-18|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref> It was speculated that the government could issue a five-year bond at a time when yields on Greek bonds are their lowest since the country left the market in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/138587|title=Greece looking at bond market return|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}</ref> The announcement came a few days after the IMF "in principle" approved Greece for a conditional loan of up to $1.8 billion. The IMF made the payment of the loans contingent on Greece's debt sustainability, demanding that euro-zone countries provide debt relief to the country.

In October 2017 Prime Minister Tsipras met with President Donald Trump at the [[White House]] in Washington, D.C., at which Trump told Tsipras that he supported a "responsible debt relief' plan for Greece as they recovered from the economic crisis in the country.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/25b108d6-b3bc-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8|title=Trump welcomes Greece’s Tsipras to White House|date=2017-10-18|work=Financial Times|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Trump added that his administration had informed Congress of a potential sale to upgrade the F-16 aircraft in Greece's air force, a deal that could be worth $2.4 billion.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-18/us-president-meets-greek-prime-minister/9060666|title=US President meets Greek Prime Minister|date=2017-10-18|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>

Greece officially concluded its three-year European Stability Mechanism (ESM) financial assistance programme on 20 August 2018, following the disbursement of €61.9 billion by the ESM over three years to support the country's macroeconomic adjustment and bank recapitalization. ESM Members agreed on the financial assistance package in August 2015. "The conclusion of the ESM programme marks a very important moment and historic for all of us. We had eight very difficult years, often painful years, but now Greece can finally turn a page in a crisis that has lasted too long," according to EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/aeb930e0-a475-11e8-926a-7342fe5e173f|title=Eurozone hails Greece’s exit from bailout as end of crisis|date=20 August 2018|work=[[Financial Times]] }}</ref> A day after Moscovici's statement, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said during a state address from the island of Ithaca: "A new day is dawning in our country, today is the beginning of a new era". Tsipras furthermore asserted that the country had regained its sovereignty to determine its own future, reaching a destination that would allow the Greeks "to make our place as it deserves to be."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.greeknewsagenda.gr/index.php/topics/politics-polity/6805-alexis-tsipras-state-address-from-ithaca-today-is-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-2|title=Alexis Tsipras' state address from Ithaca: "Today is the beginning of a new era"|date=21 August 2018|work=[[Greek News Agenda]] }}</ref>

In January 2019, Greece Defence Minister [[Panos Kammenos]] and his [[Independent Greeks]] party quit Greece's ruling coalition over a [[Prespa agreement|deal]] struck on the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], potentially leaving the governing coalition without a workable majority in parliament.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/greek-government-splits-macedonia-change-190113183705772.html</ref> Despite this, some days later, Tsipras managed to win a confidence vote and gain again the support of the absolute majority of the Greek parliament (151 votes) for his government (this time backed by one political party, i.e. SYRIZA). The confidence vote was followed by the successful ratification of the Greek parliament with 153 votes of the Prespa Agreement, an agreement which resolved a long-standing dispute and named Greece's northern neighbour as North Macedonia.

Syriza suffered a harsh defeat in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Greece|European election]] on 26 May 2019, losing to the opposition party [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]. Following the defeat, snap elections were called.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/05/27/greece-headed-to-snap-elections-after-syriza-defeat-in-eu-vote|title=Greece headed to snap elections afer Syriza defeat in EU vote|website=www.euronews.com|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>

Syriza was defeated in the 2019 legislative election, scoring 31.53% of votes and securing only 86 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.
