The '''Himalayas''', or '''Himalaya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|ə|,_|h|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə|j|ə}}), ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa-Latn|himá}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|हिम}}, "snow") and {{lang|sa-Latn|ā-laya}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|आलय}}, "abode, receptacle, dwelling")), is a [[mountain range]] in [[Asia]] separating the plains of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. The range has many of [[Earth]]'s highest peaks, including the highest, [[Mount Everest]], at the border between [[Nepal]] and [[China]]. The Himalayas include over [[list of highest mountains on Earth|fifty mountains]] exceeding {{Convert|7200|m|abbr=on}} in elevation, including ten of the fourteen [[eight-thousander|8,000-metre peaks]]. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia ([[Aconcagua]], in the [[Andes]]) is {{Convert|6961|m|abbr=on}} tall.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4q_XoMACOxkC&q=%22South+Tibet+Valley%22&pg=PA25 |title=Himalayan Mountain System |accessdate=30 July 2016 |isbn=978-7-5085-0665-4 |last1=Yang |first1=Qinye |last2=Zheng |first2=Du |year=2004}}</ref>

{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==

The name of the range derives from the [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|Himālaya}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|हिमालय}}, "Abode of the Snow"), from {{lang|sa-Latn|himá}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|हिम}}, "snow") and {{lang|sa-Latn|ā-laya}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|आलय}}, "receptacle, dwelling").<ref name=oed>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0378930#m_en_gb0378930|title=Definition of Himalayas|website=Oxford Dictionaries Online|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> They are now known as the "{{nowrap|Himalaya Mountains}}", usually shortened to the "Himalayas". Formerly, they were described in the singular as the ''Himalaya'' and rendered as Himavan in older writings. This was also previously transcribed as ''Himmaleh'', as in [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poetry<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Roshen Dalal]] |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=2014|isbn=9788184752779 }} Entry: "Himavan"</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Dickinson |first=Emily |author-link=Emily Dickinson |title=The Himmaleh was known to stoop |title-link=:s:The Himmaleh was known to stoop }}.</ref> and [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s essays.<ref>{{citation |last=Thoreau |first=Henry David |author-link=Henry David Thoreau |title=A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers |date=1849 }}.</ref>

The mountains are known as the {{lang|ne-Latn|Himālaya}} in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (both written {{wikt-lang|hi|हिमालय}}), the ''Himalaya'' ({{lang|bo|ཧི་མ་ལ་ཡ་}}) or 'The Land of Snow' ({{lang|bo|གངས་ཅན་ལྗོངས་}}) in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], the ''Himāliya'' Mountain Range ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|سلسلہ کوہ ہمالیہ}}}}) in Urdu and the ''Ximalaya'' Mountain Range ({{lang-zh|s=喜马拉雅[[wikt:山脉|山脉]]|p=Xǐmǎlāyǎ Shānmài|c=|t=喜馬拉雅[[wikt:山脉|山脉]]}}) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

The Himalayas consist of parallel [[mountain ranges]]: the [[Sivalik Hills]] on the south; the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]; the [[Great Himalayas]], which is the highest and central range; and the [[Tibetan Himalayas]] on the north.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Himalayas|title=Himalayas|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> The [[Karakoram]] are generally considered separate from the Himalayas.

In the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the {{cvt|8000|m|||}} peaks of [[Dhaulagiri]] and [[Annapurna]] in [[Nepal]], separated by the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]]. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically – the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki the [[Kora La]] is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and [[K2]] (the highest peak of the Karakoram range and of Pakistan). To the east of Annapurna are the {{convert|8000|m|mile|abbr=on}} peaks of [[Manaslu]] and across the border in Tibet, [[Shishapangma]]. To the south of these lies [[Kathmandu]], the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] lies the valley of the Bhote/[[Sun Kosi]] river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China – the [[Araniko Highway]]/[[China National Highway 318]]. Further east is the [[Mahalangur Himal]] with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: [[Cho Oyu]], [[Everest]], [[Lhotse]] and [[Makalu]]. The [[Khumbu]] region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun river]] drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing to the range to the east of Makalu.

In the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the [[Kanchenjunga]] massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of [[Sikkim]]. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to [[Lhasa]], Tibet, which passes over the [[Nathu La]] pass into the Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of [[Bhutan]]. The highest mountain in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]], which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of [[Namche Barwa]], situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlang Tsangpo]] river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the [[Kangri Garpo]] mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including [[Gyala Peri]], however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.

Going west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to [[Rara Lake]], the largest lake in Nepal. The [[Karnali River]] rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with [[India]] follows the [[Sarda River]] and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of [[Gurla Mandhata]]. Just across [[Lake Manasarovar]] from this lies the sacred [[Mount Kailash]] in the [[Kailash Ranges]], which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of [[Uttarkhand]], the Himalayas rise again as the Kumaon Himalayas with the high peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] and [[Kamet]]. The state is also home to the important pilgrimage destinations of [[Chaar Dhaam]], with [[Gangotri]], the source of holy river [[Ganga]], [[Yamunotri]], the source of river [[Yamuna]], and the temples at [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]].

The next Himalayan Indian state, [[Himachal Pradesh]], it is noted for its hill stations, particularly [[Shimla]], the summer capital of the [[British Raj]], and [[Dharmasala]], the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the [[Punjab Himalaya]] and the [[Sutlej river]], the most easterly of the five tributaries of the [[Indus]], cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]], which are disputed between India and Pakistan. The twin peaks of [[Nun Kun]] are the only mountains over {{convert|7000|m|mile|abbr=on}} in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renowned [[Kashmir Valley]] and the town and lakes of [[Srinagar]]. Finally, the Himalayas reach their western end in the dramatic 8000&nbsp;m peak of [[Nanga Parbat]], which rises over {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000&nbsp;m summits. The western end terminates at a magnificent point near Nanga Parbat where the Himalayas intersect with the Karakoram and [[Hindu Kush]] ranges, in the Pakistani territory of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]].

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}
[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|upright|The {{convert|6000|km||adj=mid|-plus}} journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million [[Before Present|years ago]]<ref name=USGS/>]]

The Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] ([[Main Himalayan Thrust]]) between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.

During the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70&nbsp;million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian Plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about {{cvt|15|cm|||}} per year. About 50&nbsp;million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[https://www.thoughtco.com/mount-everest-overview-1435553 Mount Everest – Overview and Information] by Matt Rosenberg. ThoughtCo Updated 17 March 2017</ref>

Today, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap3-Plate-Margins/Convergent/Continental-Collision|title=Plate Tectonics -The Himalayas |publisher=The Geological Society |access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> The Indian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10&nbsp;million years it will travel about {{cvt|1500|km|||}} into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the [[Main Frontal Thrust|Himalaya southern front]]. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.

During the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of {{convert|1000|-|2000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref name=Kuhle1987/> While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most {{convert|20|to|32|km|abbr=on}} in length, several of the main valley glaciers were {{convert|60|to|112|km|abbr=on}} long during the ice age.<ref name=Kuhle2011/> The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and [[Ablation#Glaciology|ablation]] of a glacier are balanced) was about {{convert|1400|-|1660|m|abbr=on}} lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least {{convert|7.0|to|8.3|C-change}} colder than it is today.<ref name=Kuhle2005/>

Despite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major watershed, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:
* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The [[Indus River|Indus]] itself forms the northern and western boundaries of the Himalayas. It begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows north-west through India into Pakistan before turning south-west to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by several major tributaries draining the southern slopes of the Himalayas, including the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]] and [[Sutlej]] rivers, the five rivers of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].
* The other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]] and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest river delta, the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>

The northern slopes of [[Gyala Peri]] and the peaks beyond the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo]], sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]]. The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]] all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the ''circum-Himalayan rivers''.<ref name=circum/>

===Glaciers===
[[File:Annapurna I, south face.jpg|thumb|South Annapurna Glacier]]

The great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after [[Antarctica]] and the [[Arctic]].<ref name=pbs_nature/> The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about {{convert|12000|km3|abbr=on}} of fresh water.<ref name=IPPC2007/> Its glaciers include the [[Gangotri Glacier|Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and [[Khumbu Glacier|Khumbu]] glaciers ([[Mount Everest]] region), [[Langtang]] glacier ([[Langtang]] region) and [[Zemu Glacier|Zemu]] ([[Sikkim]]).

Owing to the mountains' latitude near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the permanent [[snow line]] is among the highest in the world at typically around {{convert|5500|m|abbr=on|-2}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shi |first1=Yafeng |last2=Xie |first2=Zizhu |last3=Zheng |first3=Benxing |last4=Li |first4=Qichun |url=http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424125203/http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf |archive-date=24 April 2013 |title=Distribution, Feature and Variations of Glaciers in China |journal=World Glacier Inventory |year=1978 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In contrast, equatorial mountains in [[New Guinea]], the [[Rwenzoris]] and [[Colombia]] have a snow line some {{convert|900|m|abbr=on|-1}} lower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Henderson-Sellers|first1=Ann|last2=McGuffie|first2=Kendal|title=The Future of the World's Climate: A Modelling Perspective|pages=199–201|isbn=978-0-12-386917-3|year=2012}}</ref> The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large [[perennial stream|perennial rivers]].

In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] across the region as a result of climate change.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-nepal-climate-glaciers-dc/vanishing-himalayan-glaciers-threaten-a-billion-idUSDEL18761020070604|title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion|date=4 June 2007|newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref> For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades.

It drains into the nearby [[Lake Rakshastal]] with an area of {{cvt|250|km2|||}} and slightly lower at {{cvt|4575|m|||}}. [[Pangong Tso]], which is spread across the border between India and China, at far western end of Tibet, and [[Yamdrok Tso]], located in south central Tibet, are among the largest with surface areas of {{cvt|700|km2|||}}, and {{cvt|638|km2|||}}, respectively. [[Lake Puma Yumco]] is one of the highest of the larger lakes at an elevation of {{cvt|5030|m|||}}.

South of the main range, the lakes are smaller. [[Tilicho Lake]] in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world.

Some of the lakes present a danger of a [[glacial lake outburst flood]].

The vast size, huge altitude range and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills to cold and dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range. For much of Himalayas – that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the [[monsoon]]. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism – the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.

Using the [[Köppen climate classification]], the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as ''Cwa'', [[humid subtropical climate#South Asia|Humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety|subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'')]].

In the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]] is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around {{convert|723|mm|abbr=on|0}} around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.

The northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a [[Desert climate#Cold desert climates|cold desert climate]]. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.

Local impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by 0.2 to 1.2<sup>0</sup>C for every {{cvt|100|m|||abbr=}} rise in altitude.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Romshoo|first1=Shakil Ahmad|last2=Rafiq|first2=Mohammd|last3=Rashid|first3=Irfan|date=March 2018|title=Spatio-temporal variation of land surface temperature and temperature lapse rate over mountainous Kashmir Himalaya|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11629-017-4566-x|journal=Journal of Mountain Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=563–576|doi=10.1007/s11629-017-4566-x|s2cid=134568990|issn=1672-6316}}</ref> This gives rise to a variety of climates from a nearly tropical climate in the foothills, to [[tundra]] and permanent snow and ice at higher elevations. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the [[rain shadow]] of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the [[Upper Mustang]] which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the [[Annapurna]] and [[Dhaulagiri]] massifs and has annual precipitation of around {{cvt|300|mm|||}}, while [[Pokhara]] on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall ({{cvt|3900|mm|disp=or||}} a year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.

The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin–Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=https://news.wisc.edu/climate-shift-linked-to-rise-of-himalayas-tibetan-plateau/|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>

The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities.<ref name="O'Neill_2019"/> The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor [[extremophile]] organisms.<ref>{{cite web|first=C. Michael|last=Hogan|year=2010|url=https://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/Extremophiles|title=Extremophile|editor1-first=E.|editor1-last=Monosson |website=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|location=Washington, DC}}</ref><ref name="oneill_khecheopalri"/>

At high altitudes, the elusive and previously endangered [[snow leopard]] is the main predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep. The [[Himalayan musk deer]] is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the [[Himalayan tahr]], the [[takin]], the [[Himalayan serow]], and the [[Himalayan goral]]. The critically endangered [[Himalayan brown bear|Himalayan]] subspecies of the [[brown bear]] is found sporadically across the range as is the [[Asian black bear]]. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, [[Red panda]] feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered [[Gee's golden langur]] and the [[Kashmir gray langur]], with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas respectively.<ref name="oneill_khecheopalri"/>

The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. ''[[Hydrangea hirta]]'' is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], apple and ''[[Myrica esculenta|box myrtle]]''. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is ''[[Juniperus tibetica]]'' located at {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|-1}} in Southeastern Tibet.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|title=Highest Treeline in the Northern Hemisphere Found in Southern Tibet|first1=Georg|last1=Miehe|first2=Sabine|last2=Miehe|first3=Jonas|last3=Vogel|first4=Sonam|last4=Co|first5=La|last5=Duo|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2007|pages=169–173|doi=10.1659/mrd.0792|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103046/http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|archive-date=6 June 2013|hdl=1956/2482|s2cid=6061587}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Jains at Kailash.jpg|thumb|[[Jain]] pilgrims paying obeisance to Tirthankar [[Rishabhdev]] near [[Mount Kailash]].]]

The Himalayan population belongs to distinct cultural isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those cultures – Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), [[Islam]]ic ([[Afghanistan]]–[[Iran]]ian) and Animist (Burmese and [[southeast Asia]]n) – have created here their own individual and unique place.<ref name="books.google.pl" />
[[File:Shravanabelagola2007 - 23.jpg|thumb|upright|In Indian tradition, [[Rishabhdev]]'s son

There are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. In [[Jainism]], Mount Ashtapad in Himalayas is a sacred place where the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]] attained [[moksha]]. It is believed that after [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdeva]] attained ''[[nirvana]]'', his son, Emperor [[Bharata Chakravartin]], had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 [[Tirthankaras]] with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it ''Sinhnishdha''.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4aVRLGhf-8C&q=mount+Kailash+jainism&pg=RA1-PA273 | title=Faith & Philosophy of Jainism| isbn=978-81-7835-723-2| last1=Jain| first1=Arun Kumar| year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-21/spiritual-destinations/29739255_1_manasarovar-water-moon |title=To heaven and back  |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4aVRLGhf-8C&q=ashtapad+jainism&pg=PA20 | title=Faith & Philosophy of Jainism| isbn=978-81-7835-723-2| last1=Jain| first1=Arun Kumar| year=2009}}</ref> For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati.<ref name=":1" /> The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Muktinath]], also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams.<ref name="JEE" />

The [[Buddhists]] also lay a great deal of importance on the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where [[Buddhism]] started in [[Bhutan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimberly-cantor/paro-bhutan-the-tigers-ne_b_10982104.html|title=Paro, Bhutan: The Tiger's Nest|last=Cantor|first=Kimberly|date=14 July 2016|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref> The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or ''mahasiddhas''. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa.<ref name=":4">{{cite book|last1=Zurick|first1=David|last2=Julsun|first2=Pacheco|last3=Basanta|first3=Raj Shrestha|last4=Birendra|first4=Bajracharya|title=Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya|location=Lexington|publisher=U of Kentucky|year=2006}}</ref>
The Himalayan people's diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing.<ref name=":4" /> The shapes and materials of the people's homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewellery. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewellery.<ref name=":4" />

===Religions===

}}
Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. A notable example of a religious site is [[Paro Taktsang]], where [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have founded [[Buddhism]] in [[Bhutan]].<ref name="Pommaret">{{cite book|author=Pommaret, Francoise|title=Bhutan Himalayan Mountains Kingdom|edition=5th|publisher=Odyssey Books and Guides|year=2006|pages=136–137|isbn=978-962-217-810-6}}</ref>

In [[Hinduism]], the Himalayas have been personified as the king of all Mountain – "Giriraj [[Himavat]]", father of [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] and [[Parvati]] (form of [[Adi Shakti]] [[Durga]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|isbn=978-0-500-51088-9|first=Anna|last=Dallapiccola|year=2002|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofhind0000dall}}</ref>

A number of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhist]] sites are situated in the Himalayas, in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and in the Indian regions of [[Ladakh]], Sikkim, [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] and [[Darjeeling]]. There were over 6,000 [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries]] in Tibet, including the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life|work=BBC News|date=20 March 2008}}</ref> [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]] are also dotted with numerous monasteries. The [[Tibetan Muslims]] have their own mosques in [[Lhasa]] and [[Shigatse]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://en.people.cn/200510/27/eng20051027_217176.html | title = Mosques in Lhasa, Tibet|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=27 October 2005}}</ref>

==Resources==
The Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites.<ref name = JEE>{{Cite journal |title=Ecological status and traditional knowledge of medicinal plants in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary of Garhwal Himalaya, India |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=9 |page=1 |author1=Jahangeer A.

Bussmann |date=2 January 2013 |doi=10.1186/1746-4269-9-1 |pmid=23281594 |pmc=3560114}}</ref> Different parts of the plants – root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark – are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an ''abies pindrow'' tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an ''arachne cordifolia'' is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a ''callicarpa arborea'' is used for skin ailments.<ref name=JEE /> Nearly a fifth of the [[gymnosperm]]s, [[Flowering plants|angiosperms]] and [[pteridophyte]]s in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.<ref name=JEE/>

Most of the population in some Asian and African countries depend on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Pankaj|last2=Sharma|first2=Vijay Kumar|title=Healing Traditions of the Northwestern Himalayas|year=2014|publisher=Springer Briefs in Environmental Science|isbn=978-81-322-1925-5}}</ref> Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region.<ref name=":1" /> The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Himalayan Forests Disappearing|journal=Earth Island Journal|volume=21|issue=4|year=2006|pages=7–8}}</ref>

The Himalayas are also a source of many minerals and precious stones. Amongst the tertiary rocks, are vast potentials of mineral oil. There is coal located in Kashmir, and precious stones located in the Himalayas. There is also gold, silver, copper, zinc, and many other such minerals and metals located in at least 100 different places in these mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/India/Resources-and-power|access-date=2020-01-25|title=Resources and power}}</ref>
