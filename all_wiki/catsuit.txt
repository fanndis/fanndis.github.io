A '''catsuit''' is a one-piece [[form-fitting garment]] that covers the torso and the legs, and frequently the arms.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catsuit |title=Catsuit – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref> They are usually made from stretchable material, such as [[lycra]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[spandex]] (after 1959), [[latex]], or [[velour]], but may use less elastic materials, such as [[leather]] or [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Catsuits frequently close by means of a [[zipper]] at the front or back. A catsuit is regarded as [[outerwear]], but not normally [[street wear]].

Catsuits were occasionally worn as a fashion item at various times from the 1960s to the 1990s. During the 1970s and 1980s, they were worn for [[aerobics]] and [[disco dancing]]. Around 1980, disco dance catsuits briefly became a street fashion item in the [[United Kingdom]].

Athletes in sports such as [[speed skating]], [[bobsled]], [[winter triathlon]], [[skiing|ski-racing]], [[cycling]], [[bodyflight]] and [[gymnastics]] wear garments similar to catsuits, called [[unitard]]s, which are specifically geared to the needs of the sport involved. Also similar in appearance are [[wetsuit]]s and [[drysuit]]s used by [[SCUBA diving|scuba divers]], and the [[speedsuit]]s used by competitive [[swimming (sport)|swimmers]] before the more extreme forms of the suit were banned. Also, in [[tennis]] [[Serena Williams]] would sometimes wear catsuits, two examples are the [[2002 U.S. Open (tennis)|2002 US Open]] and the [[2018 French Open]].

The name "catsuit" is attributed only since about 1955 or 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/catsuit?s=t |title=cat suit |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catsuit |title=catsuit |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> The origin of the name is unknown; it may refer to a slinky, catlike aspect given the wearer by some versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/catsuit |title=catsuit (n.) |author=The Sciolist |work=Etymology Online |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref>
