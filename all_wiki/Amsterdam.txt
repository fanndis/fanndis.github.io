==Etymology==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: A|Other names of Amsterdam]]}}

After the floods of 1170 and 1173, locals near the river Amstel built a bridge over the river and a dam across it, giving its name to the village: "Aemstelredamme". The earliest recorded use of that name is in a document dated 27 October 1275, which exempted inhabitants of the village from paying [[toll bridge|bridge tolls]] to Count [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]].{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|p=19}} This allowed the inhabitants of the village of Aemstelredamme to travel freely through the [[County of Holland]], paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. The certificate describes the inhabitants as ''homines manentes apud Amestelledamme'' (people residing near Amestelledamme).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |title=The toll privilege of 1275 in the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106010052/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |archive-date=6 January 2016 }}</ref> By 1327, the name had developed into ''Aemsterdam''.{{sfn|Berns|Daan|1993|p=91}}{{sfn|Mak|1994|pp=18–20}}

===Founding and Middle Ages===
[[File:Amsterdam (6578772447).jpg|thumb|The [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude Kerk]] was consecrated in 1306 CE.]]
Amsterdam is much younger than Dutch cities such as [[Nijmegen]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Utrecht]]. In October 2008, [[historical geographer]] Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then, since [[reclamation of land]] may not have been for farming—it may have been for [[peat]], for use as fuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html |title=Amsterdam 200 jaar ouder dan aangenomen |accessdate=22 October 2008 |date=22 October 2008 |publisher=Nu.nl |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025045803/http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html |archive-date=25 October 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

}}</ref> From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1345, an alleged [[Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic miracle]] in [[Kalverstraat]] rendered the city an important place of [[pilgrimage]] until the [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of the Protestant faith]]. The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The ''[[Stille Omgang]]''—a silent walk or [[procession]] in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century.<ref name="stilleomgang">{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |title=Mirakel van Amsterdam |language=nl |accessdate=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808045508/http://www.trouw.nl/laatstenieuws/laatstenieuws/article936256.ece/Katholieken_verzameld_voor_Mirakel_van_Amsterdam |archive-date=8 August 2009 }}</ref> In the heyday of the Silent Walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam. In the 21st century, this has reduced to about 5000.

===Conflict with Spain===

In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the [[religious persecution]] of Protestants by the newly introduced [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|Inquisition]]. The revolt escalated into the [[Eighty Years' War]], which ultimately led to Dutch independence.<ref name="80yearswar">{{cite web

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's ''[[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]'', during which it became the wealthiest city in the western world.<ref>E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch (New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1982), p. 57</ref> Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the [[Baltic Sea]], North America, and Africa, as well as present-day [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Brazil]], forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]].

Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading [[Financial centre]] of the western world.<ref>[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html Amsterdam in the 17th century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826132532/http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html |date=26 August 2009 }}, The University of [[North Carolina]] at Pembroke</ref> In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the international trading Dutch East India Company became the world's first [[stock exchange]] by trading in its own shares.<ref name="The oldest share">{{cite web

=== Decline and modernisation ===
Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|wars]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] with [[Kingdom of England|England]] and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. However, the later establishment of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 marked a turning point.

The [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal]] was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]], and the [[North Sea Canal]] was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, [[Joseph Conrad]] gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in ''The Mirror of the Sea''.

===20th century–present===
[[File:Amsterdam photochrom2.jpg|thumb|left|Photochrom of Amsterdam's Dam Square at the beginning of the 20th century]]
Shortly before the First World War, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the ''Aardappeloproer'' (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.<ref name="aardappeloproer">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf |title=Aardappeloproer – Legermuseum |language=nl |accessdate=21 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528004443/http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf |archive-date=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and [[Schellingwoude]], all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |title=Amsterdam city archives |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006135130/https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/ |archive-date=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>http://www.centraledorpenraad.nl/landelijk-noord/historie {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711234152/http://www.centraledorpenraad.nl/landelijk-noord/historie |date=11 July 2014 }} from website for the centrale dorpen raad (villages central council)</ref> Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the [[Jordaan]] district in the [[Frederik Hendrikbuurt]] and surrounding neighbourhoods.

[[Nazi Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 [[Dutch Jews]] were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]], of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the Dutch Communist Party organised the [[February strike]] attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].<ref name="deportation">{{cite web

These suburbs contained many public parks and wide-open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing,{{clarify|date=January 2017}} politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people.<ref name="stadsherstel">{{cite web

Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect [[Amsterdam Centraal station|Amsterdam Centraal]] and the city centre with other parts of the city.

The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's former Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat and Weesperstraat, were widened and almost all houses and buildings were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the ''Nieuwmarktrellen'' ([[Nieuwmarkt Riots]]) broke out;<ref name="metrostad">{{cite web

As a result, the demolition was stopped and the highway into the city's centre was never fully built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as ''Stadsherstel Amsterdam'', were founded to restore the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.<ref name="stadsherstel"/> The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a [[protected area]]. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] (the three concentric canals: Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht) was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].<ref name="unesco">{{cite web|url=https://www.amsterdam.nl/kunst-cultuur/grachtengordel/ |title=Grachtengordel Amsterdam Werelderfgoed |language=nl|accessdate=5 August 2015 |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam}}</ref>

Amsterdam has more than {{convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of [[Canals of Amsterdam|canals]], most of which are navigable by boat. The city's three main canals are the Prinsengracht, Herengracht, and Keizersgracht.

In the [[Middle Ages]], Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the [[Singel]], which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and gives the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a [[Port of Amsterdam|seaport]].

Amsterdam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=4260&cityname=Amsterdam,+North+Holland,+Netherlands&units=|title=Amsterdam, Netherlands Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref> strongly influenced by its proximity to the [[North Sea]] to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. While winters are cool and summers warm, temperatures vary year by year. There can occasionally be cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers.

Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant [[Urban heat island|heat-island effect]], nights rarely fall below {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while it could easily be {{convert|−12|°C|0|abbr=on}} in Hilversum, {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast.

Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. The average daily high in August is {{convert|22.1|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|30|°C|abbr=on}} or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from {{convert|-19.7|°C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|36.3|°C|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?ind=06240&ano=2019&mes=7&day=25&hora=18&min=0&ndays=30|title=06240: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (Netherlands) |publisher=OGIMET |accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="Extreme temps">{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm |title=Extreme temperatures around the world |publisher=Herrera, Maximiliano |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> 
Days with more than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} of [[precipitation]] are common, on average 133 days per year.

In the 16th and 17th century, non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly [[Huguenot]]s, [[Flemish people|Flemings]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Westphalia]]ns. Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[History of the Jews in Amsterdam|Jewish]]. Just twenty percent of them survived the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Netherlands |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-netherlands |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |accessdate=24 January 2019 }}</ref>

The first mass immigration in the 20th century was by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy, and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land-use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so-called "groeikernen", literally ''cores of growth''. Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the [[Public housing|social housing]] projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of the city'

Historically, Amsterdam has been predominantly Christian, in 1900 Christians formed the largest [[religious denomination|religious group]] in the city (70% of the population), [[Dutch Reformed Church]] formed 45% of the city population, while Roman catholic formed 25% of the city population.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130724083310/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/pdf/2001_factsheets_5.pdf Geloven in Amsterdam]</ref>

==Cityscape and architecture==
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Amsterdam}}

[[File:Amsterdam in 1538.JPG|upright=1.5|thumb|A 1538 painting by [[Cornelis Anthonisz]] showing a bird's-eye view of Amsterdam. The famous [[Canals of Amsterdam|Grachtengordel]] had not yet been established.]]
Amsterdam fans out south from the [[Amsterdam Centraal station]] and [[Damrak]], the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as [[De Wallen]] (English: "The Quays"). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red-light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.

The medieval and colonial age [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as ''grachten'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working-class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] neighbourhood, with the [[Natura Artis Magistra|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognised by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].

}}</ref> In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] bay. Known as the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]], three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the Herengracht (where "Heren" refers to ''Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam'' (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and ''[[gracht]]'' means canal, so that the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the Lords"), Keizersgracht (Emperor's Canal), and Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stadsherstel.nl/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |title=SHVriendenwandeling2017web1.pdf |publisher=stadsherstel |accessdate=9 April 2018 }}</ref> The fourth and outermost canal is the [[Singelgracht]], which is often not mentioned on maps because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the [[Singel]].

The canals served for defence, [[Water resource management|water management]] and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen dikes]], with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry [[superstructure]]s.<ref>{{cite book

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic [[Windscreen wiper|windshield wiper]] as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|year=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=978-90-450-1232-2}}</ref> Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the [[Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal]] and the [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]].<ref name="filledincanals">{{cite web

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, [[Samuel Sarphati]] devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]]. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the ''Paleis voor Volksvlijt''.<ref name="joodsmuseum">{{cite web

Following Sarphati, civil engineers Jacobus van Niftrik and Jan Kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city's centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |title=Van Niftrik's plan at the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143743/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |archive-date=24 July 2011 }}</ref> Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.<ref name="oudzuid">{{cite web

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: ''Plan Zuid'', designed by the architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], and ''West''.

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by [[Car|motor car]]. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the Bijlmer.<ref name="bijlmer">{{cite web

In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style.

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]]. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.<ref name="neostijl">{{cite web

At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]]. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdamse School]].

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. The [[Vondelpark]], the largest park in the city, is located in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] neighbourhood and is named after the 17th-century Amsterdam author [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Yearly, the park has around 10&nbsp;million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground and several [[horeca]] facilities. In the [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]] borough, is the Beatrixpark, named after [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]]. Between Amsterdam and [[Amstelveen]] is the [[Amsterdamse Bos]] ("Amsterdam Forest"), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5&nbsp;million people visit the park, which has a size of 1.000 hectares and is approximately three times the size of [[Central Park]].<ref>[http://www.amsterdamsebos.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site Amsterdamse Bos – English site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519151059/http://www.amsterdamsebos.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site |date=19 May 2010 }}.

===Port of Amsterdam===
The [[Port of Amsterdam]] is the fourth-largest port in Europe, the 38th largest port in the world and the second-largest port in the Netherlands by metric tons of cargo. In 2014 the Port of Amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4&nbsp;million tons of cargo, which was mostly [[bulk cargo]].
Amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the Netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year.
In 2019 the new lock in IJmuiden will open; the port will then be able to grow to 125&nbsp;million tonnes in capacity.

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (AEX), now part of [[Euronext]], is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is near [[Dam Square]] in the city centre.

Together with [[Eindhoven]] ([[BrabantStad#Brainport|Brainport]]) and [[Rotterdam]] ([[Port of Rotterdam|Seaport]]), Amsterdam (Airport) forms the foundation of the Dutch economy.<ref name="ref1367203750">{{cite web|url=http://www.brainport.nl/over-brainport|title=Over Brainport|publisher=brainport.nl|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref>

De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|legalised prostitution]] and is Amsterdam's largest and best-known [[red-light district]]. This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of canals, streets, and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by [[sex worker]]s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights. In recent years, the city government has been closing and repurposing the famous red-light district windows in an effort to clean up the area and reduce the amount of party and sex tourism.

===Retail===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large high-end department stores such as [[De Bijenkorf]] founded in 1870 to small speciality shops. Amsterdam's high-end shops are found in the streets [[P.C. Hooftstraat]]<ref name="hoof_cite">{{cite web |title=PC Hooftstraat World's Third Nicest Shopping Street |url=https://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/2160-amsterdams-pc-hooftstraat-worlds-third-best-shopping-street |website=dutchamsterdam}}</ref> and ''Cornelis Schuytstraat'', which are located in the vicinity of the [[Vondelpark]]. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval [[Kalverstraat]] in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the ''Negen Straatjes'' and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. ''Negen Straatjes'' are nine narrow streets within the ''Grachtengordel'', the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the ''Negen Straatjes'' a large diversity of privately owned shops. However, as the ''Negen Straatjes'' are dominated by fashion stores, the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a wide variety of stores, just to name some specialities: candy and other food-related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the [[Albert Cuyp Market]], Westerstraat-markt, Ten Katemarkt, and [[Dappermarkt]]. Some of these markets are held daily, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held every week.

===Museums===
The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the [[Museumplein]] (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|World's fair]]. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter.<ref name="ijsbaan">{{cite web

The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated several large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.<ref name="museumpleinfacelift">{{cite web|url=http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |title=Museumplein krijgt facelift |publisher=Gemeente Amsterdam |language=nl |accessdate=30 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807174714/http://www.topstad.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/museumplein_krijgt |archive-date=7 August 2009 }}</ref>

After renovations lasting several years, the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called 'The Bathtub' due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the [[Verzetsmuseum]] (Resistance Museum), the [[Anne Frank House]], and the [[Rembrandt House Museum]], to the very large, like the [[Tropenmuseum]] (Museum of the Tropics), [[Amsterdam Museum]] (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum), [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] (a dependency of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Saint Petersburg) and the [[Joods Historisch Museum]] (Jewish Historical Museum).

Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs that treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including [[John Kraaijkamp Sr.]]; the best-known version is probably that by [[Wim Sonneveld]] (1962). In the 1950s [[Johnny Jordaan]] rose to fame with "[[Geef mij maar Amsterdam]]" ("I prefer Amsterdam"), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighbourhood, the [[Jordaan]] ("Bij ons in de Jordaan"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include [[Tante Leen]] and [[Manke Nelis]]. Another notable Amsterdam song is "[[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Amsterdam]]" by [[Jacques Brel]] (1964).<ref name="lijflied finale">{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2948441/2011/10/05/Amsterdams-lijflied-de-finale.dhtml|title=Amsterdams lijflied: de finale|date=5 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=nl|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> A 2011 poll by Amsterdam newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' that Trio Bier's "Oude Wolf" was voted "Amsterdams lijflied".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2965125/2011/10/12/Amsterdams-Lijflied-Stadsbewoners-leven-als-oude-wolven.dhtml|title=Amsterdams Lijflied: Stadsbewoners leven als oude wolven – AMSTERDAMS LIJFLIED – PAROOL|date=12 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=nl|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the [[Osdorp Posse]] and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

===Performing arts===
[[File:Stadsschouwburg amsterdam.jpg|thumb|[[Stadsschouwburg]], Amsterdam's best known theatre]]
Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

The [[Stadsschouwburg]] at the [[Leidseplein]] is the home base of [[Toneelgroep Amsterdam]]. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal programme of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theatre space, to be operated jointly with next door [[Melkweg]], will open in late 2009 or early 2010.

The [[Stopera|Dutch National Opera and Ballet]] (formerly known as ''Het Muziektheater''), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to [[Dutch National Opera]] and [[Dutch National Ballet]]. [[Carré Theatre|Royal Theatre Carré]] was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, [[cabaret]] performances, and pop concerts.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals. A new theatre has also moved into Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues: Theater Amsterdam is situated in the west part of Amsterdam, on the Danzigerkade. It is housed in a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theatre is the first-ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank's life.

On the east side of town, there is a small theatre in a converted bathhouse, the [[Badhuistheater]]. The theatre often has English programming.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy) and [https://nederlied.nl/ Nederlied]Kleinkunstkoor (English: Cabaret Choir). Contemporary popular artists are [[Youp van 't Hek]], [[Freek de Jonge]], [[Herman Finkers]], [[Hans Teeuwen]], [[Theo Maassen]], [[Herman van Veen]], [[Najib Amhali]], [[Raoul Heertje]], [[Jörgen Raymann]], [[Brigitte Kaandorp]] and [[Comedytrain]]. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of [[Boom Chicago]] in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many ''[[bar (establishment)|cafés]]'' (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cosy. The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown ''café'') breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. These brown cafés mostly offer a wide range of local and international artisanal beers. Most ''cafés'' have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many [[discothèque]]s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]]. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape, Air, John Doe and Club Abe. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), TrouwAmsterdam and Studio 80. In recent years '24-hour' clubs opened their doors, most notably Radion De School, Shelter and Marktkantine. [[Bimhuis]] located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the [[LGBT]] community and nightlife.

==Politics==
{{Main|Government of Amsterdam}}
[[File:Femke Halsema 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Femke Halsema]] has been the [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|Mayor of Amsterdam]] since 2018.]] 
The city of Amsterdam is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]], a [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] and a [[Burgemeester|mayor]]. Since 1981, the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts'. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] was reduced to eight: [[Amsterdam-Centrum]] covering the city centre including the [[Canals of Amsterdam|canal belt]], [[Amsterdam-Noord]] consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]], [[Amsterdam-Oost]] in the east, [[Amsterdam-Zuid]] in the south, [[Amsterdam-West]] in the west, [[Amsterdam Nieuw-West]] in the far west, [[Amsterdam Zuidoost]] in the southeast, and [[Westpoort (Amsterdam)|Westpoort]] covering the [[Port of Amsterdam]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-city-districts|title=Amsterdam City Districts|publisher=Iamsterdam.com|accessdate=12 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820014532/http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-city-districts|archive-date=20 August 2014}}</ref>

The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board, but also has individual responsibilities in maintaining public order. On 27 June 2018, [[Femke Halsema]] (former member of [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for [[GroenLinks]] from 1998 to 2011) was appointed as the first woman to be [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|Mayor of Amsterdam]] by the [[King's Commissioner]] of [[North Holland]] for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She replaces [[Eberhard van der Laan]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]) who was the Mayor of Amsterdam from 2010 until his death in October 2017. After the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2014|2014 municipal council elections]], a governing majority of [[Democrats 66|D66]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] and [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] was formed – the first coalition without the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] since [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/06/12/three-party-coalition-amsterdam-pvda/|title=Three-party coalition in Amsterdam|author=Britt Slegers|work=NL Times|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> Next to the [[Burgemeester|Mayor]], the [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] consists of eight ''wethouders'' ('alderpersons') appointed by the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]]: four [[Democrats 66|D66]] alderpersons, two [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] alderpersons and two [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] alderpersons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam.nl/gemeente/college/|title=College van burgemeester en wethouders|language=nl|publisher=City of Amsterdam|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Amsterdamse stadsdelen 2010.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Boroughs of Amsterdam]]]]
Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into eight [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]], called ''stadsdelen'' or 'districts', a system that was implemented gradually in the 1980s to improve local governance. The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.

Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.

The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.

===Metropolitan area===
[[File:Police Headquarters, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Police headquarters of Amsterdam]]
"Amsterdam" is usually understood to refer to the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

[[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').<ref name="cbs2013"/> The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' ('City Region of Amsterdam'). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].

The smallest of these areas is the [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam with a population of 802,938 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> The conurbation had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,<ref name="cbs2013"/> and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]]. The largest area by population, the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33&nbsp;million.<ref name=dosamsterdam>{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |title=Dienst onderzoek & statistiek Amsterdam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614030427/http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/8187/ |archive-date=14 June 2013 }}</ref> It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerland, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area [[Randstad]], with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.<ref name="randstad">{{cite web|title=Population |work=Themes |publisher=City of Amsterdam |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/2008_mutatiestatistiek_stand.xls |format=in Dutch |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the ''Stadsregio Amsterdam'' (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibilities include regional spatial planning and the metropolitan public transport concessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadsregioamsterdam.nl/algemene-onderdelen/english-information/|title=Stadsregio Amsterdam: English Information|publisher=Stadsregio Amsterdam|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

Under the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch Constitution]], Amsterdam is the [[capital of the Netherlands]]. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" in chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("''de hoofdstad Amsterdam''").<ref name="capital-constitution">{{cite web |last=Dutch Wikisource |title=Grondwet voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden |trans-title=Constitution for the Kingdom of the Netherlands |language=nl |url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Grondwet_voor_het_Koninkrijk_der_Nederlanden |at=[http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet/Hoofdstuk_2#Artikel_32 Chapter 2, Article 32] |quote=... de hoofdstad Amsterdam ... |accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned "the city of Amsterdam" ("''de stad Amsterdam''").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet |title=Previous versions of the constitution |language=nl |publisher=Nl.wikisource.org |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> For a royal investiture, therefore, the [[States General of the Netherlands]] (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] on [[Dam Square]], immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in [[The Hague]], the city which has historically been the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch supreme court]]. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

===Symbols===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the city shields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

Currently, there are sixteen [[Trams in Amsterdam|tram routes]] and five [[Amsterdam Metro|metro routes]]. All are operated by municipal public transport operator [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf]] (GVB), which also runs the city bus network.

Four fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ lake]] to the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] of [[Amsterdam-Noord]], and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a boat sharing operation, electric rental boats and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by [[Connexxion]] and [[Egged (company)|EBS]]. International coach services are provided by [[Eurolines]] from [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station]], [[IDBUS]] from [[Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station]], and [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.

In order to facilitate easier transport to the centre of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iamsterdam.com/nl/op-bezoek/parkeren/parkeren-en-verder-reizen|title=Parkeren + Reizen (P+R) Amsterdam – I amsterdam|website=www.iamsterdam.com}}</ref>

Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world,<ref name="Hortus">{{cite web|url=http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|title=Hortus Botanicus official website|publisher=2009 de Hortus|accessdate=10 June 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831051745/http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|archive-date=31 August 2009}}</ref> with many old and rare specimens, among them the [[coffee|coffee plant]] that served as the parent for the entire [[coffee culture]] in Central and South America.<ref name="he">{{cite web

There are over 200 primary schools in Amsterdam.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://www.amsterdam.nl/onderwijs-jeugd/basisonderwijs/stedelijk/ Stedelijk Toelatingsbeleid], Municipality of Amsterdam, 2015. Retrieved on 20 July 2015.</ref> Some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]] schools. The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants, there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

Schools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the [[Amsterdam International Community School]], [[British School of Amsterdam]], [[Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam]], [[Lycée Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam]] primary campus (French school), [[International School of Amsterdam]], and the [[Japanese School of Amsterdam]].

==Notable people==
{{main|List of people from Amsterdam}}

==Media==
Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media. Some locally based newspapers include ''[[Het Parool]]'', a national daily paper; ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers ''[[Trouw]]'', ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' and ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''; ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'', a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers ''[[Metro (Dutch newspaper)|Metro]]'' and ''[[The Holland Times]]'' (printed in English).

Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Dutch commercial TV group [[SBS Broadcasting Group]], consisting of TV-stations [[SBS 6]], [[Net 5]] and [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]]. However, Amsterdam is not considered 'the media city of the Netherlands'. The town of [[Hilversum]], {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Netherlands]], heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.

In 2012, the music video of Far East Movement, 'Live My Life', was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.

Also, several movies were filmed in Amsterdam, such as [[James Bond]]'s [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]], [[Ocean's Twelve]], [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]] and [[The Hitman's Bodyguard]]. Amsterdam is also featured in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', which has been made into [[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|a film]] as well that partly takes place in Amsterdam.

==Housing==
The housing market is heavily regulated. The increased influx of migrants, especially since the Syrian Civil War (2011–present), has been burdensome, economically and culturally, but the government deals with citizen and migrant cases for housing equally. According to the Netherlands' Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, "60% of housing stock is controlled by housing corporations. No different treatment for migrant groups".<ref>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ''Working Together for Local Integration of Migrants and Refugees in Amsterdam'' (Amsterdam: OECD Press, 2018), 74ff. {{ISBN|9789264299726}}</ref>

From the late 1960s onwards many buildings in Amsterdam have been [[Squatting|squatted]] both for housing and for using as social centres.<ref name="Owens">{{cite book |last1=Owens |first1=Lynn |title=Cracking the Movement: Narrating the Decline of the Amsterdam Squatters' Movement |date=2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |location=Pennsylvania |isbn=9780271034638}}</ref> A number of these squats have legalised and become well known, such as [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[Vrankrijk]].
