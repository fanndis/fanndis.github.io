'''Fakhruddin Ahmed''' (born 1 May 1940) is a [[Bangladesh]]i economist, civil servant, and a former governor of the [[Bangladesh Bank]], the country's [[central bank]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailyasianage.com/news/119410/fakhruddin-ahmed|title=Fakhruddin Ahmed {{!}} The Asian Age Online, Bangladesh|website=The Asian Age|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

On 12 January 2007, he was appointed as the Chief Adviser (Head of the Government) of the non-party interim [[Caretaker Government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] of Bangladesh, amidst [[2006–2007 Bangladeshi political crisis|Bangladeshi political crisis in 2006]]. He continued in that post for nearly two years, a longer than usual time, but new elections were held in 29 December 2008, and the Awami League assumed power based on its majority.

== Early life and career ==
Ahmed was born on 1 May 1940 in [[Munshiganj District|Munshiganj]] to Mohiuddin Ahmed. He studied economics at [[Dhaka University]], where he obtained his BA (Hons) and MA in 1960 and 1961, respectively, standing first in his class both times.<ref>[http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_33306.shtml "Fakhruddin takes oath as new Chief Adviser"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113124141/http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_33306.shtml |date=13 January 2012 }}, ''The New Nation'', 12 January 2007, Retrieved on 12 January 2007 UTC</ref> He earned a master's degree in development economics from [[Williams College]] and a Ph.D. in economics from [[Princeton University]] in 1975. His doctoral dissertation was titled "Migration and employment in a multisector model; an application to Bangladesh."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Fakhruddin|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3266587|title=Migration and employment in a multisector model; an application to Bangladesh|date=1975|language=English}}</ref>

Ahmed started his career as a lecturer of economics in Dhaka University. Later, he joined the civil service of [[Pakistan]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], he served the civil service of Bangladesh until 1978.

That year, he joined the [[World Bank]], where he held various mid-level positions. On retirement  from the World Bank, he took  the post of Governor of the Central Bank of Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank) on 29 November 2001. His contract expired on 30 April 2005.

He then became Managing Director of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), the country's apex micro-finance organisation, beginning on 1 June 2005.<ref name="fakhruddin">{{cite news |last=Liton  |first=Shakhawat |date=13 January 2007 |title=Fakhruddin new CA |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/01/13/d7011301011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=12 January 2007}}</ref>

On 12 January 2007, [[Iajuddin Ahmed|President Iajuddin Ahmed]] swore him in as Chief Adviser to the Interim Caretaker Government, after the former interim government under the President was dissolved. Fakhruddin Ahmed is credited with bringing an end to the [[anarchy]] that had threatened to sweep the troubled nation. In a country widely perceived as one of the world's most corrupt, Ahmed stressed an anti-graft campaign against the establishment during his tenure.

More than 160 senior politicians, top civil servants, and security officials were arrested on charges of graft and other economic crimes.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=22 March 2007 |title=Corruption has emerged as a great threat |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1601618,00.html |magazine=Time}}</ref> Included were former ministers from the two main political parties, the [[Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh National Party]], including former prime ministers [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia]], and the former acting prime minister [[Fazlul Haque (judge)|Fazlul Haque]].

Ahmed fainted while giving a speech at a tree-planting event on 3 June 2007, apparently due to the heat, and was hospitalized.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ahmed |first=Parveen |date=3 June 2007 |title=Report: Bangladeshi Leader Faints |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/03/AR2007060300295.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh interim head collapses |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6716027.stm |work=BBC News |date=3 June 2007}}</ref> He was released from the hospital later the same day and has said that he was well.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200706/04/eng20070604_380493.html "Head of Bangladesh's caretaker government leaves hospital"], Xinhua (''People's Daily Online''), 4 June 2007.</ref>

Following the [[2008 Bangladeshi general election|elections in 2008]], a new parliament was formed. On 6 January 2009, the interim government made way for an elected [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] government, which had won a two-thirds majority.

Ahmed has since retired from the public sphere and is now living in the United States.
