}}'''Jayaben Desai''' (2 April 1933 – 23 December 2010) was a prominent leader of the strikers in the [[Grunwick dispute]] in [[London]] in 1976.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|title=Jayaben Desai obituary|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/28/jayaben-desai-obituary|accessdate=3 January 2011|location=London| first=Jack|last=Dromey|date=28 December 2010}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Dharmaj]], [[Gujarat]], India, Desai moved to [[Tanzania]], East Africa, in 1956. At the age of twenty two, she married Suryakant, a factory owner. The couple were from middle class mercantile backgrounds. They later moved to Britain before the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] made it harder for British passport holders from former British colonies to enter the country.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Lewis, Helen, 1983-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1129661369|title=Difficult women : a history of feminism in 11 fights|date=27 February 2020|isbn=978-1-78733-128-0|location=London|oclc=1129661369}}</ref>

== Grunwick Dispute ==
In Britain, she had to take up low-paid work, first as a sewing machinist, then processing film in the Grunwick factory.<ref name="guardian" />  She resigned after being ordered to work overtime, and instigated a strike among the mainly Asian and female workforce. The strikers protested about working conditions, pay inequality and institutionalised racism within the company.<ref>http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/asian/politics/grunwick.htm Jeyaben Desai part in the Grunwick Dispute</ref> Women were made to asked why they needed to go to the toilet, and Desai counselled her colleagues not to be intimidated by this, saying "Why should you feel ashamed, when he has no shame is asking you loudly. Learn how to say it in English "I want to go to the ladies" and then just say it without any hesitation".<ref name=":0" />

Desai led the strikers in their epic two-year picket from 1976 to 1978. The strike was backed by the Apex union and the local postal union initially refused to deliver the Grunwick photography laboratory post, until challenged with the support of the Tory party, at that time the government Opposition. 

Desai was an inspiring speaker, often forming memorable phrases, for example her parting shot to the boss when she led the walkout: "What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. But in a zoo there are many types of animals. Some are monkeys who dance on your fingertips, others are lions who can bite your head off. We are the lions, Mr Manager." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irr.org.uk/faces/desai.html|title=Jayaben Desai Biography at The Institute of Race Relations|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904100203/http://www.irr.org.uk/faces/desai.html|archivedate=2007-09-04}}</ref> Whilst on one of the thousand delegations the Grunwick strikers sent to factories across the country to raise supoort for the strike, Mrs Desai was challenged by a manager who said "You can't win with that sari on, why don't you change into a miniskirt?" Desai replied "I'll tell you something, manager. [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs Gandhi]] wears a sari and she runs a country of 600 million people. You can't even run a little factory".<ref name=":0" /> 

After the abortive hunger strike outside the [[Trades Union Congress]] headquarters in November 1977 she remarked: "Trade Union support is like honey on the elbow - you can smell it, you can feel it, but you cannot taste it."

The prime minister [[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]] appointed a judge, [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Justice Scarman]] to settle the dispute. Mrs Desai testified at length. Judge Scarman recommeded that the union should be recognised and the sacked workers reinstated. The factory owner ignored the report and the unions backed off, leaving the Grunwick strike committee to announce the strike was over on 14 July 1978.<ref name=":0" />

== After the strike ==
Desai returned to the sewing industry and later became a teacher at Harrow College. She passed her driving test at the age of 60 and encouraged other women to do so to increase their freedom.<ref name=":0" />

Mrs Desai (as she was always referred to) recorded her thoughts for the Brent Museum and archives. In an interview by Hannah Phung of Brent Museum she said: "It was amazing, let me tell you, it was amazing.[…] tears were in my eyes to see these people […] they were hurting themselves and the police were charging them with horses and everything and still they were standing strong."

Jayaben Desai died on 23 December 2010. Her family scattered her ashes near the sources of the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Ganges]] rivers and in [[Rotherhithe]] on the [[River Thames|Thames]].<ref name=":0" /> 

== Commemoration ==
On 14 December 2016 she was named as one of seven women chosen by [[BBC Radio Four]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' for their 2016 Power List, which was topped by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and also included [[Helen Brook]], [[Barbara Castle]], [[Germaine Greer]], [[Bridget Jones]] and [[Beyoncé]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38303886 "Margaret Thatcher tops Woman's Hour Power List"], BBC News, 14 December 2016.</ref>
