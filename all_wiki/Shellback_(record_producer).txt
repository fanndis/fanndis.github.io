'''Karl Johan Schuster''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjûːan ˈɧʏ̌sːtɛr|lang}}; born 1 February 1985), known professionally as '''Shellback''', is a Swedish record producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Shellback was listed as the No. 1 producer of 2012 on ''Billboard'' magazine's year end chart, and he also topped the list of their "Top 10 Songwriters Airplay Chart" the same year; he has won four [[Grammy Award]]s.

He regularly collaborates with songwriter [[Max Martin]], and together they have produced, written, or co-written songs for [[Pink (singer)|P!nk]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Adele]], and [[Maroon 5]]. Shellback has also collaborated with fellow producer [[Benny Blanco]] and has produced songs by himself, including "[[Want U Back]]" by [[Cher Lloyd]] and "[[Animals (Maroon 5 song)|Animals]]" by Maroon 5.

==Life and career==
Karl Johan Schuster was born and raised in [[Karlshamn]], Sweden. He started as a drummer in local [[indie rock]] bands in Karlshamn, as well as recording all instruments on the 2003 Meriah demo ''...Turn Him Your Other Cheek'' (a strictly [[black metal]] recording), before joining the hardcore-metal scene as a [[Singing|vocalist]] in 2004 for [[Blinded Colony]], with whom he recorded 2005's ''Promo Demo'' and 2006's ''[[Bedtime Prayers]]'', drawing comparisons to fellow Swedish [[melodic death metal]] band [[In Flames]], before leaving in 2007. In 2005 he also performed as a guest musician on the [[Faith (band)|Faith]] album ''[[Sorg]]''.

At the age of 16, Schuster met Max Martin through their mutual friend Julius. By that time, according to an interview in the Swedish music magazine ''Stim-magasinet'', Schuster's taste in music was "too cool for school" and he had no interest in pop music whatsoever. Julius kept sending Schuster's indie rock-death metal demos to Martin, who became curious about what it would sound like if Schuster would make pop music. So in 2006 Martin invited Schuster to his studio in Stockholm to record a demo with him, and since 2007 Schuster has been signed to Martin's production company [[Maratone]].<ref name="MaratoneFrontPage">{{cite web| title=Maratone| url=http://www.maratone.se/| accessdate=2 February 2009 | work=[[Maratone]] official website| publisher=maratone.se| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maratone.se%2F&date=2009-02-01| archivedate=2 February 2009}}</ref>

Among the first songs Schuster co-wrote with Martin are [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s 2008 single "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]" and [[Britney Spears]]' 2008 single "[[If U Seek Amy]]".<ref>{{cite web| title=Pink hyllade svenske Johan| url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1360260/pink-hyllade-svenske-johan| accessdate=5 January 2009| last=Eigert | first=Av Ann-Marie| date=6 November 2008| work=[[Expressen]]| publisher=AB Kvällstidningen Expressen| language=Swedish| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressen.se%2Fnoje%2F1.1360260%2Fpink-hyllade-svenske-johan&date=2009-02-01| archivedate=2 February 2009}}</ref> In 2012 Schuster won the STIM Platinum guitar prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stim.se/en|title=There is value in music|website=Stim.se|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref>
In 2014, Schuster produced "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]" alongside Martin and [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]].<ref name="problem">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-ariana-grande-and-max-martin-made-problem-the-song-of-the-summer-20140522 |title=How Ariana Grande and Max Martin Made 'Problem' the Song of the Summer |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=22 May 2014 |access-date=2 June 2014}}</ref>
In 2015, Shellback collaborated with Swedish [[hardcore punk]] band [[Refused]], as he is both a fan of the band's music and friends with the band's drummer David Sandstrom. Sandstrom sent him the versions of the songs "Elektra" and "366" that Refused had recorded with producer [[Nick Launay]], and Shellback replied with his own arrangements of the two songs. Refused frontman [[Dennis Lyxzen]] explained in June 2015 that Shellback's versions were "far more Refused than our versions" and "were better" than the Launay-produced versions. The two songs appear on Refused's comeback album ''[[Freedom (Refused album)|Freedom]]''—"Elektra" was released as a single on 27 April 2015—which was released on the label [[Epitaph Records]] on 26 June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Lamington23|title=Refused on lying, selling out and Taylor Swift|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/43137/Refused-on-lying-selling-out-and-Taylor-Swift|website=FasterLouder|publisher=FasterLouder Pty Ltd|access-date=28 June 2015|date=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628081410/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/43137/Refused-on-lying-selling-out-and-Taylor-Swift#|archive-date=28 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>
