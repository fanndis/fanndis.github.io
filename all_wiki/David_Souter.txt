'''David Hackett Souter''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|t|ər}} {{respell|SOO|tər}}; born September 17, 1939) is a retired [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. He served from October 1990 to his retirement in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pr_05-01-09.html |title=Press Release |date=February 13, 2009 |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}</ref> Appointed by [[US President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] to fill the seat that had been vacated by [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], Souter sat on both the [[Rehnquist Court|Rehnquist]] and the [[Roberts Court|Roberts]] Courts.

Souter grew up in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and attended [[Harvard College]]; [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; and [[Harvard Law School]]. After briefly working in private practice, he moved to public service. He served as a prosecutor (1966–1968), in the [[New Hampshire Attorney General]]'s office (1968–1976), as the Attorney General of New Hampshire (1976–1978), as an Associate Justice of the [[Superior Court of New Hampshire]] (1978–1983), as an Associate Justice of the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] (1983–1990) and briefly as a Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] (1990).<ref name="nytimesprofile" />

Souter was nominated to the Supreme Court without a significant "paper trail", but was expected to be a conservative justice. Within a few years of his appointment, Souter moved towards the ideological center. He eventually came to vote reliably with the [[ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices|Court's liberal wing]].<ref name="nytimesprofile">{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/david_h_souter/index.html |title=David H.

In mid-2009, after Democrat [[Barack Obama]] took office as U.S. president, Souter announced his retirement from the Court. He was succeeded by [[Sonia Sotomayor]]. Souter has continued to hear cases [[visiting judge|by designation]] at the [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court level]].

== Early life and education ==
Souter was born in [[Melrose, Massachusetts]], on September 17, 1939, the only child of Joseph Alexander Souter (1904–1976) and Helen Adams (Hackett) Souter (1907–1995).<ref name="biography">Yarbrough, Tinsley E.

Souter graduated second in his class from [[Concord High School (New Hampshire)|Concord High School]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concord.k12.nh.us/alumni/hist/disting/notables.htm |title=CONCORD HIGH SCHOOL NOTABLES |publisher=Concord High School |access-date=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221172824/http://www.concord.k12.nh.us/alumni/hist/disting/notables.htm |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> He then attended [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1961 with an [[A.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in [[philosophy]] and writing a senior thesis on the [[legal positivism]] of Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] While at Harvard, Souter was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref>[http://www.pbk.org/userfiles/file/Famous%20Members/PBKSupremeCourtJustices.pdf Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082723/http://www.pbk.org/userfiles/file/Famous%20Members/PBKSupremeCourtJustices.pdf |date=September 28, 2011 }}, Phi Beta Kappa website<!-- accessed Oct 4, 2009 --></ref> He was selected as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (later promoted to a [[Master of Arts]] degree, [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|as per tradition]]) from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], in 1963. He then entered Harvard Law School, graduating in 1966.

== Early career ==

In 1968, after two years as an associate at the law firm of Orr & Reno in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], Souter realized he disliked private practice<ref name="biography" /> and began his career in public service by accepting a position as an Assistant Attorney General of New Hampshire. As Assistant Attorney General he [[prosecuted]] criminal cases in the courts. In 1971, [[Warren Rudman]], then the [[Attorney General of New Hampshire]], selected Souter to be the Deputy Attorney General. Souter succeeded Rudman as New Hampshire Attorney General in 1976.

In 1978, with the support of his friend Rudman, Souter was named an Associate Justice of the [[Superior Court of New Hampshire]].<ref name="biography" /> As a judge on the Superior Court he heard cases in two counties and was noted for his tough sentencing.<ref name="biography" /> With four years of trial court experience, Souter was appointed to the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] as an Associate Justice in 1983.<ref name="Gerstenzang, James">{{cite news |last1=Gerstenzang |first1=James |last2=Lauter |first2=David |title=Little-Known Judge Named to Replace Brennan on Court : Judiciary: David Souter served as New Hampshire justice and attorney general.

Shortly after George H. W. Bush was sworn in as President, he nominated Souter for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]. Souter had had seven years of judicial experience at the appellate level, four years at the trial court level, and ten years with the Attorney General's office. He was confirmed by unanimous consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on April 27, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/101st-congress/1016|title=PN1016 - Nomination of David H.

== U.S. Supreme Court appointment ==
President George H. W. Bush originally considered appointing [[Clarence Thomas]] to Brennan's seat, but decided that Thomas did not have enough experience as a judge.<ref name="abc news">Greenberg, Jan Crawford [https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3664944&page=1 Clarence Thomas: A Silent Justice Speaks Out], [[ABC News]], September 30, 2007<!-- accessed 2008-10-18 --></ref> Warren Rudman, who had since been elected to the U.S. Senate, and former New Hampshire Governor [[John H. Sununu]], then Chief of Staff to President Bush, suggested Souter, and were instrumental in his nomination and confirmation. At the time, few observers outside New Hampshire knew who Souter was,<ref name="nytimes">Greenhouse, Linda [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/03/news/souter-anchoring-the-court-s-new-center.html Souter Anchoring the Court's New Center], ''The New York Times'', July 3, 1992<!-- accessed 2008-06-27 --></ref> although he had reportedly been on Reagan's short list of nominees for the Supreme Court seat that eventually went to [[Anthony Kennedy]].

Souter was seen as a "stealth justice" whose professional record in the state courts provoked little real controversy and provided a minimal "paper trail"<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/opinion/02rosen.html "Stealth Justice"], ''The New York Times'', May 1, 2009<!-- retrieved May 10, 2009 --></ref> on issues of U.S. Constitutional law. Bush saw the lack of a paper trail as an asset, because one of [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s nominees, [[Robert Bork]], had been rejected by the Senate partially because of his extensive written opinions on controversial issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2m3B3oX|title=The Justice Who Built the Trump Court|last=Greenfield|first=Jeff|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Bush nominated Souter on July 25, 1990, saying that he did not know Souter's stances on [[abortion]], [[affirmative action]], or other issues.<ref name="biography" /><ref name="about">[http://uspolitics.about.com/od/usgovernment/a/supreme_court_3.htm US Supreme Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128170158/http://uspolitics.about.com/od/usgovernment/a/supreme_court_3.htm |date=November 28, 2005 }}, about.com</ref>

[[File:David Souter at one of his confirmation hearings.jpg|thumb|left|Souter testifying during one of his confirmation hearings]]
Senate confirmation hearings were held beginning on September 13, 1990. The [[National Organization for Women]] opposed Souter's nomination and held a rally outside the Senate during his confirmation hearings.<ref name="biography" /> The president of NOW, [[Molly Yard]], testified that Souter would "end freedom for women in this country."<ref name="washpost">Kamen, Al [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/18/AR2005091801188.html For Liberals, Easy Does It With Roberts], ''The Washington Post'', September 19, 2005 <!-- accessdate 2008-06-28 --></ref> Souter was also opposed by the [[NAACP]], which urged its 500,000 members to write letters to their senators asking them to oppose the nomination.<ref name="nytimes naacp">Molotsky, Irvin [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/22/us/naacp-urges-souter-s-defeat-citing-earlier-statements-on-race.html N.A.A.C.P.

{{quote|The first lesson, simple as it is, is that whatever court we are in, whatever we are doing, whether we are in a trial court or an appellate court, at the end of our task some human being is going to be affected. Some human life is going to be changed in some way by what we do, whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it as appellate judges, as far removed from the trial arena as it is possible to be. And so we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and our beings to get those rulings right.<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh101-1263/49-52.pdf Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Senate Hearing 101–1263] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106221819/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh101-1263/49-52.pdf |date=January 6, 2010 }}, Hearings on the Nomination of David H.

The nine senators voting against Souter included [[Ted Kennedy]] and [[John Kerry]] from Souter's neighboring state of [[Massachusetts]]. These senators, along with seven others, painted Souter as a right-winger in the mold of Robert Bork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emkinstitute.org/resources/warren-rudman-oral-history-senator-new-hampshire|title=Warren Rudman Oral History, Senator, New Hampshire|last1=Boston|first1=Edward M.

== U.S. Supreme Court career ==
Souter opposed having cameras in the Supreme Court during oral arguments because he said questions would be taken out of context by the media and the proceedings would be politicized.<ref name="AP">[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/30/us/on-cameras-in-supreme-court-souter-says-over-my-dead-body.html On Cameras in Supreme Court, Souter Says, 'Over My Dead Body'], ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1996 <!-- accessed 2009-10-14 --></ref>

He also served as the court's designated representative to Congress on at least one occasion, testifying before committees of that body about the court's needs for additional funding to refurbish its building and for other projects.<ref name="biography" />

=== Expected conservatism ===
At the time of Souter's appointment, John Sununu assured President Bush and conservatives that Souter would be a "home run" for conservatism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/us/conservative-says-sununu-assured-him-on-souter.html|title=Conservative Says Sununu Assured Him on Souter|last1=Shenon|first1=Philip|date=1990-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-18|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In his testimony before the Senate, he was thought by conservatives to be a [[strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] on constitutional matters, but he portrayed himself as a moderate who disliked radical change and attached a high importance to precedent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CHRG-SOUTER/pdf/GPO-CHRG-SOUTER.pdf|title=Hearings Before the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate on the Nomination of David H.

After the appointment of [[Clarence Thomas]], Souter moved to the ideological middle.<ref name="nytimes" /> In two 1992 cases, Souter voted with the Court's liberal wing: ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', in which the Court reaffirmed the essential holding in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''; and ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', in which Souter voted against allowing [[prayer]] at a high school graduation ceremony. In ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', Kennedy considered overturning ''Roe'' and upholding all the restrictions at issue in ''Casey.'' Souter considered upholding all the restrictions but was uneasy about overturning ''Roe''. After consulting with O'Connor, the three (who came to be known as the "troika") developed a joint opinion that upheld all the restrictions in ''Casey'' except the mandatory notification of a husband while asserting the essential holding of ''Roe'', that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whitman|first=Christina|date=June 2002|title=Looking Back on Planned Parenthood v.

By the late 1990s, Souter began to align himself more with [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], although as of 1995, he sided on more occasions with the more liberal<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23stevens-t.html The Dissenter: Majority of One, Stevens at the Supreme Court], ''The New York Times'', September 23, 2007</ref> justice [[John Paul Stevens]] than either Breyer or Ginsburg, both Clinton appointees.<ref name="national review">Ponnuru, Ramesh [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n17_v47/ai_17374429 Empty Souter-Supreme Court Justice David Souter], ''National Review'', September 11, 1995 <!-- accessdate 2008-06-27 --></ref> O'Connor began to move to the center. On death penalty cases, worker rights cases, criminal rights cases, and other issues, Souter began voting with the Court's liberals,<ref>(see [[Segal-Cover score]])</ref> and came to be considered part of the Court's liberal wing. Because of this, many conservatives view Souter's appointment an error of the Bush presidency.<ref>Greenfield, Jeff [https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/09/david-souter-the-supreme-court-justice-who-built-the-trump-court-218953 David Souter: The Justice Who Built The Trump Court] ''Politico Magazine'', July 9, 2018</ref> For example, after widespread speculation that President George W.

A ''Wall Street Journal'' opinion piece ten years after Souter's nomination called Souter a "liberal jurist" and said that Rudman took "pride in recounting how he sold Mr. Souter to gullible White House Chief of Staff John Sununu as a confirmable conservative. Then they both sold the judge to President Bush, who wanted above all else to avoid a confirmation battle."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB951789438683921325|title=Chief Justice Souter?|date=2000-02-29|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-10-18|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Rudman wrote in his memoir that he had "suspected all along" that Souter would not "overturn activist liberal precedents."<ref name="biography" /> Sununu later said that he had "a lot of disappointment" in Souter's positions on the court and would have preferred him to be more like Scalia.<ref name="biography" />

=== Notable decisions ===

==== ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' ====
{{Expand section|needs non-primary sources. Expert please?|date=February 2016}}

In 1992's ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', Souter wrote that ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' should not be overturned because it would be "a surrender to political pressure... So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833|title=Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>

==== ''Bush v. Gore'' ====
In 2000, Souter voted along with three other justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' to allow the presidential election recount to continue while the majority voted to end the recount. The decision allowed the declaration of [[George W. Bush|Bush]] as the winner of the election in Florida to stand.

[[Jeffrey Toobin]] wrote, controversially, of Souter's reaction to ''Bush v. Gore'' in his 2007 book ''[[The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court|The Nine]]'': <!-- please do not use template:cquote, as this gives too much weight to these words. --> {{quote|Toughened, or coarsened, by their worldly lives, the other dissenters could shrug and move on, but Souter couldn't. His whole life was being a judge. He came from a tradition where the independence of the judiciary was the foundation of the rule of law. And Souter believed ''Bush v. Gore'' mocked that tradition. His colleagues' actions were so transparently, so crudely partisan that Souter thought he might not be able to serve with them anymore. Souter seriously considered resigning. For many months, it was not at all clear whether he would remain as a justice. That the Court met in a city he loathed made the decision even harder. At the urging of a handful of close friends, he decided to stay on, but his attitude toward the Court was never the same. There were times when David Souter thought of ''Bush v. Gore'' and wept.<ref name="wsjlawblog">[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/09/06/did-bush-v-gore-make-justice-souter-weep/ Did Bush v. Gore Make Justice Souter Weep?], ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 6, 2007<!-- accessdate 2008-06-27 --></ref>}}

The above passage was disputed by Souter's longtime friend Warren Rudman. Rudman told the ''New Hampshire Union Leader'' that while Souter was discomfited by ''Bush v. Gore'', it was not true that he had broken down into tears over it.<ref name="wsjlawblog" />

=== Relationship with other justices ===
[[File:USSC justice group photo-2005 current.jpg|thumb|Justice Souter (second from the left in the back row) on the [[Rehnquist Court]]]]
Souter worked well with [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and had a good relationship with both her and her husband during her days on the court.<ref name="biography" /> He generally had a good working relationship with every justice, but was particularly fond of [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and considered [[John Paul Stevens]] to be the "smartest" justice.<ref name="biography" />

=== International recognition ===
Even though Souter had never traveled outside the United States during his years with the Supreme Court, he still gained significant recognition abroad. In 1995, a series of articles based on his written opinions and titled "Souter Court" was published by a Moscow legal journal, ''The Russian Justice''. Those were followed by a book, written in Russian and bearing Souter's name in the title.<ref>Петр Баренбойм, "3000 лет доктрины разделения властей: Суд Сьютера", M., 1996. / Petr Barenboim, "3000 years of the separation of powers doctrine: Souter court", Moscow, 1996; 2nd ed., 2003. / {{ISBN|5-7619-0015-7}}, http://lccn.loc.gov/2001434516</ref> Justice of the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]] Yury Danilov, reviewing the 2nd edition of the book in a Moscow English-language daily, made the following remark on Souter's position in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'': "In a most critical and delicate situation, David Souter had maintained the independence of his position and in this respect had become a symbol of the independence of the judiciary."<ref>Yury Danilov, The Judiciary: From Samuel to Souter, ''The Moscow News'', October 15, 2003.</ref><ref>Peter Barenboim, [http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf «Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers», Moscow, 2005], p.163, {{ISBN|5-94381-123-0}}</ref>

She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 6.

On June 29, 2009, the last day of the Court's 2008–09 term, Chief Justice Roberts read a letter to Souter that had been signed by all eight of his colleagues as well as retired Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], thanking him for his service, and Souter read a letter to his colleagues reciprocating their good wishes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Kate |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/souter-and-justices-exchange-farewells/ |title=Souter and Justices Exchange Farewells |work=The New York Times |date=June 29, 2009}}</ref>

As a Supreme Court justice with retired status, Souter remains a judge and is entitled to sit [[by designation]] on lower courts. Since his retirement from the Supreme Court, he regularly sits by designation on panels of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]], based in Boston and covering Maine, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, and his native New Hampshire, generally in February or March of each year.<ref name="2010report">{{cite web

== Personal life ==
Once named by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as one of ''Washington's 10 Most Eligible Bachelors'',<ref name="biography" /> Souter has never married, though he was once engaged.<ref>Totenberg, Nina [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103694193 "Supreme Court Justice Souter To Retire"], NPR, April 30, 2009</ref>

In 2004, Souter was mugged while jogging between his home and the [[Fort Lesley J. McNair]] Army Base in Washington, DC. He suffered minor injuries from the event, visiting the [[MedStar Washington Hospital Center]] for treatment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/us/justice-souter-is-attacked-while-jogging.html|title=Justice Souter Is Attacked While Jogging|date=2004-05-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The issue led to public questioning of the [[Supreme Court Police]]'s security detail, which was not present at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blackmun, Harry A. (1908-1999), Supreme Court justice|last=Yarbrough|first=Tinsley E.|date=January 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=American National Biography Online|doi = 10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1101205}}</ref>

According to [[Jeffrey Toobin]]'s 2007 book ''The Nine'', Souter has a decidedly low-tech lifestyle: He writes with a [[fountain pen]], does not use e-mail, and has no cell phone or [[answering machine]]. While he was serving on the Supreme Court, he preferred to drive back to New Hampshire for the summer where he enjoyed mountain climbing.<ref name="biography" /> Souter has also done his own [[home repair]]s<ref name="NYT">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/us/04souter.html A No-Frills Embrace for a Low-Key Justice], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 3, 2009</ref> and is known for his daily lunch of an apple and yogurt.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13611101|title=Following Souter|date=2009-05-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-03-13|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

Former Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse wrote of Souter: "to focus on his eccentricities—his daily lunch of yogurt and an apple, core and all; the absence of a computer in his personal office—is to miss the essence of a man who in fact is perfectly suited to his job, just not to its trappings. His polite but persistent questioning of lawyers who appear before the court displays his meticulous preparation and his mastery of the case at hand and the cases relevant to it. Far from being out of touch with the modern world, he has simply refused to surrender to it control over aspects of his own life that give him deep contentment: hiking, sailing, time with old friends, reading history."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/weekinreview/03greenhouse.html|title=David H. Souter: Justice Unbound|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|date=2009-05-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-13|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In early August 2009, Souter moved from his family farm house in [[Weare, New Hampshire|Weare]] to a [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape Cod-style]] single-floor home in [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire]], a town adjacent to the state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Souter told a disappointed Weare neighbor that the two-story family farmhouse was not structurally sound enough to support the thousands of books he owns and that he wished to live on one level.<ref name="nyt 20090803">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/us/04souter.html Off the Bench, Souter Leaves Farmhouse Behind], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 3, 2009</ref>

Over the years, Souter has served on hospital boards and civic committees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/us/man-in-the-news-an-intellectual-mind-david-hackett-souter.html |title=An 'Intellectual Mind': David Hackett Souter |author=Linda Greenhouse |work=The New York Times |date=July 24, 1990 |access-date=March 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/05/20/whats-in-souters-future-civics-for-starters/ |title=What's in Souter's Future?
