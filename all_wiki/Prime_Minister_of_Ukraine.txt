The '''prime minister of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Прем'єр-міністр України}}, {{lang|uk-Latn|Prem'ier-ministr Ukrayiny}}) is [[Ukraine]]'s [[head of government]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IMaWuaYRnQC&pg=PA187&dq=Prime+Minister+of+Ukraine+head+of+government&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfrM_V0trPAhWkHsAKHcLlDmMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=Prime%20Minister%20of%20Ukraine%20head%20of%20government&f=false Economic Interdependence in Ukrainian-Russian Relations] by [[Paul J. D'Anieri]], [[State University of New York Press]], 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-4246-3}} (page 187)</ref> presiding over the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], which is the highest body of the executive branch of the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]]. The position replaced the Soviet post of the chairman of Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, which was established on March 25, 1946.

Since Ukrainian independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, there have been sixteen prime ministers,<ref name=Guar15UkrPM>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/eugenia-tymoshenko-fight-to-save-mother-yulia Eugenia Tymoshenko: the fight to save my mother Yulia], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (23 September 2012)</ref> or twenty, counting acting PMs. [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] was the first woman appointed prime minister in history of Ukraine. [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] was the first prime minister who came from [[Western Ukraine]]. Two prime ministers were born in the [[Russian SFSR]].

The current prime minister is [[Denys Shmyhal]] who was sworn in on 4 March 2020 following the resignation of [[Oleksiy Honcharuk]].<ref name="btkpBermetHastyB">{{cite news |last1=Talant |first1=Bermet |title=Hasty government reshuffle sows disquiet at home, abroad |publisher=Kyiv Post |date=6 March 2020 |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/hasty-government-reshuffle-sows-disquiet-at-home-abroad.html}}</ref>

==Appointment==
The prime minister is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine|president]] with the consent of the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. The consent is deemed granted by the parliament when a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] of its constitutional membership votes in favour of the candidate nominated by the president. The highest parliamentary approval to date was received by [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] who was appointed the prime minister on February 4, 2005, with 373 votes in the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Other prime ministers who received more than 300 votes were [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] (371), Yatsenyuk again in 2014 (341)<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/236676.html Ukrainian parliament appoints Yatseniuk prime minister], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 November 2014)</ref> [[Vitold Fokin]] (332), and [[Leonid Kuchma]] (316).

The procedure of granting consent by the parliament is usually preceded by several days of comprehensive consultations and interviews of the candidate by the parliamentary factions. The approval by the legislature is not a mere formality. Some candidates were ratified by a narrow margin and a candidate may be turned down. For instance, in 1999, [[Valeriy Pustovoitenko]] fell three votes short of being re-confirmed after he tendered his resignation at the second inauguration of President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999. Kuchma chose [[Viktor Yushchenko]] as his alternative candidate. Another example is the approval of [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]]'s candidacy (he fell three votes short of approval, but was confirmed on the second attempt two days later).

After the constitutional reform of late 2004, the president was restricted in his choice of prime minister and was virtually obliged to nominate the person proposed by the parliamentary coalition. The prime minister, as with all members of executive branch, cannot be a [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|member of parliament]].

==Duties and powers==
[[File:P031214PS-0710 (14104760453).jpg|thumb|left|Then-[[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Barack Obama]] talks with then-Prime Minister [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] at the conclusion of their bilateral meeting in the [[Oval Office]], March 12, 2014.]]

The prime minister heads Ukraine's executive branch of government, the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]], and signs decrees passed by the Cabinet.

The prime minister has the authority to propose candidates for ministry offices to the Verkhovna Rada,<ref name="YanichoosesPM">[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/49986.html Government approves draft law on cabinet according to which president appoints premier], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (October 5, 2010)</ref> with the exception of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|minister of foreign affairs]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|minister of defense]], which are proposed by the president. The prime minister can also propose candidates for the heads of regional administrations to the president for consideration.<ref name=YanichoosesPM/>

The prime minister can also countersign decrees and laws passed by the president. The constitution is silent on the exact regulation of the countersigning. The prime minister (and the respective minister) are responsible for the execution of laws passed by the cabinet.

While in office, the prime minister is granted full [[Sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] from all prosecutions and legal proceedings. The prime minister's office is headquartered in the Cabinet of Ministries building in central [[Kyiv]]. The prime minister was paid a yearly salary of 202,776 [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]] (16,898/month) (US$26,770) in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The salary of Yushchenko rose 9 times – to $4.5 thousand|work=NTA-Privolzhye|date=2005-07-14|accessdate=December 25, 2008|url=http://www.nta-nn.ru/news/item/?ID=79842|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224218/http://www.nta-nn.ru/news/item/?ID=79842|archive-date=October 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2013, following a petition in ''Fokus'' magazine, the secretariat of the cabinet stated that the monthly salary of the prime minister was 33,980 [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]] (US$4,173.42), which is eleven times more than the average salary in the country.<ref>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/01/24/6982154/ Azarov receives more than 30 thousands in a month (Азаров отримує більше 30 тисяч на місяць)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 2013-1-24</ref>
 
Prime ministers are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems, sometimes successfully. In 2012, Prime Minister Azarov received dozens of personal pleas every day on his [[Facebook#Website|Facebook page]].<ref name=helpmeprespm/> By-passing [[Local government in Ukraine|local governments]] is an age-old practice in Ukraine.<ref name=helpmeprespm>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125579/ Help Me, Father Czar!], [[Kyiv Post]] (5 April 2012)</ref>
 
===Acting and vice-prime ministers===

{{Main article|First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine}}
 
The first vice-prime minister, also known as the first deputy, heads the cabinet in the absence of the prime minister due to resignation or dismissal. Among the most notable First deputies were [[Yukhym Zvyahilsky]] and [[Mykola Azarov]], who served as the acting prime minister for a longer period of time than anyone else. [[Valentyn Symonenko]], [[Vasyl Durdynets]], [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] and others also served as acting prime minister.
 
Apart from the first vice-prime minister, there are also several other vice-ministers who support the prime minister and may be in charge of one or more ministries. In 1991–1992 the office of the state minister was also introduced. Traditionally vice-prime ministers are in charge of an area of general state government policy such as the agro-industrial complex, humanitarian affairs, economic affairs, or regional policy. On certain occasions, those deputies may be given regular ministerial portfolios as well, as happened in the 2010 [[Azarov Government]].

==Dismissal and resignation==
The prime minister, like other Cabinet members, may resign voluntarily by tendering their resignation to parliament (according to the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the prime minister can only be dismissed by parliamentary vote).<ref name="president200117091753873b">[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/ukraine-pm-offers-resign-alleged-slurs-president-200117091753873.html Ukraine President Zelenskyy rejects PM's resignation], [[Al Jazeera English]] (17 January 2020)</ref><ref name="653410Honcharuk">{{in lang|uk}} [https://m.glavcom.ua/publications/trimayte-mene-semero-chim-zavershitsya-vidstavka-goncharuka-653410.html "Keep me seven."

Before the constitutional reform of 2004, the prime minister was usually dismissed unilaterally by the president. After the reform, the prime minister can only be dismissed by the parliament.<ref name="653410Honcharuk"/><ref name="7237648Honcharuk"/> Formally, the Verkhovna Rada needed to pass a [[Motion of no confidence|resolution of no confidence]] of the cabinet, which had to result in the prime minister's resignation. However, the parliament could not put such a resolution to the vote within one year of the approval of the cabinet's official programme.<ref name="7237561TymoshenkoPM">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/01/16/7237561/ Tymoshenko wants change of power: "Let them return to their 95s"], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (16 January 2020)</ref> The Cabinets of prime ministers [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were dismissed in this way, with the latter refusing to tender his resignation to the president claiming a violation of the one-year period condition. The Cabinet of [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]] had also been formally dismissed, but the parliamentary act was subsequently repealed.
