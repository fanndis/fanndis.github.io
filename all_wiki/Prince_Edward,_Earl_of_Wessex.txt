'''Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex''' {{Post-nominals|country= GBR|size= 100%|sep= ,|KGr|GCVO|CD|ADC(P)}} (Edward Antony Richard Louis; born 10 March 1964)<ref name=Buck1>{{cite web|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5561.asp |work= Members of The Royal Family |title= TRH The Earl and Countess of Wessex |publisher= Buckingham Palace |accessdate= 19 March 2008 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080308203311/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5561.asp |archivedate= 8 March 2008 }}</ref> is the youngest child of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. At birth, he was third in [[line of succession to the British throne]]; he is currently 11th in line.

Born at [[Buckingham Palace]], Edward studied at [[Heatherdown School]] before earning his A-levels at [[Gordonstoun]] where he was made guardian. He graduated from [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1989 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Faculty of History, University of Cambridge|History]]. Following a brief stint in the [[Royal Marines]], Edward worked as a theatre production assistant, and later formed his own television company, Ardent Productions. The Earl stepped down from the company in 2002 to begin full-time duties as a working member of the royal family, and undertakes engagements on behalf of the Queen. His charity work focuses on sport, [[the arts]], and the development of the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award]], which centers around fitness, wellbeing, and community service.

Prince Edward was made [[Earl of Wessex]] prior to marrying [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Sophie Rhys-Jones]] in 1999. The couple have two children: [[Lady Louise Windsor]] and [[James, Viscount Severn]]. He was given the additional title of [[Earl of Forfar]] in 2019.

==Early life and education==

Prince Edward was born on 10 March 1964, at [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43268 |date=11 March 1964 |page=2255 }}</ref> as the third son, and the fourth and youngest child of [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. He was christened on 2 May 1964 in the private chapel at [[Windsor Castle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor_18.htm|title=Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|accessdate=7 January 2009|work=The House of Windsor|publisher=English Monarchs|quote=He was baptised on 2 May 1964, at the private chapel at Windsor Castle by the Dean of Windsor and was given the names Edward Anthony Richard Louis.}}</ref> by the [[Dean of Windsor]], [[Robin Woods]].{{efn|Edward's godparents were: [[Prince Richard of Gloucester]] (his mother's cousin); the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] (his mother's cousin-in-law, for whom [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], his mother's aunt, stood proxy); [[Princess George William of Hanover]] (his aunt); the [[Louis, Prince of Hesse and by Rhine|Prince of Hesse and by Rhine]] (his first cousin twice removed); and the [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]] (his uncle).<ref name="Yvonne">{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings|website=users.uniserve.com|access-date=31 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806125845/http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|archive-date=6 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

As with his older siblings, a [[governess]] was appointed to look after Edward and was responsible for his early education at Buckingham Palace before he attended Gibbs School in Kensington. In September 1972, he joined [[Heatherdown School]], near [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] in [[Berkshire]]. Later, as his father and elder brothers had done before him, he moved to [[Gordonstoun]], in northern Scotland, and was appointed [[head boy]] in his last term. Edward obtained a C-grade and two D-grades at [[A-level]],<ref>{{cite news|title=The family qualifications|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 October 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531553/The-family-qualifications.html}}</ref> and after leaving school spent a [[gap year]] abroad, working as a house tutor and junior master for two terms at the [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wanganui Collegiate School [Summary]|url=http://www.heritage.org.nz/the-list/details/9620|website=Heritage New Zealand|accessdate=26 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130112439/http://www.heritage.org.nz/the-list/details/9620|archivedate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|first1=Hugh Montagu|last2=Cooksey [ed.]|first2=Jon|title=Blood and Iron: Letters from the Western Front|date=2011|publisher=Casement|isbn=9781848844919|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAlT5D703SAC&pg=PA218}}</ref>

Upon his return to Britain, Edward studied at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where he read History. His admission to Cambridge caused some controversy, since his A-level grades were far below the standard normally required for Oxbridge entrance, "straight As".<ref>{{cite news|title=The prince with a difference| date=11 June 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/royal_wedding/363894.stm|work=BBC News}}</ref> Edward graduated in 1986 as [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] ([[British undergraduate degree classification|lower second class honours]]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waston |first1=Jeremy |title=William enjoys a degree of success |url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/William-enjoys-a-degree-of.2634447.jp |access-date=27 November 2020 |publisher=The Scotsman |date=3 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203030808/http://news.scotsman.com/news/William-enjoys-a-degree-of.2634447.jp |archive-date=3 December 2010}}</ref>

==Post-university==
===Royal Marines===
Upon leaving university in 1986, Prince Edward joined the [[Royal Marines]], who had paid £12,000 towards his tuition at Cambridge University on condition of future service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/12/world/commando-life-losing-appeal-for-prince.html |title=Commando Life Losing Appeal for Prince? |website=The New York Times|date=12 January 1987|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> In January 1987, Edward dropped out of the gruelling commando course after having completed just one-third of the 12-month training. Media reported that the move prompted a berating from Prince Philip, who was the [[Captain General Royal Marines]] at that time and "reduced his son to prolonged tears",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095504,00.html|title=Edward Goes His Own Way |date=26 January 1987 |website=people.com |publisher=People |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> while others stated that Philip was the most sympathetic family member toward his son's decision.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ingrid |last=Seward|title=My Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of the Royal Marriage|year=2017|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1471159589|chapter=Chapter 9: Watching the Family Grow}}</ref>

===Theatre and television===
After leaving the Marines, Edward opted for a career in entertainment. He commissioned the 1986 musical ''[[Cricket (musical)|Cricket]]'' from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]], for his mother's 60th birthday celebration, which led to a job offer at Lloyd Webber's [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Theatre Company]], where he worked as a [[production assistant]] on musicals such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Starlight Express]]'', and ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-19/entertainment/ca-37020_1_prince-edward-theater |title=Prince Edward Joins the Theater at 'Lowest Rung' |website=LA Times|date=19 January 1988 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> While there he met actress [[Ruthie Henshall]], whom he dated for three years.

Edward's first foray into television production was the programme ''[[The Grand Knockout Tournament]]'', informally known as ''It's a Royal Knockout'', on 15 June 1987, in which four teams sponsored by him, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] and the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]] competed for charity. The programme was criticized by the media and the public, and it was later reported that the Queen was not in favour of the event, with her courtiers having advised against it.<ref>Ben Pimlott [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/royals/readings/polish.html "Polishing Their Image"], extract from ''The Queen'', HarperCollins (1996) reprinted on the PBS Frontline webpage</ref> The programme raised over £1,000,000 for its selected charities.

===Ardent Productions===
In 1993, Edward formed the television production company Ardent Productions.<ref name="Beckett">{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Beckett|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/05/themonarchy.broadcasting|title=It's a royal cock-up|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=5 March 2002}}</ref> Ardent was involved in the production of a number of documentaries and dramas,<ref name="BFI">[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b98a73e44 Ardent Productions Filmography], BFI Film & TV Database</ref> but Edward was accused in the media of using his royal connections for financial gain,<ref>{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Karlin|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/26/entertainment/ca-26454|title=Edward Windsor: Truly a Prince Among Producers|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1998}}</ref> and the company was referred to by some industry insiders as "a sad joke" due to a perceived lack of professionalism in its operations. [[Andy Beckett]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', opined that "to watch Ardent's few dozen hours of broadcast output is to enter a strange kingdom where every man in Britain still wears a tie, where pieces to camera are done in cricket jumpers, where people clasp their hands behind their backs like guardsmen. Commercial breaks are filled with army recruiting advertisements".<ref>{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Becket|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/05/themonarchy.broadcasting|title=It's a royal cock-up|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 March 2002}}</ref>

Ardent's productions were better received in the United States<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/436805.stm|title=Edward: No intention to offend|work=BBC News|date=2 September 1999}}</ref> and a documentary Edward made about his great uncle, [[Edward VIII]] (the late Duke of Windsor) in 1996, sold well worldwide.<ref name="BFI"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Summerskill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/oct/29/broadcasting.society|title=Losses double at Prince's TV firm|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 October 2000}}</ref> Nonetheless, the company reported losses every year it operated, with the exception of one when Edward did not draw a salary.<ref name="Beckett"/> An Ardent two-man film crew later allegedly invaded the privacy of Edward's nephew, [[Prince William]], in September 2001, when he was studying at the [[University of St Andrews]], which went against industry guidelines regarding the privacy of members of the royal family;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1566416.stm|title=Edward's turbulent media career|work=BBC News|date=27 September 2001}}</ref> William's father, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], was reportedly angered by the incident.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Alderson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1358014/Prince-Edward-to-apologise-to-Queen-and-agrees-to-stop-making-royal-films.html|title=Prince Edward to apologise to Queen and agrees to stop making royal films|newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph|location=London|date=30 September 2001}}</ref> In March 2002, Edward announced that he would step down as production director and joint managing director of Ardent<ref name="Beckett"/> to concentrate on his public duties and to support the Queen during [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Golden Jubilee]] year.

Their wedding took place on 19 June 1999 in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]]. This was a departure from the weddings of his elder brothers, which were large, formal events at [[Westminster Abbey]] or [[St Paul's Cathedral]], and had ended in divorce. On his wedding day, Prince Edward was created [[Earl of Wessex]], with the [[subsidiary title]] of [[Viscount Severn]] (derived from the Welsh roots of the Countess's family),<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55536 |date=28 June 1999 |page=7011 |nolink=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Wessex titles for Edward and Sophie |work=[[BBC News]]| date=19 June 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/royal_wedding/373120.stm | accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref> breaking from a tradition whereby sons of the sovereign were created [[royal duke]]s.

The Earl of Wessex assumed many duties from his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as the Duke reduced his commitments and retired from royal duties. Prince Edward succeeded the Duke as president of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (vice-patron since 2006) and opened the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] in New Zealand and the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in Malaysia.

Before Edward's marriage in 1999, royal commentators conjectured that former royal dukedoms such as [[Duke of Cambridge|Cambridge]] or [[Duke of Sussex|Sussex]] might be granted to him. Instead, the [[Buckingham Palace|Palace]] announced the intention that Prince Edward would eventually be created [[Duke of Edinburgh]], once that title had reverted to The Crown upon the death of both his parents.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx | title = The Earl of Wessex - Styles and titles | publisher = The Royal Family | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904051612/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2014}}.</ref>{{efn|The Earl of Wessex would not automatically succeed his father, as titles are passed to the eldest son; hence, the current Prince of Wales would succeed the present Duke.

On his marriage in 1999, the prince was ennobled in keeping with tradition, however he was the first prince since the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]] to be known as an earl rather than a duke (while reserving the rank of duke for the future).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/ranks-and-privileges-peerage/duke|title=Duke|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that he was drawn to the Earldom of Wessex after watching the 1998 film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', in which a character with that title is played by [[Colin Firth]].<ref name= "EdwardSundayTelegraph">{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8196402/Royal-wedding-Prince-William-asks-the-Queen-not-to-make-him-a-duke.html |title=Royal wedding: Prince William asks the Queen not to make him a duke| first =Richard | last = Eden|date= 12 December 2010 |work= The Telegraph|accessdate= 12 December 2010}}</ref>
