[[File:Jay & Trey Cartoon Swearing.jpg|thumb|In [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]], profanity is often depicted by substituting symbols for words ("[[The Lexicon of Comicana#Examples|grawlixes]]" in the lexicon of cartoonist [[Mort Walker]])]]

'''Profanity''' is [[society|socially]] offensive language,<ref>"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profanity Definition of Profanity]", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved on 2014-08-31.</ref> which may also be called '''cursing''', '''cussing''' or '''swearing''', '''cuss words''' (American English vernacular), '''curse words''', '''swear words''', '''bad words''', or '''expletives'''. Used in this sense, profanity is language that is sometimes considered by certain parts of a [[culture]] to be strongly impolite, rude, or offensive. It can show a [[pejorative|debasement of someone or something]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=A.N.|date=1940|title=The Monthly Supplement: a current biographical reference service, Volumes 1-2|journal=The Monthly Supplement|publisher=A.N.

In its older, more literal sense, "profanity" refers to a lack of respect for things that are held to be [[sacred]], which implies anything inspiring or deserving of [[Reverence (emotion)|reverence]], as well as [[Desecration|behaviour showing similar disrespect]] or causing [[religious offense]].<ref name="Longman - profanity">{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/profanity|title=Definition of profanity|publisher=[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]] – online|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''profane'' originates from classical Latin ''profanus'', literally "before (outside) the temple", "pro" being outside and "fanum" being temple or sanctuary. It carried the meaning of either "desecrating what is holy" or "with a secular purpose" as early as the 1450s.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Online, "profane", retrieved 2012-02-14</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|profane}}</ref> Profanity represented secular indifference to religion or religious figures, while [[blasphemy]] was a more offensive attack on religion and religious figures, considered [[sin]]ful, and a direct violation of [[The Ten Commandments]]. Moreover, many [[Bible verses]] speak against swearing.<ref name=swearingisbad>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbible.info/topics/bad_words|title=Bad Words [in the Bible]|publisher=OpenBible.info|access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref> In some countries, profanity words often have [[Pagan]] roots that after [[Christianity|Christian]] influence were turned from names of deities and spirits to profanity and used as such, like famous [[Finnish profanity]] word ''[[perkele]]'', which was believed to be an original name of the thunder god [[Ukko]], the chief god of the [[Finnish paganism|Finnish pagan]] pantheon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siikala|first=Anna-Leena|title=Itämerensuomalaisten mytologia|publisher=SKS|year=2013|location=Helsinki}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Salo|first=Unto|title=Agricola's Ukko in the light of archeology.

Profanities, in the original meaning of ''blasphemous profanity'', are part of the ancient tradition of the comic cults which laughed and scoffed at the deity or deities: an example of this would be Lucian's ''[[Dialogues of the Gods]]'' satire.<ref>[[Eleazar M.

==History==
The history of curse words and profanity was part of spoken words in the medieval era. The word ''[[fuck]]'' was used in English in the fifteenth century, though the usage in earlier times of the 13th century was not with abusive intent. The word ''[[shit]]'' is the oldest of words in use rooted in the Proto-Germanic word ''skit-,'' then evolved in Middle English to the word ''schitte,'' meaning excrement and ''shiten,'' to defecate. Another curse word, damn, has its origins in Latin with the word ''damnum'' meaning to damage, hurt or harm.<ref>{{Cite web|title=shit {{!}} Search Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=shit|access-date=2020-10-19|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>

Swearing performs certain psychological functions, and uses particular linguistic and neurological mechanisms; all these are avenues of research. Functionally similar behavior can be observed in chimpanzees, and may contribute to our understanding, notes ''New York Times'' author Natalie Angier.<ref name="angier" /> Angier also notes that swearing is a widespread but perhaps underappreciated anger management technique; that "Men generally curse more than women, unless said women are in a sorority, and that university provosts swear more than librarians or the staff members of the university day care center".<ref name="angier">{{cite news|title=Cursing is a normal function of human language, experts say|last=Angier|first=Natalie|journal=New York Times|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Cursing-is-a-normal-function-of-human-language-2567316.php|date=2005-09-25|access-date=2012-11-19}}</ref> Swearing over time may gain roots as a habit with the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. This has been referred to as [[coprolalia]], which is an occasional characteristic of [[tic disorder]]s.

An interdisciplinary team of researchers from the [[University of Warsaw]] investigated bilingual swearing: why is it easier to swear in a foreign language? Their finding that bilinguals strengthen the offensiveness of profanities when they switch into their second language, but soften it when they switch into their first tongue, but do both statistically significantly only in the case of ethnophaulisms (ethnic slurs) led the scientist to the conclusion that switching into the second language exempts bilinguals from the social norms and constraints (whether own or socially imposed) such as political correctness, and makes them more prone to swearing and offending others.<ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013">{{cite journal|vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M|title=Second language as an exemption from sociocultural norms.

===Types by purpose===
According to [[Steven Pinker]], there are five possible functions of swearing:<ref>[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] (2007) ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]''. [[Viking Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-670-06327-7}}</ref>
* [[Abusive]] swearing, intended to offend, intimidate or otherwise cause emotional or psychological harm
* [[Catharsis|Cathartic]] swearing, used in response to pain or misfortune
* [[Dysphemistic]] swearing, used to convey that the speaker thinks negatively of the subject matter and to make the listener do the same
* [[:wikt:emphasis|Emphatic]] swearing, intended to draw additional attention to what is considered to be worth paying attention to
* [[Idiom in English language|Idiomatic]] swearing, used for no other particular purpose, but as a sign that the conversation and relationship between speaker and listener is informal

==Slurs vs profanity==
Already mentioned that profanity is socially offensive and are considered to be strongly impolite. Slurs however are derogatory, they are meant to harm another individual. Although profanity has been seen to improve performance or relieve anxiety and anger, and can be use in a lighthearted way; it is not the same with slurs.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wong|first=Kristin|date=2017-07-27|title=The Case for Cursing (Published 2017)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/smarter-living/the-case-for-cursing.html|access-date=2020-11-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By definition, slurs are considered profanity because they are socially offensive and strongly impolite. When using profanity they can be taken lightheartedly.

For example: If I don't get an A on this exam, I'm fucked.

In the example, the word "fucked" is profanity however, the way it is embedded isn't offending anything, the speaker isn't making an offensive claim. However slurs are not to be taken lightheartedly, no matter how they are used they still make an offensive claim.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pejorative Language {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://iep.utm.edu/pejorati/|access-date=2020-11-03|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Legality==
===Australia===
Three Australian states ([[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) have laws against using "offensive language" in public. These offenses are classed as a [[summary offence]]. However, if the court is satisfied that the individual concerned had "a reasonable excuse to behave in such a manner", no offense is committed. In Australia's remaining states and territories, swearing is not [[Illegal per se|illegal ''per se'']], but depending on circumstances may constitute [[disorderly conduct]] or a [[breach of the peace]].<ref>[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4251/swearing-in-public-is-against-the-law-really.aspx Swearing in Public is Against the Law (Really)] – FindLaw Australia</ref>

Section 175 of Canada's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] makes it a criminal offence to "cause a disturbance in or near a public place" by "swearing […] or using insulting or obscene language".

Swearing, in and of itself, is not usually a [[crime|criminal offence]] in the [[United Kingdom]] although in context may constitute a component of a crime. However, it may be a criminal offence in [[Salford Quays]] under a [[public spaces protection order]] which outlaws the use of "foul and abusive language" without specifying any further component to the offence, although it appears to be unclear as to whether all and every instance of swearing is covered.

;In the workplace
In the United Kingdom, swearing in the workplace can be an act of [[Misconduct|gross misconduct]] under certain circumstances. In particular, this is the case when swearing accompanies insubordination against a superior or humiliation of a subordinate employee. However, in other cases, it may not be grounds for instant dismissal.<ref>[http://www.lindermyers.co.uk/is-swearing-in-the-workplace-legal/ Swearing in the Workplace]. Retrieved 2012-11-19.</ref> According to a UK site on work etiquette, the "fact that swearing is a part of everyday life means that we need to navigate away through a day in the office without offending anyone, while still appreciating that people do swear. Of course, there are different types of swearing and, without spelling it out, you really ought to avoid the 'worst words' regardless of who you’re talking to".<ref name="worketiquette">[http://www.worketiquette.co.uk/swearing-workplace.html Work Etiquette&nbsp;– Swearing in the Workplace].

The site continues to explain that, even in a workplace in which swearing is the norm, there is no need to participate in it.<ref name="worketiquette" /> The site stresses that swearing is, in general, more problematic in asymmetric situations, such as in the presence of senior management or clients, but it also mentions that a "holier than thou" attitude towards clients may be problematic.<ref name="worketiquette" />

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "36% of the 308 UK senior managers and directors having responded to a survey accepted swearing as part of workplace culture", but warned about specific inappropriate uses of swearing such as when it is discriminatory or part of bullying behaviour. The article ends with a quotation from Ben Wilmott (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development): "Employers can ensure professional language in the workplace by having a well-drafted policy on bullying and harassment that emphasises how bad language has potential to amount to [[harassment]] or [[bullying]]."<ref>{{cite news|author=Matt Keating|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jun/03/careers.work|title=Should swearing be tolerated in the workplace?|newspaper=Guardian|date=2006-06-03|access-date=2010-05-12|location=London}}</ref>

==Minced oaths==
{{Main article|Minced oath}}
Minced oaths are [[euphemism|euphemistic]] expressions made by altering or clipping profane words and expressions to make them less objectionable. Although minced oaths are often acceptable in situations where profanity is not (including the radio), some people still consider them profanity. In 1941, a judge threatened a lawyer with [[contempt of court]] for using the word ''darn''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montagu|first=Ashley|author-link=Ashley Montagu|title=The Anatomy of Swearing|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2001|location=Philadelphia|page=298|isbn=0-8122-1764-0}}</ref><ref name="Phrase Finder minced">{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/minced-oath.html|title=Minced oath|publisher=The Phrase Finder}}</ref>

==Impact on society==
A 2011 research by Jeffrey Bowers affirms the use of swearing has impact on and alters human behaviour.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal|last1=Pleydell-Pearce|first1=Christopher W.|last2=Bowers|first2=Jeffrey S.|date=2011-07-20|title=Swearing, Euphemisms, and Linguistic Relativity|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e22341|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022341|pmid=21799832|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622341B|pmc=3140516}}</ref> This study was conducted to study linguistic relativity with regards to swear words and euphemisms. As a part of this study, 24 volunteers between ages of 18 - 26 with mean age 21 were subject to a 20-minute experiment involving their responses on swear words spoken aloud and their responses noted. Additionally their electrodermal activity was measured using an in-house device that measured changes in skin resistance in response to the swear words.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Another study<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Gilald|date=Oct 2016|title=Profanity and honesty|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/profanity.pdf|journal=Stanford|pages=44}}</ref> at Stanford in 2016 indicated a direct correlation between profanity and honesty. Based on this study of 307 participants, it turned out that the top two US states (Connecticut and New Jersey) on profanity were also the highest on integrity. Previous notions about children picking swearing from adult behavior have found to be incorrect while experience shows that they learn to swear as the behaviour of conformity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIGsBwAAQBAJ&q=children&pg=PA247|title=An Encyclopedia of Swearing: The Social History of Oaths, Profanity, Foul Language, And Ethnic Slurs in the English-speaking World|last=Hughes|first=Geoffrey|date=2015-03-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317476788|language=en}}</ref>

* [[Brandon Sanderson]], in an annotation for his 2007 novel ''[[The Well of Ascension]]'', mentions that some readers are put off by "light" cursing:
{{quote|text=I’ve taken a little bit of criticism from certain readers for the swearing I put into these books.
