'''McKinsey & Company''' is an American worldwide [[management consulting]] firm, founded in 1926 by [[University of Chicago]] professor [[James O. McKinsey]], that advises on [[strategic management]] to corporations, governments, and other organizations. Under the leadership of [[Marvin Bower]], McKinsey expanded into Europe during the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, McKinsey's [[Fred Gluck]]—along with [[Boston Consulting Group]]'s [[Bruce Henderson]], [[Bill Bain (consultant)|Bill Bain]] at [[Bain & Company]], and [[Harvard Business School]]'s [[Michael Porter]]—transformed corporate culture.<ref name="Kiechel2010" /><ref name="FT_2010">{{Cite news |title=Synopsis of The Lords of Strategy by Walter Kiechel |work=[[Financial Times]] |url=https://ig.ft.com/sites/business-book-award/books/2010/longlist/the-lords-of-strategy-by-walter-kiechel/ |access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> A 1975 publication by McKinsey's John L.

[[File:Marvin Bower.jpg|thumb|Marvin Bower, founder of modern-day McKinsey and its corporate culture]]
[[Marvin Bower]] is credited with establishing McKinsey's values and principles in 1937, based on his experience as a lawyer. The firm developed an "up or out" policy, where consultants who are not promoted are asked to leave. in 1937.<ref name="vault" /><ref name="Observer_Caulkin_19970629" /> Bower established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth even if it means challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well.<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /><ref name="Observer_Caulkin_19970629" /> Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.<ref name="MacDonald_Firm_20130910" /><ref name="OShea_Dangerous_1997" /> Bower also established the firm's language.<ref name="Observer_Caulkin_19970629" />

In 1932, the company opened its second office in [[New York City]].<ref name="Edersheim2010" />{{RP|20}} In 1935, McKinsey left the firm temporarily to serve as the Chairman and CEO of client [[Marshall Field's]].<ref name="GreinerOlson2004">{{Cite book |last=Larry Greiner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91NEAAAAYAAJ |title=Contemporary consultant casebook: educating today's consultants |last2=Thomas Olson |date=June 25, 2004 |publisher=Thomson/South-Western |isbn=978-0-324-29019-6 |access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref>{{rp|5}}<ref name="MayoNohria2007" />{{rp|133}}

In 1937, James O. McKinsey died after catching pneumonia.<ref name="Edersheim2010" /><ref name="WoodWood2002" /> This led to the division of McKinsey, Wellington & Company in 1939.

In 1971, McKinsey created the Commission on Firm Aims and Goals, which found that McKinsey had become too focused on geographic expansion and lacked adequate industry knowledge.

The burst of the [[dot-com bubble]] led to a reduction in utilization rates of McKinsey's consultants from 64 to 52 percent.

==Organization and services==

===Structure===
[[File:McKinsey Office in Bucharest.jpg|thumb|upright|McKinsey office in [[Bucharest]], Romania]]
McKinsey & Company was originally organized as a [[partnership]]<ref name="Empson2007" /> before being legally restructured as a private corporation with shares owned by its partners in 1956.<ref name="seventysix">{{Cite news |last=Bhide |first=Amar |date=March 1996 |title=Building the Professional Firm: McKinsey & Co.: 1939-1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZkGHAAACAAJ |access-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Ellis2013">{{Cite book |last=Charles D.

By 2013, McKinsey was described as having a de-centralized structure, whereby different offices operate similarly, but independently.<ref name="MacDonald_Firm_20130910">{{Cite book |last=McDonald |first=Duff |title=The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and its Secret Influence on American Business |date=September 10, 2013 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-1439190975}}</ref><ref name="OShea_Dangerous_1997">{{Cite book |last=O'Shea |first=James |title=Dangerous Company |last2=Madigan |first2=Charles |date=1997 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-8129-2634-7}}</ref> The company's budgeting is centralized, but individual consultants are given a large degree of autonomy.<ref name="guardianlo" />

===Consulting services===
McKinsey & Company provides strategy and [[management consulting]] services, such as providing advice on an acquisition, developing a plan to restructure a sales force, creating a new business strategy or providing advice on downsizing, according to the 2013 book, ''The Firm''.<ref name="MacDonald_Firm_20130910" /><ref name="Rasiel_McKinseyWay_1999" /> The 1999 book, ''The McKinsey Way'' said that McKinsey consultants designed and implemented studies to evaluate management decisions using data and interviews to test [[hypotheses]].<ref name="Rasiel_McKinseyWay_1999" />which were then presented to senior management, typically in a [[PowerPoint]] presentation and a booklet.<ref name="Rasiel_McKinseyWay_1999" />

McKinsey & Company has traditionally charged approximately 25 percent more than competing firms.<ref name="WetFeet2009" />

A typical McKinsey engagement can last between two and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants.<ref name="WetFeet2009" /> An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise.<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /> Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so).

===Recruiting===
McKinsey & Company was the first management consultancy to hire recent graduates instead of experienced business managers,<ref name="SundayTimes_Birchall_20060608" /> when it started doing so in 1953.

By 2009, less than half of the firm's recruits were business majors;<ref name="WetFeet2009" />{{RP|7}} by 1999, recruits had advanced degrees in science, medicine, engineering or law.<ref name="Rasiel_McKinseyWay_1999">{{Cite book |last=Rasiel |first=Ethan |title=The McKinsey Way |date=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-053448-3}}</ref><ref name="SchaeperSchaeper2004">{{Cite book |last=Thomas J.

According to a 1997 article in ''The Observer'', McKinsey recruited recent graduates and "imbue[d] them with a religious conviction" in the firm, then cull[ed] through them with its "[[Up or out|up-or-out]]" policy.<ref name="Observer_Caulkin_19970629" /> The "up or out" policy, which was established in 1951, meant that consultants that were not being promoted within the firm were asked to leave.<ref name="McKenna2006" />{{rp|208}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hill |first=Andrew |title=Inside McKinsey |work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/0d506e0e-1583-11e1-b9b8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz34Hf2CyZl |quote=Every two or three years, McKinsey determines whether its consultants will make progress to the next level in the firm.

===Culture===

A November 1, 1993, profile story in [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] said that McKinsey & Company was "the most well-known, most secretive, most high-priced, most prestigious, most consistently successful, most envied, most trusted, most disliked management consulting firm on earth".<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /> In the article, McKinsey was cited as saying that its consultants were not motivated by money.<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /> and that partners talked to each other with "a sense of personal affection and admiration".<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /> The article described a culture clash that occurred in the early 1990s, leading to the departure of 151 out of the 254 ICG staff members.<ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" />

In their 1997 book ''Dangerous company : management consultants and the businesses they save and ruin'', authors James O'Shea and Charles Madigan said that McKinsey's culture had often been compared to [[religion]], because of the influence, loyalty and zeal of its members.<ref name="OShea_Dangerous_1997" /><ref name="Times_OShea_19970907" /> The firm has a policy against discussing specific client situations.<ref name="OShea_Dangerous_1997" /> A September 1997 ''[[The News & Observer|The News Observer]]'' story said that McKinsey's internal culture was "collegiate and ruthlessly competitive" and has been described as arrogant.<ref name="Observer_Caulkin_19970629" /> Ethan Rasiel's 1999 book entitled ''The McKinsey Way'', described a culture at McKinsey's whereby members were not supposed to "sell" their services.<ref name="Rasiel_McKinseyWay_1999" /><ref name="theguardian_Laville_20050614">{{Cite news |last=Laville |first=Sandra |last2=Pratley |first2=Nils |date=June 14, 2005 |title=Brothers who sit at Blair's right hand |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

''The Sunday Times'' wrote that McKinsey was a pioneer in the industry— the "first firm to hire MBA graduates from the top business schools to staff its projects, rather than relying on older industry personnel." They were still trying to keep a "very low profile public image" in 2005.<ref name="SundayTimes_Birchall_20060608">{{Cite news |last=Birchall |first=Martin |date=June 8, 2006 |title=Consultancy pioneer is still setting the pace |pages=7 |work=The Sunday Times |quote=It was also the first firm to hire MBA graduates from the top business schools to staff its projects, rather than relying on older industry personnel.}}</ref> That year, an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that McKinsey "hours are long, expectations high and failure not acceptable".<ref name="theguardian_Laville_20050614" /> According to an October 2009 [[Reuters]] article, the firm had a "button-down culture" focused on "playing by the rules".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Eder |first=Steve |date=October 19, 2009 |title=McKinsey shocked by insider-trading allegations |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/19/us-mckinsey-insider-trading-analysis-sb-idUSTRE59I5Y520091019 |access-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In his 2013 book, ''The Firm: the Story of McKinsey and its Secret Influence on American Business'', Duff McDonald, described how McKinsey's consultants were expected to become a part of the community and recruit clients from church, charitable foundations, board positions and other community involvements.<ref name="MacDonald_Firm_20130910" /> McDonald wrote that McKinsey calls itself "The Firm" and its employees "members".<ref name="MacDonald_Firm_20130910" /><ref name="Fortune_Huey_19931101" /> ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' summarized ''The Firm'''s description of McKinsey's as a "fading empire, where hubris and changing times have diminished the firm's statures."<ref name="BW_Rodenhauser_20130826">{{Cite news |last=Rodenhauser |first=Tom |date=August 26, 2013 |title=The McKinsey Mystique |work=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/the-mckinsey-mystique |access-date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>

===Conflicts of interest between McKinsey and MIO partners===
In February 2019, ''The New York Times'' ran a series of articles about McKinsey<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bogdanich |first=Walt |author-link=Walt Bogdanich |last2=Forsythe |first2=Michael |date=19 February 2019 |title=How We've Reported on the Secrets and Power of McKinsey & Company |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/reader-center/mckinsey-hedge-fund-reporting-investigation.html |access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> and the in-house hedge fund it operates – McKinsey Investment Office, or MIO Partners. The articles claimed that there was "potential for undisclosed conflicts of interest between the fund's investments and the advice the firm sells to clients", since the hedge fund could benefit from the inside knowledge obtained through management consulting services.<ref name="nyt_conflictofinterest">{{Cite news |last=Forsythe |first=Michael |last2=Bogdanich |first2=Walt |author-link2=Walt Bogdanich |last3=Hickey |first3=Bridget |date=19 February 2019 |title=As McKinsey Sells Advice, Its Hedge Fund May Have a Stake in the Outcome |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/mckinsey-hedge-fund.html |access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>

The firm responded that "MIO and McKinsey employ separate staffs. MIO staff have no nonpublic knowledge of McKinsey clients. For the vast majority of assets under management, decisions about specific investments are made by third-party managers".<ref name="nyt_conflictofinterest" />

The firm has agreed to repay fees it earned in three bankruptcy cases, approximately $15 million worth.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shazar |first=Jon |title=New McKinsey Conflict-Of-Interest Scandal Emerges Just In Time |url=https://dealbreaker.com/2019/02/mckinsey-hedge-fund |access-date=2020-01-20 |website=Dealbreaker |language=en-us}}</ref>

In the 1980s, AT&T reduced investments in cell towers due to McKinsey's prediction that there would only be 900,000 cell phone subscribers by 2000. According to ''The Firm'' this was "laughably off the mark" from the 109 million cellular subscribers by 2000. At the time cell phones were bulky and expensive. The firm helped the Dutch government facilitate a turnaround for [[Hoogovens]], the world's largest steel company as of 2013, through a $1 billion bankruptcy bailout. It also implemented a turnaround for the city of [[Glasgow]], which had problems with unemployment and crime. McKinsey created the corporate structure for [[NationsBank]], when it was still a small company known as [[North Carolina National Bank]]. McKinsey was hired by [[General Motors]] to do a large-scale re-organization to help it compete with Japanese auto-makers.

===Enron===
{{Main|Enron scandal}}
[[Enron]] was the creation of [[Jeff Skilling]], a McKinsey consultant of 21 years, who was jailed after Enron collapsed. McKinsey reportedly "fully endorsed the dubious accounting methods that caused the company to implode in 2001."<ref name="independent.co.uk" /> Enron reportedly used McKinsey on 20 different projects,<ref name="theguardian.com" /> and McKinsey consultants had "used Enron as their sandbox."<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web |date=23 March 2002 |title=The firm that built the house of Enron |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/mar/24/enron.theobserver |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

Prior to the Enron scandal, McKinsey helped it shift from an oil and gas production company into an electric commodities trader, which led to significant growth in profits and revenues.<ref name="guardianlo" /> According to ''The Independent'', there was "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, [but] critics say the arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture."<ref name="theindlo">{{Cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Katherine |date=June 27, 2005 |title=The Real Power Behind No 10; McKinsey is a Highly Secretive Consultancy Firm |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-real-power-behind-no-10-754912.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425071616/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-real-power-behind-no-10-754912.html |archive-date=2008-04-25}}</ref> The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting.<ref name="wsj" /> The ''Wall Street Journal'' questioned McKinsey's "liability" and its "close relationship with Enron".<ref name="wsjtwosohn">{{Cite news |last=Hwang |first=Suein |last2=Rachel Emma Silverman |date=January 17, 2002 |title=McKinsey's Close Relationship With Enron Raises Question of Consultancy's Liability |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://faculty.msb.edu/bodurthj/teaching/ENRON/McKinsey%27s%20Close%20Relationship%20With%20Enron%20Raises%20Question%20of%20Consultancy%27s%20Liability.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=December 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918063322/http://faculty.msb.edu/bodurthj/teaching/ENRON/McKinsey%27s%20Close%20Relationship%20With%20Enron%20Raises%20Question%20of%20Consultancy%27s%20Liability.htm |archive-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and a 2002 ''BusinessWeek'' suggested they had ignored warning signs.<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708" />

In his July 2002 in-depth ''BusinessWeek'' article on the aftermath of the [[Enron scandal]], John Bryne wrote that, McKinsey had been a "key architect of the strategic thinking that made Enron a Wall Street darling. In books, articles, and essays, its partners regularly stamped their imprimatur on many of Enron's strategies and practices, helping to position the energy giant as a corporate innovator worthy of emulation. The firm may not be the subject of any investigations, but its close involvement with Enron raises the question of whether McKinsey, like some other professional firms, ignored warning flags in order to keep an important account."<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708">{{Cite news |last=Byrne |first=John |date=July 8, 2002 |title=Inside McKinsey |work=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2002-07-07/inside-mckinsey |access-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref> ''BusinessWeek'' described how McKinsey's culture had changed, as the "number of partners grew from 427 to 891" making it a "less personal place".<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708" /> According to the article, "some current and former McKinsey consultants" said that McKinsey's had lost their "ingrained values" that used to guide the firm. Citing the example of the [[dot-com bubble]], McKinsey had begun to have "less prestigious companies" as clients and had allowed "its focus on building agenda-shaping relationships with top management at leading companies to slip."<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708" /> As well, "there was a noticeable tilt toward bringing in revenue at the expense of developing knowledge."<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708" /> McKinsey denied this.<ref name="BusinessWeek_Byrne_20020708" />

McKinsey denied giving Enron advice on financing issues or having suspicions that Enron was using improper accounting methods.<ref name="theguardian.com" /> 

===2008 financial crisis===
{{main|Financial crisis of 2007–2008}}
McKinsey is said to have played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis by promoting the securitization of mortgage assets and encouraged the banks to fund their balance sheets with debt, driving up risk, which "poisoned the global financial system and precipitated the 2008 credit meltdown".<ref name="independent.co.uk" /> Furthermore, McKinsey advised [[Allstate]] Insurance to purposefully give low offers to claimants. [[The Huffington Post|The ''Huffington Post'']] revealed that the strategy was to make claims "so expensive and so time-consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients."<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 December 2011 |title=Insurance Industry Reaps Massive Profits From Delay |url=http://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/insurance-claim-delays-industry-profits-allstate-mckinsey-company_n_1139102}}</ref> Next to this, 2016 McKinsey partner Navdeep Arora was convicted for illegally depleting [[State Farm]] of over $500,000 over a period of 8 years, in collaboration with a State Farm employee.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Janssen |first=Kim |date=January 5, 2016 |title=McKinsey and State Farm consultants bilked $900,000, feds say |work=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mckinsey-indictment-0106-biz-20160105-story.html |access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>

=== Rikers Island jail complex ===
New York City paid McKinsey $27.5 million between 2014 and 2017 to reduce prison assaults in [[Rikers Island]]; but the violence grew and the city abandoned many of the firm’s recommendations.

The consultancy's alleged failings included not soliciting the views of inmates or clinic staff; using an encrypted messaging app that deletes messages, allegedly to avoid transparency; initiatives involving the expanded use of Tasers, shotguns and K9 patrol dogs; replacing troublesome inmates with more accommodating ones in the test area, which skewed the data in favor of the project; the use of ineffective data-analytics software; and spreadsheet errors that inflated the baseline rate of violence, against which the project was measured.<ref name="propublica_MacDougall_20191210">{{Cite news |last=MacDougall |first=Ian |date=December 10, 019 |title=New York City Paid McKinsey Millions to Stem Jail Violence.

===Controversial clients and association with authoritarian regimes===

====Role in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)====

McKinsey stopped working for [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]] after it was disclosed that the firm had done more than $20 million in consulting work for the agency. McKinsey [[managing partner]] Kevin Sneader said the contract, not widely known within the company until The New York Times reported it, had "rightly raised" concerns.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Forsythe |first=Michael |last2=Bogdanich |first2=Walt |author-link2=Walt Bogdanich |date=July 9, 2018 |title=McKinsey Ends Work With ICE Amid Furor Over Immigration Policy |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/mckinsey-ends-ice-contract.html |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> In 2019, ''The New York Times'' and ProPublica reported on newly uncovered documents which showed that McKinsey, as part of its work with ICE, proposed cuts in spending on food and medical care for migrants.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=MacDougall |first=Ian |date=2019-12-03 |title=How McKinsey Helped the Trump Administration Carry Out Its Immigration Policies |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html |access-date=2019-12-04 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> McKinsey also advocated for an acceleration of the deportation process, causing concerns among ICE staff that the due process rights of the migrants would be violated.<ref name=":0" /> Previously, McKinsey managing partner, Kevin Sneader, had claimed that McKinsey had done no work for ICE in terms of developing and implementing immigration policy; the uncovered documents showed that to be false.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="MacDougall">{{Cite news |last=MacDougall |first=Ian |date=16 December 2019 |title=McKinsey Called Our Story About Its ICE Contract False.

In October 2018, in the wake of the [[assassination of Jamal Khashoggi]], a Saudi dissident and journalist, ''The New York Times'' reported that McKinsey had identified the most prominent [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi dissidents]] on Twitter and that the Saudi government subsequently repressed the dissidents and their families. One of the dissidents was arrested. Another dissident's family members were arrested, and the cell phone of the dissident was hacked. McKinsey issued a statement, saying "We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that [the report] could have been misused.

====Support of authoritarian regimes====

McKinsey's business and policy support for [[authoritarian regime]]s came under scrutiny in December 2018, in the wake of a lavish company retreat in China held adjacent to [[Chinese labor camps|Chinese government internment camps]] where thousands of [[Uyghurs]] were being [[Xinjiang re-education camps|detained without cause]].<ref name="nytimes-2018-12-15" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Premack |first=Rachel |date=December 15, 2018 |title=McKinsey held a lavish corporate retreat in Kashgar miles from where the Chinese government is imprisoning thousands of ethnic Uighurs |work=Business Insider |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/mckinsey-china-uighur-corporate-retreat-china2018-12 |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> In the preceding few years, McKinsey's clients included [[Saudi Arabia]]'s absolute monarchy,<ref name="nytimes-2018-10-20" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Holman |first=Jordyn |date=October 23, 2018 |title=Elizabeth Warren Asks McKinsey to Provide Information on Work for Saudis |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-24/warren-asks-mckinsey-to-provide-information-on-work-for-saudis |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Kolhatkar |first=Sheelah |date=November 1, 2018 |title=McKinsey's Work for Saudi Arabia Highlights its History of Unsavory Entanglements |work=The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mckinseys-work-for-saudi-arabia-highlights-its-history-of-unsavory-entanglements |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref> Turkey's autocratic leader [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]], ousted former President of Ukraine [[Viktor Yanukovych]], and several Chinese and Russian companies under sanctions.<ref name="nytimes-2018-12-15" />

==South African corruption scandal==
The [[Gupta family]] (no relation to Rajat Gupta) had strategically placed corrupted individuals in various South African government, utilities and infrastructure sectors. It is alleged that McKinsey was complicit in this corruption by using the Guptas to obtain consulting contracts from certain state-owned enterprises, including [[Eskom]] and [[Transnet]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bogdanich |first=Walt |author-link=Walt Bogdanich |last2=Forsythe |first2=Michael |date=June 26, 2018 |title=How McKinsey Lost Its Way in South Africa |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/world/africa/mckinsey-south-africa-eskom.html?action=click&module=Trending&pgtype=Article&region=Footer&contentCollection=Trending |access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Working with Trillian Capital Partners (a consultancy which was owned by a Gupta associate),<ref name="theconomist_20171012">{{Cite news |date=12 October 2017 |title=Why McKinsey is under attack in South Africa |work=[[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730191-consulting-firm-worked-trillian-capital-owned-gupta-family-associate-why-mckinsey}}</ref> they provided services to the value of R1 billion ($75 million) annually.

South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority concluded in early 2018 that the payments to McKinsey and its local business partner, Trillian, were illegal, involving crimes such as fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering. McKinsey had subsequently been in discussion with Eskom and the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit to agree on a transparent, legally appropriate process for returning the R1-billion (US$74m) it had been paid - it was confirmed on 6 July 2018 that this had been concluded.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Pityana commends McKinsey for "paying back the money" - BUSA |url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/pityana-commends-mckinsey-for-paying-back-the-mone}}</ref> Eskom confirmed it received R99.5 million in interest from McKinsey on July 23, 2018.

Information relating to allegedly corrupt practices by McKinsey at [[Transnet]] in 2011 and 2012 came to light in late July 2018.  The weekly ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that a "...new forensic treasury report shows how controversial former Transnet and Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh enjoyed overseas trips at the expense of international consulting firm McKinsey, which scored multi-billion rand contracts at the state owned entities." The "...report reiterates treasury's recommendations that Singh's conduct with regards to McKinsey should be referred to the elite crime-fighting unit, the Hawks, for investigations under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Precca). Under Precca, Singh would be investigated for allegations of corruption as payment for the overseas trips alone would constitute a form of gratification, which is illegal."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jika |first=Thanduxolo |last2=Skiti |first2=Sabelo |date=July 29, 2018 |title=From Dubai to Russia ― how former Eskom and Transnet CFO Anoj Singh was bought |work=[[Mail & Guardian]] |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-07-29-from-dubai-to-russia-how-the-former-eskom-and-transnet-cfo-was-bought |access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>  The Sunday ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' reported that the forensic report in turn reported that "multinational advisory firm McKinsey paid for Singh to go on lavish international trips to Dubai, Russia, Germany and the UK, after which their contract with Transnet was massively extended."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Treasury drops looting bomb |url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/treasury-drops-looting-bomb-20180729-4}}</ref> McKinsey issued a statement that the allegations were incorrect.

''[[The Economist]]'' reported in November 2019, that McKinsey's scandals, such as the 2016 South Africa scandal and the allegations of conflict of interest tied to its $12.7bn investment affiliate, McKinsey Investment Office (MIO), are relatively recent in terms of its long history.<ref name="economist_20191121">{{Cite news |date=November 21, 2019 |title=Rethinking McKinsey |work=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/21/rethinking-mckinsey |access-date=November 27, 2019 |issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The article said that McKinsey's legal challenges facing McKinsey's new global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, may be related to the company's fast-paced growth with an increase of 2,200 partners compared to 2009.
