== History ==
The ''New York Post'', established on November 16, 1801, as the ''New-York Evening Post'', describes itself as the nation's oldest continuously published ''daily'' newspaper. ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', which began daily publication on July 21, 1829, also bills itself as the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper because the ''New York Post'' halted publication during strikes in 1958 and 1978.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/extra/2004/175/content/175old.htm|title=Digital Extra: The Journal's 175th Anniversary – For the record|last=The Providence Journal Co.|date=July 21, 2004|access-date=August 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075034/http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/extra/2004/175/content/175old.htm|archive-date=June 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', believed to be the oldest continuously published newspaper, was founded in 1764 as a semi-weekly paper; it did not publish daily until 1836. ''[[The New Hampshire Gazette]]'', which has trademarked its claim of being ''The Nation's Oldest Newspaper'', was founded in 1756 as a weekly. Since the 1890s it has been published only on weekends.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

[[File:William Cullen Bryant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[William Cullen Bryant]], the ''Post''{{'}}s most famous 19th-century editor]]
The most famous 19th-century ''Evening Post'' editor was the poet and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[William Cullen Bryant]].<ref>Emery & Emery, p. 90.</ref> So well respected was the ''Evening Post'' under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], in 1864.<ref>Nevins, p. 341.</ref>

In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited [[William Leggett (writer)|William Leggett]], the [[Locofoco]] Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's espoused a fierce opposition to [[central banking]] and support for the organization of labor unions. He was a member of the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]. Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the ''Post'' in 1831,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beckner |first1=Steve |title=Leggett |url=https://reason.com/1977/02/01/leggett/ |website=reason.com |publisher=Reason Foundation |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>

In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] took control of the ''Evening Post'', as well as ''[[The Nation]]'', which became the ''Post''{{'}}s weekly edition.

===1918 to 1976===
Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during [[World War I]] hurt its circulation. The new owner was [[Thomas W.

Under Schiff's tenure the ''Post'' was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most popular columnists of the time, such as [[Joseph Cookman]], [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Max Lerner]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Pete Hamill]], and [[Eric Sevareid]], in addition to theatre critic [[Richard Watts, Jr.]] and [[gossip]] [[columnist]] [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]].

===1976 to present===
In November 1976, it was announced that Australian [[Rupert Murdoch]] had bought the ''Post'' from Schiff with the intention she would remain as a consultant for five years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=Deirdre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html|title=Dorothy Schiff Agrees to Sell ''Post'' To Murdoch, Australian Publisher|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1976|access-date=December 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230317/http://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html|archive-date=December 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It later emerged that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million.<ref name="hollywoodreporter2005"/> The ''Post'' at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing ''[[New York World Journal Tribune|World Journal Tribune]]''. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the ''Post''{{'}}s profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. The paper has lost money ever since.<ref name=Emery_opcit/>

In late October 1995, the ''Post'' announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication schedule and begin issuing a Sunday edition,<ref>{{cite news|date=October 24, 1995 |title=New York Post to Publish on Sundays |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |access-date=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221000037/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> which it last published briefly in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 5, 1996 |title=Post Plans Sunday Paper |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=6 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |access-date=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221000046/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 14, 1996, the ''Post'' delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.<ref name="Orlando">{{cite news|date=April 14, 1996 |title=The New York Post Starts Inexpensive Sunday Paper |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |page=A26 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2 |access-date=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214064752/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2 |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', was part of ''Post''{{'}}s efforts "to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/nyregion/slimmed-down-the-post-returns-to-sundays.html|title=Slimmed Down, The Post Returns to Sundays|date=April 14, 1996|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="Orlando"/>

Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media [[cross ownership|cross-ownership]] after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now [[WNYW]]) and four other stations from [[Metromedia]] to launch the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to [[Peter S.

==Content and coverage==
The ''Post'' has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for [[sensationalism]], blatant [[advocacy]], and conservative [[Media bias|bias]]. In 1980, the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' stated "''New York Post'' is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem—a force for evil."<ref name="CJR">''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', volume 18, number 5 (Jan/Feb 1980), pp. 22–23.</ref>

The ''Post'' has been accused of contorting its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular avoiding subjects which could be unflattering to the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.<ref name=PageSix>{{cite news|author=James Barron and Campbell Robertson|title=Page Six, Staple of Gossip, Reports on Its Own Tale|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 19, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin|access-date=May 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202074313/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Ken Auletta]] writes that Murdoch "doesn't hesitate to use the Post to belittle his business opponents". He goes on to say that Murdoch's support for [[Edward I. Koch]] while he was running for mayor of New York "spilled over onto the news pages of the Post, with the paper regularly publishing glowing stories about Koch and sometimes savage accounts of his four primary opponents."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Auletta |first1=Ken |title=Promises, Promises |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/02/promises-promises-2 |access-date=26 April 2019 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=25 June 2007 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111024350/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/02/promises-promises-2 |archive-date=January 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign team credited Murdoch and the Post for his victory in New York in the [[1980 United States presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mahler |first1=Jonathan |last2=Rutenberg |first2=Jim |title=How Rupert Murdoch's Empire of Influence Remade the World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html |access-date=26 April 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426130110/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html |archive-date=April 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Reagan later "waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market," allowing Murdoch to continue to control ''The New York Post'' and ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' while expanding into television.

In 1997, ''Post'' executive editor [[Steven D. Cuozzo]] responded to criticism by saying the ''Post'' "broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moyer |first1=Justin Wm |title=New York Post endorses Trump: He reflects the best of 'New York values' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/04/15/new-york-post-endorses-trump-he-reflects-the-best-of-new-york-values/ |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

In a 2004 survey conducted by [[Pace University]], the ''Post'' was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it "not credible" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|author=Jonathan Trichter|title=Tabloids, Broadsheets, and Broadcast News|work=Pace Poll Survey Research Study|date=June 16, 2004|access-date=June 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623180156/http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|archive-date=June 23, 2004|url-status=live}}</ref>

Murdoch imported the [[tabloid journalism]] style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which remains one of the highest selling daily newspapers in the UK. This style was typified<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tabloid journalism|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/tabloid-journalism|access-date=2020-09-19|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> by the ''Post''{{'}}s famous headlines such as "Headless body in topless bar" (shown on the right, written by [[Vincent Musetto]]).

Beginning with the 2017–18 television season, a daily [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series known as '''''Page Six TV''''' came to air, produced by [[20th Television]], which was part of the [[21st Century Fox]] side of Rupert Murdoch's holdings, and [[Endemol Shine North America]]. The show was originally hosted by comedian [[John Fugelsang]], with contributions from ''Page Six'' and ''Post'' writers (including Carlos Greer), along with regular panelists [[Elizabeth Wagmeister]] from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and [[Bevy Smith]]. In March 2018, Fugelsang left the show, with the expectation that a new host would be named, though by the end of the season, it was announced that Wagmeister, Greer and Smith would be retained as equal co-hosts.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/john-fugelsang-leaves-page-six-tv-guest-hosts-filling-in/|title = John Fugelsang Leaves 'Page Six TV': Meet the Guest Hosts Filling in|date = March 23, 2018|access-date = May 28, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180528215547/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/john-fugelsang-leaves-page-six-tv-guest-hosts-filling-in/|archive-date = May 28, 2018|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Hunter Biden laptop story ===
{{further|Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory}}

Social media networks [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] initially limited the spread of the ''Post'' story on their platforms, citing policies restricting the sharing of hacked material and personal information; this decision proved controversial, with many critics, including Republican Sen.

In 1997, a national news story concerning [[Rebecca Sealfon]]'s victory in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', a direct in-market competitor.

==Operations==
The 1906 [[Old New York Evening Post Building]] is a designated landmark. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the ''Post'' was established at 75 West Street in the [[New York Evening Post Building]]. The building remained in use by the ''Post'' until 1970, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.<ref name="nris"/> In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'', which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the ''Post''. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated ''Post''{{'}}s news and business offices to the [[1211 Avenue of the Americas|News Corporation headquarters tower]] at 1211 [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]] (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan. ''Post'' shares this building with [[Fox News Channel]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', both of which are also owned by Murdoch.  Both the ''Post'' and the New York City edition of the ''Journal'' are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of [[The Bronx]].

===Sales===
The daily circulation of ''Post'' decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 around 1967–68, to approximately 517,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carmody |first1=Deirdre |title=Dorothy Schiff Agrees to Sell Post To Murdoch, Australian Publisher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html |website=nytimes.com  |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref> Under Murdoch, ''Post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' in 1978—prompting the ''Daily News'' to retaliate with a PM edition called ''Daily News Tonight''. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''Post'' experienced and the ''Daily News'' ultimately folded ''Tonight'' in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day ''Post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition (It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of [[David Berkowitz]], the infamous "Son of Sam" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer). But ''Post'' lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down ''Post''{{'}}s PM edition in 1982, turning ''Post'' into a morning-only daily.

''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''Post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007,<ref name=circ/> achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, ''Post'' for the first time surpassed the ''Daily News'' in circulation—only to see the ''Daily News'' overtake its rival a few months later.<ref>Associated Press, [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-05-newspaper-circulation_N.htm "Newspaper circulation off 2.6%; some count Web readers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040220/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-05-newspaper-circulation_N.htm |date=August 5, 2011 }}, November 5, 2007.

Yet ''Post'' has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that ''Post'' loses up to $70 million a year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-news-corp_n_1635680.html|author=Michael Calderone|title=Rupert Murdoch Suggests Wall Street Journal Won't Face Cuts In News Corp.
