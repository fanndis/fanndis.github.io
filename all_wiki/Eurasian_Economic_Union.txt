==History==

===Proposal===
In the 1990s, Russia and the Central Asian republics were weakened economically and faced declines in [[GDP]]. The member states of the union underwent economic reforms and [[privatisation]].<ref group=journal>{{cite journal|title=Russian Federation|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/50/2452793.pdf|access-date=7 July 2014|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Russia Economic Conditions in Mid-1996|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ru0119)|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref> The process of Eurasian integration began immediately after the break-up of the Soviet Union. When the USSR [[August Coup|began to fall]] in 1991, the presidents of [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]]<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal>{{cite journal|title=Eurasian economic integration: figures and facts|url=http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/Documents/broshura26_ENGL_2014.pdf|access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref> of the founding republics signed the [[Belavezha Accords]] on 8 December 1991, declaring that the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union would cease to exist]] and proclaimed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in its place.

In 1994, during a speech at [[Moscow State University]], the first [[President of Kazakhstan]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], suggested the idea of creating a "Eurasian Union" as a regional trading bloc in order to connect to and profit from the growing economies of [[European Union|Europe]] and [[East Asia]]. The vision would be to simplify the free flow of goods across Eurasia.<ref>Alexandrov, Mikhail. ''Uneasy Alliance: Relations Between Russia and Kazakhstan in the Post-Soviet Era, 1992–1997.''

===Founding treaties (1990s)===
[[File:CIS meeting 2008.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Meeting of the leaders of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in [[Bishkek]], 2008. The CIS initiated the lengthy process of Eurasian integration.]]

During the 1990s, the Eurasian integration process was slow, possibly due to the economic crisis experienced after the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and the size of the countries involved (Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan cover an area of about 20 million km<sup>2</sup>). As a result, numerous treaties have been signed by member states to establish the regional trading bloc gradually.<ref group=journal>{{cite journal|author1=Steven Blockmans|author2=Hrant Kostanyan|author3=Ievgen Vorobiov|title=Towards a Eurasian Economic Union: The challenge of integration and unity|url=http://www.ceps.eu/system/files/CEPS%20Special%20Report%20No%2075%20-%20Towards%20a%20Eurasian%20Economic%20Union.pdf|date=December 2012|volume=75|issue=CEPS Special Report|pages=4–5|publisher=CEPS|quote=Given the distances between major economic centres, the transportation costs appear to be much higher in the case of trade within the CU than within the EEC. Besides, there is significant asymmetry in the distance between Russia's and Belarus' economic centres and those of Russia and Kazakhstan, which affects intra-bloc trade flows. This factor might significantly impede the envisaged positive effects of removing tariff barriers to trade and increasing labour mobility, and will therefore require greater efforts to ease cross-border trade, such as improving transport infrastructure.}}</ref><ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal />

In 1995, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and later acceding states Kyrgyzstan and [[Tajikistan]] signed the first agreements on the establishment of a [[Customs Union]]. Its purpose was to gradually lead the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between member states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evrazes.com/docs/view/118|title=AGREEMENT on the Customs union of 20 January 1995|publisher=Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC)}}</ref>

In 1996, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan signed the Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields to begin economic integration between countries to allow for the creation of [[common markets]] for goods, services, capital, labour, and developing single transport, energy and information systems.<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal /><ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://evrazes.com/docs/view/120|title=TREATY between the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic on increased integration in economic and humanitarian fields of 29 March 1996|publisher=Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC)}}</ref>

In 1999, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed the Treaty on the Customs Union and the Single Economic Space by clarifying the goals and policies the states would undertake in order to form the [[Eurasian Customs Union]] and the Single Economic Space.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan are launching common economic space 1 Jan.|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20120101/170583110.html|access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TREATY on the Customs union and the Common economic space of 26 February 1999|url=http://evrazes.com/docs/view/128|publisher=Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC)}}</ref>

===Eurasian Economic Community (2000–2014)===
{{main|Eurasian Economic Community}}

To promote further economic integration and more cooperation, in 2000 Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan established the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (EurAsEC) which [[Uzbekistan]] joined in 2006. 
The treaty established a common market for its member states. The Eurasian Economic Community was modelled on the [[European Economic Community]].<ref name="Boris N. Mamlyuk 2014">{{cite web|ssrn=2412319|title=Regionalizing Multilateralism: The Effect of Russia's Accession to the WTO on Existing Regional Integration Schemes in the Former Soviet Space|publisher=UCLA Journal of International Law and Foreign Affairs, Vol. 18, No. 2|date=2014|author=Boris N. Mamlyuk}}</ref> The two had a comparable population size of 171 million and 169 million, respectively.

A Treaty on a Single Economic Space by Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine was signed in 2003 and ratified in 2004, but the process was stalled after the [[Orange revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1052410.html|title=CIS: Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh Parliaments Ratify Treaty on Single Economic Space}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-12-10-putin-ukraine_x.htm|title=Putin: No objection to Ukraine in EU}}</ref>

In 2007, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement to create a Customs Union between the three countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.by/en/organizations/membership/list/aa16658947a49c28.html|title=Eurasian Economic Union}}</ref>

The Eurasian Economic Union is located at the eastern end of [[Europe]], bounded by the [[Arctic]] in the north, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east and [[East Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and part of [[Central Asia]] to the south. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39°]] and [[82nd parallel north|82°N]] and longitudes [[19°E]] and [[169th meridian west|169°W]]. The union extends across much of northern [[Eurasia]]. Its member states cover an area of over 20,000,000 square kilometers, which is approximately 15% of the world's land surface.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Information|url=http://eaeunion.org/#about-info|publisher=Eurasian Economic Union|access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[Eastern European Plain]] encompasses [[Belarus]] and most of [[European Russia]]. The plain is mostly mountain-free and comprises several [[plateaus]]. [[Russia]]'s northernmost regions are [[tundra]]. The Russian Tundra is located on the coastline with the [[Arctic]] and is known for its total darkness in the winter. [[Taiga]] reaches Russia's southern borders in [[Siberia]] and accounts for 60% of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geography of Russia|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his241/notes/geography/geography.html|publisher=Northern Virginia Community College|access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref> Towards the [[Ural Mountains]] and in northern [[Kazakhstan]], the climate is mostly temperate.

The Eurasian Economic Union has sought to base its model on the [[European Union]]. All institutions carry out their work in compliance with the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) and the international agreements that provide the legal and regulatory framework of the Customs Union and the Single Economic Space.

===Supreme Eurasian Economic Council===
{{main|Supreme Eurasian Economic Council}}
The Supreme Council, which is composed by the heads of state of the member states, makes important decisions for the union. It approves the budget and the distribution of the contribution of the Member States. The Supreme Council also determines the strategy, direction and prospects of integration and takes decisions aimed at achieving the goals of the union.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alta.ru%2Fshow_orders.php%3Faction%3Dview%26filename%3D14bn0044&sandbox=1|title = Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union|date = 29 May 2014|access-date = 30 August 2014|publisher = Alta}}</ref><ref name=":0" >{{Cite journal|url = http://sps.yurclub.ru/home/document/560461571|title = Draft Treaty of the Eurasian Economic Union (May 2014)|date = 29 May 2014|access-date =30 August 2014 |website = yurclub.ru}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.zhgtu.kz/images/stories/eeu/31548839.doc |title=Draft Treaty of the Eurasian Economic Union (May 2014) |date=29 May 2014 |access-date=30 August 2014 |publisher=Zhambyl Humanitarian-Technical University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090533/http://www.zhgtu.kz/images/stories/eeu/31548839.doc |archivedate=19 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url = http://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=31548839|title = Draft Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union (May 2014)|date = 29 May 2014|access-date =30 August 2014 |website = online.zakon.kz}}</ref>

===Eurasian Economic Commission===
{{main|Eurasian Economic Commission}}

The Eurasian Commission was established as the supranational governing body of the Eurasian Economic Space on 1 January 2012.<ref name=tut.by/> The commission was modelled on the [[European Commission]].<ref name="bbc18Nov2011" /> Its headquarters are in [[Moscow]].<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal /> The commission monitors subordinate branches and advisory bodies. Its departments were greatly expanded on 1 January 2015, and the number of international employees increased from 150 to 1,200.

The Eurasian Commission can take decisions on not only the customs policy of the union, but also on the macro-economy, the competition regulations, the energy policy and the fiscal policy of the Eurasian Economic Union. It has strict anti-corruption laws.<ref name=":3">{{cite news |script-title=ru:Встреча президентов России, Республики Беларусь и Казахстана |url=http://kremlin.ru/news/13581 |work=kremlin.ru |language=Russian |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=19 November 2011}}</ref>

The Eurasian Economic Commission consists of two bodies: the Council and the Collegium.

====Council====
The council is composed of the Vice Prime Ministers of the member states. The council of the Commission oversees the integration processes in the Union, and is responsible for the overall management of the Eurasian Commission. It monitors the commission by approving the draft budget of the union, the maximum number of personnel, and the qualification requirements for the commission's employees. The council convenes once every quarter.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

It also considers issues of customs cooperation, trade and development of Eurasian integration. The council regularly holds discussions on the important aspects of the EAEU and meets with business representatives of the member states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission|url=http://www.customsbemoscow.org/home/05-subjects/organisations/01-customs-union/eurasian-economic-commission/council-of-the-eurasian-economic-commission|website=CustomsBeMoscow|access-date=8 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215331/http://www.customsbemoscow.org/home/05-subjects/organisations/01-customs-union/eurasian-economic-commission/council-of-the-eurasian-economic-commission|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>

====Board====
The Board is composed of ten commissioners, one of which is the Chairman of the Board.<ref group=journal>{{cite book|title=Eurasian Union Brochure 2014 – English|url=http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/Documents/broshura26_ENGL_2014.pdf|pages=26–27|access-date=8 July 2014}}</ref> Each member state provides two commissioners to the Board of the Eurasian Commission who carry out the operational management and oversee the everyday work of the Eurasian Commission.<ref name=bbc18Nov2011/> All ten commissioners are appointed by the Supreme Eurasian Council for a four-year renewable term. The commissioners also receive the status of federal ministers in their respective countries.<ref name=tut.by/>

The Board of the commission is the executive body of the commission. It convenes once every week at least, and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Eurasian Economic Union. It has a wide range of activities, including monitoring the implementation of treaties, submitting annual progress reports and making recommendations. The Board also assists member states in the settlement of disputes, and carries out the draft of the union's budget. Part of its activities include being the intermediary between the departments of the commission and the heads of state of the member states.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

A number of departments are headed by the commissioners. The lower rank staff is composed of 84% Russian officials, 10% Kazakhs and 6% Belarusians, proportional to the populations of the member states.<ref name="bbc18Nov2011" /> The departments enable the Board of the Eurasian Commission to make decisions not only with regard to customs policies, but in such areas as [[macroeconomics]], regulation of [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]], [[energy policy]] and [[financial policy]]. The Commission departments are also involved in [[government procurement]] and [[Human migration|labour migration]] control.<ref name="tut.by" />

The Court of the Eurasian Economic Union replaced the Court of the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (EurAsEC Court) in 2015. It is in charge of dispute resolution and the interpretation of the legal order within the Eurasian Economic Union.

==Economy==
[[File:GDP PPP 2018 Selection.svg|270px|thumb|Selection of GDP PPP data (top 10 countries and [[Trade bloc|blocs]]) in no particular order]]

===Formation and overview===
[[File:Moscow-City (36211143494).jpg|250px|left|thumbnail|The [[Moscow International Business Center]] is a commercial district in [[Moscow]] that is currently under construction. The complex includes some of [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|Europe's tallest skyscrapers]].]]

The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields signed in 1996 laid the first foundation for economic convergence. The treaty ensured the creation of a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EAEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour.<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal /><ref name=":4" /> The [[Single Economic Space]] established a [[single market]] across the territory of [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EAEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include [[Armenia]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. The countries represent a market of some 180 million people and a combined [[GDP PPP]] of around $5 trillion.

Euroasian Economic Union has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest economy]] in the world by nominal GDP and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]].
Since the turn of the century, member states have experienced economic growth with GDP averaging 6% to 8% growth between 2000 and 2007, rising again in 2010 after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]].
Since the establishment of the [[Eurasian Customs Union]] in 2010, trade between member states rose sharply. In 2011 mutual trade was $63 billion, 33.9% more than in 2010. In 2012, mutual trade was $68 billion and combined exports reached $594 billion, while imports were $341 billion.<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal /> The first integration stage primarily enhanced trade among member states, bolstered economies and created a legal and institutional foundation for the member states. The second stage includes the free movements of goods, people, services and capital.

The Eurasian Economic Union is designed to reach a number of macroeconomic objectives such as reducing commodity prices by reducing the cost of transportation of [[raw materials]], increasing return on new technologies and products due to the increased market volume, and promoting "healthy" competition in the [[common market]]. It is also designed to lower food prices, increase employment in industries and increase production capacity. EAEU members like Belarus and Kazakhstan (by its [[Nurly Zhol]] economic policy) seek to leverage the EAEU as a bridge between the European Union and the New Silk Road economic belt.<ref name="tvr">{{cite news |title=Alexander Lukashenko meets with new Chairman of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission |url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/news/prezident/aleksandr_lukashenko_vstretilsya_s_novym_predsedatelem_kollegii_evraziyskoy_ekonomicheskoy_komissii/ |agency=TVR}}</ref>

The Eurasian Union is considered as a major player in the world's energy sector, [[raw materials]], [[arms industry]] and [[agricultural production]]. In 2013 Russia was the 3rd most successful country in the world in attracting capital from abroad.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/01/29/russia-is-no-3-in-attracting-foreign-direct-investment-a31566 |title = Russia is No. 3 in Attracting Foreign Direct Investment|date = 29 January 2014|work =TheMoscowTimes.com |access-date = 2020-03-08}}</ref> The significant potential for developing infrastructure has led the member states and its partners to create links by constructing roads, railways, electric power grids and fibre-optic cables.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Internal market===
{{main|Eurasian Economic Space}}

The core objective of the Single Economic Space is the development of a [[single market]] and achieving the "four freedoms", namely the free movements of goods, capital, services and people within the single market. The four freedoms came into effect on 1 January 2015 (the day the Eurasian Economic Union was officially established). The free movement of people means that citizens can move freely among member states to live, work, study or retire.<ref name=singlemarket>{{cite web|title=Belarus to benefit from Eurasian Economic Union|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_07_01/Belarus-to-benefit-from-Eurasian-Economic-Union-Lukashenko-3114/|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> Citizens of the member states of the union may travel to other member states on an [[internal passport]]. Although Russia also admits access to citizens of other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states without a passport, it is expected that after 2015 only citizens of the Customs Union will have this privilege.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://ria.ru/society/20121212/914456159.html Путин: въезд в РФ должен быть разрешен только по загранпаспортам] (Putin: passports will be required for entering Russia), 12 December 2012</ref>
Member states have a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the market and unified methods of valuing imported goods since the creation of the [[Eurasian Customs Union]] on 1 January 2010.

===Competition===
The [[Eurasian Economic Commission]] operates a competition policy to ensure equal competitive conditions in the commodity markets of the Single Economic Space. It also aims at harmonisation and improvement of legislation of each of the three countries in regard to competition policy. The commission serves as the competition regulator for the single market and is also responsible for antitrust issues. Special regulations limit state intervention in the economy.<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal /><ref>{{cite web|title=Competitiveness Policy|url=http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/act/caa/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Eurasian Commission|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

Kazakhstani President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] had first proposed, in 2009, the creation of a common noncash currency called "yevraz" for the Eurasian Economic Community. It would have reportedly helped insulate the countries from the global economic crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kazakhstan-suggests-a-new-currency/375212.html|title=Kazakhstan Suggests a New Currency – News|website=The Moscow Times|access-date=4 June 2015}}</ref> In 2012, the idea of the new joint currency found support from Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev and by 2014 proposals were drafted in Eurasian Commission documents for the establishment of a Eurasian Central Bank and a common currency to be called the [[altyn]] which is to be introduced by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus to have new joint currency|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/10-04-2014/127325-russia_kazakhstan_belarus_new_currency-0/|access-date=8 July 2014}}</ref>

When discussing the Eurasian Economic Union, [[Vladimir Putin]] said the Eurasian Economic Union would include closer coordination of economic and monetary policy, including the use of a [[common currency]] in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.ch/gifiles/docs/50/50116_eurasian-union-proposal-key-aspect-of-putin-s-expected.html|publisher=Wikileaks|access-date=8 July 2014|title=Eurasian Union Proposal Key Aspect of Putin's Expected Presidency|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143455/http://wikileaks.ch/gifiles/docs/50/50116_eurasian-union-proposal-key-aspect-of-putin-s-expected.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although the creation of a [[monetary union]] was not envisaged in the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] called for the introduction of a common currency for the Eurasian Economic Union. [[Leonid Slutsky (politician)|Leonid Slutsky]], head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a monetary union.

Belarusian president, [[Alexander Lukashenko]], circulated the idea of creating a "new [[euro]]" for the Eurasian economic bloc. In April 2014, discussions to introduce a single currency resumed.

Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, [[Igor Shuvalov]], stated on 24 July 2014 that the Eurasian Economic Union will have a common currency unit in a span of five to ten years.<ref name=currency>{{cite web|title=Eurasian Economic Union to have common currency in 5–10 years|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/742323|access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>

===Energy===
The Eurasian Economic Union is seen as an energy superpower, producing about 20.7% of the world's natural gas, and 14.6% of the world's oil and [[gas condensate]] in 2012, making it the world's top producer in both domains.
It is worth mentioning that these figures are mainly due to Russian Membership of EAEU, with Kazakhstan contributing 1.9% and 0.6% in gas and oil production respectively. Considerably small oil and gas reserved were discovered in Belarus while there are no such resources in Armenia.<ref name="energycharter">https://energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Occasional/1The_common_energy_market_of_the_EAEU-implications_for_the__EU_and_the_role_of_the_ECT.pdf</ref> 
It also produces 9% of the world's [[electrical energy]] and 5.9% of the world's coal, making it the third and fourth producer in the world, respectively.
In [[Kazakhstan]], energy is the leading economic sector. The country holds about 4 billion tons of proven recoverable oil reserves and 2,000 cubic kilometers (480 cu mi) of gas. Kazakhstan is the world's 17th largest [[oil exporter]] and the world's 23rd largest [[natural gas exporter]].

[[Russia]] has the world's largest [[natural gas reserves]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2253rank.html Country Comparison :: Natural gas – proved reserves].

While trade in oil and gas between resource-rich Russia and Kazakhstan is relatively low, the Belarus economy is heavily dependent on the access to the Russian hydrocarbons and - unlike the case with Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, Russia is Belarus's main trade partner accounting for 47% of all the trade. Belarus imports Russian crude oil (of which 45-50% were used for production of oil products to export) and natural gas (which were not directly re-exported) for the prices below the market ones, paying $173 for 1000 cubic meters of gas (for comparison - $250 for Armenia, $430 for Ukraine).<ref name="energycharter"/>

By 2019, Russia, Kazakhstan, [[Belarus]] and [[Armenia]] intend to create a common electricity market as well as a single [[hydrocarbons]] market by 2025. "With the creation of a single hydrocarbons market, we will have a deeper coordination that will allow us to be more competitive both in terms of pricing and in terms of getting high value added products in this very interesting and important market", stated Eurasian Commissioner [[Daniyal Akhmetov]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plaschinsky|first1=George|title=Eurasian Integration: Does Lukashenka Have A Choice?|url=http://belarusdigest.com/story/eurasian-integration-does-lukashenka-have-choice-17740|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=Belarus Digest|date=6 June 2014|quote=Integrators postponed creation of the single electrical energy market to 2019 and the single financial and oil and gas markets to 2025.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908201918/http://belarusdigest.com/story/eurasian-integration-does-lukashenka-have-choice-17740|archive-date=8 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mukhtarov|first1=Daniyar|title=Single hydrocarbons market of Eurasian Economic Union to be created by 2025|url=http://en.trend.az/business/energy/2277110.html|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=Trend|date=24 May 2014|quote=The single hydrocarbons market of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAU) will be created by 2025, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure of the Eurasian Economic Commission, Danial Akhmetov said.}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
[[File:Trans-Siberia048.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] is a vital link between the Russian Far East and the rest of Eurasia.]]
The major economic centres are [[Moscow]], [[Minsk]] and [[Astana]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} The distance between Moscow and Minsk is 717 kilometers, and the distance between Moscow and Astana is 2700 kilometers, making infrastructure a key challenge for the integration of member states. Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise and connect the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region. In 2007 Moscow announced it will invest US$1 trillion by 2020 to modernise the country's infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russia to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/09/21/russia-investment-idUKL2121712020070921|work=Reuters|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Russia: A Snapshot|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/capital-projects-infrastructure/assets/russia-snapshot.pdf|date=2013|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

Railways have been the primary way of linking countries in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century. It has always been the main way of transport in the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]] up until today. The union ranks 2nd in the world in terms of railway trackage (about 7.8% of the world's share). However it is still looking to improve cross-border trade within the union.

The [[Eurasian Development Bank]] has pledged to help in the construction of facilities to produce new generation freight cars and freight containers in [[Tikhvin]], [[Russia]] and in [[Osipovichi]], [[Belarus]] to respond to the increasing demand for rail transport. Projects have also been launched in Kazakhstan, as the landlocked country is highly dependent on railways for trade.

The most renowned railway in the union is the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] which links the [[Russian Far East]] to Moscow. The Southern route also travels via Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Investing in development and integration|url=http://eabr.org/general//upload/Presentations/Буклет%20о%20проектах%20банка%20новый_анг.pdf|publisher=Eurasian Development Bank|access-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130031629/http://eabr.org/general/upload/Presentations/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%85%20%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3.pdf|archive-date=30 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan – Infrastructure, power, and communications|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Kazakhstan-INFRASTRUCTURE-POWER-AND-COMMUNICATIONS.html#ixzz37MpBsJ7j|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Turk-Sib railway.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]] connects the Central Asian republics to [[Siberia]].]]
The [[Trans-Asian Railway]] and the [[Asian Highway Network]] are cooperative projects among countries in Asia and Europe which have helped to improve highway and railway systems across the region. Six of the eight major Asian highways go through the Eurasian Economic Union (the [[AH3]], [[AH4]], [[AH5]], [[AH6]], [[AH7]] and the [[AH8]]). The highways connect the EAEU to many countries including [[Finland]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]] and [[China]]. [[AH6]] goes through Russia's [[Trans-Siberian Highway]] which is over 11,000 kilometers long. The Trans-Siberian Highway is one of the longest national highways in the world along with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Australia's Highway 1]].

A major railway, known as the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]] allows goods to be transported from China and the EAEU to [[Europe]]. An expansion of the original railway line named the [[New Eurasian Land Bridge]] provides an uninterrupted rail link between China and the EAEU. Talks with China, India and Burma are ongoing to expand the railway network. In June 2014, it was announced that Russia, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EAEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also have the potential for expansion, with the future creation of [[high-speed railway]] lines being considered.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

====Single Eurasian Sky====
The Single Eurasian Sky programme, administered by the [[Eurasian Economic Commission]], outlines the creation of a single market for air services and a single [[Control zone|air traffic zone]]. The single air traffic zone would make it easier for airlines to draw up new flight paths, thereby increasing the number of flights flying through the region. Eurasian Commissioner, [[Daniyal Akhmetov]], said that it would be created on a step-by-step basis.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Akhmetov|first1=Daniyal|title="The CU railroad alliance to increase share of carriage from China to EU via the SES territory 10-folds," – Member of the EEC Board -Minister in charge of Energy and Infrastructure Daniyal Akhmetov|url=http://www.eurasiancommission.org/en/nae/news/Pages/22-05-2014-1.aspx|publisher=Eurasian Economic Commission|access-date=4 September 2014|date=22 May 2014}}</ref> In June 2014, Belarusian Airline [[Belavia]] stated that it was ready to move towards the development of the Single Eurasian Sky. The terms and conditions of operation in the common aviation market have not yet been agreed on. However, the project is likely to be modelled on the European Union's [[Single European Sky]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Belavia: Belarus ready to move pretty fast towards single Eurasian sky|url=http://eng.belta.by/all_news/economics/Belavia-Belarus-ready-to-move-pretty-fast-towards-single-Eurasian-sky_i_74020.html|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=Belarusian News: National Source of News|date=26 June 2014|location=Minsk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205222236/http://eng.belta.by/all_news/economics/Belavia-Belarus-ready-to-move-pretty-fast-towards-single-Eurasian-sky_i_74020.html|archive-date=5 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The project will reportedly help turn the airspace of the Eurasian Union into a popular transit hub between Europe and Southeast Asia. "We should understand that currently, the aviation companies of Kazakhstan and Belarus are not able to compete with Russia's aviation companies. Therefore, the programme will envisage a phasing, creating a competitive environment and so on", Eurasian Commissioner Akhmetov said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mukhtarov|first1=Daniyar|title=Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus developing Single Eurasian Sky programme|url=http://en.trend.az/casia/kazakhstan/2277034.html|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=Trend|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[File:Ivan Shishkin - Рожь - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|''A Rye Field'' by [[Ivan Shishkin]]]]
The Eurasian Economic Union is the top producer of [[sugar beet]] and [[sunflower]], producing 18.6% of the world's sugar beet and 22.7% of the world's sunflowers in 2012, as well as a top producer of [[rye]], [[barley]], [[buckwheat]], [[oats]] and [[sunflower seed]]. It is also a large producer of [[potatoes]], [[wheat]] and [[grain]] (and grain legumes).<ref name="eurasiancommission.org" group=journal />

Part of the competences of the [[Eurasian Economic Commission]] are agriculture subsidies. It is responsible for the coordination of agricultural policy-making between member states and ensuring collective food security. 
The [[Eurasian Development Bank]] finances projects to further integration and develop agriculture. It has disbursed approximately US$470 million for projects between 2008 and 2013.

===Projected economic impact===

Member states remain optimistic of the union and key partners in the region, namely [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] remain interested in it. A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential over the next two decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion.<ref name=leb>{{cite web|title=Leaders of Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus to meet in Astana to sign agreement establishing EEU|url=http://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/show-news/27182/Leaders-of-Kazakhstan-Russia-and-Belarus-to-meet-in-Astana-to-sign-agreement-establishing-EEU|publisher=Lebanese government}}</ref> The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation.<ref name=WaPost /> These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in [[Asia]] seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.

Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] of Russia stated that both the positive and negative experiences of the [[European Union]] will be taken into account and argued that the Eurasian Union will avoid the problems of economic gaps and disparity between countries,<ref name=":3" /> such as those found in the [[eurozone]], since the member countries have a comparable level of economic development, as well as common history and values.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=ru:Медведев: Евразийский экономический союз избежит проблем еврозоны |url=http://news.mail.ru/politics/7370197/ |work=[[Mail.ru|news.mail.ru]] |language=Russian |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=19 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612165139/http://news.mail.ru/politics/7370197/ |archive-date=12 June 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] as well as other western countries remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact.<ref name="WaPost" /> The popular magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear<ref name="Economist">{{cite news|title=Where three is a crowd|work=The Economist|date=30 May 2014|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/05/introducing-eurasian-economic-union|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> and further remarked "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one".<ref>{{cite news|title=Vladimir Putin's European adventures|work=The Economist|date=6 June 2014|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21603483-russian-presidents-strategy-towards-ukraine-and-west-may-not-have-worked-well-he|access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref> Outlets have also stated that without [[Ukraine]], the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary to the success of the union.

In May 2015, the Union gave the initial go-ahead to signing a free trade agreement with [[Iran]].

The [[European Council on Foreign Relations]] and analysts suggest the Eurasian Union includes strategic interests as well as economic interests for its member states, especially Russia. In order to link both Europe and East Asia, Russia seeks to develop its eastern regions to increase its access to Asian markets. [[Russian Far East|Russia's Far East]] has gained even more importance due to its proximity to alternative markets since the [[European Union]] and [[United States]] imposed [[International sanctions during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|sanctions on Russia following the crisis in Ukraine]].<ref name="Development Far East" group=journal>{{Cite book|isbn= 978-1-910118-03-0|author1=Alexander Gabuev|editor1-last=Liik|editor1-first=Kadri|title=Russia's Pivot to Asia: The development of the Russian Far East|date=May 2014|page=84|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR103_RUSSIA_COLLECTION_290514_AW.pdf|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=European Council on Foreign Relations|location=35 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9JA, United Kingdom|quote=This Asian vector of Russian domestic and foreign policy is now becoming even more important as the European Union and the United States impose sanctions on Russia.

China's rise as a major trading partner has been cited as a potential reason for Russia's loss of control over Central Asian economies. The union is seen as a way to counterbalance China's growing trade in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Eastern Partnership|European Union's Eastern Partnership]].<ref name="Trames" group=journal />

As the trading bloc seeks to profit from the growing economies of East Asia, Russia has made steps to develop its eastern territories, [[Siberia]] and the Russian Far East.<ref name="Development Far East" group=journal /> However, the development of the Russian Far East may face difficulties due to Russia's traditional orientation towards Europe and the region's backward infrastructure and underdeveloped economy.<ref name="Eurasian Russia in 21st Century" group=journal>{{Cite book|isbn= 978-1-910118-03-0|author1=Timofei Bordachev|editor1-last=Liik|editor1-first=Kadri|title=Russia's Pivot to Asia: Eurasian Russia in the twenty-first century|date=May 2014|page=27|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR103_RUSSIA_COLLECTION_290514_AW.pdf|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=European Council on Foreign Relations|location=35 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9JA, United Kingdom|quote=In the first months of 2014 the work of the recently created Ministry for the Development of the Far East was significantly reinvigorated.

An estimated 76% of Russia's exports depend on resources extracted (or manufactured) in Siberia. In order to transport goods from East Asia to Europe, they must be transported through Siberia by rail. Hence, the region plays an important role in trade. However, it remains less developed than Russia's western regions and modernisation plans are ongoing.

In 2013 the Russian government announced it would spend 450 billion Rubles (US$14 billion) for the modernisation of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans-Siberian]] and [[Baikal–Amur Mainline|Baikal-Amur]] railways. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the Trans-Siberian railway the country's "strategically vital transport artery". In July 2013 he stated "Rail freight traffic to our Far East ports has increased by 55 percent over the last 5 years and now comes to around 110 million tons a year". Projects to upgrade stations at the border with Mongolia, China and North Korea were also undertaken the same year.<ref group=journal>{{Cite book|isbn= 978-1-910118-03-0|author1=Alexander Gabuev|editor1-last=Liik|editor1-first=Kadri|title=Russia's Pivot to Asia: The development of the Russian Far East|date=May 2014|page=80|url=http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR103_RUSSIA_COLLECTION_290514_AW.pdf|access-date=4 September 2014|publisher=European Council on Foreign Relations|location=35 Old Queen Street, London, SW1H 9JA, United Kingdom|quote=The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit held in Vladivostok in September 2012 cost the state 680 billion roubles (over $22 billion) – one-third of which came from the federal budget, with the rest put up by state companies such as Gazprom.

====Kazakhstan====

Neighbouring Kazakhstan has replicated Russia's attempt to access East Asian markets. In September 2013, the presidents of China and Kazakhstan signed commercial deals and launched China's "New Silk Road". On 20 May 2014, both presidents announced they would link Kazakhstan's railways to the [[Pacific Ocean]] by opening a new terminal in the Chinese port city of [[Lianyungang]]. China also signed agreements to make further investments in Kazakhstan's energy sector. Both countries announced they would put aside US$1 billion to modernise an oil refinery in [[Shymkent]] and a further US$150 million to open a new oil and gas plant near [[Almaty]].

===Economic partners===
The Eurasian Economic Union must negotiate as a whole to sign free trade agreements with other countries. Key players for the Eurasian Economic Union are the [[European Union]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]. The EAEU has sought to increase its trade with partners in the [[Middle East]] and [[East Asia]] in order to profit from the growing trade between Europe and Asia.

Tensions with the European Union in 2014 have increased both unions to pressure [[post-Soviet states]] to join their integration unions.

It proposed major high-speed railway lines going towards Europe via Russia and Kazakhstan and another through the Middle East via [[Tajikistan]], a potential future member for the union.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Establishing New Silk Roads|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/china-establishing-new-silk-roads/1953455.html|access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China considers high-speed 'silk railroad' to Europe|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/china-considers-high-speed-silk-railroad-to-europe/8667079.article|access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref> China has signed numerous energy deals with Russia and Kazakhstan, as it tries to move from [[coal]] to less pollutant alternatives.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/central-asias-energy-rush/|title = Central Asia's Energy Rush: The region's major powers are in a tussle to control its rich energy sources|last = Romanowski|first = Michał|date = 3 July 2014|accessdate = 30 August 2014|magazine = The Diplomat}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/07/uk-kazakhstan-china-deals-idUKBRE98608520130907|title = China, Kazakhstan to ink deals worth $30 billion on Saturday|last = Zhumatov|first = Shamil|date = 7 September 2013|access-date = 30 August 2014|work = Reuters|location = Astana, Kazakhstan}}</ref>

Iran has sought to diversify its economy as well, seeing the EAEU and China as key economic partners. Relations between Russia and Iran have increased as both countries are under U.S. sanctions and are seeking new trade partners. in 2014 the two countries signed a historic US$20 billion energy deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vladimir Putin signs historic $20bn oil deal with Iran to bypass Western sanctions|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11014604/Vladimir-Putin-signs-historic-20bn-oil-deal-with-Iran-to-bypass-Western-sanctions.html|access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Russia and Iran strike oil agreement|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101899870#.|access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref> A free trade agreement between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union came into force on 27 October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/441768/Trade-agreement-with-EAEU-officially-declared-to-Iranian-customs|title=Trade agreement with EAEU officially declared to Iranian customs|date=2019-11-08|website=Tehran Times|language=en|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>

Kazakhstan seeks to enhance its ties with Turkey, a key player in the region.

===Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh===

In September 2013, Armenia announced its intentions of joining the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. At the time of joining the Union, the Republic of Armenia already had preferential treatment within the framework of the CIS as a party to the Free Trade Zone Agreement of 18 October 2011, and therefore enjoyed significant tariff benefits. According to an IMF representative in Armenia, Armenia's membership to the Eurasian Economic Union resulted in about $250 million a year in customs revenue. Armenia also benefited in the form of secured privileges for 752 products until 2020, which implies no EAEU tariffs due to Union membership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greater-europe.org/archives/5454 |title=Why Armenia Chose the Eurasian Economic Union |website=greater-europe|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> Joining the Union allowed the country to get even more tangible economic effects due to the functioning of the Common Economic Space, the use of common technical regulation, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, non-tariff regulation. Such results confirm that for the implementation of full-scale freedom of movement of goods, liberalization of tariff regulation alone is not enough.<ref name=ack>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/67852 |title=Giorgi Lomsadze: Will Karabakh "Join" Russia's Customs Union? |website=EurasiaNet.org |access-date=10 December 2013}}</ref> The region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], however, is disputed between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. Tensions rose further in the [[Caucasus]] region on 30 July 2014 due to clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armenia Blames Azerbaijan for Deadly Incident|url=http://www.radiofree.org/us/armenia-blames-azerbaijan-for-deadly-incident/|access-date=7 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024065455/http://www.radiofree.org/us/armenia-blames-azerbaijan-for-deadly-incident/|archive-date=24 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Experts estimate that with the accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] would not be integrated into the Eurasian Union.<ref name=ack /> Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with Armenia's long-standing enemy Turkey. The Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.belta.by/politics/view/kazakhstan-views-disagreements-on-eurasian-economic-union-as-resolvable-3675-2014/|title=Kazakhstan views disagreements on Eurasian Economic Union as resolvable |website=BelTA |access-date=29 April 2014}}</ref> The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, [[Artak Zakarian]], announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will not build any customs borders, including with the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asbarez.com/123001/armenia-rules-out-tariffs-on-karabakh |title=Armenia Rules Out Tariffs on Karabakh |website=Asbarez |access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>

===Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan===

Previously, [[Tajikistan]] was on track to become a potential member of the union, having signed the treaty on the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space. However, due to border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the integration process in Tajikistan has stalled.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":6">{{cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21608806-plan-export-electricity-looks-cursed-mi-casa-no-es-tu-casa|title = A plan to export electricity looks cursed|date = 26 July 2014|access-date = 26 August 2014|newspaper = The Economist}}</ref> Both countries exchanged fire in December 2013 and August 2014, which resulted in casualties.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite news|url = http://en.itar-tass.com/world/746643|title = Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan border guards engage in shootout again|date = 26 August 2014|access-date = 26 August 2014|publisher = Itar Tass}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://news.yahoo.com/two-killed-border-skirmish-between-tajikistan-kyrgyzstan-113727690.html|title = Two killed in border skirmish between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan|access-date = 26 August 2014|agency = Reuters}}</ref> Both countries have since announced they would resolve conflicts and improve border cooperation.

Former European commissioner [[José Manuel Barroso]] stated at the [[World Economic Forum]] that the EU supports the regional integration, including the Eurasian Union. He also praised Kazakhstan for joining the bloc. He criticized the post-Soviet space, saying "the integration in the region is not sufficient". However, he warned that the [[Ukrainian crisis]] is a major obstacle to good cooperation between the EU and the Eurasian Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2015|url=http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/regions-transformation-eurasia|publisher=World Economic Forum|access-date=25 January 2015|date=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Davos 2015 – Regions in Transformation: Euroasia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wb409Nlhlw|website=youtube.com|publisher=World Economic Forum|access-date=25 January 2015}}</ref>

Tensions between the EAEU and the [[European Union]] (EU) occurred as both have sought to deepen their ties with several [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]]. The EU has signed free trade agreements with [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. However, separatists in all three countries back closer ties with [[Russia]]. Russia and the EU both pressured Ukraine to join their respective economic blocs to the exclusion of the other, which ultimately led to Ukraine being torn in two,<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/war-in-ukraine-a-result-of-misunderstandings-between-europe-and-russia-a-1004706.html Summit of Failure: How the EU Lost Russia over Ukraine].

Later the already started construction of the pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was abandoned. Analysts believe Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order to limit western influence in the region.<ref name=":5">{{cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21608807-not-all-goes-smoothly-russia-its-backyard-power-failure|title = Power failure – Not all goes smoothly for Russia in its backyard|date = 26 July 2014|access-date = 26 August 2014|newspaper = The Economist}}</ref>

Western analysts generally see the Eurasian Economic Union as a way to reunite many of the former Soviet republics. For example, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended "to further bolster [Russia]'s ties to former Soviet republics."<ref name=WaPost>{{cite news|title=Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus form Eurasian Economic Union|work=The Washington Post|date=29 May 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-kazakhstan-belarus-form-eurasian-economic-union/2014/05/29/de4a2c15-cb01-4c25-9bd6-7d5ac9e466fd_story.html|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is "an attempt" to re-establish a [[Soviet Union|USSR]]-type union among the former Soviet republics.<ref name=Hillary/> In December 2012, former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] claimed "It's not going to be called that [Soviet Union].

Kazakhstan's president [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] called it "a hard-won achievement" and "a blessing for our people."<ref name=WaPost /> Public support in Kazakhstan for the country's accession to the EAEU stood at 68% in June 2014, with 5.5% opposed.<ref>[http://www.demos.kz/rus/index.php?article=28 Большинство казахстанцев поддерживают вступление Казахстана в Евразийский экономический союз, но 33% считают, что это не принесет им никакой выгоды].

==Existing integration projects==
{{Supranational PostSoviet Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}

The [[Eurasian Customs Union]] has already brought partial economic integration between the three states, and the Eurasian Economic Union is said to be a continuation of this customs union.<ref name="Boris N.

A number of other regional organisations also provide the basis for further integration: the [[Union State]] of Russia and Belarus; the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]], consisting of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan; and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] comprising most of the post-Soviet countries.<ref group=journal>{{cite journal|last1=Brusis|first1=Martin|title=A Eurasian European Union?
