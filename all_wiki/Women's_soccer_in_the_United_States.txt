'''[[Women's association football|Women's soccer]] in the [[United States]]''' has developed quite differently from men's soccer. Until the 1970s, organized women's soccer matches in the U.S. existed only on a limited basis.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Level Playing Field: Why the USA Is So Strong in Women's Soccer|publisher=[[NBC]]|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/level-playing-field-why-usa-so-strong-womens-soccer-n385346?cid=par-time-article_20150705|access-date=6 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=sover>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/womensoverview.html|title=Women's Soccer History in the USA: An Overview|publisher=The American Soccer History Archives|date=17 August 2011|access-date=21 August 2016|first=David|last=Litterer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/353262-the-history-of-soccer-teams-in-the-olympic-games/|title=History Of The U.s.

The highest women's professional soccer league in the United States is the [[National Women's Soccer League]] (NWSL), which was established in 2012 as a successor to [[Women's Professional Soccer]] and is run by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF). The league began with eight teams and reached a maximum size of ten teams before contracting to nine in 2018, with the most recent expansion being the [[Utah Royals FC]]. The NWSL season runs from April to August or September, with each team scheduled for twenty-four regular season games, twelve each at home and on the road.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/about/nwsl|title=About the NWSL|publisher=National Women's Soccer League|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> The NWSL is the third attempt at a women's professional league in the U.S. and has been the most resilient, expanding to 10 teams in 2016 and becoming the first to play two seasons.

== Early history ==
The first organized women's soccer league in the United States was the Craig Club Girls Soccer League, which consisted of four teams in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], playing 15-game seasons in 1950 and 1951.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Jean |title=A Beautiful Game: International Perspectives on Women's Football |date=2007 |publisher=Berg |location=Oxford, England |isbn=9781845206741 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sDUAwAAQBAJ&q=%22craig+club+girls%22&pg=PA59|access-date=2015-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dent |first1=Mark |title=Thirty Years Before Abby Wambach Was Even Born, These Women Pioneered Soccer in America |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_spot/2015/06/12/women_s_world_cup_2015_before_any_team_usa_members_were_even_born_these.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=2015-07-03 |date=2015-06-12}}</ref>

Women's soccer in the United States started to gain popularity in the beginning of the 20th century, much later than it appeared in Europe, which had women's leagues in the 1930s. In the 1970s, [[Title IX]] legislation passed in 1972 made [[gender equality]] mandatory in education, including collegiate athletics, which led to more organized women's soccer teams and development. [[College soccer|Collegiate soccer]] created more popularity for the game in the 1980s. However, there were few professional opportunities for women in the United States, and the first national women's league, the [[USL W-League]], wouldn't be established until 1995.<ref name=sover />

== National team ==
{{Main|United States women's national soccer team}}
{{Main|United States at the FIFA Women's World Cup}}

The women's national team was formed in 1983, but wouldn't play its first games until [[1985 United States women's national soccer team|1985]]. In its first years, it played in little more than friendly tournaments, primarily against European teams, as few competitions for women's national teams yet existed. After the first [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was announced for 1991 and especially on the United States being awarded the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] increased investment in both the men's and women's national teams by the USSF led to the United States' team rapidly improving and winning the first women's World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-28/sports/sp-32320_1_recent-world-cup |title=Foudy Shows Women's Soccer is Alive, Kicking: Future: Former Mission Viejo star hopes her game grows thanks to the popularity of the recent World Cup tournament|publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1994-08-28 |access-date=2012-08-20}}</ref><ref name=sover /> The popularity of the team exploded in the aftermath of the US [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]] win as a result of penalty kicks in front of a sold-out [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|title= SOCCER; U.S. Women Beat Norway To Capture World Cup|work=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/01/sports/soccer-us-women-beat-norway-to-capture-world-cup.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|access-date=2012-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/1999/07/14/womens_league/ |title=CNN/SI - Inside Game - Michael Lewis - Most agree a pro league is needed, but would it work? - Friday July 16, 1999 07:27 AM |work=Sports Illustrated|date=1999-07-16 |access-date=2012-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416231552/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/1999/07/14/womens_league/ |archive-date=April 16, 2003 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1999">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/1999/womens_worldcup/news/1999/07/11/wwc_dayafter/ |title=CNN/SI - Women's World Cup - U.S. women make a mark, leave lingering question - Wednesday July 14, 1999 01:04 AM |work=Sports Illustrated|date=1999-07-14 |access-date=2012-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020219050348/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/1999/womens_worldcup/news/1999/07/11/wwc_dayafter/ |archive-date=February 19, 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Out of this World |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/1999/womens_worldcup/news/1999/07/23/out_of_this_world/ |access-date=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914212439/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/1999/womens_worldcup/news/1999/07/23/out_of_this_world/ |archive-date=September 14, 2000 }}</ref> The close win increased the tension, giving the team a more lively reputation as a sport.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Longman |first1=Jere |title=Soccer; 1999 Women's World Cup: Beautiful Game Takes Flight |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/20/sports/soccer-1999-women-s-world-cup-beautiful-game-takes-flight.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |access-date=2015-07-03 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1999-05-20}}</ref>

Since then, the Americans have remained a force in international women's soccer, having finished third or better in every World Cup, reaching the championship game again in 2011 and winning in 2015 and 2019, as well as appearing in five of the six Olympic gold medal games, winning four. The national team also competes in other tournaments, such as the annual [[Algarve Cup]]. The primary source of young players for the national team is NCAA [[college soccer]], which feeds players to the U-20 national team and eventually the full senior team. Because the United States often lacked a professional women's league, interest in the team peaked around major tournaments, and the team historically struggled to maintain interest between tournaments.<ref name=sover /> The United States also faces increasingly competitive European national teams, many of which have well-established women's leagues in their countries from which to draw players.

=== History ===

==== Amateur soccer: W-League and WPSL ====
{{Main|USL W-League|Women's Premier Soccer League}}
Originally called the United States Interregional Women's League, the USL W-League was formed in 1995 as the first national women's soccer league, providing a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country. It also allowed college players the opportunity to play alongside established international players. Starting as the Western Division of the W-League, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) broke away and formed its own league in 1997 and had its inaugural season in 1998. Both the W-League and the WPSL were considered the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States at the time, but eventually fell to a second-tier level upon the formation of the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] in 2000.

==== Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) ====
{{Main|Women's United Soccer Association}}
A seemingly viable market for the sport became apparent after the United States women's national soccer team won the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/01/sports/sp-45471|title=Women Ready to Kick-Start Soccer League of Their Own|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1 April 2001|access-date=21 August 2016|first1=Grahame|last1=Jones}}</ref> Feeding on the momentum of their victory, the twenty national team players, in partnership with [[John Hendricks]] of the [[Discovery Channel]], sought out the investors, markets, and players necessary to form the WUSA, an eight-team league, in February 2000. The league played its first season in April 2001, and was the world's first women's soccer league in which all players were paid professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/7703/wusa-founding-players-take-pay-cuts.html|title=WUSA – Founding players take pay cuts|first1=Scott|last1=French|publisher=Soccer America|date=25 March 2003|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

The eight teams included the [[Atlanta Beat (WUSA)|Atlanta Beat]], [[Boston Breakers (WUSA)|Boston Breakers]], [[Carolina Courage]], [[New York Power]], [[Philadelphia Charge]], [[San Diego Spirit]], [[San Jose CyberRays]] (called Bay Area CyberRays for 2001 season), and the [[Washington Freedom]].

The U.S. Soccer Federation approved membership of WUSA as a sanctioned Division I women's professional soccer league on August 18, 2000. WUSA had previously announced plans to begin play in 2001 in eight cities across the country, including: [[Atlanta]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], [[Boston]], New York City, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Diego]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. Led by investor John Hendricks, WUSA had also forged ahead on a cooperation agreement that will see the new league work side by side with [[Major League Soccer]] to help maximize the market presence and success of both Division I leagues.<ref>{{Cite web|title = WUSA Granted U.S. Soccer Membership as Division I Women's Professional Soccer League|url = http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/07/wusa-granted-u-s-soccer-membership-as-division-i-womens-professional-soccer-league|website = www.ussoccer.com|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref>

WUSA played for three full seasons and suspended operations on September 15, 2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season due to financial problems and lack of public interest in the sport.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cash-strapped WUSA folds after 3 seasons|url = http://azdailysun.com/cash-strapped-wusa-folds-after-seasons/article_c41897c8-1472-501e-84e9-4a363b961357.html|website = Arizona Daily Sun|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref>

==== Post-WUSA  ====
With the Women's United Soccer Association on hiatus, the [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] (WPSL) and the [[USL W-League|W-League]] regained their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States, and many former WUSA players joined those teams.

After the folding of WUSA, the WUSA Reorganization Committee was formed in September 2003 that led to the founding of Women's Soccer Initiative, Inc. (WSII), whose stated goal was "promoting and supporting all aspects of women's soccer in the United States", including the founding of a new professional league.<ref>{{Cite web|title = WSII|url = http://wsii.typepad.com/wsii/about.html|website = wsii.typepad.com|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref> Initial plans were to play a scaled-down version of WUSA in 2004. However, these plans fell through and instead, in June 2004, the WUSA held two "WUSA Festivals" in Los Angeles and [[Blaine, Minnesota]], featuring matches between reconstituted WUSA teams in order to maintain the league in the public eye and sustain interest in women's professional soccer.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SOCCER.COM {{!}}{{!}} WUSA – Women's United Soccer Association|url = http://www.soccer.com/channels/wusa/index.php?story_id=3|website = www.soccer.com|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref> A planned full relaunch in 2005 also fell through.

In December 2006, WSII announced that it reached an agreement with six owner-operators for teams based in [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], Los Angeles, [[St. Louis]], Washington, D.C., and a then-unnamed city.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Relaunch of WUSA set for spring 2008|url = http://www.espnfc.com/story/411235|website = ESPNFC.com|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref> In September 2007, the launch was pushed back from Spring of 2008 to 2009 to avoid clashing with [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007 Women's World Cup]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and to ensure that all of the teams were fully prepared for long-term operations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Women's pro soccer team put on hold|work=St. Louis Business Journal|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/09/03/daily13.html|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref>

The new league announced its name and logo on January 17, 2008, and was to have its inaugural season in 2009 with seven teams, including the Washington Freedom of the WUSA. The United States national team players allocated 21 players across the seven teams in September 2008. Also in September, the league held the [[2008 WPS International Draft]].

Unlike WUSA, the WPS attempted a more local approach and slower growth. In addition, the WPS attempted to have a closer relationship with [[Major League Soccer]] in order to cut costs. Most teams considered the first season a moderate success, despite many losing more money than planned. However, most teams began to see problems in 2010. Overall attendance for 2010 was noticeably down from 2009, teams struggled financially, and the WPS changed leadership by the end of the season.

The success of the United States women's national team at the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]] resulted in an upsurge in attendance league-wide as well as interest in new teams for the 2012 season. However, several internal organization struggles, including an ongoing legal battle with [[MagicJack (WPS)|magicJack]]-owner [[Dan Borislow]] and a lack of resources invested in the league, led to the suspension of the 2012 season announced in January 2012.

On May 18, 2012, the WPS announced that the league had officially ceased operations after three seasons.

==== WPSL Elite  ====
By this time, the [[Women's Premier Soccer League Elite|WPSL]] and [[USL W-League|W-League]] were the two semi-pro leagues in the United States and had sat under WUSA and the WPS until 2012. Upon the disbandment of the WPS, they once again regained their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States. In response to the suspension &ndash; and eventual end &ndash; of the WPS, the Women's Premier Soccer League created the [[Women's Premier Soccer League Elite]] (WPSL Elite) to support the sport in the United States. For the 2012 season, the league featured former WPS teams with the [[Boston Breakers]], [[Chicago Red Stars]], and [[Western New York Flash]], in addition to many WPSL teams. Six of the eight teams were considered fully professional.

Many members of the USWNT remained unattached for the 2012 season, while others chose to play in the W-League instead of the WPSL Elite.

==== National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) ====
{{Main|National Women's Soccer League}}

After the WPS folded in 2012, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced a round-table discussion of the future of women's professional soccer in the United States. The meeting resulted in the planning of a new league set to launch in 2013 with 12 to 16 teams from the WPS, the W-League, and the WPSL. In November 2012, the USSF, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canadian Soccer Association (CSA)]] and the [[Mexican Football Federation]] (FMF) announced that there would be eight teams in a new women's professional soccer league to be funded by the USSF. The USSF would fund up to 24 players, the CSA up to 16, and the FMF a minimum of 12.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eight teams to start new women's pro soccer league in 2013|publisher=The Equalizer|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/11/21/eight-teams-to-start-new-womens-pro-soccer-league-in-2013/|access-date=5 January 2016|first=Dan|last=Lauletta}}</ref> Four former WPS teams &ndash; the Western New York Flash, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, and [[Sky Blue FC]] &ndash; were joined by four other teams for the inaugural season in 2012. One of those teams, the [[Portland Thorns FC]], is affiliated with the MLS [[Portland Timbers]] and shares its ownership and facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2012/12/timbers-name-new-womens-club-portland.html|title=Timbers name new women's club Portland Thorns|first=Erik|last=Siemers|date=13 December 2012|access-date=21 August 2016|publisher=Portland Business Journal}}</ref>

Each NWSL club is allowed a minimum of 18 players on their roster, with a maximum of 20 players allowed at any time during the season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2016 Roster Rules - National Women's Soccer League|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/about/2016-roster-rules|website=www.nwslsoccer.com|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> Initially, each team's roster included up to three allocated USWNT players, two [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexico women's national team]] players, and two [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada women's national team]] players via [[NWSL Player Allocation]]. Mexico no longer allocates players to the NWSL following the 2017 establishment of its own women's professional league, [[Liga MX Femenil]]. Each team also has, as of 2016, four spots for international players, though these spots can be traded. The rest of the roster must be filled by players from the United States.

The [[Houston Dynamo]] of MLS stated interest in starting a women's team in 2013, and by December 2013 the NWSL approved the new Dynamo-operated team, the [[Houston Dash]], for expansion in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Houston Dash Officially Announced for NWSL 2014|url=http://www.dynamotheory.com/2013/12/12/5201960/houstons-dash-nwsl-officially-announced|website=Dynamo Theory|access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> The addition of the Dash made the NWSL the first top-division professional women's soccer league in the United States to have nine teams.

After the United States women's national team winning the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]], the NWSL announced agreements for its first televised games with [[Fox Sports 1]] during the 2015 season, airing games near the end of the season and during the postseason. The league reached another similar agreement with Fox Sports 1 for the 2016 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Details-of-Fox-Sports-1s-National-Womens-Soccer-League-TV-deal.html|publisher=philly.com|first=Jonathan|last=Tannenwald|title=Fox Sports 1's National Women's Soccer League TV schedule|date=14 April 2016|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref>  The league remained without a season-long broadcast deal, however, and streamed all of its games for free on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/news-2/apr---jun-2015/nwsl-to-live-stream-2015-season-via-youtube|publisher=[[National Women's Soccer League]]|title=NWSL to live stream 2015 season via YouTube|date=9 April 2015|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

After the media boom of the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]], MLS side [[Orlando City SC]] showed interest in starting a women's team for the 2016 season. On October 20, 2015, the NWSL and Orlando City SC announced that [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] would host the [[Orlando Pride]], which started play at the beginning of the 2016 season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Orlando Pride women's soccer team to join NWSL in 2016|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/on-the-town/article.html/content/news/articles/bhsn/2015/10/20/orlando_city_nwsl_soccer.html|website=www.baynews9.com|access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref>

With the beginning of the 2016 season, the NWSL became the first professional women's soccer league to play a fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/15/nwsl-fourth-season-portland-seattle-writers-predictions|date=15 April 2016|access-date=21 August 2016|first1=Caitlin|last1=Murray|first2=Kevin|last2=Koczwara|first3=Jamie|last3=Goldberg|first4=Howard|last4=Megdal|title=The NWSL kicks off its fourth season, and Portland and Seattle look good|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

The 2016–17 offseason saw the league's first major relocation, with the Western New York Flash selling their NWSL franchise rights to [[Steve Malik|the owner]] of [[North Carolina FC]], then members of the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] and now in the [[United Soccer League|USL]], who moved the NWSL team to NCFC's base of the [[Research Triangle]] of North Carolina and relaunched it as the [[North Carolina Courage]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=North Carolina Football Club enters into agreement to acquire rights to NWSL's 2016 champions Western New York Flash|url=http://www.northcarolinafc.com/news/2017/01/09/north-carolina-football-club-enters-into-agreement-to-acquire-rights-to-nwsls-2016-champions-western-new-york-flash |publisher=North Carolina FC |date=January 9, 2017 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>

Shortly before the start of the 2017 season, the NWSL signed a three-year broadcasting deal with [[A&E Networks|A+E Networks]]. Under this deal, A+E's [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]] channel broadcasts 22 regular-season matches as the ''NWSL Game of the Week'' at 4 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday afternoons, as well the league's entire postseason.

Soon after the end of that season, [[FC Kansas City]] folded. The team was partnered with but not owned by MLS side [[Sporting Kansas City]], and media reports indicated that FCKC was the unintended victim of issues that Sporting was facing with its [[United Soccer League]] reserve team, [[Swope Park Rangers]]. Kansas City's place in the NWSL was immediately filled by a new franchise to be operated by another MLS club, [[Real Salt Lake]], which was soon unveiled as [[Utah Royals FC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/real-salt-lake-purchases-fc-kansas-city-nwsl-relocation-news-analysis |title=Real Salt Lake team to replace FC Kansas City: What it means for the NWSL |first=Richard |last=Farley |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=November 15, 2017 |access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the [[Boston Breakers]] folded, dropping the league to 9 teams for the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/boston-breakers-fold-unrecognizable-nwsl-future-analysis |title=The Boston Breakers' demise is another step toward an unrecognizable NWSL, but in which direction is the league headed? |first=Jeff |last=Kassouf |magazine=FourFourTwo |date=January 25, 2018 |access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>

==== Folding of the W-League and creation of United Women's Soccer ====
The [[USL W-League|W-League]] served as a second-tier development organization and league for women's soccer in the United States for 21 seasons. However, the W-League announced on November 6, 2015, that the league would cease operations ahead of the 2016 season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=USL W-League, once top flight, folds after 21 seasons|first=Jeff|last=Kassouf|publisher=The Equalizer|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2015/11/06/usl-w-league-folds-21-seasons/|access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> In response to the folding of the W-League and instability in the WPSL, another second-tier league &ndash; [[United Women's Soccer]] (UWS) &ndash; was founded as a pro-am women's soccer league in the United States. The UWS had 11 teams in two conferences for its 2016 inaugural season, with [[Real Salt Lake Women]], [[New England Mutiny]], [[Lancaster Inferno (WPSL)|Lancaster Inferno]], and [[Houston Aces]] joining from the WPSL and the [[Long Island Rough Riders]], [[New York Magic]], [[North Jersey Valkyries]], [[Santa Clarita Blue Heat]], [[Colorado Storm]], and [[Colorado Pride]] joining from the W-League.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New women's league plans to launch 12/22/2015|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/67081/new-womens-league-plans-to-launch.html|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|publisher=Soccer America|website=www.socceramerica.com|access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> The league doubled in size for its 2017 season, adding a Midwest Conference to go with its original East and West Conferences.

=== Tier system ===
The U.S. Soccer Federation is heavily involved in the creation and operation of the NWSL, but it did not initially refer to the league as a sanctioned Division I league.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NWSL Announces Allocation of 55 National Team Players to Eight Clubs|url=http://nwslsoccer.com/news-2/jan---mar-2013/nwsl-announces-allocation-of-55-national-team-players|website=www.nwslsoccer.com|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> U.S. Soccer has now officially labeled the NWSL as a Division I professional league, and has added the league to its Professional Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/about/affiliates/professional-soccer|access-date=21 August 2016|title=Professional Council – U.S. Soccer|website=www.ussoccer.com}}</ref> Unlike men's soccer, the USSF has not specifically designated tiers or levels below the NWSL. However, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and United Women's Soccer (UWS) act as an unofficial lower division.

== Amateur soccer ==
The [[United States Adult Soccer Association]] (USASA) is a national organization and sanctioning body for amateur soccer in the United States. It consists of 55 state organizations as well as regional and national leagues. The USL's Premier Development League and the National Premier Soccer League are USASA-affiliated but are designed to promote a higher lever of competition than the state organizations. USASA also sanctions the Women's Premier Soccer League and United Women's Soccer league.

=== USASA National Women's Open ===
The [[USASA National Women's Open]] is an American women's soccer tournament run by USASA. It began in 1996, and from 2009–2012 it was known as the Women's Cup. Before the formation of the Women's Open, the [[USASA National Women's Amateur|Women's Amateur]] was the top national cup competition.

Historically, it has been contested only by amateur and semi-pro teams, as teams from professional leagues ([[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]], [[Women's Professional Soccer|WPS]], and the [[National Women's Soccer League|NWSL]]) are not allowed to enter the competition. However, in 2012, the Chicago Red Stars &ndash; then a professional club in the WPSL Elite &ndash; entered and won the competition. Similarly, the professional Houston Aces of the WPSL won in 2013.

=== USASA National Women's Amateur ===
The [[USASA National Women's Amateur]] is an American women's soccer tournament run by the United States Adult Soccer Association. It began in 1980 and was the top-level national tournament for women's soccer in the United States until the formation of the Women's Open in 1996. It is open to all USASA-affiliated women's teams.

=== US Soccer National Amateur Championships ===
First held in 2014, the US Soccer National Amateur Championships are contested between the league winners of WPSL, Open Cup, and Amateur Cup.

== Hardships ==
High operating and travel costs, the lack of TV rights and sponsorship agreements and corresponding lack of funding for salaries and training and development facilities, and the lack of affiliation with profitable men's professional clubs have all hampered the growth of professional women's leagues in the United States. The NWSL, now the longest-lasting professional women's soccer league in the United States, pays salaries as low as $7,200 per year, an amount that falls beneath every government-recognized poverty line in the United States and is less than an equivalent Federal minimum wage job of 40 hours per week. Its highest-paid players who lack a national team affiliation face a maximum cap of $39,700 and teams are held to a salary cap of $278,000, while some players join teams under amateur agreements where the players cannot be paid even if they take the field or start the game. This is far less than the NWSL's predecessors, such as the WPS, where the average salary of $32,000 was almost double the NWSL's maximum average salary of $16,850.<ref name=sbn>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2016/4/15/11409908/nwsl-2016-season-wages-cap-salary-minimum|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|title=NWSL has survived longer than any other women's soccer league. When do players get paid?|first1=Kevin|last1=McCauley|date=15 April 2016|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> It is also poorly competitive with European leagues, which can readily pay salaries to players of the same talent more than $100,000 per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2012/07/15/lindsey-horan-signs-reported-six-figure-deal-with-psg/|date=15 July 2012|access-date=21 August 2016|title=Lindsey Horan signs reported six-figure deal with PSG|first1=Jeff|last1=Kassouf|publisher=The Equalizer}}</ref>

The United States women's national team further highlighted pay issues, both in discrepancy with the men's national team and in fiscal hardships of low NWSL pay, in 2015 and 2016. The women's national team filed action with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] on March 31, 2016, claiming they are paid 1/4 as much as the men's team despite generating more revenue for the U.S. Soccer Federation. The women's team also claimed that they are paid only if they win, and paid less for winning than the men's team is if they were to lose every game. Also, in order for the U.S women soccer team keep pace financially in order to keep up with the men soccer team was by performing at the world beating level and when it came to the victory tour money the women had to pay extra just to get it. However, in contrast to the men they would just get paid just for showing up. According to the recent four years and recent months in 2016 the women's national team played more games about 40 to 50 percent more and than the men and they have 88 wins and the men have 44.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Das |first1=Andrew Das |title=Pay Disparity in U.S. Soccer?

The players' group abandoned the complaint before the tournament.<ref name=ap>{{Cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/6db74b8d74e9472db71047fc50ff3f6f/spurred-field-flap-nwsl-players-sounds|title=Spurred by field flap, NWSL players sound off|first1=Anne|last1=Peterson|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=13 July 2016|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

United States women's soccer players have also faced inferior accommodations and facilities to men's soccer at the professional club level. After a 2016 regular season NWSL game between the [[Seattle Reign]] and [[Western New York Flash]] was played on a baseball field smaller than league regulations considered acceptable, several prominent current and former players called out the league for allowing the game to be played. Former Women's national team goalkeeper [[Hope Solo]], who used to play for the NWSL's [[Seattle Reign]], published a blog post detailing several other examples of failures in hotels, facilities, and equipment while playing for the NWSL.<ref name=ap /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hopesolo.com/2016/07/12/time-for-change/|date=12 July 2016|access-date=21 August 2016|first1=Hope|last1=Solo|title=Time for Change}}</ref>

Another contributing factor is the role of women within American society, which includes relative equality (especially rejecting hardened gender roles) for women in the United States relative to many other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB900031231676127500|first1=Stefan|last1=Fatsis|title=Waking Up to Women's Soccer|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=1998-07-10|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> This is also reflected in official government policies regarding women in athletics, specifically [[Title IX]], which requires college and public school athletics programs to support men's and women's athletics equally. By contrast, youth athletics in many countries &ndash; including most European countries, where soccer development is highly competitive &ndash; is focused on [[sports club]]s, not on school-based programs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hinxman|first1=Dan|title=Ex-college coach proposes ending high school sports|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/preps/story/2012-05-07/Coach-proposes-ending-high-school-sports/54801730/1|access-date=2015-07-02|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2012-05-07}}</ref> Thus, outside the United States, laws prohibiting sex discrimination in the educational system could have limited effect on sports programs.
