The recording by Florida Georgia Line reached No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on its initial release, but dropped off the Hot 100 in February 2013. A couple of months later, a remix by rapper Nelly was released, and the song then re-entered the top 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=27067 |title=Cruise by Florida Georgia Line |work=Song Facts }}</ref> The song reached a peak of No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart in its 34th week, one of the slowest climbs to the top five in the chart's history.

==Background==
The song was written by the two members of Florida Georgia Line, Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard, together with Joey Moi, Chase Rice and Jesse Rice. According to Chase Rice, they (Brian Kelley, Chase Rice and Jesse Rice) were writing a different song, when Kelley started to strum a chord and hummed another melody, which ended up being the melody for "Cruise".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2014/03/25/florida-georgia-line-cruise-behind-the-song-chase-rice/ |title=Behind the Song: Florida Georgia Line’s ‘Cruise’ |date=March 25, 2014 |author=Annie Reuter |work=Radio.com |access-date=January 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127031054/http://radio.com/2014/03/25/florida-georgia-line-cruise-behind-the-song-chase-rice/ |archive-date=November 27, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They decided to drop the song they were writing to write "Cruise" instead, which they finished in 45 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/chase-rice-admits-he-didnt-expect-cruise-to-become-a-big-hit/ |title=Chase Rice Admits He Didn’t Expect ‘Cruise’ to Become a Big Hit|author= Christina Vinson |date=June 12, 2014|work=Taste of Country }}</ref> Kelley originally wrote the opening line as "Baby, you like a song", and the song then went through several edits when Florida Georgia Line recorded the song with producer Moi, with rewrites of some lyrics and the addition of a section after the solo.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/cruise-behind-the-making-of-florida-georgia-lines-mega-hit/2013/09/26/b6960478-2586-11e3-ad0d-b7c8d2a594b9_story.html |title=‘Cruise’: Behind the making of Florida Georgia Line’s mega-hit |author=Emily Yahr September 29, 2013 |work=The Washington Post }}</ref>  In December 2011, the duo signed a publishing deal with [[Craig Wiseman#Big Loud Shirt|Big Loud Shirt]], and recorded "Cruise" that same day.<ref name="tennessean"/>

The song is a mid-tempo in the key of [[B-flat major]] with a main chord pattern of B{{flat}}-F-Gm{{sup|7}}-E{{flat}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0112062|title=Florida Georgia Line "Cruise" Sheet Music - Download & Print|author=Hubbard, Tyler}}</ref> It is about an attractive woman that the male narrator wants to cruise with in his pick-up truck.

==Critical reception==
Billy Dukes of ''[[Taste of Country]]'' gave the song four stars out of five, writing that "their formal training shows in the tight execution of this lyric-heavy summer song."<ref>{{cite news|last=Dukes|first=Billy|title=Florida Georgia Line, ‘Cruise’ – Song Review|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/florida-georgia-line-cruise/|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=Taste of Country|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Matt Bjorke of ''Roughstock'' also gave the song a favorable review, calling it "a feel-good song from a band that likes to have a good time."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|title=The Weekly Single Recap: June 14, 2012|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/the-weekly-single-recap-june-14-2012|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=Roughstock|date=June 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817142209/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/the-weekly-single-recap-june-14-2012|archive-date=August 17, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Liv Carter of ''Urban Country News'' gave the song a 'thumbs-up,' calling it "one of those disposable-yet-enjoyable country summer songs which will not only enjoy a healthy chart run, but find itself on radio playlists for many more summers."<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Liv|title=Single Review: ‘Cruise’ – Florida Georgia Line|url=http://www.urbancountrynews.com/single-review-cruise-florida-georgia-line/|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=UrbanCountry News}}</ref>   Ian Crouch wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that musically, the song is "forward-thinking, combining traditional country harmonies and a banjo backing with rock and roll stadium-show guitars and drums", and "has the hint of a dance-music". However, lyrically, he thought that the song is "ass-backwards".<ref name="newyorker"/>

"Cruise" is credited with the rise of "[[bro-country]]", a musical trend in country music starting in 2013 that entails rock- and rap-influenced country by male artists, often with partying themes. [[Jody Rosen]], a music critic who coined the term bro-country, described "Cruise" as the "most generic song", an "amiable lunk of a song", and that the "most extraordinary thing about it is its aggressive ordinariness."  To Rosen, it exemplifies the genre of bro-country, "music by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude."<ref name="rosen">{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/rise-of-bro-country-florida-georgia-line.html |title=Jody Rosen on the Rise of Bro-Country |last=Rosen|first=Jody |work=Vulture |date=August 11, 2013 }}</ref>  Its themes of women and driving are noted by critics to typical of the genre of bro-country, with its perceived objectification of women the target of criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/what-is-bro-country/ |title=Bro-Country … What the Heck Is It? |author= Billy Dukes|work=Taste of Country }}</ref> Some country purists also thought it too influenced by hip-hop, pop and rock to be country music, with one describing the song as "the death of modern country music".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nashvillegab.com/2013/08/why-florida-georgia-lines-cruise-is-the-death-of-modern-country-music-a-rant.html |title=Why Florida Georgia Line’s "Cruise" is the death of modern country music [A Rant] |author=Ashley Anne-Helene |date=August 1, 2013|work=Nashville Gab }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://theboot.com/florida-georgia-line-love-hate/ |title=Poll: Florida Georgia Line – Love Them, or Hate Them?|author= Sterling Whitaker |date=August 13, 2013|work=The Boot }}</ref>

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Brian Lazzaro and premiered in August 2012. It was filmed outside [[Nashville]], and featured the duo driving and performing against an [[American flag]] backdrop at a colorful paint party, and showed shots of women as well as a game of [[strip poker]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyland|first=Sarah|title=Watch Florida Georgia Line’s "Cruise" Video|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/08/28/watch-florida-georgia-lines-cruise-video/|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Great American Country]]|date=August 28, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120830115809/http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/08/28/watch-florida-georgia-lines-cruise-video/ |archive-date=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

==Chart performance==
"Cruise" debuted at No. 54 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart for the week of August 11, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Edward|title=Zac Brown Band's ''Uncaged'' Racks Up Third Week at No. 1|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1691182/zac-brown-bands-uncaged-racks-up-third-week-at-no-1.jhtml|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Country Music Television]]|date=August 4, 2012}}</ref> On the chart dated December 15, 2012, it reached No. 1 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Country Airplay]] chart in only its 19th week, achieving the fastest climb to the top of the chart for a debut single since [[Heartland (band)|Heartland]]'s "[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]" in October 2006.

"Cruise" went on to spend three weeks atop the Country Airplay chart—the most weeks at No. 1 on Country Airplay for a new act's first charted title since [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s "[[Redneck Woman]]" in early 2004—and 24 weeks (over three different runs including the [[Nelly]] remix) atop the new Hot Country Songs chart. When the song reached its 10th week atop Hot Country Songs on May 18, 2013, it became the second song ([[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]") to spend that many weeks at No. 1 since [[Buck Owens]]'s "[[Love's Gonna Live Here]]" (16 weeks between October 1963 and February 1964). On August 24, 2013, it logged its 24th week at No. 1, the longest run at No. 1 in the chart's 69-year history (the previous record was 21 weeks held jointly by three songs, the last of which was [[Webb Pierce]]'s "[[In the Jailhouse Now]]" from February to June 1955). On November 9, 2013, the song logged its 66th and final week on the Hot Country Songs chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2013-11-09/country-songs|title=Country Music: Top Country Songs Chart - Billboard|work=Billboard}}</ref> setting a new all-time record of 56 weeks, previously held jointly by "[[Love Like Crazy (song)|Love Like Crazy]]" by [[Lee Brice]] and "[[Wanted (Hunter Hayes song)|Wanted]]" by [[Hunter Hayes]], and just the sixth song to spend 52 or more weeks on the chart during a single chart run.

"Cruise" debuted at No. 99 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for the week of September 1, 2012. It spent 26 consecutive weeks on it, peaking at No. 16. The song returned to the Hot 100 following the release of the remix with [[Nelly]], reappearing at No. 8 for the week ending April 20, 2013, and reaching a new peak at No. 4 in the issue dated July 6, 2013. The remix video featuring Nelly has over 91 million views as of November 2018.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmZ9xRO7M9M|title=Florida Georgia Line - Cruise (Remix) ft.
