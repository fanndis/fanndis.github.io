The post replaced the existing position of a [[Chairman of Central Executive Committee (Ukraine)|chairman of Central Executive Committee]] (1917-37). Along with the chairman, from 1937 to 1996 Verkhovna Rada was also governed by the [[Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada]] that consisted of about 20 members.
