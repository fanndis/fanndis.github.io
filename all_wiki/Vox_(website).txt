== Content ==
According to ''Vox''{{'s}} founding editors, the site seeks to explain news by providing additional contextual information not usually found in traditional news sources.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Klein |first1=Ezra |last2=Bell |first2=Melissa |last3=Yglesias |first3=Matt |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/3/28/5559144/nine-questions-about-vox |title=Nine questions about Vox |website=Vox |date=March 9, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2018}}</ref> To reuse work from authors prior to the relaunch in 2014, ''Vox'' creates "card stacks" in bright canary yellow that provide context and define terms within an article. The cards are perpetually maintained as a form of "wiki page written by one person with a little attitude".<ref name="NYT: melding">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html?_r=0 |accessdate=December 26, 2014 |title=Vox Takes Melding of Journalism and Technology to a New Level |last1=Kaufman |first1=Leslie |date=April 6, 2014 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6V7lIdtpR?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/voxcom-takes-melding-of-journalism-and-technology-to-next-level.html?_r=1 |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> As an example, a card about the term "insurance exchange" may be reused on stories about the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref name="NYT: melding" />

''Vox'' uses Vox Media's Chorus [[content management system]], which enables journalists to easily create articles with complex visual effects and transitions, such as photos that change as the reader scrolls.<ref name="NYT: melding" /> Vox Media's properties target educated households with six-figure incomes and a head of house less than 35 years old.<ref name="NYT: melding" />

== Reception ==
In March 2014, before it had officially launched, ''Vox'' was criticized by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] media commentators, including [[Erick Erickson]], for a video<ref>{{cite web |last=Yglesias |first=Matthew |title=Stop freaking out about the debt |date=March 28, 2014 |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/3/28/5559052/stop-freaking-out-about-the-debt |website=Vox |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=December 17, 2019}}</ref> it had published arguing the [[U.S. public debt]] "isn't a problem right now".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/ezra-kleins-vox-is-already-being-labeled-left-wing-propaganda-by-conservatives/359709/ |title=Ezra Klein's Vox Is Already Being Labeled 'Left-Wing Propaganda' by Conservatives |last=Cosman |first=Ben |newspaper=The Atlantic |language=en-US|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after it launched, conservative writer [[David Harsanyi]] criticized the site's concept of "explanatory journalism" in an article in ''[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]'' titled "How Vox makes us stupid", arguing that the website selectively chose facts, and that "explanatory journalism" inherently leaves out opposing viewpoints and different perspectives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thefederalist.com/2014/04/08/how-vox-makes-us-stupid/ |title=How Vox makes us stupid |last=Politics|access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry at ''[[The Week]]'' argued that the website produced "partisan commentary in question-and-answer disguise" and criticized the site for having a "starting lineup [that] was mostly made up of ideological liberals".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/445880/vox-derp-intellectual-stagnation-left |title=Vox, derp, and the intellectual stagnation of the left |website=[[The Week]]|access-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Week]]''{{'}}s Ryu Spaeth described the site's operations as: "It essentially takes the news (in other words, what is happening in the world at any given moment in time) and frames it in a way that appeals to its young, liberal audience."<ref>{{Cite news |author=Ryu Spaeth |url=https://theweek.com/articles/567586/gawker-meltdown-voxification-news-media |title=The Gawker meltdown and the Vox-ification of the news media |date=July 21, 2015|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref>
