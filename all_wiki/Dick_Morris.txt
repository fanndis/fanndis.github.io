Morris encouraged Clinton to pursue [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] policies of [[Triangulation (politics)|triangulation]] that combined traditional Republican and Democratic proposals, rhetoric, and issues so as to achieve maximum political gain and popularity. He worked as a Republican strategist before joining the Clinton administration, where he helped Clinton recover from the [[Republican Revolution|1994 midterm elections]] by advising the President to adopt more moderate policies.<ref name=Time>{{cite magazine|title=Who is Dick Morris?|last=Pooley|first=Eric|magazine=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985043,00.html|date=September 2, 1996|access-date=2008-09-17}}</ref> The president consulted Morris in secret beginning in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/chapters/4.html |title=Frontline: The Clinton Years |access-date=2007-12-27}}</ref> Clinton's communications director [[George Stephanopoulos]] has said, "Over the course of the first nine months of 1995, no single person had more power over the president."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/interviews/stephanopoulos4.html |title=Frontline: the clinton years: interviews: george stephanopoulos |publisher=PBS |date=1995-06-13 |access-date=2010-07-10}}</ref> Morris went on to become [[campaign manager]] of [[Bill Clinton]]'s successful 1996 [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|bid for re-election]] as President, but his tenure on that [[political campaign|campaign]] was cut short two months before the election, when it was revealed that he had allowed a prostitute to listen in on conversations with the President.

Morris now writes a weekly column for the ''[[New York Post]]'' which is carried nationwide, contributes columns and blogs to both the print and online versions of ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''.

== Early life ==
Morris was born in New York City, New York, the son of writer [[Terry Lesser Morris]], an early proponent of confessional [[human interest story|human interest stories]], and attorney Eugene J. Morris.<ref>Laura Miller, [http://www.salon.com/2011/10/16/sybil_exposed_memory_lies_and_therapy/singleton/ "'Sybil Exposed': Memory, lies and therapy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016222638/http://www.salon.com/2011/10/16/sybil_exposed_memory_lies_and_therapy/singleton/ |date=October 16, 2011}} salon.com (October 16, 2011). Retrieved October 17, 2011</ref> He attended [[Stuyvesant High School]] in New York City,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D61538F933A15753C1A963958260 |title=President's Guru Goes Public; Back Home, Dick Morris Tells Tales From the Clubhouse |first=Alison |last=Mitchell |date=1995-10-20 |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=2007-11-02}}</ref> where he was active on the debate team. He managed [[Jerrold Nadler]]'s campaign for [[student government|class president]]; Nadler has since gone on to represent New York in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Morris was also involved in the first campaign of [[Richard Gottfried]] for New York State Assembly in 1970. Morris graduated from Stuyvesant in 1964, then attended [[Columbia University]], where he earned a Bachelor of Arts [[academic degree|degree]], graduating in 1967.

Morris is a first cousin once removed of [[Roy Cohn]], who served as chief counsel to Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s.

== Morris and the Clintons ==
Morris first worked with Bill and [[Hillary Clinton]] during Bill Clinton's successful 1978 bid for [[Governor of Arkansas]]. Morris did not have a role in Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, which instead was headed by [[David Wilhelm]], [[James Carville]], [[George Stephanopoulos]], and [[Paul Begala]]. After the 1994 mid-term election, in which Republicans took control of both houses of the [[United States Congress]] and gained considerable power in the states, Clinton once again sought Morris' help to prepare for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 Presidential election]].

=== Prostitute scandal ===
On August 29, 1996, Morris resigned from the Clinton campaign after tabloid reports stated that he had been involved with a prostitute, Sherry Rowlands, as reported by the ''[[Washington Post]]''. A New York [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper, the ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', had obtained and published a set of photographs allegedly of Morris and the woman on a Washington, D.C., hotel balcony. News of the impending publication broke during the third day of the 1996 Democratic Convention. The ''[[Electronic Telegraph]]'' reported unverified claims that in order to impress Rowlands, Morris invited her to listen in on his conversations with President Clinton.  According to Rowlands, Morris had a fondness for sucking toes.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/morris020399.htm Dick Morris, High on the Critical List], Washington Post</ref><ref>McCaslin, John, "Inside the Beltway," The Washington Times, September 5, 1996</ref><ref>Hall, Allan, "I'd Like to Bed Hillary; Kinky aide called the First Lady 'Twister' and Bill 'Monster'," The Mirror, August 30, 1996</ref> It was also alleged he had an out-of-wedlock child from an affair with a Texas woman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/morris.htm |title=Dick Morris, 1996 |work=Washingtonpost.com |date= 1998-07-21|access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref>

Morris resigned on the same day that Bill Clinton spoke and accepted the nomination at the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. In his resignation statement, he said that "while I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message. Now, I resign so I will not become the issue."<ref name=Resign>{{cite news|title=Call-Girl Story Costs President A Key Strategist|last=Berke|first=Richard|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/us/call-girl-story-costs-president-a-key-strategist.html|date=August 30, 1996}}</ref> In his response, President Clinton praised Morris as a "friend", and thanked him for his years of service. Privately, several of Clinton's aides were furious that in his resignation statement Morris credited himself with helping the President "come back from being buried in a landslide" and that Morris ended by comparing himself to [[Robert F. Kennedy]].<ref name="Skunk" />

Morris was featured on [[List of covers of Time magazine (1990s)#1996|two consecutive covers]] of ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine. The September 2, 1996 issue, which was released before the prostitute story broke, featured Morris as "The Man Who Has Clinton's Ear".<ref name="Time" /> The following week, the cover featured Morris and his wife, [[Eileen McGann (author)|Eileen McGann]], and the headline read "The Morris Mess: After the Fall".<ref name="Skunk">{{cite magazine|title=Skunk at the Family Picnic|last=Pooley|first=Eric|magazine=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985081,00.html|date=September 9, 1996|access-date=2009-03-25}}</ref>

In his book ''Why Just Her'', on his defence of the ''"Washington Madam"'', [[Debra Jeane Palfrey]], [[Montgomery Blair Sibley]] wrote that Morris was a client of Palfrey's escort agency, and the first individual he planned to call in Palfrey's defence.<ref name=WhyJustHer />

=== Later work ===
In his 1997 book, ''Behind the Oval Office'', Morris wrote that, following an argument in the Arkansas Governor's Mansion in May 1990, he strode toward the exit and was tackled by Clinton. In 2003, Morris further stated that Clinton cocked his arm back to throw a punch, but Hillary Clinton pulled her husband off Morris. In both versions of the story, she consoled Morris and apologized to him, stating that Bill behaved as such only with those he cared for most. According to Morris, she did this to keep him quiet about the incident. He says the incident was the reason for denying Bill Clinton's request to work on the 1992 campaign.<ref>''National Review'': [http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/207207/setting-record-straight/dick-morris Setting the Record Straight:] An open letter to Hillary Clinton. Dick Morris, June 12, 2003.</ref>

Morris has become a vocal and regular critic of the Clintons since his departure, in particular Hillary Rodham Clinton and her bid for the presidency. Morris has written extensively about the Clintons (see below) and also contributed to ''[[Hillary: The Movie]]'', a documentary about Rodham Clinton when she was still a 2008 Presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillarythemovie.com/about.html |title=About |publisher=Hillarythemovie.com |date= |access-date=2010-07-10}}</ref> Later, after Bill Clinton's comments about the similarities between [[Barack Obama]]'s popularity and that of presidential candidate [[Jesse Jackson]] in 1988, Morris put out an article on his blog that asserted that this was Clinton's way of injecting race into the political campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/2008/02/04/super-tuesday-outlook-obamas-surge/ |title=Super Tuesday Outlook: Obama'S Surge At |publisher=Dickmorris.com |access-date=2010-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712042918/http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/2008/02/04/super-tuesday-outlook-obamas-surge/ |archivedate=July 12, 2010 |df=mdy}}</ref>

== Political consulting ==
As of August 2009, Morris lends his name and assistance to the League of American Voters, an advocacy group for seniors to defeat the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. He has been described as "America's most ruthless political consultant" in the BBC documentary ''[[Century of the Self]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/AdamCurtisCenturyoftheSelfPart4of4_0 |title=Century of the Self Part4 of 4 |access-date=2007-11-02}}(Dick Morris segment at ~34:45)</ref> which chronicled how he brought [[lifestyle marketing]] to politics for the first time.

Morris has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of [[Fernando de la Rua]] for [[President of Argentina]] (1999), [[Jorge Batlle]] for [[President of Uruguay]] (1999), [[Vicente Fox]] for [[President of Mexico]] (2000), and [[Raphael Trotman]] for [[President of Guyana]] (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000015/001577.htm |title=Guyana opposition party hires Clinton's former campaign manager |publisher=Caribbean Net News |date=2006-05-12 |access-date=2010-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904234654/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000015/001577.htm |archivedate=September 4, 2008 |df=mdy}}</ref>

Morris and his wife, Eileen McGann, are behind [https://web.archive.org/web/19961226172523/http://www.vote.com/ www.vote.com], a site intended to register non-scientific political public opinion on various issues.

Morris worked as a strategist for [[Christy Mihos]], who sought the Republican nomination to run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in 2010 against incumbent [[Deval Patrick]] overseeing strategy, polling, and advertising.<ref name=Mihos /> At the Republican state convention, Mihos lost to [[Charlie Baker (politician)|Charlie Baker]] by 89 percent to 11 percent; by failing to reach 15 percent, Mihos did not qualify for a [[primary election|primary]] against Baker.<ref>{{Citation| last = Bierman| first = Noah | title = After spot on ballot is denied, Mihos says he won't run again| newspaper = [[The Boston Globe]]| date = April 18, 2010| url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/04/18/after_spot_on_ballot_is_denied_mihos_says_he_wont_run_again/| access-date = 2012-01-15}}</ref>

== Guest commentator and political prognosticator ==
{{example farm|date=September 2018}}
Since leaving Clinton's employ in 1996, Morris has said he has become profoundly "disillusioned" with the actions of the Clintons in the late 1990s. He has since formed a career as a political commentator and critic of the Clintons (particularly Hillary), appearing on [[Fox News]] programs such as ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'', ''[[Hannity]]'', and ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', and on various local and nationally [[Radio syndication|syndicated]] radio [[Talk radio|talk shows]]. Morris is also a regular columnist and Pundits Blogger for [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]], a nonpartisan daily newspaper based in Washington, D.C., and for [[NewsMax.com]], a conservative online news website.<ref>[[The Hill (newspaper)]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmax.com/pundits/Morris.shtml |title=Dick Morris |access-date=2007-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812172327/http://www.newsmax.com/pundits/Morris.shtml |archivedate=August 12, 2007 |df=mdy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmaxstore.com/nm/newsmax_pundits.cfm |title=NewsMax Pundits |access-date=2007-11-02}}</ref> Morris regularly makes predictions about candidates' chances of winning elections during these appearances.

Regarding the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, he initially stated that [[Howard Dean]]'s candidacy could be written off right away. He had earlier discussed the likelihood of Dean defeating [[John Kerry]] after early strong showings by the former [[Vermont]] governor. Kerry defeated Dean and all his other rivals and won the nomination.

In a column in ''The Hill'' on June 22, 2005, Morris predicted that Hillary Clinton would face her "worst nightmare" in her 2006 Senate race against Republican candidate [[Jeanine Pirro|Judge Jeanine Pirro]], whose campaign subsequently collapsed within a matter of two months after repeated crushing defeats in the opinion polls due to her husband's alleged [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] ties. He even went so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton would drop out to focus on her 2008 presidential campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/dick-morris/4714-helping-hillary-now-will-hurt-the-republicans-later |title=Helping Hillary now will hurt the Republicans later |date=2005-06-21 |access-date=2012-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,102322,00.html |title=Bush's Weapon Against Dean |date=2003-11-05 |first=Dick |last=Morris |access-date=2007-11-02 | work=Fox News}}</ref>

In 2005 Morris wrote that [[Hurricane Katrina]] "has the capacity to shape the second [[George W. Bush|Bush]] term in the same way [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] shaped his first term—not only in rebuilding [[New Orleans]] but in taking preventative steps around the nation to bolster our defenses against natural and man-made disasters and terror strikes. Responding to disasters is a source of presidential strength and popularity, and Bush is about to show how it is done."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/dick-morris/bush-will-rebound-from-katrina-missteps-2005-09-07.html |title=Bush will rebound from Katrina missteps |first=Dick |last= Morris |date=2005-09-07 |access-date=2007-11-02}}</ref>

In a 2005 book on the 2008 presidential campaign, Morris stated that it was most likely that Hillary Clinton would face [[Condoleezza Rice]] for the presidency. Morris's critics reacted by mocking his mistaken predictions of past races. Appearing on Fox News' ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'' on January 29, 2008, Morris said that those voting for [[John Edwards]] were "at the moment... those that can't decide which they don't like more—a black or a woman getting elected". Morris elaborated that [[exit polls]] showed some Edwards voters were unsure if a woman or an African-American, in reference to then Democratic Primary front runners Hillary Clinton and [[Barack Obama]], could get elected to the Presidency for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/01/30/dick-morris-says-edwards-voters-dont-like-the-black-or-female-candidate |title=Dick Morris: Edwards voters don't like the 'black' or the 'female' |first=Joh |last=Amato |date=2008-01-30 |access-date=2008-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209012427/http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/01/30/dick-morris-says-edwards-voters-dont-like-the-black-or-female-candidate/ |archivedate=February 9, 2008 |df=mdy}}</ref>

After Obama won the 2008 election, Morris was critical of him. In early 2009, Morris said: "Those crazies in [[Montana]] who say, 'We're going to kill [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agents because the UN's going to take over'? Well, they're beginning to have a case."<ref>''Your World with Neil Cavuto'', Fox News Channel, March 31, 2009.</ref> In April 2009, Morris keynoted an animated debate at the [[Yale Political Union]] on the topic "Resolved: Save Capitalism from President Obama".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/ypu/minutes/ypu-2009-04-21.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805212444/http://www.yale.edu/ypu/minutes/ypu-2009-04-21.html |archivedate=August 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In March 2010, [[About.com]], owned by [[The New York Times Company]], named Morris one of the top 20 conservatives to follow on Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usconservatives.about.com/od/gettinginvolved/tp/Top-Conservatives-on-Twitter.htm|title=Top Conservatives to Follow on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref>

In a March 2011 column for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Morris predicted that Obama would not win a second term as President.<ref>Deutsch-Feldman, Ezra and Fitzgerald, Michael (2011-03-24) [http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/85668/dick-morris-obama-2012-japan-economy Dick Morris Is Lying, Part ∞], ''[[The New Republic]]''</ref> For many years a "disillusioned Democrat," Dick Morris has stated he is now a Republican.

In August 2011, Morris began a petition on his website opposing federal funding for the [[Park51]] [[Muslim]] community center, [http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/no-federal-funds-for-ground-zero-mosque/ claiming] that the center is "designed to celebrate the attacks that killed 3,000 Americans", and that the center [http://www.foxbusiness.com/on-air/lou-dobbs-tonight/index.html#/v/1134689212001/uphill-battle-for-obamas-reelection-efforts/?playlist_id=164630 would] "train the same kinds of terrorists who caused the... attacks".

In July 2012, he stated that he believed that [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]] would pick Florida Senator [[Marco Rubio]] as his [[running mate]]; insisting "It's the only choice that makes sense," going as far as to state, "I believe Mitt Romney has known for six months that he's going to pick Marco Rubio."<ref>Newsmax: [http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/rubio-romney-vp-candidate/2012/07/16/id/445539 Dick Morris to Newsmax: Rubio Is the 'Only Choice That Makes Sense'] July 16, 2012.</ref> Romney would end up choosing [[Wisconsin]] Congressman [[Paul Ryan]] as his running mate.<ref>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/us/politics/mitt-romney-names-paul-ryan-as-his-running-mate.html?pagewanted=all Romney Adds Ryan, Pushing Fiscal Issues to the Forefront.] August 11, 2012.</ref>

In August 2012 Morris claimed that Bill Clinton was going to vote for [[Mitt Romney]], but that he would still speak in favor of Obama because "his wife is hostage."<ref>''Hannity'', Fox News Channel, July 31, 2012.</ref>

In October 2012, Morris was a speaker at a special meeting of the Republican Caucus of the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] to discuss claims that Obama was using [[Delphi method|'mind-control']] techniques to create a Communist dictatorship controlled by the United Nations under the guise of promoting [[sustainability]] and [[public transportation]]. Speaking at the event, Morris argued that Obama's aim was to join with the United Nations to "force everyone into the cities from whence our ancestors fled."<ref>''Atlanta Journal Constitution'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20140724112432/http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2012/11/12/georgia%E2%80%99s-own-52-minute-video-on-agenda-21/ Georgia's own 52-minute video on the 'Agenda 21′ conspiracy].

== 2012 Electoral College prediction ==
As of November 5, the day before the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]], Morris predicted on his website and in an article in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' that the Republican candidate, [[Mitt Romney]], would win the presidency in a landslide "approaching the magnitude of [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s against [[John McCain|McCain]]." Specifically, he stated that Romney would win 325 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] votes and that Obama would win 213.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/dick-morris/266027-prediction-romney-325-obama-213-|title=Prediction: Romney 325, Obama 213|first=Megan|last=Ruyle|date=November 6, 2012|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="Morris">{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Dick|title=Prediction: Romney 325, Obama 213|url=http://www.dickmorris.com/prediction-romney-325-obama-213/#more-10128.html|publisher=DickMorris.com|access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref> (Obama ended up winning 332 electoral votes with Romney winning 206, meaning Morris was off by 119 electoral votes.) He explained the logic behind his prediction in a video posted at his website.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moris |first=Dick |title=Prediction!

On Tuesday, we'll change our president."<ref name="Morris" /> With regard to his prognostications, Morris announced on ''[[Fox and Friends]]'' two days before the election that after the election "either I'm gonna have to go through a big reckoning, or they [the mainstream pollsters] are."<ref>''Fox & Friends'', Fox News Channel, November 4, 2012.</ref> [[Jon Stewart]] mocked the idea on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', calling Dick Morris the "King of Wrong Mountain" and claiming that pundits live in a "reckoning-free zone."<ref>{{cite web |last=LoGiurato |first=Brett |title=Jon Stewart Shreds Dick Morris, 'King of Wrong Mountain' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jon-stewart-election-predictions-obama-romney-daily-show-2012-11.html |website=Business Insider|access-date=2012-12-07}}</ref> Morris was the least accurate major pundit in predicting the 2012 presidential election.<ref name=VoteSeeing>{{cite web |url=http://www.voteseeing.com/2012/11/2012-presidential-prediction-rankings.html |title=2012 Presidential Prediction Rankings |access-date=2012-12-07}}</ref>

In Morris's article in ''The Hill'', he identified some "key mistakes" by the Obama campaign, which he stated would cost Obama the election:
* The campaign "bet the farm on negative ads in swing states."
* Obama never moved to the political center.
* The Obama campaign did not consider Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan or Minnesota swing states.
* Obama "became nothing more than a nasty partisan" instead of trying to look presidential.
* Obama offered nothing more than "a grab-bag of special-interest pleadings for single women, unions, college kids and minorities".
* Obama underperformed in the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012#October 3: First presidential debate (University of Denver)|first presidential debate]].
* Obama was slow to release information about the [[attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi]].
* Obama returned to campaigning too quickly after [[Hurricane Sandy]].

On November 7, 2012, the day after the election, Morris published an article in ''The Hill'' titled "Why I was wrong".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/dick-morris/266741-why-i-was-wrong|title=Why I was wrong|first=Megan|last=Ruyle|date=November 8, 2012|publisher=}}</ref> Morris stated that he had "egg on his face" and that the "key reason for my bum prediction is that I believed, mistakenly, that the 2008 surge in black, Latino and young voter turnout would recede in 2012 to 'normal' levels. Didn't happen. These high levels of minority and young voter participation are here to stay. And, with them, a permanent reshaping of our nation's politics." In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Morris added: "I called it as I saw it from the polling and I did the best I could and I also worked very hard for Romney." He elaborated on the latter point by explaining that he thought it was his duty to help the Romney campaign by countering pessimism about Romney's chances.<ref>''Hannity'', Fox News Channel.

According to FEC disclosures, Morris' Super PAC For America disbursed approximately $1.7mm for "fundraising" to Newsmax.com, who Morris is closely affiliated with.<ref>Federal Election Commission: [http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00489781/838801/sb/ALL Schedule B: Itemized Disbursements.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411120248/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00489781/838801/sb/ALL |date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> Emails from both Morris and Newsmax were paid for by Super PAC for America. Some media outlets speculate that Morris took advantage of Super PAC For America donations by paying Newsmax for fundraising which in turn paid Morris large sums of money to 'rent' his email list.<ref>''The American Prospect'': [http://prospect.org/article/dick-morris-con-artist Dick Morris, Con Artist].</ref><ref>The Young Turks: {{YouTube|PzneOkkhb5A|Dick Morris Cashed in on Bogus Election Predictions}}.</ref>

After the election, Morris did not appear on Fox News for almost three months. Finally on February 5, 2013, Fox announced that it would not renew Morris' contract.<ref name="Politico" /> In addition to his numerous inaccurate predictions, Morris had been criticized for accepting paid ads on his Website from candidates whom he discussed on the air, a clear conflict of interest.<ref>[https://tv.yahoo.com/news/fox-cuts-ties-commentator-dick-morris-011037434.html Fox cuts ties to commentator Dick Morris].

== Foreign political consultant ==
Morris worked with the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] in their campaign before the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European Parliament election]].<ref name="ukip">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4162497.stm |title=UKIP's secret weapon? |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |first=Nick |last=Assinder |date=14 January 2005 |access-date=26 September 2015}}</ref> The party, which advocated withdrawal from the [[European Union]], won 12 of the United Kingdom's 78 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3805929.stm |title=Leaders meet MPs over EU results |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=14 June 2004 |access-date=26 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2004 and 2005, he and his wife had acted as campaign consultants to the successful [[Viktor Yushchenko|Yushchenko]] Presidential campaign in [[Ukraine]].<ref name="ukip" /> Morris reports that he insisted on the use of [[exit poll]]s as a means of potentially exposing [[ballot]] tampering. He argues this played a significant role in forcing the government of then President [[Leonid Kuchma]] to acquiesce to a new poll when the official results of the first varied materially from the exit surveys. Faced with a similar (though smaller) divergence between exit polling and election returns, he took the opposite stance in a 2004 article in ''The Hill'' when he suspected "foul play" on the part of the exit pollsters in the US presidential race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/dick-morris/those-faulty-exit-polls-were-sabotage-2004-11-04.html |title=Dick Morris |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |access-date=2010-07-10}}</ref>

In a November 13, 2007 press conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], Morris announced that he would be offering his consultancy services [[pro bono]] for the campaign to elect [[Raila Odinga]] as President of Kenya in the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|2007 Presidential election]] running on the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] ticket. With four weeks to the national elections, an editorial in one of the leading dailies called into question the legalities of Morris' consulting work from the perspective of his presence in and lack of legal ability to work in Kenya "pro bono" or "through the back door".<ref>''The Standard'', November 22, 2007: [http://eastandard.net/news/?id=1143977783 Raila outs another dodgy "consultant"]</ref>

The outcome of the December 27, 2007, elections in Kenya is still disputed due to allegations of electoral fraud and rigging by the incumbent president, [[Mwai Kibaki]], the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] and erroneous reporting by the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). Massive protests and tribal tensions have since erupted between the president's [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] tribe and the majority of other tribes not favorably aligned to the outcome. Major mediations have commenced between concerned parties, including possible formation of a coalition and/or interim government until reelections are held.

== Radio host ==
Morris was host of a daily radio talk show on [[WPHT]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], from 2013 to 2015. Morris cited his desire to campaign for 2016 Republican candidates as his reason for leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillygossip/Dick-Morris-announces-hes-leaving-WPHT.html |title=Dick Morris announces he's leaving WPHT |publisher=philly.com |date= |access-date=2015-05-07}}</ref>

== DVD ==
Morris has appeared in, and wrote the screenplay for, the documentary film ''[[FahrenHYPE 9/11]]''. The film was a response to [[Michael Moore]]'s [[2004 in film|2004]] film, ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.

== Tax issues ==
Morris failed to pay a variety of state and federal taxes beginning in 1996. In 2010, he declared that he had reached an agreement with the State of Connecticut, and that he is committed to paying his taxes: "Following a difficult period in my life, I fell into arrears. But since then, I have paid almost $3 million in state and federal taxes."<ref name="a.abcnews.com">{{cite web |url=http://a.abcnews.com/Business/PersonalFinance/Story?id=4650368&page=3 |title=From O.J. to Dick Morris: Taxes Go Unpaid – ABC News |publisher=A.abcnews.com |date= |access-date=2010-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927183907/http://a.abcnews.com/Business/PersonalFinance/Story?id=4650368&page=3 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2012, the lien that had been placed on his house was lifted.<ref>[http://www.gossipextra.com/2012/08/16/dick-morris-irs-taxes-fox-1727/ IRS to Fox News' Dick Morris: Congrats, You're All Paid up!]<!-- Terrible source, but seems accurate -- please improve! --></ref>

== Books ==
Morris has written several books, many co-authored with his wife, Eileen McGann. He authored ''Condi vs. Hillary'' in which he argues that only [[Condoleezza Rice]] could block Hillary Clinton's anticipated 2008 bid for the White House.

''Rewriting History'' was published in May 2004 as a rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's book, ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-2224-5}}). In it, he argues that Hillary Clinton has presented a false "nice" persona in the book. Morris instead remembers her as manipulative, cold, and single-minded in her pursuit of power. Similarly, Morris and McGann wrote ''Because He Could'' in response to Bill Clinton's memoir ''[[My Life (memoir)|My Life]]'' ({{ISBN|0-375-41457-6}}).
