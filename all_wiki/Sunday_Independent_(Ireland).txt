The '''''Sunday Independent''''' is an Irish populist Sunday [[newspaper]] [[broadsheet]] published by [[Independent News & Media]] plc, a subsidiary of [[Mediahuis]].

It is the Sunday edition of the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', and maintains an editorial position midway between magazine and [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]].

==History==
[[File:Armoured Car, Passage West, Cork (6652701421).jpg|thumb|This photo appeared in the ''Sunday Independent'' on 13 August 1922, with the caption: "A Dangerous Corner – This photograph was taken in one of the towns captured during the past week by the National Army. It shows an armoured car "manoeuvring for position" at the end of a street facing the post office. Irregulars occupy the further end of the street, and are being quickly dislodged by infantry supported by the armoured car."]]

The ''Sunday Independent'' was first published in 1905 as the Sunday edition of the ''Irish Independent''.<ref name="tb">''The Blackwell companion to modern Irish culture'' Edited by W. J. McCormack. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001 (pp. 304–5). {{ISBN|0-631-22817-9}}</ref> Following the creation of the [[Irish Free State]], the ''Sunday Independent'' followed its daily counterpart's political line by supporting [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] and its successor [[Fine Gael]].<ref name="tb" />

From the 1940s until 1970, the paper was run by [[Hector Legge]] (1901–1994). Legge's time at the paper was notable for the ''Sunday Independent'' in 1948 leaking the news that the Irish government were going to leave the [[British Commonwealth]] by repealing the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]].<ref>"Hector Legge" (Obituary) in ''The Times'', 11 November 1994.</ref> Legge also published a series of articles by the writer [[Frank O'Connor]] (under the pseudonym "Ben Mayo") in the paper.<ref>James H.

In the 1970s, under the editorship of Conor O'Brien, the ''Sunday Independent'' became known for a series of investigations by journalist Joe MacAnthony into the activities of the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|Irish Sweepstakes]].<ref>''Irish Media: A Critical History since 1922'' by John Horgan, Routledge, 2001.(p.105). {{ISBN|0-415-21640-0}}</ref>

==Content==
The newspaper is a general Sunday newspaper, covering news and politics. It is published in five sections: News, Sport, Business, Property, and Living, as well as a magazine section. In terms of news, while the newspaper maintains a broadsheet outlook, it has come in for much criticism lately due to its increasing emphasis on lifestyle features in the main section. It has also been criticised for regularly tending towards sensationalism, and for the often opinion-focused, rather than news-focused nature of its articles.<ref>"Making a "tabloid broadsheet" work", Michael Foley. Irish Times, 21 March 1997, p.6. Retrieved 26 October 2011.</ref><ref>"''The absence of critical journalism is most obvious in the pages of the ''Sunday Independent''. The paper is low on actual hard news content and instead places an emphasis on colour pieces or features. As well as promoting its "personality journalism", the newspaper dwells on the trials and tribulations of the elite personalities in Irish society''". Quoted in "Trivial Pursuits" by Eoin Devereux, ''Magill'' magazine, May 1998, (p.56).</ref> It is probably better described as a ''middle-of-the-road'' newspaper, rather than a [[newspaper of record]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Deputy Editor was [[Anne Harris (journalist)|Anne Harris]].<ref>[[Emily O'Reilly]], ''Veronica Guerin-The Life and Death of a Crime Reporter''. Vintage, 1998 (p.73). {{ISBN|0-09-976151-3}}</ref>

The ''Sunday Independent'' has become one of the most controversial publications in Ireland; an article in ''[[Magill]]'' magazine about the newspaper stated, "Its critics have characterised it as nasty and narcissistic , its supporters as lively and libidinous, a tornado of fresh air in a stale and shrinking industry".<ref name="magill">"No More Vanity Fare?" (Profile of the ''Sunday Independent'') by Eddie Holt, David Quin and Catherine Logan. ''Magill'' Magazine, November 1997, (p.36-41).</ref>

Noted for its trenchant support for [[Fianna Fáil]], and particularly [[Bertie Ahern]] and latterly [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]], it usually contains articles focused that party and its policies, often at the expense of other political groups in the state. The Government's former Minister for Defence, [[Willie O'Dea]] writes a weekly column for the newspaper. The former partner of Bertie Ahern, [[Celia Larkin]] has also started writing as a columnist for the newspaper following the closure of her beauty salon business.

Popularly nicknamed ''The Sindo'', the paper has been a zealous critic of the [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Sinn Féin]] for many years.<ref name="tpc">''The Troubles: Ireland's ordeal, 1966–1996, and the search for peace'' by [[Tim Pat Coogan]]. London: Arrow, 1996 (p. 395). {{ISBN|0-09-946571-X}}</ref> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ''Sunday Independent'' was reproachful toward SDLP politician [[John Hume]], whom the newspaper accused of being insufficiently attentive to the needs of the [[Ulster Unionists]].<ref>''"The SDLP leader John Hume still has some public explaining to do.&nbsp;... Why has he refused to make any concession to Unionist difficulties on the whole question of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]?"'' ''Sunday Independent'' editorial, quoted in "The lead for the leader writers", ''[[Fortnight Magazine]]'', No. 271, March 1989, (p. 15).</ref> Many of the ''Sunday Independent's'' columnists also criticised Hume for negotiating with Sinn Féin leader [[Gerry Adams]], accusing Hume of being naive about Adams.<ref name="magill" /><ref name="tpc" /><ref>''Modernisation, crisis and culture in Ireland, 1969–1992'' by Conor McCarthy.

New look Life Magazine on October 4th 2020, In March 2020 Living went back to broadsheet 2020 first new look Sunday Independent for some years. Keeping the [[Broadsheet]] size even though (2004-2012) [[Irish Independent]] was in both sizes of [[Broadsheet]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] before moving to the smaller size. But on [[Sunday]] there will still more demand the [[Big]] newspaper meaning the Sunday Independent still rules out a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]] edition. On November 29th 2020 Living was replaced by People & Culture Magazine.

==Editorial==
The Editorial policy of the ''Sunday Independent'' can be described as support for [[Laissez-faire]] policies in economics and strong opposition to armed [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]]; some have described the newspaper's policies as those of the [[New Right]].<ref name="magill" /> It was strongly supportive of the [[Progressive Democrats]] and in favour of income tax reduction and the rolling back of the state. Major issues often include big government, the size of the public sector, terrorism, and more recently, the Republic's regime of stamp duty on newly acquired property. It usually features articles by [[Alan Ruddock]], [[Jody Corcoran]], [[Brendan O'Connor (journalist)|Brendan O'Connor]], [[Anne Harris (journalist)|Anne Harris]], Deputy Editor [[Willie Kealy]] and, a more recent addition, economist [[Marc Coleman]]. Prior to his death, former editor [[Aengus Fanning]] also contributed material here. The ''Sunday Independent'' is quite hostile to the Irish [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] and social democratic policies; in the early 1990s, the paper singled out Labour politicians [[Mary Robinson]] (then serving as [[President of Ireland]]), [[Dick Spring]] and [[Michael D. Higgins]] for intense criticism.<ref name="magill" /><ref>Emily O'Reilly, (p. 68).</ref> The ''Sunday Independent'' also took a negative tone towards rival media outlets [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and the ''[[Irish Times]]'', objecting to perceived left-wing and pro-[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] bias in these organisations.<ref name="magill" />

The ''Sunday Independent's'' editorials came out strongly against [[Martin McGuinness]]' campaign to become [[President of Ireland]] in 2011, claiming McGuiness' IRA past made him unsuitable for the role: "''Those who contemplate voting for&nbsp;... McGuinness should ask if, within the context of the murders committed by the IRA on our security forces, they are prepared to force our soldiers and gardai to salute President McGuinness with equally heavy hearts.''".<ref>"Penny drops on McGuinness".

==Controversies==
The newspaper has been the source of many controversies over the years:

===Bishop Casey controversy===
In 1993, the ''Sunday Independent'' advertised what was claimed as a "world exclusive" interview with Bishop [[Eamon Casey]] after he had fled Ireland following the revelation of his affair with Annie Murphy. However it was later revealed that Casey had refused to speak to the ''Sunday Independent'' and the "interview" was in fact a telephone recording of Casey speaking to a friend. The ''Sunday Independent'' later apologised for this incident, stating "''We are not satisfied the bishop was interviewed in any normal sense of the word''".<ref name="magill" /><ref>"Paper admits errors in Casey Report", ''Irish Times'', 26 April 1993, (p.2). Retrieved 1 November 2011.</ref>

===The Keane Edge===
The Keane Edge was a gossip column written by [[Terry Keane]], a fashion journalist and estranged wife of former [[Chief Justice of Ireland]], [[Ronan Keane]]. It was frequently the subject of successful libel actions by persons angered by accusations therein.<ref name="magill" /> In it there were often hints of a relationship with a prominent political figure, named in the column as ''Sweetie''. In 1999, it was revealed by Keane on the [[RTÉ One]] programme, ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)|The Late Late Show]]'', that the figure had been the former [[Taoiseach]], [[Charles Haughey]]. Keane gave the story as an exclusive to rival newspaper [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''The Sunday Times'']], while still employed by [[Independent News and Media]]. She abruptly left the newspaper (amid much recriminations) and her column continued as ''Not The Keane Edge'', soon renamed ''The Double Edge''.

===Mary Ellen Synon controversy===
[[Mary Ellen Synon]], a columnist with the newspaper, caused much controversy when she attacked the [[Paralympic Games]] as being "perverse", in an article of 22 October 2000. This became the subject of much public debate and lead to the columnist being criticised in the [[Oireachtas Éireann|Oireachtas (Irish Parliament)]]. Initially, the editor, [[Aengus Fanning]], defended the columnist, however he eventually issued an apology, after the then [[health Board (Ireland)|health boards]] threatened to withdraw advertising from the newspaper. Synon has not written for the newspaper since, although it was denied that she had been dismissed from the newspaper.<ref>''Disability and Social policy in Ireland'' by Suzanne Quin and Bairbre Redmond, University of Dublin Press, 2003 (p. 174).</ref>

===The 03 team===
The 03 (later 04) team were a group of young female journalists who appeared in the ''Sunday Independent'' during 2003 and early 2004. The articles, originally appearing in the ''Living'' supplement but soon promoted to the main section, comprised the various members of the team writing usually very poor quality short articles on a common subject. However, they were usually accompanied by a large colour group photo of the team posing scantily clad and very occasionally [[Toplessness|topless]]. Eventually the feature was dropped,<ref>"[http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/frontpagepdfs/2003/10235.pdf]" unison.ie (PDF)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424152317/http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/frontpagepdfs/2003/10235.pdf |date=24 April 2005 }}</ref> but not before the team had made a [[television]] appearance on the [[RTÉ One]] show ''[[Open House (Ireland)|Open House]]''. They occasionally featured as a fantasy figure for fictional ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' character [[Ross O'Carroll-Kelly]].

===Death of Liam Lawlor===
On 22 October 2005, the controversial Irish politician [[Liam Lawlor]] was killed in a road traffic accident in the [[Khimki]] district of [[Moscow]] during the early hours of Saturday morning. His driver was also killed in the accident, and a female passenger in the back seat of the car was slightly injured. The ''Sunday Independent'' edition of 23 October published a story on its front page, written by [[Ciarán Byrne]], [[Jody Corcoran]] and [[Nick Paton Walsh]], claiming that Lawlor's car had been travelling "from a [[red-light district]]" of Moscow and that police had claimed that the female passenger was a teenage girl who police claimed was "likely to be a prostitute". Reports later during Sunday revealed that the female passenger was actually a 32-year-old [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] national who worked in [[Prague]] as a legal secretary and interpreter and who had worked in that role for Lawlor before during previous business trips to Russia.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1023/lawlorl.html RTÉ News: Lawlor family 'saddened' by media coverage]. RTÉ.</ref> As the furore over the accuracy of the article continued on the Sunday, the article disappeared from the front page of the newspaper's website (although it could still be accessed by specifying its [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]), and the [[PDF]] copy of the front page of the newspaper (usually available on the website) was also taken down.

On Monday 24 October, the managing director of Independent Newspapers, Michael Denieffe, admitted in an interview on [[RTÉ Radio 1]]'s lunchtime news programme, ''[[RTÉ News at One|News at One]]'', that the report had been "inaccurate" and apologised to the Lawlor family for the distress caused. The original article had by this point disappeared from the website entirely, and the PDF copy of the front page had reappeared on the website with the offending article blanked out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/frontpagepdfs/2005/13173.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026025332/http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/frontpagepdfs/2005/13173.pdf|title=Irish Independent &#124; Breaking, Irish & World News – Independent.ie|archivedate=26 October 2005}}</ref> Later that afternoon, the editor of the ''Sunday Independent'', Aengus Fanning, also apologised to the Lawlor family and said that he "took full responsibility" for the inaccurate report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1024/lawlorl.html|title=Newspaper apologises for Lawlor report|date=24 October 2005|work=RTÉ.ie}}</ref> There had been considerable outrage about the report during the day, with calls being made on phone-in radio programmes for a [[boycott]] of the newspaper unless the editor and others responsible for the report resigned or were sacked.

On Tuesday 25 October, ''[[The Observer]]'', whose Moscow correspondent [[Nick Paton Walsh]] had been one of those by-lined in the original story, issued a statement acknowledging that there had been "serious discrepancies" in the article it had published (also claiming that the woman concerned was a prostitute), apologised for the distress caused, and removed the article from its website. In addition, Paton Walsh stated that he had had "no hand" in the drafting of the ''Sunday Independent'' article. Paton Walsh said that "an editor" in the ''Sunday Independent'' had contacted him on the Saturday seeking help to confirm reports that Mr Lawlor had died. Paton Walsh said that he had spoken with an official police spokesperson and relayed only the contents of three conversations with this same person to their news desk, saying that he had stressed that it was "only a possibility the girl was a prostitute".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2005/1026/629250659HM1LAWLOR.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904232411/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2005/1026/629250659HM1LAWLOR.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-09-04 | title=The Irish Times – Wed, Oct 26, 2005 – Apology from newspapers sought …}}</ref>

It was reported on Wednesday 26 October that the interpreter, Julia Kushnir, was seeking apologies from those newspapers who had published erroneous reports that she was a prostitute, and that she was likely to sue for damages if the newspapers did not comply.

The controversy sparked a debate over press standards in Ireland, with the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] Senator [[Kathleen O'Meara (politician)|Kathleen O'Meara]] calling for the establishment of a Press Council to monitor standards in the print media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=160222464&p=y6xzz3y7x|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708004945/http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=160222464&p=y6xzz3y7x|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-08|title=BreakingNews.ie – Irish News – Breaking News from Ireland|work=iol.ie}}</ref> The then Minister for Justice, [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], stated that the print media coverage of Mr Lawlor's death was "grossly offensive, cruel and lacking in foundation and fact", and that defamation was not enough to deal with this kind of posthumous coverage. He said that legislation was being drafted to establish an appropriate press complaints council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1025/lawlorl.html|title=Lawlor's son slams newspaper reports|date=25 October 2005|work=RTÉ.ie}}</ref>

On 10 June 2006, the ''Irish Times'' reported that Kushnir was to sue ''The Observer'', the ''Sunday Independent'', the ''Sunday Tribune'', the ''Sunday World'', the ''Irish Sunday Mirror'', and the ''Irish Independent'' over the erroneous claim that she was a prostitute.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2005/1104/1555504086HM1KUSHNIR.html]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}. The ''Irish Times'' Online, 2005.</ref> On 6 November 2007, the four Irish newspapers agreed to pay Kushnir libel damages totalling €500,000 before libel proceedings began in the Irish High Court and lawyers for the four newspapers apologised in court for the offence caused. ''The Observer'' newspaper had earlier settled its libel action for approximately €100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2007/1107/1194222776930.html|title=€500,000 libel damages in Lawlor crash case|date=November 11, 2007|work=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=19 September 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202031546/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2007/1107/1194222776930.html|archive-date=2 February 2011 }}</ref>

===Death of Sgt. Tania Corcoran===
The ''Sunday Independent'' sparked another furore in March 2007 when the newspaper featured a front-page report of the death in childbirth of Garda Sergeant Tania Corcoran.<ref>"[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/garda-who-lost-wife-and-son-in-childbirth-shot-john-carthy-123016.html Garda who lost wife and son in childbirth shot John Carthy]".

The newspaper was sued by relatives of the murdered solicitor [[Pat Finucane (solicitor)|Pat Finucane]] over allegations that Finucane was a member of the [[Provisional IRA]]. Finucane was a solicitor who came to prominence due to successfully challenging the British Government over several important human rights cases in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politico.ie/index.php/video/tonight/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3486&limitstart=1|title=Interview with Geraldine Finucane: Breaking the glass ceiling|work=politico.ie}}</ref> He was shot fourteen times as he sat eating a meal at his [[Belfast]] home with his three children and wife, who was wounded in the attack.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1677046.stm Pat Finucane: A controversial killing]".

The paper was forced print an apology to the family of Finucane.

===Supporting Bertie Ahern===
The newspaper strongly supported [[Bertie Ahern]] during the [[2007 Irish general election]] and continued to support him during his appearances before the [[Mahon Tribunal]].  Columnists [[Eoghan Harris]] and [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]] have been particularly strong in supporting Ahern. In August 2007 Harris was appointed to [[Seanad Éireann]] by Ahern.  At the same time as supporting Ahern, the newspaper has been strongly critical of [[Taoiseach]], [[Brian Cowen]].  Several front-page articles, written by Jody Corcoran and [[Daniel McConnell (journalist)|Daniel McConnell]], have accused him of mishandling the economy since the May 2007 election. According to McConnell's recent articles, Cowen has refused repeatedly to deal with ''Sunday Independent'' information requests.

=== Familial ties ===
The ''Sunday Independent'' is noteworthy for the numerous familial ties within the publication.

[[Anne Harris (journalist)|Anne Harris]], is now editor of the ''Sunday Independent'', her daughter Constance Harris writes for the newspaper as a fashion writer. Anne Harris is the former wife of [[Eoghan Harris]] who is an opinion columnist for the newspaper and she was the partner of the previous ''Sunday Independent'' editor, the late Aengus Fanning whose son Dion Fanning also writes for the newspaper as a sports writer covering soccer. Another of Fanning's sons, Evan also writes for the newspaper while his nephew, Brendan Fanning is rugby correspondent.

Sarah Caden and [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]], a married couple, are both columnists; however, they met while both were working for the ''Sunday Independent''.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2011-09-27|title=The Heart of Saturday Night|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2011/0927/432584-oconnorb/|language=en}}</ref>

[[Shane Ross]] is a former Business Editor of the ''Sunday Independent'', he was succeeded by his son-in-law [[Nick Webb (journalist)|Nick Webb]]. Ironically, Ross was a frequent critic of nepotism, cronyism and under-performance in Irish companies, particularly the Smurfit family's influence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/top-of-the-agenda-shane-ross-26241158.html|title=Top of the agenda. Shane Ross|website=independent}}</ref> within the [[Smurfit Kappa|Smurfit Group]] despite the family status as minority shareholders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/top-of-the-agenda-shane-ross-26242227.html|title=Top of the Agenda - Shane Ross|website=independent}}</ref>

Despite being a publicly listed company, the parent company Independent News and Media employed as its CEO [[Gavin O'Reilly]] whose father was the largest shareholder and Chairman [[Tony O'Reilly]]. Gavin O'Reilly was ousted as CEO after INM's share price collapsed and [[Denis O'Brien]] became the largest shareholder.

=== INM plc support and Denis O'Brien ===

The Independent group has often been accused of supporting the business interests of the O'Reilly family and in particular the parent group INM plc. [[Shane Ross]], business editor and columnist, in particular has repeatedly praised the performance of Independent News and Media and its largest shareholder [[Tony O'Reilly]] and refrained from commenting on the subsequent collapse in the INM share-price and debt restructuring. Denis O'Brien in contrast has been the frequent subject of critical comment, in particular when his business activities conflicted with the O'Reilly family.

In the 2001 battle for control of Eircom with then-largest shareholder Tony O'Reilly, the ''Sunday Independent'' wrote of the inevitability of the sale to O'Brien, writing "The Employee Share Option Trust (ESOT) has made its position clear: better dead than Denis.  If they stick to this line it will be almost impossible for him to secure the votes needed to capture Eircom. Deadlock looms. And what happens if Valentia then walks away, leaving Denis as the highest bidder? Not yet likely, but possible. Sir Anthony is not going to pay a silly price for Eircom."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/time-to-sell-irish-shares-26249950.html|title=Time to sell Irish shares|website=independent}}</ref>

In a 2002 article headlined as ''"tough questions for the INM board"'', Tony O'Reilly was referred to as the "noble Knight" by Shane Ross, who reminded shareholders of historic share-price performance and "good dividend" while referring to the "well-publicised woes of the Irish Times" and refraining from comment on the €400 million spent on ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]''. In 2006 he wrote glowingly of "success fuelled by global strategy"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/inm-success-fuelled-by-global-strategy-26410088.html|title=INM success fuelled by global strategy|website=independent}}</ref> and referred reverentially to O'Reilly "global nature of INM's earnings is surely its strength? Tony O'Reilly has exploited an enviable knack of targeting the right geographical zones with an uncanny anticipation of future trends."

While Denis O'Brien is often newsworthy, the ''Sunday Independent'' has paid particular attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O'Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group's coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O'Reilly wrote "As far as I am concerned, Independent News and Media have spent the last seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the ''Sunday Tribune'', ''Sunday Independent'', ''Irish Independent'' and ''Evening Herald'' have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. I very much doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught."<ref name="irishindo">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/i-will-destroy-you-and-your-father-and-i-will-go-after-everything-26564052.html|title='I will destroy you and your father and I will go after everything'|website=independent}}</ref>

After this O'Brien began to build a personal stake in INM plc at huge cost{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}} and in 2007 as O'Brien stepped up his criticism of the O'Reilly management Shane Ross labeled Denis O'Brien as a dissident shareholder and accused him of launching "a destabilisation strategy"<ref name="independent.ie">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/shane-ross/obriens-guns-misfire-26298796.html|title=O’Brien’s guns misfire|website=independent}}</ref> due to the critical report into INM's corporate governance. Ross also described the critics as "human stooges" and lauded the share price under O'Reilly, and looked forward to a "bright future" ''"Shareholders in Independent Newspapers have never been better off. On Wednesday its stock stood at €3.66, close to its high. In the last year it has outperformed the Irish index. A record dividend is due to drop into shareholders' letterboxes . The stock yields 3.5 per cent. While the future looks bright, the past is dazzling. Any shareholder who invested €1,000 in the Indo's shares in 1973, when O'Reilly took over, will now have €580,000"''<ref name="independent.ie"/>

In a 2008 commentary on the INM plc AGM Shane Ross referred to O'Brien as "an ordinary, likeable bloke&nbsp;... from a solid middle-class background" but a "little businessman" and "no star", and mocked his Malta residency, although not only was Chairman [[Tony O'Reilly]] a resident in an offshore tax haven ([[Bahamas]]) but 70% of CEO Gavin O'Reilly's remuneration was paid into an-off shore Jersey entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/how-the-o-reillys-lost-battle-for-inm-1.1064732|title=How the O'Reillys lost battle for INM|date=8 June 2012|work=The Irish Times}}</ref> "Whatever the source of the obvious personal resentment which the man from Malta feels for Sir Anthony O'Reilly, this weekend let us show him some gratitude. He gave us shareholders a clear choice. In return we gave him an unambiguous verdict. Vacate the pitch." After Ross wrote the article the share price collapsed and the company was restructured, without attracting additional comment from Ross's column.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/shane-ross/money-cant-buy-me-love-26443593.html|title=Money can't buy me love|website=independent}}</ref>

In 2009 in a phone call to Gavin O'Reilly, O'Brien, by then a 26% shareholder in INM, criticized O'Reilly's stewardship of the company and issued a series of ultimatums and threatened to call an extraordinary general meeting if not implemented. O'Brien's criticisms intensified, culminating with Mr O'Brien's threat to Mr O'Reilly: "I will destroy you and your father and I will go after everything."<ref name="irishindo" />
