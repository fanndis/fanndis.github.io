'''United States Customs and Border Protection''' ('''CBP''') is the largest [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], and is the country's primary [[border control]] organization. It is charged with regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting [[Customs duties in the United States|import duties]], and enforcing U.S. regulations, including trade, [[customs]], and immigration. CBP is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States.<ref>"[https://www.cbp.gov/about About CBP]" U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

==Organization==

CBP has a workforce of over 58,000 employees, including officers and agents, agriculture specialists, aircraft pilots, trade specialists, mission support staff, and canine enforcement officers and agents.
*More than 21,180 CBP Officers inspect and examine passengers and cargo at 328 ports of entry.<ref name="nyt-inside-border-patrol-2019">{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=Manny |last2=Jordan |first2=Miriam |last3=Kanno-Youngs |first3=Zolan |last4=Dickerson |first4=Caitlin |title='People Actively Hate Us': Inside the Border Patrol's Morale Crisis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/us/border-patrol-culture.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 September 2019 |date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>
*Over 2,200 CBP Agriculture Specialists work to curtail the spread of harmful pests and plant and animal diseases that may harm America's farms and food supply or cause [[Bioterrorism|bio-]] and [[agro-terrorism]].
*Over 21,370 [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] Agents protect and patrol {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of [[Mexico–United States border|border with Mexico]] and {{convert|5000|mi|km}} of [[Canada–United States border|border with Canada]].
*Nearly 1,050 Air and Marine Interdiction Agents prevent people, weapons, narcotics, and conveyances from illegal entry by air and water.
*Nearly 2,500 employees in CBP revenue positions collect over $30 billion annually in entry duties and taxes through the enforcement of trade and tariff laws. In addition, these employees fulfill the agency's trade mission by appraising and classifying imported merchandise. These employees serve in positions such as import specialist, auditor, international trade specialist, and textile analyst.
*The primary goal of the CBP Canine Program is terrorist detection and apprehension. The CBP Canine Program is critical to the mission of the Department of Homeland Security: "To Protect the Homeland." The program conducts the largest number of [[working dog]]s of any U.S. federal [[law enforcement agency]]. [[Police dog|K-9]] teams are assigned to 73 commercial ports and 74 Border Patrol stations throughout the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/canine-program|title=Canine Program |website=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/canine-program/history-3|title=Canine Program History|website=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

There are 328<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about/leadership-organization/executive-assistant-commissioners-offices|title=Executive Assistant Commissioners' Offices &#124; U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=Cbp.gov}}</ref> officially designated ports of entry and an additional 14 pre-clearance locations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry/operations/preclearance|title=Preclearance Locations|website=Cbp.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> in [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Middle East]], [[Bermuda]], and the [[Caribbean]]. CBP is also in charge of the [[Container Security Initiative]], which identifies and inspects foreign cargo in its mother country before it is to be imported into the United States.

In addition the CBP claims to have legal jurisdiction to conduct some activities up to {{convert|100|mi|km}} inwards from any land or sea border.  This can include operating interior checkpoints.<ref name="ACLU-100-Miles">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone |title=The Constitution in the 100-Mile Border Zone |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Aclu.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604063515/https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone |archive-date=June 4, 2020 |quote=Specifically, federal regulations give U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authority to operate within 100 miles of any U.S. "external boundary."}}</ref> <ref name="CityLab-100-miles">{{cite web |url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/05/who-lives-in-border-patrols-100-mile-zone-probably-you-mapped/558275/ |title=Mapping Who Lives in Border Patrol's '100-Mile Zone' - CityLab |last=Misra |first=Tanvi |date=May 14, 2018 |website=citylab.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |access-date=June 11, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426114117/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/05/who-lives-in-border-patrols-100-mile-zone-probably-you-mapped/558275/ |archive-date=April 26, 2020 |quote=the border zone is home to 65.3 percent of the entire U.S. population }}</ref>

CBP assess all passengers flying into the U.S. for terrorist risk via the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF) and systems such as [[Advance Passenger Information System]] (APIS), United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology ([[US-VISIT]]), and the Student and Exchange Visitor System ([[SEVIS]]). CBP also works with the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] to screen high-risk imported food shipments in order to prevent [[Bioterrorism|bio-terrorism]] and [[agro-terrorism]].

Through the [[Container Security Initiative]], CBP works jointly with host nation counterparts to identify and screen containers that pose a risk at the foreign port of departure before they are loaded on board vessels bound for the U.S. CSI is implemented in 20 of the largest ports in terms of container shipments to the U.S., and at a total of 58 ports worldwide.

The [[Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection]] (SENTRI) program allows pre-screened, low-risk travelers from [[Mexico]] to be processed through dedicated lanes. [[NEXUS]] is a similar program on the country's northern border with Canada. Along both borders, CBP has implemented the [[Free and Secure Trade]], which uses [[transponder]] technology and pre-arrival shipment information to process participating trucks as they arrive at the border. An agreement with Canada allows CBP to target, screen, and examine rail shipments headed to the U.S.

CBP is authorized to provide aerial surveillance outside of the border area "to assist law enforcement and humanitarian relief efforts" when requested by local, tribal, state or federal agencies.  CBP drones have been used to capture images of storm-impacted areas for the [[National Weather Service]]; assess hurricane affected areas for [[FEMA]]; and provide surveillance for local law enforcement during the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] and 2020 [[George Floyd protests]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cox | first = Joseph | date = June 3, 2020 | title = The Government is Regularly Flying Predator Drones Over American Cities | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wnzm/government-flying-predator-drones-american-cities | work = VICE}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Sands | first = Geneva | date = May 29, 2020 | title = Customs and Border Protection Drone Flew over Minneapolis to Provide Live Video to Law Enforcement | url = https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/politics/cbp-drone-minneapolis/index.html | work = CNN}}</ref>

==Enforcement powers==
[[File:PHL DNC305 (28482015210).jpg|thumb|right|Scanning a delegate bus entering the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]]]
CBP has the authority to search outbound and inbound shipments, and uses targeting to carry out its mission in this area. Under Section 596 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930|Tariff Act]], CBP is required to seize and forfeit all merchandise that is stolen, smuggled, or clandestinely imported or introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1595a.html|title=19 U.S. Code § 1595a – Forfeitures and other penalties|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> CBP is also required to seize and forfeit controlled substances, certain contraband articles, and plastic explosives that do not contain a detection agent. In conjunction with the [[Department of State]] and the [[Bureau of the Census]], CBP has put in place regulations that require submission of electronic export information on [[U.S. Munitions List]] and for technology for the Commerce Control List. CBP uses advance information from the [[Automated Targeting System]] and the [[Automated Export System]] to identify cargo that may pose a threat. CBP also works with the Departments of State and Defense to improve procedures on exported shipments of foreign military sales commodities.

Merchandise may also be seized and forfeited if:

*Its importation is restricted or prohibited because of a law relating to health, safety or conservation;
*The merchandise is lacking a federal license required for the importation;
*The merchandise or packaging is in violation of copyright, trademark, trade name, or trade dress protections;
*The merchandise is intentionally or repetitively marked in violation of [[country of origin]] marking requirements; or
*The imported merchandise is subject to quantitative restrictions requiring a visa or similar document from a foreign government, and the document presented with the entry is counterfeit.

===Civil penalties===
Section 1592 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]] is the basic and most widely used customs penalty provision for the importation of goods.  It prescribes monetary penalties against any person who imports, attempts to import, or aids or procures the importation of merchandise by means of false or fraudulent documents, statements, omissions or practices, concerning any material fact.  Penalties may be applied even in situations where there is no loss of revenue.

Section 1592 infractions are divided into three categories of culpability, each giving rise to a different maximum penalty:

*''Fraud'', an act or omission done intentionally to defraud the United States.  The maximum civil penalty for a violation is the domestic value of the merchandise in the entry or entries concerned.
*''Gross negligence'', an act or omission with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and a disregard of section 1592 obligations. The maximum civil penalty is the lesser of the domestic value of the merchandise or four times the loss of revenue (actual or potential). If the infraction does not affect revenue, the maximum penalty is 40% of the dutiable value of the good.
*''Negligence'', involving a failure to exercise due care in ascertaining the material facts or in ascertaining the obligations under section 1592. The maximum civil penalties are the same for gross negligence, except the lesser of ''twice'' the domestic value of the merchandise or twice the loss of revenue is used. The penalty cannot exceed 20% of the dutiable value.
The [[Customs Modernization Act]] amended section 1592 to apply existing penalties for false information to information transmitted electronically and allows Customs to recover unpaid taxes and fees resulting from 592 violations. It also introduced the requirement that importers use "reasonable care" in making entry and providing the initial classification and appraisement, establishing a "shared responsibility" between Customs and importers, thus allowing Customs to rely on the accuracy of the information submitted and streamline entry procedures. To the extent that an importer fails to use reasonable care, Customs may impose a penalty.

US Customs Agriculture Specialist Officers are allowed to issue civil penalties in accordance with CFR 7 & 9.

===Criminal penalties===
In addition to the civil penalties, a criminal fraud statute provides for sanctions to those presenting false information to customs officers, with violators facing a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, or a $5,000 fine, or both, for each violation involving an importation or attempted importation.<ref>{{cite web|title=8 U.S. Code § 542 – Entry of goods by means of false statements|publisher=Legal Information Institute|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/542|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref>

==History==
===U.S. Customs Service===
{{Main|United States Customs Service}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:US Customs.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs Inspectors, late 19th century]] -->
Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the [[American Revolutionary War]], the First [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[George Washington]] signed on July 4, the [[Tariff of 1789]], which authorized the collection of [[duty (economics)|duties]] on [[imports]]. Four weeks later, on July 31, the fifth [[List of United States federal legislation, 1789–1901|act of Congress]] established the [[United States Customs Service]] and its [[ports of entry]].

For nearly 125 years, the U.S. Customs Service was the primary source of governmental funds, which paid for the nation's early growth and infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about/history|title=CBP Through the Years – U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=Cbp.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Purchases include the [[Louisiana]] and [[Oregon]] territories; [[Florida]], Alaska, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; funding the [[National Road]] and the [[Transcontinental Railroad]]; building many of the United States' [[lighthouse]]s; and the [[U.S. Military]] and [[U.S. Navy|Naval]] academies.

In March 2003, the Customs Service was renamed the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, and its structure split to form parts of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] as the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division. [[Uncle Louie|Louis Gregory]] was a founding member of the agency and the first to rise through every rank in uniform before retiring as Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/profiles-in-courage-the-truth-about-ice-cbp-hsi-and-their-important-roles-retired-director-louis-gregory/|url-status=live|title=Profiles in Courage|archivedate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

===U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:INS 1924.jpg|thumb|Immigration inspectors, c. 1924]] -->
Shortly after the [[American Civil War]], some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to rule in ''[[Chy Lung v. Freeman]]'' in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17109431320863199074&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr|title=Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 US 275 - Supreme Court 1876 - Google Scholar}}</ref>  The [[Immigration Act of 1891]] established an Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. This office was responsible for admitting, rejecting, and processing all immigrants seeking admission to the United States and for implementing national immigration policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/guides/usimmigration/26%20stat%201084.pdf|date=1891|title=Fifty First Congress|website=Library.uwb.edu|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> "Immigrant inspectors", as they were then called, were stationed at major U.S. [[port of entry|ports of entry]] collecting manifests of arriving passengers. A "head tax" of fifty cents was collected on each immigrant.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/our-history/agency-history/early-american-immigration-policies|title=Early American Immigration Policies|website=Uscis.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In the early 20th century [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s primary interest in immigration was protecting American workers and wages – the reason it had become a federal concern in the first place. This made immigration more a matter of commerce than revenue; hence, in 1903, Congress transferred the Bureau of Immigration to the newly created [[Department of Commerce and Labor]].<ref>''[http://www.cbp.gov/about/history/legacy/immigration-history U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service – Populating a Nation: A History of Immigration and Naturalization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220233531/http://www.cbp.gov/about/history/legacy/immigration-history |date=2014-12-20 }}'', cbp.gov, Retrieved December 20, 2014.</ref>

After [[World War I]], Congress attempted to stem the flow of immigrants, still mainly coming from Europe, by passing laws in [[Emergency Quota Act|1921]] and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]] limiting the number of newcomers by assigning a quota to each nationality based upon its representation in previous [[U.S. census]] figures. Each year, the [[U.S. State Department]] issued a limited number of [[visa (document)|visas]]; only those immigrants who had obtained them and could present valid visas were permitted entry.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] from the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 1940.

===Reorganization (2003 to present)===
[[Image:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers (CBPO)]]
CBP became an official agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] on March 1, 2003, combining employees from the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (specifically the Plant Protection Quarantine inspectors),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/safeguarding/downloads/implementation_reports/year3report.pdf|title=Safeguarding Implementation – Nearing the Finish|date=September 2003|work=[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> the [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (specifically, immigration inspectors and the [[United States Border Patrol]]), and the [[United States Customs Service]].  This transformation was led by former Commissioner [[Robert C. Bonner]].

[[W. Ralph Basham]] was nominated to the post of Commissioner by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 6, 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/wbasham-bio.html|title=W. Ralph Basham|website=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov}}</ref> Basham had 28 years of experience as a law enforcement manager, including serving as the head of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]. He had also served as the chief of staff for the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. It is the largest federal law enforcement agency and works closely with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).

In 2007, the [[U.S. Border Patrol]] joined two units, the [[Border Patrol Tactical Unit]] (BORTAC) and the [[Border Patrol, Search, Trauma and Rescue|Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit]] (BORSTAR), to form the U.S. Border Patrol's Special Operations Group (SOG),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Border%20Patrol%20Special%20Operations%20Group.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318214228/http://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Border%20Patrol%20Special%20Operations%20Group.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Special Operations Group PDF|archivedate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> headquartered in El Paso, Texas. BORTAC and BORSTAR direct their nationally dispersed assets from the SOG, providing the U.S. Border Patrol with immediate tactical and emergency response assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/operations/special-operations|title=Special Operations – U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=Cbp.gov|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

In March 2019, Director [[Uncle Louie|Louis Gregory]] retired. He was the first Officer to achieve every rank in uniform having risen from trainee to Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/profiles-in-courage-the-truth-about-ice-cbp-hsi-and-their-important-roles-retired-director-louis-gregory/|url-status=live|title=Profiles in Courage|archivedate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

CBP officers have full law enforcement powers on and off duty. CBP officers defend against terrorist intrusion by identifying high risk individuals who are attempting to enter into the United States; stop criminal activities – such as [[drug trafficking]], [[child pornography]] (including on computers, cell phones, and other electronic media), [[weapons trafficking]], and [[money laundering]] – by inspecting vehicles and trucks; and prevent the illegal entry of individuals, the smuggling of prohibited goods, and other customs and immigration violations. Officers are armed with [[Heckler & Koch P2000]] pistols chambered in [[.40 S&W]], expandable [[baton (law enforcement)|batons]], x26 [[Taser]]s and oleoresin capsicum [[pepper spray]]. In accordance with Public Law 110-161, CBP officers are covered under special law enforcement retirement, and all candidates must be referred for selection for this position before reaching their 40th birthday.

Officer candidates attend the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], in Glynco, Georgia for 17–19 weeks of paid training. Candidate training consists of basic law enforcement skills, including Anti-Terrorism; Detection of Contraband; Interviewing; Cross-cultural Communications; Firearms Handling and Qualification; Immigration and Naturalization Laws; U.S. Customs Export and Import laws, Defensive Tactics and Driving; Crime Investigation Site; Arrest Techniques; Baton Techniques; Examination of cargo, bags, and merchandise; [[border search exception]]; Entry and Control Procedures; Passenger Processing; and Officer Safety and Survival. Those candidates selected for duty locations requiring Spanish may receive an additional 6 weeks of Spanish Language training. After a few years of service, qualified Officers may serve on CBP's [[SWAT|Special Response Team]] after passing a pre-test and an additional five weeks of paid training at the U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit ([[BORTAC]]) in [[El Paso, Texas]].
[[Image:CBP checking authenticity of a travel document.jpg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. CBP [[Office of Field Operations]] agent checking the [[Authentication|authenticity]] of a [[travel document]] at an [[international airport]] using a [[stereo microscope]]]]
CBP Officers may begin their careers in any region for which they apply. The duty region is selected during the application phase. Proficiency in Spanish is a duty requirement only for those stationed along southern border regions, although it is not a requirement before being hired. CBP Officers stationed along southern border regions will undergo Spanish language training before coming on duty.
[[File:CBP International Travel Preclearance Operations in Canada (26003271678).jpg|thumb|US and Canadian custom agents]]
The CBP Officer position is categorized as a "critical-sensitive" position in law enforcement. For this reason, officer candidates must undergo a single scope background investigation (SSBI) before being appointed. In addition, officer candidates must undergo drug and medical examination, polygraph examination, two physical fitness tests, a video based test, and structured interview during the pre-appointment phase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp/which-cbp-career/cbp-officer|title=CBP Officer Requirement Tabs|publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

The U.S. Border Patrol Agent<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp/which-cbp-career/border-patrol-agent|title=CBP Careers - Border Patrol Agent|website=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> (as opposed to Officer) is a federal law enforcement agent actively patrolling a U.S. border to prevent persons from entering or leaving the United States without government permission. Agents detect and prevent the smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States, along with apprehending those people found to be in violation of immigration laws. Agents work to lower crime and improve the quality of life in border communities. In some areas, Agents are deputized or have peace-officer status and use it to enforce local and state/territory laws. More than 20,000 Border Patrol Agents safeguard nearly 6,000 miles of land border the United States shares with Canada and Mexico, and more than 2,000 miles of coastal waters.
[[File:CPB UAS Sample Surveillance Video 02282008 .theora.ogv|thumbnail|right|Border Surveillance video captured by a UAS (likely along the Mexican border).]]
One of the most important activities for a United States Border Patrol Agent is "line watch". This involves the detection, prevention and apprehension of [[terrorist]]s, illegal aliens and smugglers of both aliens and contraband at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor systems, aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks, marks and other physical evidence. Some of the major activities are farm and ranch check, traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.

All agents complete a 13-week paid "Basic Academy" training at the U.S. Border Patrol Academy in [[Artesia, New Mexico]].  Training includes such topics as immigration and nationality laws, physical training (PT), weapons and marksmanship. For those needing Spanish language instruction, an additional 8 weeks may be required beyond the 65 days of Basic Academy training.  Border Patrol Agents must be willing to work overtime and varying shifts under arduous conditions, and be proficient in the carry and use of firearms.  They may also be sent on temporary assignments on short notice, or on permanent reassignments to any duty location.  All new agents begin their careers along the Southwest border, where a working knowledge of Spanish is required.

AMO is the world's largest civilian aviation and maritime law enforcement organization. Its mission is to protect the American people and nation's critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of air and marine assets to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. Air and Marine Interdiction Agents are endowed with the authority to enforce Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) and Title 19 (Customs) of the United States Code in addition to the general law enforcement powers bestowed upon federal law enforcement agents.

This specialized law enforcement capability allows AMO to make significant contributions to the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to those of other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. AMO is uniquely positioned to provide direct air and maritime support to multiple agencies and to ensure the success of border protection and law enforcement operations between ports of entry, within the maritime domain and within the nation's interior. To accomplish its mission, AMO employs over 1,200 Federal Agents at 70 locations, operating more than 260 aircraft of 26 different types, and approximately 300 maritime vessels. It is one of the major operational components within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Office of Field Operations (OFO) and the United States Border Patrol (USBP).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/air-sea|title=CBP Air and Sea Security |website=Cbp.gov|date=July 1, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

===Employee morale===
[[Image:CBP Officers pay tribute 2007.jpg|thumb|A color guard composed of CBP officers and USBP agents at a Washington, D.C. ceremony in May, 2007.]]

In July 2006, the [[United States Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]] conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS (which includes CBP) was last or near to last in every category including

*36th on the job satisfaction index
*35th on the leadership and knowledge management index
*36th on the results-oriented performance culture index
*33rd on the talent management index

The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within DHS. Based on the survey, the primary concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, and the inability of leadership to generate high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization and complaints from the traveling public.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688|title=Homeland Security employees rank last in job satisfaction survey|work=ABC 7 Chicago|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316220717/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688|archive-date=16 March 2007|date=8 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136|title=DHS memo reveals agency personnel are treated like &quot;human capital&quot; - the narcosphere|publisher=NarcoSphere|date=January 31, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

In June 2007, CBP Commissioner W. Ralph Basham announced to employees that the agency would be conducting 125 different focus groups in 12 different cities around the country to better understand their concerns as expressed in the Human Capital Survey. The agency is also going to give employees who are not a part of that focus group process an intranet virtual focus group where they can express their views and their concerns. The commissioner stated: "We are looking at this very seriously. We want to hear from the employees, we want to hear from these focus groups, we want to drill down on this survey." In 2011, more than four years after this statement was made, these focus groups have never been reported to have been held, nor have any plans been reported for them to be held in the future.

A November 2007 [[Government Accountability Office]] report showed that low staffing, training, and overwork is a large problem within CBP, and an average of 71 officers leave the service every two weeks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/13/AR2007111302007.html|work=The Washington Post|title=One Tired, Under-Trained, Overworked Face at the Border|author=Barr, Stephen|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/department-homeland-security-annual-employee-survey|title=DHS Annual Employee Surveys|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

CBP continued carrying out their mission during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]]. As of June 17, 2020, 544 federal employees tested positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] and 5 have died as a result of the virus.<ref name="CBP-COVID-19">{{cite web |url=https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/coronavirus |title=CBP COVID-19 Updates and Announcements - U.S. Customs and Border Protection |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=June 17, 2020 |website=cbp.gov |publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection |access-date=June 17, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617115626/https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/coronavirus |archive-date=June 17, 2020 |quote=Overall, CBP has had 544 federal employees test positive for COVID-19.  5 have unfortunately died as a result of the virus.}}</ref>

===Polygraphing===
In 2011, the [[United States Congress]] mandated that applicants to CBP jobs undergo [[polygraph]] testing. The agency polygraphs about 10,000 applicants annually. From the start of the polygraphing until August 16, 2013, over 200 confessions of wrongdoing had been made. Many of the applicants confessed that they had close associations with drug traffickers or that they were directly involved in smuggling of drugs and illegal immigrants. The agency accused ten applicants of using countermeasures. As part of the "Operation Lie Busters", the name of the crackdown on polygraph countermeasures, all ten were not selected for employment.<ref name=TaylorWootsonPolyFeds>Taylor, Marisa and Cleve R.

===Weapons===
CBP Officers primary sidearm is the [[H&K P2000]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/hk-p-2000-40-defends-the-homeland/|title=HK P-2000 .40 Defends the Homeland|date=January 24, 2008|publisher=Tactical Life|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> double action LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) pistol in [[.40 S&W]] caliber. It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).  Like many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[Remington Model 870]] is the standard pump-action shotgun. The CBP issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to CBP specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical "ghost-ring" rear sight. CBP uses the [[5.56x45]] caliber Colt [[M4 Carbine|M4 Carbine (M4A1)]] as the standard long gun for CBP Officers assigned to its aviation and maritime interdiction units, the CBP Border Patrol, the CBP Special Response Teams.

In April 2019, CBP awarded [[Glock]] a contract to replace the P2000.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=CBP Awards Contract for Duty Handguns |url=https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-awards-contract-duty-handguns |location=Washington |publisher=U.S. Customs and Border Protection |date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> A special version of the Glock known as G47 was produced for CBP, along with Glock G19 compact and Glock G26 subcompacts modified to CBP specifications.

==Criticism==

[[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' reported that CBP radiation-detection equipment at ports is better at detecting kitty litter than dangerous weapons, and that U.S. borders are so porous that congressional investigators carrying simulated nuclear materials have walked across unchallenged.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17969438|author=Fessler, Pam|title=DHS Still Dogged by Questions over Effectiveness|department=Morning Edition|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=January 14, 2008|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

In an article entitled "''DHS Decision-Making: Competence or Character?''", James Giermanski states that the fundamental problem within CBP is that the agency has weak and sometimes flawed management. He says that DHS and CBP suffer from "seriously flawed decision-making", citing the "door only" policy, radio frequency identification technology, and lack of focus on exports which contain bombs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2122485/build-ci-sdlc/dhs-decision-making--competence-or-character-.html|title=Decision-Making: Competence or Character?|author=Gradijan, Dave|website=Csoonline.com|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

The agency's practice of performing internal document checks on buses and trains running entirely within U.S. territory has been called "coercive, unconstitutional, and tainted by [[racial profiling]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernstein, Nina|title=Border Sweeps in North Reach Miles Into U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/nyregion/30border.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Court of International Trade]] found that CBP improperly classified merchandise when it had untrained chemists testifying before the court. The court found that there were errors in the laboratory reports, that CBP destroyed the evidence, and the tests used by the chemist did not meet any [[Daubert standard]]s.<ref>[https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/SlipOpinions/Slip_op00/00-9.pdf ''THOM S. ZANI D/B/A WHOLESALE ART & FRAME LTD., Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES, defendant''.] Retrieved April 10, 2018.</ref>

During a federal court case for unlawful removal,{{specify|date=March 2016}} CBP and [[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys cited the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (04-473), which ruled that CBP employees do not have protection from retaliation by CBP managers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment of the Constitution]]. The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to [[Whistleblower protection in the United States|shield whistleblowers]] from retaliation. In response to the Supreme Court decision of ''Garcetti v. Ceballos'', the House of Representatives passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007, and the Senate passed its version of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] (S. 274), which has significant bipartisan support.

In 2005, a merger of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] and CBP was considered, following a review at the request Senator [[Susan Collins]] (R-ME) chairwoman of the [[Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee]], that found morale and operational issues with ICE and the overlapping responsibilities within the two agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2005/feb/16/20050216-123422-2436r/|title=Merger of ICE, CBP considered|accessdate=April 10, 2018|work=The Washington Times|date=February 16, 2005}}</ref>

A 2018 report by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and [[University of Chicago Law School]]'s International Human Rights Clinic alleged that there was pervasive physical, verbal, sexual and psychological abuse of immigrant minors by DHS and CBP officials over the period 2009–2014.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/23/613907893/aclu-report-detained-immigrant-children-subjected-to-widespread-abuse-by-officia|title=ACLU Report: Detained Immigrant Children Subjected To Widespread Abuse By Officials|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref> Customs and Border Protection denied the allegations.<ref name=":0" />

In July 2019, after a report by [[ProPublica]], the CBP initiated an investigation into "disturbing social media activity hosted on a private [[Facebook]] group that may include a number of CBP employees". ProPublica reported that the three-year existence of the Facebook group called "I'm 10-15" (the code used by the Border Patrol for "aliens in custody"). The Facebook group, meant for current and former Border Patrol officials, had around 9,500 members. ProPublica published screenshots and quotes of group members mocking migrant deaths, questioning if a photo of drowned migrants was "edited" by liberals, and posting sexist and racist jokes on Latino congressmen, including Representative [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]. She, in turn, described this as CBP's "violent culture". Border Patrol Chief [[Carla Provost]] said that the "posts are completely inappropriate" and vowed to hold the employees responsible accountable.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Silverstein |first1=Jason |title=Customs and Border Protection investigating secret Facebook page where agents allegedly mocked migrant deaths |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/customs-and-border-protection-investigating-secret-facebook-page-where-agents-allegedly-mock-migrant-deaths/ |website=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |date=July 1, 2019}}</ref> Provost herself was once a member of the group, having posted in it in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Devereaux |first1=Ryan |title=Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost was a member of secret Facebook group |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/07/12/border-patrol-chief-carla-provost-was-a-member-of-secret-facebook-group/ |accessdate=July 12, 2019 |date=July 12, 2019}}</ref>

In July 2020, the [[Trump administration]] dispatched federal officers to [[Portland, Oregon]] during riots in the city following the [[killing of George Floyd]]. Policing tactics such as the detainment of rioters in unmarked vans and the shooting of rioter Donavan La Bella in the head with an impact round were linked to a deployment that included CBP [[BORTAC]] agents sent to the city against the wishes of state and local government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/society/border-patrol-portland-arrest/|last1=Klippenstein |first1=Ken|author-link=Ken Klippenstein|title=The Border Patrol was Responsible for an Arrest in Portland|accessdate=July 20, 2020|work=The Nation|date=July 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html/|last1=Olmos|first1=Sergio|last2=Baker|first2=Mike|last3=Kanno-Youngs|first3=Zolan|title=Federal Officers Deployed in Portland Didn't Have Proper Training, D.H.S.
