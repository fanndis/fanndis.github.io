The '''Minister President of Lower Saxony'''<ref name="StateChancellery">http://www.state-chancellery.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=5691&_psmand=1003</ref> ({{lang-de|Ministerpräsident des Landes Niedersachsen}}), also referred to as '''Premier''' or '''Prime Minister''', is the [[head of government]] of the [[Germany|German]] [[states of Germany|state]] of [[Lower Saxony]]. The position was created in 1946, when the states of [[Free State of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Free State of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], [[Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe|Schaumburg-Lippe]] and the [[State of Hanover]] were merged to form the state of Lower Saxony. The current Minister President is [[Stephan Weil]], heading [[Cabinet Weil|a coalition government]] between the [[Social Democratic Party (Germany)|Social Democrats]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party|CDU]]. Weil succeeded [[David McAllister]] following the [[2013 Lower Saxony state election|2013 state election]].

The office of the Minister President is known as the State Chancellery ({{lang-de|Staatskanzlei}}), and is located in the capital of [[Hanover]], along with the rest of the cabinet departments.

The state of Lower Saxony sees itself in the tradition notably of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], having adopted many of its symbols. For the predecessor office in the Kingdom of Hanover, see [[Privy Council of Hanover]]. The head of the Privy Council held the title Minister President.

== Origin of the Office ==

After the Second World War, the states of [[Free State of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Free State of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] and the [[State of Hanover]] were administered as part of the zone allocated to the [[British-occupied Germany|British military administration]]. With the passage of time, the British government began to back the advocates of a merger of the states. [[Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf]], who went on to become Lower Saxony's first Minister President, was a fervent advocate of the merger towards the British military authorities. On 23 October 1946, the British administration announced that they would support a [[Merger (politics)|merger]] of the states, as proposed by Kopf.<ref>{{cite book|last=Borchers|first=Jürgen|title=Gründung des Landes Niedersachsen - Darstellung und Quellen|publisher=Niedersächsische Landeszentrale für Politische Bildung|pages=24–25|url=http://www.politische-bildung.de/niedersachsen/gruendung_niedersachsen.pdf}}</ref>

Consequently, the four states were merged to form the state of Lower Saxony via Ordinance No. 55 of 1 November 1946. Article 3 of the Ordinance created the position of Minister President:

:''"Subject to the provisions of any legislation which may be enacted pursuant to this Ordinance, the executive authority of Lower Saxony shall be exercised by a Cabinet, the Head of which shall be known as 'Ministerpräsident'"''

Article 4 of Ordinance No. 55 stipulated the appointment of the Minister President by the military government, until the holding of free Legislative Assembly elections in 1947. The British military administration then appointed Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf, the erstwhile Minister President of the former State of Hanover, to serve as the first Minister President of Lower Saxony.

== Constitutional Practice ==

=== Election and Removal ===
[[File:Schröder and Bush.jpg|thumb|[[Gerhard Schröder]] (here with US President [[George W. Bush]]) was Minister President of Lower Saxony (1990-1998) before becoming [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]]]
The Minister President is elected by the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|Legislative Assembly]], by a majority of its members in a [[secret ballot]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Article 29.1 of the Lower Saxony Constitution|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/download/21561/nds_verfassung_englisch.pdf|work=The Constitution of the State of Lower Saxony|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Lower Saxony|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>   However, he does not have to be a Member of the Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Busse|first=Christian|title=Regierungsbildung und Regierungswechsel nach niedersächsischem Verfassungsrecht: Eine Untersuchung zum parlamentarischen Regierungssystem in Niedersachsen|year=1992|publisher=Duncker & Humblot|isbn=3-428-07326-6|pages=35–36}}</ref>  The only restriction is that the Minister President may not be a Member of the [[Bundestag]]. Before assuming his duties, the Minister President-elect takes the following oath before the Members of the Legislative Assembly:

:"''I swear that I will devote my strength to the people and the state, preserve and defend the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and the constitution of Lower Saxony as well as the laws, perform my duties conscientiously and exercise justice towards all people''." (The oath may be taken with or without the affirmation "[[So help me God]]")

Upon election, the Minister President then appoints his Cabinet which requires subsequent confirmation by the Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles 29.2 and 29.3 of the Lower Saxony Constitution|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/download/21561/nds_verfassung_englisch.pdf|work=The Constitution of the State of Lower Saxony|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Lower Saxony|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> In practical terms, the confirmation of the cabinet is an essential requirement for the Minister President to govern, as until then the cabinet departments would be run by the (possibly defeated) predecessors.<ref>{{cite book|last= Busse|first=Christian|title=Regierungsbildung und Regierungswechsel nach niedersächsischem Verfassungsrecht : eine Untersuchung zum parlamentarischen Regierungssystem in Niedersachsen|year=1992|publisher=Duncker und Humblot|location=Berlin|isbn=3-428-07326-6|pages=37}}</ref>  The Minister President can be removed by the Legislative Assembly, through a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] – namely the election of a successor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles 32.1 and 32.3 of the Lower Saxony Constitution|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/download/21561/nds_verfassung_englisch.pdf|work=The Constitution of the State of Lower Saxony|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Lower Saxony|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  To this day, no vote of no-confidence has succeeded in the Lower Saxony Legislative Assembly, with the last attempt being made in November 1988.<ref>{{cite book|last=Busse|first=Christian|title=Regierungsbildung und Regierungswechsel nach niedersächsischem Verfassungsrecht: Eine Untersuchung zum parlamentarischen Regierungssystem in Niedersachsen|year=1992|publisher=Duncker & Humblot|isbn=3-428-07326-6|pages=135}}</ref>

[[File:Staatskanzlei Hannover.JPG|thumb|left|The State Chancellery in [[Hanover]] is the official residence of the Minister President of Lower Saxony]]

=== Powers and Status ===
According to the Lower Saxony Constitution, the Minister President is the effective leader of the State Government, being responsible for the determination and formulation of policy guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Article 37 of the Lower Saxony Constitution|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/download/21561/nds_verfassung_englisch.pdf|work=The Constitution of the State of Lower Saxony|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Lower Saxony|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  In this context, he chairs the cabinet meetings and may cast a tie-breaking vote in case of a stalemate between the ministers. Additionally, the Minister President also represents the State of Lower Saxony externally and exercises the right of clemency in individual criminal cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles 35 and 36 of the Lower Saxony Constitution|url=http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/download/21561/nds_verfassung_englisch.pdf|work=The Constitution of the State of Lower Saxony|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Lower Saxony|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>  In titular terms, the Minister President is also regarded as head of the state of Lower Saxony, thereby taking precedence over officials like the Speaker of the Lower Saxony Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Starck|first=Christian|title=Verfassungen: Entstehung, Auslegung, Wirkungen und Sicherung|year=2009|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-149916-6|pages=267}}</ref>

The Minister President, like the other members of the State Government, is not a civil servant—his salary is regulated by law. Like his ministers, the Minister President is subject to the Lower Saxony Ministers Act, which regulates matters of salary, confidentiality and ethics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gesetz über die Rechtsverhältnisse der Mitglieder der Landesregierung (Ministergesetz)|url=http://www.nds-voris.de/jportal/portal/t/106x/page/bsvorisprod.psml;jsessionid=7236C1E87B279CD4D55EE9E527DD275A.jp95?pid=Dokumentanzeige&showdoccase=1&js_peid=Trefferliste&documentnumber=1&numberofresults=23&fromdoctodoc=yes&doc.id=jlr-MinGNDrahmen%3Ajuris-lr00&doc.part=X&doc.price=0.0&doc.hl=1#jlr-MinGNDpP1|publisher=Lower Saxony State Government|accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, the Minister President signs treaties made by the State of Lower Saxony and has to be consulted by other cabinet members prior to the start of any negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standing Orders of the State Government and the Ministries of the State of Lower Saxony|url=http://www.recht-niedersachsen.de/11120/ggo.htm|work=Gemeinsame Geschäftsordnung der Landesregierung und der Ministerien in Niedersachsen (GGO) vom 30.3.2004 (Nds.GVBl.

Nr.40/2004 S.584)|publisher=State Government of Lower Saxony|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref> The Minister President is also authorized to appoint one of his cabinet members as his deputy in case of absence or illness. The only currently known instance of a Deputy Minister President taking over the duties of Minister President was in July 2010, when [[Jörg Bode (politician)|Jörg Bode]] ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]) served as Acting Minister President in the interval between Christian Wulff's election as President of Germany and David McAllister's confirmation as Minister President on 1 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministerpräsident für einen Tag|url=http://www.ndr.de/regional/niedersachsen/bode126.html|publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref> Meetings of the Cabinet traditionally take place in the guesthouse of the Lower Saxony Government, located close to the Hanover Zoological Gardens.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Guesthouse of the Lower Saxony Land Government|url=http://www.state-chancellery.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=5804&article_id=16147&_psmand=1003|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910200516/http://www.state-chancellery.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=5804&article_id=16147&_psmand=1003|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 September 2012|publisher=State Chancellery of Lower Saxony|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>

=== The Role of the State Chancellery ===
The Minister President of Lower Saxony, like his fellow Minister President in their respective states, has the staff of the State Chancellery at his disposal. The State Chancellery assists the Minister President in the preparation of draft legislation, the management of day-to-day government business and the coordination of media policy for the entire state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the homepage of the Lower Saxony State Chancellery|url=http://www.state-chancellery.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=5691&_psmand=1003|work=State Chancellery of Lower Saxony|publisher=Lower Saxony State Government|accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref>  Additionally, it is responsible for relations to the other states in Germany and the European Union.

The State Chancellery, by convention, is headed by a [[Secretary of State#Germany|state secretary]] appointed by the Minister President. The current incumbent is [[Jörg Mielke]]. Under the [[David McAllister (politician)|McAllister]] administration, the State Chancellery was divided into four overall departments (Department 1: ''Policy Guidelines'', Department 2: ''Legal/Administration/Media'', Department 3: ''Europe/International Cooperation'', Department 4: ''Lower Saxony Representation to the Federal Government''). While each of these departments is headed by a separate section head, the Press and Information Office is under the direct purview of the Minister President.<ref>{{citation|title=Organization Chart of the State Chancellery|publisher=Lower Saxony State Chancellery}}</ref>

[[File:Christian-Wulff-2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christian Wulff]] was Minister President of Lower Saxony (2003-2010) before being elected [[President of Germany]]]]

== Role in German Politics ==
As the leader of one of Germany's territorially largest and most populous states, the Minister President of Lower Saxony has traditionally been a major player in federal politics: The state's first Minister President, [[Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf]] often used the ''Bundesrat'' as a forum to oppose the policies of the [[Adenauer]] government. Alfred Kubel, one of Kopf's successors, played a major role in negotiating a compromise between all German states on the creation of a national fiscal transfer mechanism (''[[Equalization payments|Länderfinanzausgleich]]''). Minister President [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]], contrary to prevailing majority opinion in his own party, advocated and voted for the ratification of the treaties around which [[Willy Brandt|Willy Brandt's]] ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' was centred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Niedermayer|first=Oskar|title=Parteien und Parteiensysteme in den deutschen Ländern|year=2007|publisher=Vs Verlag|isbn=978-3-531-15439-8|pages=311}}</ref>

[[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]] was a candidate for the CDU nomination for President in 1979 and Chancellor in 1980, [[Gerhard Schröder]] became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1998, his successor [[Sigmar Gabriel]] served as the [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] between 2013 and 2018 and [[Christian Wulff]] was elected [[President of Germany]] in 2010. Examples of Lower Saxony's influence on policy debates in federal politics include Ernst Albrecht's advocacy of financial transfers from other states and Gerhard Schröder's usage of Lower Saxony's ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' votes in matters of fiscal and tax policy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Naßmacher|first=Hiltrud|title=Handwörterbuch des politischen Systems der Bundesrepublik|year=2003|publisher=Leske+Budrich|isbn=3-8100-3865-2|url=http://www.bpb.de/wissen/00073582881299377728262554965500,2,0,Land_Niedersachsen.html#art2}}</ref>
