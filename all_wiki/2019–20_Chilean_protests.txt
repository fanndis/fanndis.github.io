[[File:Tarifas reales de transantiago desde 2012.png|thumb|left|Fee, adjusted by inflation, of public transportation in Santiago, between 31 January 2012 and 6 October 2019, before the last increase was revoked]]

The price of public transport in Greater Santiago is determined by the Panel of Public Transport Experts ({{lang-es|Panel de Expertos del Transporte Público}}), which uses an automatic calculation formula to adjust fares on a monthly basis. The Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications is advised by the panel and must be notified of any price changes.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=19 October 2019|title=Panel Expertos - Preguntas Frecuentes|url=http://www.paneldeexpertostarifas.cl/faq.php |website=paneldeexpertostarifas.cl |language=es|trans-title=Panel of Experts - Freqeunt Questions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014164338/http://www.paneldeexpertostarifas.cl/faq.php|archive-date=14 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 1 October 2019, the Panel determined the quarterly adjustment of fares for the public transport system of the [[Province of Santiago, Chile|Province of Santiago]] and the communes of [[San Bernardo, Chile|San Bernardo]] and [[Puente Alto]]. They decided that a fare hike of 10 [[Chilean peso]]s for buses and 30 pesos for the [[Santiago Metro]] and [[Metrotrén]] at peak hours (a rise of about 4%), as well as a fare decrease of 30 pesos at off-peak hours, was necessary.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.paneldeexpertostarifas.cl/documentos/ResN22019.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019024251/http://www.paneldeexpertostarifas.cl/documentos/ResN22019.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The increase was justified by the panel due to increase of the rate index, which is subject to variations in the value of fuel, the value of the [[US dollar]], the value of the [[euro]], the cost of labor, and the [[consumer price index]] among other variables, such that the costs to the subway have risen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooperativa.cl|access-date=19 October 2019|title=Así opera el panel de expertos que sube las tarifas del transporte público|url=https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/metro/asi-opera-el-panel-de-expertos-que-sube-las-tarifas-del-transporte/2019-10-16/175053.html|website=Cooperativa.cl|language=es|trans-title=This is how the panel of experts that increases public transport rates operates|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019032538/https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/metro/asi-opera-el-panel-de-expertos-que-sube-las-tarifas-del-transporte/2019-10-16/175053.html|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The fare change was scheduled to take effect from 6 October.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooperativa.cl|access-date=19 October 2019|title=Subir al Metro en horario punta costará ahora 830 pesos|url=https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/metro/subir-al-metro-en-horario-punta-costara-ahora-830-pesos/2019-10-04/183903.html|website=Cooperativa.cl|language=es|trans-title=Metro rides at peak hours will now cost 830 pesos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020140836/https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/metro/subir-al-metro-en-horario-punta-costara-ahora-830-pesos/2019-10-04/183903.html|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some specialists, such as former Minister [[Paola Tapia]], have indicated that there are other factors that explain the rise. Among these factors would be the purchase without tender of a new fleet of electric buses for the Metropolitan Mobility Network and the suspension of the new tender for bus services, both decisions made by the administration of Minister [[Gloria Hutt]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooperativa.cl|access-date=20 October 2019|title=Ex ministra de Transportes: Alza de pasajes es consecuencia directa de las decisiones del Gobierno|url=https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/transantiago/ex-ministra-de-transportes-alza-de-pasajes-es-consecuencia-directa-de/2019-10-16/175705.html|website=Cooperativa.cl|language=es|trans-title=Former Minister of Transportation: Fare increase is a direct consequence of the Government's decisions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020015620/https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/transportes/transantiago/ex-ministra-de-transportes-alza-de-pasajes-es-consecuencia-directa-de/2019-10-16/175705.html|archive-date=20 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Inequality and cost of living ===
According to Jose Miguel Ahumada, a political economist and associate professor at the [[University of Chile]], the country is "one of the most unequal countries in Latin America".<ref name="aljazeera" /> As described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', while the last three decades of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies made Chile "one of South America’s wealthiest countries, with inflation under control and easy access to credit", they also "created stark economic disparities and strapped many Chileans into debt".<ref name="WAPO102019">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/21/chile-protests-santiago-dead-state-emergency/|title='We are at war': 8 dead in Chile's violent protests over social inequality|date=21 October 2019|website=Washington Post|access-date=24 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024130721/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/21/chile-protests-santiago-dead-state-emergency/|archive-date=24 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC) states, that 1% of the population in Chile controls 26.5% of the country's wealth, while 50% of low-income households access 2.1%.

The protests began on Monday, 7 October, as secondary-school students began an orchestrated campaign of fare dodging on the Santiago Metro. In response, the Metro authority began controlling access to several stations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/evasion-masiva-alumnos-del-instituto-nacional-metro-termina-denuncia-fiscalia-medidas-contencion/857409/|title=Evasión masiva de alumnos del Instituto Nacional en el Metro termina con denuncia en Fiscalía y medidas de contención|date=11 October 2019|website=La Tercera|access-date=21 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019235325/https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/evasion-masiva-alumnos-del-instituto-nacional-metro-termina-denuncia-fiscalia-medidas-contencion/857409/|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the end of January 2020, the social unrest (which had reduced somewhat during the Chilean summer holidays) resumed again with large demonstrations.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
The protests had to come to a halt due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Chile|COVID-19 pandemic]] and the establishment of several partial lockdowns in Santiago and other cities. Taking advantage of the situation, government agencies erased most of the graffiti and street art in downtown Santiago that was drawn during the protests. On 3 April, President Sebastián Piñera visited an empty [[Plaza Baquedano|Plaza Italia]] and took some pictures in it, which was considered by many as a way of taunting the protesters under quarantine. Piñera later regretted the situation and mentioned that he was "misinterpreted".<ref>{{cite news |title=Piñera se bajó de su auto en Plaza Italia y fue fotografiado a los pies del monumento a Baquedano |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/03/world/americas/03reuters-chile-protests-president.html |date=3 April 2020|access-date=19 May 2020 |work=CNN Chile}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chiles-president-sparks-outrage-with-visit-to-quarantined-protest-2/|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Laing|first=Aislinn|agency=Reuters|date=3 April 2020|access-date=19 May 2020 |title=Chile's president sparks outrage with visit to quarantined protest square}}</ref> Despite the lockdown, some protests appeared during [[International Workers' Day]] in Santiago that resulted in the arrest of 57 people by Carabineros.
