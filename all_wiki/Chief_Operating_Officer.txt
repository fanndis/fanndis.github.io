{{short description|Executive position}}
{{Original research|date=May 2018}}
A '''chief operating officer''' ('''COO'''), also called a '''chief operations officer''', is one of the highest-ranking executive positions in an organization, comprising part of the "[[C-suite]]". The COO is usually the [[second-in-command]] at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the [[chairperson]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]]. The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the [[company]] and its [[office]] building<ref name=investopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp|title=Chief Operating Officer – COO|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=Investopedia}}</ref> and routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive—usually the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).<ref name=Levinson1993>{{Citation|title=Between CEO and COO|jstor=4165123|year=1993|author=Levinson, Harry|journal=Academy of Management Executive|pages=71–83|volume=7|issue=2}}</ref>

==Responsibilities and similar titles==
Unlike other [[C-suite]] positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, a COO's job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.<ref name=hbr2006>{{Citation|title=Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating Officer|url=http://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer/ar/1|year=2006|journal=Harvard Business Review|pages=70–79|volume=84|issue=5|last1=Miles|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Bennett|first2=Nathan|pmid=16649699|accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref> 

The selection of a COO is similar in many ways to the selection of a [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or [[White House Chief of Staff|chief of staff]] of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the president or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.<ref name="hbr2006" />

The COO position is common in firms that are operationally intensive, such as airline and automotive industries.<ref>[https://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer]</ref>

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate president as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "C-suite" designation, such as "president and CEO" or "president and COO") is also loosely defined. The president is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various vice presidents (including senior vice president and executive vice president), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO.

In 2007, the investment banking firms of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when [[James Cayne]] was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

[[Tom Anselmi]] of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]] was chief operating officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of [[Richard Peddie]] and the hiring of [[Tim Leiweke]] for the posts of president and CEO, Anselmi added the title of president from September 4, 2012, to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Damien|title=Maple Leafs: New era of MLSE intrigue unfolding: Cox|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/article/1252698--a-new-era-of-mlse-intrigue-unfolding|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>

[[Richard Fuld]], the chairman and CEO of [[Lehman Brothers]], had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as president and chief operating officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as president and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the office of the chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/|title=Print Page|website=nymag.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008, and replaced as president and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.<ref name=Ward2010/><ref name="truell">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html?pagewanted=print| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| first=Peter| last=Truell| title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm| date=November 27, 1996}}</ref>

[[Thomas W. LaSorda]] served as president and CEO of [[Chrysler]] from January 1, 2006, to August 5, 2007, while Chrysler was owned by [[Daimler-Benz]]. When [[Cerberus Capital]] bought majority control of Chrysler, [[Bob Nardelli]] was appointed chairman and CEO of Chrysler, while LaSorda became vice chairman and president.

[[Michael Ovitz]] was president from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. [[Bob Iger]] was president and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. [[Thomas O. Staggs]] was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

[[Manulife]] has used the president and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco "Roy" Gori served as president where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the chief investment officer. Gori reported to chief executive officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017, upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the chief operating officer, reported to the president on corporate strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including corporate development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, human resources, regulatory and public affairs, global resourcing and procurement, and the global program office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/manulife-appoints-roy-gori-as-president-617424583.html|title=Manulife appoints Roy Gori as President|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref>

===Current situation===

Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.<ref name=hbr2006 />

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs.<ref name=Ward2010>{{Citation

In the [[manufacturing sector]], the primary role of the COO is routinely one of [[operations management]], meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's [[product (business)|products]]. The COO is responsible for ensuring that [[business operations]] are efficient and effective and that the proper [[Resource management|management of resources]], [[supply chain management|distribution of goods and services to customers]] and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and board of directors, marshalling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching or corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, knowledge-skills-attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the [[heir apparent]] to the CEO.<ref name=Galbraith2009>{{Citation

* ''Not being automatically granted the luxury of a diagnostic period''. Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* ''Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board''. Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the board of directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* ''Being in the spotlight''. COOs are used to having the luxury of working "behind the scenes." As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a "public" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* ''Recalibrating their image''. Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an "execution" executive versus a "strategy" executive.<ref name=Miles2010 />

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO "heir" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.<ref name=Miles2010 />

The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened.

* Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
* Clear decision rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
* Lock on the backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
* Sharing the spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much "credit" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the board of directors, and from each other.
* Fit between CEO and COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
* Fit Between the COO and the position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
* Transparency of succession expectations and timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board.<ref name=Miles2007>{{Citation

}}</ref> A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director.<ref name=Miles2007 />  Researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO.  For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEO's, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an "operations" person or a "number two" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the board of directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position.<ref name=hbr2006 /> Harry Levinson effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: "The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power."<ref name=Levinson1993 />.
