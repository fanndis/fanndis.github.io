'''Glasgow Govan''' was a [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituency]] in the [[Govan]] district of [[Glasgow]]. It was represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for 120 years; from 1885 until 2005, returning one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) elected by the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system.

It was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] marginal seat for the first three decades of its existence, before breaking this trend when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the seat in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]. It remained a Labour-controlled seat for the next fifty-five years, except for a five-year Conservative interlude between 1950–55, until being seized by the [[Scottish National Party]] at a by-election in 1973, only to be regained by Labour the following year. The SNP regained the seat at a 1988 by-election, only to lose it again to Labour in 1992. It remained under Labour control until its abolition thirteen years later.

The area which the constituency represented is now covered by [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]], [[Glasgow South (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South]] and [[Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South West]].
