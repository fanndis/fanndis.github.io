Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original [[Polynesia]]n migrants to the [[archipelago]] comes from oral histories and artifacts.

His court relocated in 1809 to what is now [[downtown Honolulu]].  The capital was moved back to [[Kailua-Kona]] in 1812.

In 1794, Captain [[Butterworth Squadron|William Brown]] of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now [[Honolulu Harbor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/United-States/Hawaii-Honolulu-History-c2089416.html |title=Honolulu History, Hawaii |publisher=Travelgrove.com |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.

The annual average rainfall is {{convert|17.10|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}},<ref name = NOAA/> which mainly occurs during the winter months of October through early April, with very little rainfall during the summer. However, both seasons experience a similar number of rainy days. Light showers occur in summer, while heavier rain falls during winter. Honolulu has an average of 278 sunny days and 89.4 rainy days per year.

===Highways===
Honolulu has been ranked as having the nation's worst traffic congestion, beating former record holder [[Los Angeles]]. Drivers waste on average over 58 hours per year on congested roadways.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Worst Traffic in America? It's not Los Angeles |publisher= Yahoo! Autos |url= http://autos.yahoo.com/news/the-worst-traffic-in-america--it-s-not-los-angeles.html |accessdate=August 8, 2012 }}</ref> The following [[freeway]]s, part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] serve Honolulu:

* [[File:I-H1.svg|30px]] [[Interstate H-1]], which, coming into the city from the west, passes [[Hickam Air Force Base]] and Honolulu International Airport, runs just north of Downtown and continues eastward through Makiki and Kaimuki, ending at Waialae/Kahala. H-1 connects to [[Interstate H-2]] from [[Wahiawa]] and [[Interstate H-3]] from [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]], west of the CDP.
* [[File:I-H201.svg|30px]] [[Interstate H-201]]—also known as the Moanalua Freeway and sometimes numbered as its former number, Hawai{{okina}}i State Rte. 78—connects two points along H-1: at [[Aloha Stadium]] and [[Fort Shafter]]. Close to H-1 and Aloha Stadium, H-201 has an exchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate H-3]] to the windward side of Oahu ([[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]]). This complex of connecting ramps, some directly between H-1 and H-3, is in [[Halawa, Hawaii|Halawa]].

Other major highways that link Honolulu CCD with other parts of the Island of Oahu are:
* [[Pali Highway]], State Rte. 61, crosses north over the Koolau range via the Pali Tunnels to connect to [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]] and [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]] on the windward side of the Island.
* [[Likelike Highway]], State Rte. 63, also crosses the Koolau to Kaneohe via the Wilson Tunnels.
* Kalanianaole Highway, State Rte. 72, runs eastward from Waialae/Kahala to [[Hawaii Kai, Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i Kai]] and around the east end of the island to [[Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii|Waimanalo Beach]].
* [[Kamehameha Highway]], State Rts. 80, 83, 99 and 830, runs westward from near [[Hickam Air Force Base]] to [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]] and beyond, eventually running through the center of the island and ending in [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]].

Like most major American cities, the Honolulu metropolitan area experiences heavy traffic congestion during rush hours, especially to and from the western suburbs of [[Kapolei]], [[ʻEwa Beach, Hawaii|{{okina}}Ewa Beach]], [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]], [[Pearl City]], [[Waipahu]], and [[Mililani]].

====Rail====
{{Main|Honolulu Rail Transit}}

Currently, there is no [[urban rail transit]] system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company prior to World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&year=1888 |title=Hawaii's History in 1888 – Hawaii History – 1888 |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date= |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

The City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near [[Pearl Harbor]] and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating [[traffic congestion]] for West O{{okina}}ahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.

====Bicycle sharing====
Since June 28, 2017, [[Bikeshare Hawaii]] administers the bicycle sharing program in O'ahu while Secure Bike Share operates the ''[http://gobiki.org Biki]'' system. Most ''Biki'' stations are located between Chinatown/Downtown and Diamond Head, however an expansion in late 2018 added more stations towards the University of Hawai'i Manoa Campus, Kapi'olani Community College, Makiki, and Kalihi area.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bikeshare Hawai'i | url = http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | accessdate = August 14, 2017 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170815061101/http://www.bikesharehawaii.org/ | archivedate = August 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = 10 new Biki stops to be installed from Downtown to Waikiki | url = http://www.kitv.com/story/36133094/10-new-biki-stops-to-be-installed-from-downtown-to-waikiki | work = [[KITV]] | date = August 14, 2017 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Zielke | first = Aydee | title = Honolulu's bike share program ready to roll in summer 2015! | url = http://www.hhf.com/2014/04/02/honolulus-bikeshare-program-ready-to-roll-in-summer-2015/ | work = HHF Planners | date = April 2, 2014 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Bikeshare Hawaii selects PBSC Urban Solutions as partner to supply bikes for Honolulu | url = https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/12/08/bikeshare-hawaii-selects-pbsc-urban-solutions-as.html | work = [[American City Business Journals|Pacific Business News]] | location = Honolulu | date = December 8, 2015 | accessdate = August 14, 2017}}</ref> The GoBiki.org website has a [https://gobiki.org/map-of-biki-stops/ ''Biki'' stations map].
