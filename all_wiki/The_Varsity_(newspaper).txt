'''''The Varsity''''' is the official [[student newspaper]] of the [[University of Toronto]], in publication since 1880.

The paper publishes weekly on all campuses during the fall and winter semesters and online throughout the year, along with two seasonal magazines.

Originally a broadsheet daily, it now issues in [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] form.  The paper's primary focus is on campus affairs and local news.

''The Varsity'' usually assumes a centre-left stance on political affairs. The paper is published by Varsity Publications, a not-for-profit corporation, and is primarily financed by advertisement revenues with subsidies from a student [[Tax|levy]].

==History==
At the height of debate on coeducation in 1880, ''The Varsity'' published an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women.<ref name="historyQA_women">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history36.htm|title=What was front page news in the inaugural issue of the student paper The Varsity in 1880? |work=History Q & A |publisher=University of Toronto Department of Public Affairs|accessdate=2007-07-19 |year=2002}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1895, the suspension of ''The Varsity'''s editor, James Tucker, led Latin Professor Dale to publicly attack the administration in ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'', which in turn led to his own dismissal.<ref>[http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history17.htm Q&A: What made the "blood fairly boil" in U of T student and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1895?<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820132516/http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history17.htm |date=2007-08-20 }}</ref> University College students then approved a motion by ''Varsity'' staff member [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and boycotted lectures for a week. This is significant for [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s involvement as a member of the Varsity editorial staff and student leader. He would later become Canada's longest serving Prime Minister.<ref name="historyQA_king">{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history17.htm |title=What made the "blood fairly boil" in U of T student and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1895? |accessdate=2007-09-24 |work=History Q & A |publisher=University of Toronto Department of Public Affairs |year=2002}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7908&&PHPSESSID=uhlbmjtm0fc5n5ibvqbk5ipp75 |title=Dale, William |accessdate=2009-02-28 |last=Marshall |first=David B. |work=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] |year=2000}}</ref>

After [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] decriminalized homosexuality in 1969, a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in ''The Varsity'' seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rbebout.com/oldbeep/concep.htm |title=Conception & birth |accessdate=2009-02-28 |work=On the Origins of the Body Politic |last=BÃ©bout |first=Rick |date=January 2000}}</ref>

In 2017, ''The Varsity'' began publishing a Chinese-language edition of the newspaper on their website.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://j-source.ca/article/varsity-launches-chinese-language-edition/ | title = The Varsity Launches Chinese-language Edition | date = 12 October 2017 | accessdate = 18 October 2017 | publisher = The Canadian Journalism Project | author = Shrinkhala Dawadi }}</ref>
