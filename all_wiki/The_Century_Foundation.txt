== History ==
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Edward Filene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward A. Filene]], founder of The Century Foundation. Filene served as president and trustee from 1919 until his death in 1937.]] -->
The Century Foundation was founded in 1919 by [[Edward A. Filene]], an American businessman, social entrepreneur, and philanthropist, under the name of The Cooperative League.<ref name="The">{{cite web |url=https://capitalresearch.org/article/the-century-foundation-the-little-known-liberal-stalwart/ |title=The Century Foundation: The Little-Known Liberal Stalwart |last=Morse Wooster |first=Martin |date=2006-02-01 |publisher=capitalresearch.org |access-date=2018-10-15 }}</ref> The organization's mission was to act as an advisory committee for Filene in disbursing his funds in a way that could best benefit the world.

Renamed the Twentieth Century Fund in 1922, and then The Century Foundation in 1999, the Foundation has sought liberal, progressive solutions to the nation's problems.<ref name="The" />  The Fund's first executive director was [[Evans Clark]] (1928–1953), who remained on the board of trustees until his death in 1970.

During the twentieth century, the Foundation published many reports that informed public policy, including "Stock Market Control", a 1934 report that provided ideas for legislation enacted after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash of the stock market]]; America's Needs and Resources, a 1947 report that set forth a forecast of the nation's needs, industrial production, and income over the following two decades; [[Jean Gottmann]]’s ''Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States''; the New Federalist Papers by [[Nelson W. Polsby]], [[Alan Brinkley]], and [[Kathleen Sullivan]]; and [[Gunnar Myrdal]]’s ''Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations''.

The Foundation has provided information and analysis concerning Social Security since its earliest days. At the time of the inception of the Social Security program in the mid-1930s, the organization set up a “Committee on Old-Age Security” to look at the provisions of the [[Townsend Plan]], a movement in this country to provide some pension protection for the elderly in the aftermath of the [[Great Depression]]. The Committee determined that the Townsend plan was unworkable, but its members continued to examine the issue of the elderly poor, and in 1937, More Security for Old Age, a report and program for action was published, providing an analysis of the newly created Social Security program. Through the ensuing years, the organization has returned to the issue frequently. More recently, beginning in the 1990s, the organization has supported numerous studies and reports, including Ensuring the Essentials by former Social Security Administrator Robert Ball (2000); Social Security Reform: Beyond the Basics, edited by [[Richard Leone]] and Greg Anrig, Jr. (1999); and Countdown to Reform: The Great Social Security Debate by [[Henry J. Aaron]], and Robert D. Reischauer (2001).

In the wake of the 2000 election, The Century Foundation and the [[University of Virginia]]’s Miller Center for Public Affairs organized The National Commission on Federal Election Reform, which was co-chaired by former presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Gerald Ford]], and was composed of distinguished public leaders from across the political spectrum. The commission’s charge was to quickly evaluate an enormous body of research on election reform, review policy proposals, and offer a bipartisan analysis to the Congress, the administration, and the American people. It released its final report, To Assure Pride and Confidence in the Electoral Process, to Congress and the White House on July 31, 2001.<ref>Ford, Carter to Lead Panel to Study Election Reform https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-01-30-electionreform.htm</ref> In 2002, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed by the Congress and signed into law by President Bush.<ref>Congressional Record of Action http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HR03295:@@@R</ref>

The Century Foundation also has supported two task forces that examined homeland security issues after the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. The first, chaired by [[Richard A. Clarke]], produced a report, "Defeating the Jihadists: A Blueprint for Action", in 2005. The report assessed the nation's successes and failures on homeland security and, building on the recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]], offered a detailed action plan for neutralizing the international movement at the core of worldwide terrorism.<ref>Disconnected by Matthew Yglesias http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9214</ref> The second task force, co-chaired by Richard Clarke and Randy Beers, produced the report "The Forgotten Homeland" in 2006, in which leading homeland security experts analyze the nation's most significant vulnerabilities and propose strategies to reduce them.<ref>Domestic Security is Forgotten, Bipartisan Task Force Reports http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/terror/20060702-9999-1n2security.html</ref>  In 2003, The Century Foundation published "The War on Our Freedoms: Civil Liberties in an Age of Terrorism", which included essays by scholars and journalists that pointed out what is wrong with the current rush to limit civil liberties in the name of national security.

== Mission ==

The Century Foundation describes its mission as explaining and analyzing public issues in plain language, providing facts and opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of different policy strategies, and developing and calling attention to distinctive ideas that have been demonstrated to work as policy solutions to the nation's problems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Foundation covers many areas of public policy, but recently it has focused particularly on four basic challenges:

* Persistent [[economic inequality]] combined with the shift to American households of financial risks previously borne by employers and government
* Aging of the population
* Preventing and responding to terrorism while preserving [[civil liberties]]
* Restoring America's international credibility as an effective and cooperative leader in responding to global security and economic dangers

The Century Foundation produces work on issues such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and pensions, health care, education, tax and budget policy, homeland security, [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], election reform, international [[terrorism]], the U.S. relationship with the [[United Nations]] and other multilateral institutions, and policies toward regions such as the [[Middle East]] and East Asia.<ref>The Century Foundation web Site http://www.tcf.org/</ref>
