His public commentary has appeared in several periodicals such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''. Roberts himself is possibly best known internationally for his 2009 non-fiction work ''[[The Storm of War]]'',<ref name=umt/><ref name=uncommon/> which covers historical factors of the [[World War II|Second World War]] such as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] rise to power and the organisation of [[Nazi Germany]]. The book has been lauded by several publications such as ''[[The Economist]]'',<ref name=uncommon>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0iwRO6jas|title=The Storm of War|date=6 January 2012|publisher=[[Uncommon Knowledge]]|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> and it additionally received the British Army Military Book of the Year Award for 2010.<ref name=umt>{{cite web |url=http://news.umt.edu/2013/10/100313hist.aspx |title=Esteemed Military Historian to Lecture at UM |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=2 October 2013 |publisher=[[University of Montana]]}}</ref>

Much of Roberts' work, including his 2018 biography of [[Winston Churchill]], has been widely praised; the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', for example, called the Churchill biography 'Undoubtedly the best single-volume life of Churchill ever written.'<ref>{{cite news The Times|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-churchill-walking-with-destiny-by-andrew-roberts-the-best-biography-of-winston-ever-written-fh35d7982|title=Review: Churchill Walking with Desiny by Andrew Roberts|date=30 September 2018}}</ref> Elsewhere, his work has sometimes been criticised by, for example, ''The Economist'' who described one book as "a giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices, with sneers at those who do not share them and with errors".<ref name="Economist">{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2006/11/02/going-out-in-the-midday-sun |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |title=Going out in the midday sun |date=2 November 2006 |access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

==Early life and education==

Roberts was born in [[Hammersmith]], west London, the son of Kathleen ({{née|Hillery-Collings}}) and business executive Simon Roberts.<ref name="Who's Who"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=BgNF8jDigWgwe383y5mQgQ&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=14 September 2018|website=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Simon Roberts, from [[Cobham, Surrey]], inherited the Job's Dairy milk business and also owned the United Kingdom contingent of [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants.  A prolific reader as a child, he soon gained a passion for history, particularly for dramatic works relating to "battles, wars, assassinations and death".<ref name="observer">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/26/andrew-roberts-storm-of-war|title=Andrew Roberts: The history man who loves to party|work=[[The Observer]]|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=17 March 2015|first=Oliver|last=Marre}}</ref>

Roberts attended [[Cranleigh School]] in [[Surrey]]. He studied at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], and he went on to chair the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]].<ref name="and-me"/> He earned a [[first class honours]] [[B.A.]] degree in [[Modern History]] and a [[Ph.D.]]. 

Roberts began his career in corporate finance as an investment banker and private company director with the London merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]], where he worked from 1985 to 1988. He published his first historical book in 1991.

==Personal life==

Roberts is divorced from his first wife, Camilla Henderson, with whom he had two children.<ref name="observer"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Andrew Roberts and Camilla Henderson |date=8 December 1995 |newspaper=[[Tatler]] |url=http://www.tatler.com/gallery/andrew-roberts-and-camilla-henderson |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> Roberts is married to businesswoman Susan Gilchrist, CEO of the corporate communications firm Brunswick Group LLP and chairman of the [[South Bank Centre]]. They currently live in London.

Roberts has worked with [[think tank]] organisations such as the [[Centre for Policy Studies]] and the [[Centre for Social Cohesion]]. He additionally has maintained personal friendships with several British political and social figures such as [[David Cameron]], [[Michael Gove]] and [[Oliver Letwin]].<ref name="observer"/> In February 2016, he was appointed President of the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]].

==Historical and socio-political viewpoints==

===Commentary on history===
Roberts' analysis of the [[Second World War]] convinced him that the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] government had significant advantages in military organisation and economic power early in the war. He has argued that, if someone other than [[Adolf Hitler]] had control of the nation's military strategy, the country would likely have forgone a costly direct invasion of [[Soviet Union|Soviet territory]] (which occurred through [[Operation Barbarossa]]) and instead would have swept through [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] territories before trying to seal off British-controlled [[Middle East]] areas. Thus, Roberts believes, the likely morale-building victories against the comparatively weak forces to the southeast could have allowed Hitler to essentially "win" the war.<ref name=uncommon/> The other key strategic mistake, according to Roberts, was the [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|German declaration of war against the United States]], which happened only four days after the [[Pearl Harbor attacks]] and which the Nazi regime was not obliged to do. Roberts argues that after the declaration, Germany could not keep the U.S. war-making economic machine at bay.<ref name="uncommon" /> In short, Roberts believes that the mistakes, delusions and exaggerated self-confidence complexes that the [[Fascism|fascist dictatorship]] fostered proved its undoing.<ref name="korda" />

Roberts has also stated that he views [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the Soviet forces as having been disastrous to the allied efforts against the [[Axis powers]]. He noted that Stalin's obsessive tactics of killing his own men for [[Ideology|ideological]] reasons cost him thousands upon thousands of troops. In the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] alone, Soviet forces killed the equivalent of two full divisions of their own personnel.<ref name=uncommon/>

In terms of more recent history, Roberts whole-heartedly embraced [[Thatcherism]]. He has remained a staunch backer of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] and her socio-political legacy.<ref name="observer"/> In Roberts' opinion, Thatcher's insight to push the UK into a path in which it kept out of the [[Euro]] while still having strong ties to European economies has been validated by the [[Eurozone crisis]] in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession|world economic recession]]. After [[Tony Blair]] resigned as Prime Minister, Roberts assessed him as an "exemplary war leader" with his "vigorous prosecution of the [[War against Terror]]", which would leave him regarded as a "highly successful prime minister".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6636091.stm |title=How will history judge Blair? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref> In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 UK Referendum on the EU]], Roberts backed a Leave vote.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/09/14/breakfast-with-a-brexiteer/|title=Breakfast with a Brexiteer}}</ref>

===Support for the Iraq War and Military Intervention===
Roberts supports a strong American military and has generally argued in favour of close relations between the [[Anglosphere]] nations. As an advocate for the general principle of democratic pluralism, he has argued that "[s]neered at for being 'simplistic' in his reaction to 9/11, Bush's visceral responses to the attacks of a fascistic, totalitarian death cult will be seen as having been substantially the right ones" in the long run. In many writings, he has come out in support of [[neo-conservative]] influenced socio-political viewpoints.<ref name="observer"/>

During the buildup to the [[Iraq War]], Roberts supported the proposed invasion, arguing that anything less would be tantamount to appeasement, comparing Tony Blair to Winston Churchill in his "astonishing leadership". He additionally argued that acting against [[Saddam Hussein]] was in line with the "Pax Americana realpolitik that has kept the great powers at peace since the Second World War, despite the collapse of communism".<ref name="Roberts-Guardian">{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Andrew |last2=Pimlott |first2=Ben |author-link2=Ben Pimlott |date=8 March 2003 |title=The UN: Right or wrong |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/08/iraq.foreignpolicy |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

Roberts wrote in 2003 "For Churchill, apotheosis came in 1940; for Tony Blair, it will come when Iraq is successfully invaded and hundreds of weapons of mass destruction are unearthed from where they have been hidden by Saddam's henchmen."<ref name="Seaton">{{cite news |last=Seaton |first=Matt |date=19 February 2003 |title=Blast from the past |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/19/iraq.artsandhumanities |newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> When such [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons were not found]], Roberts still defended the invasion for larger strategic reasons while arguing that his past views were based on credible assessments from "the French, Chinese, Israeli and Russian intelligence agencies" as well as other sources.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Authorship and television appearances==
===Early works===

The first of Roberts' books was the biography of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s and [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]], [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax]], entitled ''The Holy Fox'', and published in 1991. Roberts provided a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] account of Wood, a one-time [[Viceroy of India]] and the Foreign Secretary in Chamberlain's government. Halifax has been charged with [[appeasement]], along with Chamberlain, but Roberts argues that Halifax in fact began to move his government away from that policy vis-à-vis [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's Germany]], following the 1938 [[Munich Crisis]].

This work was followed by ''Eminent Churchillians'', in 1994, a collection of essays about friends and enemies of Churchill. A large part of the book is an attack on [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and other prominent members of the elite. The title is an obvious allusion to the famous and similarly combative book of biographies ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''.

In 1995 Roberts published ''[[The Aachen Memorandum]]'', a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel based on Britain and its relationship with a fictionalised [[European Union]].

In 1996 Andrew Roberts offered his "personal view" of the [[Suez crisis]] in an [[Open Media]] production for BBC TV. The [[Radio Times]] described the programme: "Forty years after [[Sir Anthony Eden|Eden]]'s decision to deploy troops against the Egyptians, Andrew Roberts argues that the former prime minister should be congratulated, not chastised, for fighting to protect British assets".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-10-23 Radio Times, 23 October 1996]</ref>

In 1999, Roberts published ''[[Salisbury: Victorian Titan]]'', a biography of the [[Victorian era]] politician and then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]]. Historian Michael Korda praised the work as "a masterpiece about one of the greatest and most able Tory political figures of the Victorian age".<ref name=korda/> The book additionally won the [[Wolfson History Prize]] and the James Stern Silver Pen Award for Non-Fiction. In September 2001, ''Napoleon and Wellington'', an investigation into the relationship between the two generals, was published by [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], and was the subject of the lead review in all but one of [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] national newspapers.

January 2003 saw the publication of ''Hitler and Churchill: Secrets of Leadership''. In the book, which addresses the leadership techniques of Hitler and Churchill, he delivered a rebuttal to many of the assertions made by [[Clive Ponting]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] concerning Churchill.

An accompanying [[television series]] based around Roberts' ''Hitler and Churchill'' ran on [[BBC2]], with its first episode being broadcast on 7 March 2013.<ref name="Seaton"/> Roberts remarked that he felt grateful for the BBC's support of his work and their unwillingness to cut corners when it came to exploring history in detail, quipping as well about the group's wardrobe policy, "Courtesy of this programme, I now have two Armani suits upstairs."<ref name="and-me">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=David |date=11 February 2003 |title=Churchill, Hitler and me |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3589735/Churchill-Hitler-and-me.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

Also in 2003, he became a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. In 2004, he edited ''What Might Have Been'', a collection of twelve "[[Counterfactual history|What If?]]" essays written by historians and journalists, including [[Robert Cowley]], [[Antonia Fraser]], [[Norman Stone]], [[Amanda Foreman (biographer)|Amanda Foreman]], [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], [[Conrad Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour|Lord Black of Crossharbour]] and [[Anne Somerset (historian)|Anne Somerset]]. In 2005, Roberts published ''Waterloo: Napoleon's Last Gamble'', which was published in America as ''Waterloo: The Battle for Modern Europe''.

His ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900'', a sequel to the [[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples|four volume work]] of Churchill, was published in September 2006 and won the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Book Award. ''Masters and Commanders'' describes how four figures shaped the strategy of the West during the Second World War. It was published in November, 2008 and won the International Churchill Society Book Award and was shortlisted for two other military history book prizes. ''The Art of War'' is a two-volume chronological survey of the greatest military commanders in history. It was compiled by a team of historians, including [[Robin Lane Fox]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[John Julius Norwich]], [[Jonathan Sumption]] and [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]], working under the general editorship of Roberts.

===Overview of the Second World War===

''[[The Storm of War: A New History of the Second World War]]'' came out in August 2009. A detailed look at the history of events behind the [[Second World War]] and various key elements within it such as the nature of [[Nazi Germany]]'s rule, the book received large popular success.<ref name=uncommon/> and reached number two in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' bestseller list. The book additionally earned the British Army Military Book of the Year award for 2010.<ref name=umt/>

In terms of critical response, ''The Storm of War'' has also received a wide variety of praise in publications such as ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', where historian Michael Korda lauded it as written "superbly well" and stated that Roberts' "scholarship is superb",<ref name=korda>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Korda|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/16/the-storm-of-war-by-andrew-roberts-best-history-of-world-war-two.html|title='The Storm of War' by Andrew Roberts: Best History of World War II|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=16 May 2011|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where historian Jonathan W. Jordan said that Roberts "splendidly weaves a human tragedy into a story".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hell's Ethos|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070104576399862101639604|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2 July 2011|first=Jonathan W.|last=Jordan|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Support also came from figures such as American political commentator [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]] and fellow English historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]. In the book, the author aims to paint a concise yet highly detailed picture of the conflict in which he argues that dictators [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] both took terrible actions due to their repressive [[Ideology|ideologies]], throwing thousands and thousands of lives away in the process, yet the eventual defeat of the [[Axis powers]] constituted a moral triumph of democratic pluralism over [[authoritarianism]] that led the way to a better future.<ref name=uncommon/>

===Biography of Napoleon===

In 2014, Roberts wrote ''Napoleon the Great'' (the American edition is titled ''Napoleon: A Life''), which was awarded the 2015 [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] for best biography. In this biography, Roberts seeks to evoke Napoleon's tremendous energy, both physical and intellectual, and the attractiveness of his personality, even to his enemies. The book argues against many long-held historical opinions, including the myth of a great romance with [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. She took a lover immediately after their marriage, as Roberts shows, and Napoleon in fact had three times as many mistresses as he acknowledged. Roberts goes through fifty-three of Napoleon's sixty battlefields, and he additionally evaluates a gigantic new French edition of Napoleon's letters, aiming to create a complete re-evaluation of the man.<ref name=stand/>

Like ''The Storm of War'', Roberts's life of Napoleon received critical praise from a wide range of publications. For example, journalist Jeremy Jennings wrote for ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'' in October 2014 that "Napoleon could have had few biographers more dedicated to their subject." Jennings additionally labelled the book a "richly detailed and sure-footed reappraisal of the man, his achievements—and failures—and the extraordinary times in which he lived".<ref name=stand>{{cite news|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/books-october-14-enlightenment-on-horseback-andrew-roberts-napoleon?page=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0|publisher=[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]|first=Jeremy|last=Jennings|title=The Enlightenment on Horseback|date=October 2014|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The book earned the Prix du Jury des Grands Prix de la Fondation Napoléon for 2014, an award given by the historical organisation [[Fondation Napoléon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/Fr/fondation/prix/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-17 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203134841/http://www.napoleon.org/fr/fondation/prix/index.asp |archivedate=3 February 2002}}</ref>

Praise additionally came from fellow historian Jay Winik: 'With his customary flair and keen historical eye, Andrew Roberts has delivered the goods again. This could well be the best single volume biography of Napoleon in English for the last four decades. A tour de force that belongs on every history-lover's bookshelf!’<ref name="andrew-roberts.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew-roberts.net/|title=Home – Andrew Roberts, British historian, British history writer, Masters and Commanders, A History of the English Speaking Peoples since 1900|website=Andrew Roberts, British historian, British history writer, Masters and Commanders, A History of the English Speaking Peoples since 1900}}</ref> Author of historical fiction [[Bernard Cornwell]] describes the book as 'Simply dynamite ... [Napoleon was] a mass of contradictions and Roberts's book encompasses all the evidence to give a brilliant portrait of the man. The book, as it needs to be, is massive, yet the pace is brisk and it's never overwhelmed by the scholarly research, which was plainly immense ... Roberts suggests looking at Europe for the Emperor's monument, but this magnificent biography is not a bad place to start.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Napoleon the Great|author=Andrew Roberts|isbn=978-1846140273|year=2014}}</ref>

In announcing in 2013 that it would present a three-part television series based on Roberts's analysis of Napoleon's life and legacy, [[BBC Two]] declared in its press release that "Roberts sets out to shed new light on the emperor... an extraordinary, gifted military commander and a mesmeric leader whose private life was littered with disappointments and betrayals."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/history-release|title=BBC Two announces new collection of history commissions |publisher=BBC Media Centre }}</ref> However, the series has had mixed reviews.  ''The Daily Telegraph'' declared it "unconvincing", saying "there was no getting away from Roberts’s regular lapses into hero-worship," and "Roberts’s remarks on the refreshing qualities of dictatorship made me wonder if he had taken leave of his senses".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11681648/Napoleon-episode-2-review.html|title=Napoleon, episode 2, review: 'unconvincing'|author=Gerard O'Donovan|date=17 June 2015|website=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

===Churchill biography===
In 2018, Roberts produced a biography of Churchill entitled ''[[Churchill: Walking with Destiny]]''. Dovetailing with Roberts' previous work on the Second World War and its related major figures, the book received praise from a number of publications. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote, "Anecdotes sparkle like gems throughout Roberts’s book, an exhaustive but fluent text that draws on a wider range of sources than the typical Churchill biography."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/content/13c8f2c2-e1d4-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee|title=Churchill: Walking With Destiny/The Kremlin Letters – correspondents' ball|last=Barber|first=Toni|date=30 November 2018|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref> [[Andrew Rawnsley]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' included the book among the 'Books of the Year' and said that "Roberts triumphed over my skepticism with his riveting account of the extraordinary life of the most remarkable individual to have lived at No 10."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|last2=Empire|first2=Kitty|last3=Rawnsley|first3=Andrew|last4=Cumming|first4=Laura|last5=Kellaway|first5=Kate|last6=Preston|first6=Alex|last7=Anthony|first7=Andrew|last8=Rayner|first8=Jay|last9=Naughton|first9=John|title=Best books of 2018|language=en-GB|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2018/dec/09/best-books-of-2018|date=9 December 2018|accessdate=17 January 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> [[Stephen Pollard]], in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', lauded the book as "the most superb one-volume biography I have ever read— of anyone." Pollard additionally remarked, "Roberts manages something I thought impossible. He has given us a new, ground-breaking portrait of the man whom many consider to be the greatest ever Englishman. This is a simply wonderful book. A living, poetic, stirring yet thought-provoking portrait of a giant, it will be regarded as a classic for generations to come."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/books/book-review-churchill-walking-with-destiny-1.472568|title=Book review: Churchill: Walking with Destiny|last=Pollard|first=Stephen|date=18 November 2018|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that 'All told, it must surely be the best single-volume biography of Churchill yet written.'<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldous|first=Richard|date=13 November 2018|title=Is This the Best One-Volume Biography of Churchill Yet Written?|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/books/review/andrew-roberts-churchill-winston-biography.html|accessdate=17 January 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The ''National Book Review'' also noted that the book was 'widely praised as the best single-volume biography of Winston Churchill ever written' and added that 'historian and commentator Roberts draws on previously unavailable journals and notes for the robust, engrossing, and nuanced history of the great British leader.'.<ref>{{cite web|title=5 HOT BOOKS: A Timely Look at How to Get Rid of a President, Churchill, and More|url=https://www.thenationalbookreview.com/features/2018/11/18/5-hot-books-a-timely-look-at-how-to-get-rid-of-a-president-churchill-and-more|website=The National Book Review|accessdate=17 January 2019|language=en-US}}</ref>

Although Roberts's 2006 work ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900'' won critical acclaim from some sections of the media,<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Daniels |first=Anthony |title=The case for the defence |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=2 November 2006 |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/11/the-case-for-the-defence-3/ |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Massie |first=Allan |author-link=Allan Massie |date=22 October 2006 |title=Happy is he who speaks English |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3656058/Happy-is-he-who-speaks-English.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' drew attention to some historical, geographical and typographical errors, as well presenting a generally scathing review of the book. The newspaper referred to the work as "a giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices".<ref name="Economist"/> More generally, Reba Soffer described him in 2009 as "devoted&nbsp;...to public, polemical conservatism as well as to historical revisionism".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9UTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA301 |title=History, Historians, and Conservatism in Britain and America: From the Great War to Thatcher and Reagan |first=Reba N. |last=Soffer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19920-811-1 |page=301}}</ref>

One claim made by Roberts in ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900'' was that [[Harvard University|Harvard]] historian [[Caroline Elkins]] had committed "blood libels" in her [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning book ''[[Imperial Reckoning]]''.<ref name="Roberts_aHotESPs1900_278">{{cite book|author=Andrew Roberts|title=A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQTgHvsUhyMC&pg=PT278|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-86524-7|page=278|quote=One way that the Left in the West has attempted to undermine its legacy is to try to argue that was a 'moral equivalence' between Soviet communism and English-speaking capitalism. Thus in 2004 the University of California Press published a book by Mark Dow entitled ''American Gulag'' and subtitled ''Inside US Immigration Prisons'', and in 2005 a book entitled ''Britain's Gulag'' was published about British detention camps in Kenya, written by a Harvard historian named Caroline Elkins, whose blood-libels against Britain won her the Pulitzer Prize.}}</ref> Elkins was subsequently vindicated when files released by the [[National Archives]] showed that abuses were described as "distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia" by the [[Solicitor General]] of the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=British colonial 'cover up' in Mau Mau camp revealed in new secret document release |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9713465/British-colonial-cover-up-in-Mau-Mau-camp-revealed-in-new-secret-document-release.html |quote=Serious concerns about the clampdown were raised as far back as 1953, the second year of the uprising, when Solicitor General described reported abuses as ''distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia'', according to one of the secret documents.}}</ref> The [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] subsequently announced compensation for the first round of victims with statements that the British government "recognises that Kenyans were subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment" and "sincerely regrets that these abuses took place" during the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya Emergency]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mau Mau torture victims to receive compensation – Hague |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22790037 |work=BBC News |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UK to compensate Kenya's Mau Mau torture victims |newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 June 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/uk-compensate-kenya-mau-mau-torture |agency=[[Press Association]] |accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>

British journalist [[Johann Hari]] has claimed that Roberts' writings defended acts such as the [[Amritsar massacre]], the [[British concentration camps|concentration camps for Afrikaners]] during the [[Second Boer War]] and [[Operation Demetrius|mass internments in Ireland]]. Hari also wrote that Roberts addressed the expatriate South African [[Springbok Club]] that flies the [[Flag of South Africa (1928–1994)|pre-1994 South African national flag]] and calls for "the re-establishment of civilised rule throughout the African continent".<ref name="Hari">{{cite news |last=Hari |first=Johann |authorlink=Johann Hari |date=31 July 2009 |title=The dark side of Andrew Roberts |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-dark-side-of-andrew-roberts-1765229.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref> Roberts responded by saying that he did not realise the Springbok Club was racist when he took on the speaking engagement.
