Reactions to the event were largely against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.

== Background ==
{{Further|History of the Republic of Turkey}}

=== Kemalism ===
{{Main|Kemalism|Turkish coup d'état}}
It is widely reported that [[Kemalism|Kemalist ideology]] played little or no role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, unlike all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey's military.<ref name="Filkins2016a" /> Since the establishment of [[multiparty democracy]] in Turkey in 1946, the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] (TSK), together with the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|judiciary]], have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular [[Turkish nationalist]] state established under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] against political parties that have promoted a larger role for [[Islam]] and minorities in public life. The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks who were attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women's wearing of [[Headscarf controversy in Turkey|headscarves]]. The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960]] and [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980]], and by military decisions in [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971]] and [[1997 Turkish coup d'état|1997]]. In addition, the military has banned [[List of historical parties in Turkey|several major political parties]]. In 1998, Erdoğan, who was the mayor of Istanbul at the time, was banned for life from politics, and jailed, because he had read a certain poem several years before, at a public meeting. In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of [[Abdullah Gül]], of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), as president, by issuing an [[e-memorandum]], but Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|referendum]] on the matter, and also a [[2007 Turkish presidential election|snap election]], and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.<ref name="ArangoNYT">{{cite news |author1=Tim Arango |author2-link=Ceylan Yeğinsu |author2=Ceylan Yeğinsu |date=15 July 2016 |title=President of Turkey Urges Resistance as Military Attempts Coup |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/military-attempts-coup-in-turkey-prime-minister-says.html |accessdate=15 July 2016|author1-link=Tim Arango}}</ref>

=== AKP–Gülen alliance and "Ergenekon" ===
{{Main|Ergenekon trials|Turkish government – Gülen Movement conflict}}
As opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey's AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to [[Kemalism|Kemalist ideology]], but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric [[Fethullah Gülen]].<ref name="Filkins2016a" /> Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed "[[Ergenekon (allegation)|Ergenekon]]". Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials and media, the purges gave an opportunity to lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/real-and-imagined-threats-the-shared-past-of-akp-and-the-g%C3%BClen-movement/a-19429199 |title=Real and imagined threats: the shared past of AKP and the Gülen movement |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=27 July 2016}}</ref> They were seen as a bid by Turkey's civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish [[Civilian control of the military|dominance over the military]].<ref name="ArangoNYT" /><ref name="BBCErgenekon" /> In these trials in 2013 – viewed as "sensational"<ref name="ArangoNYT" /> and "one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"<ref name="BBCErgenekon">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36099889 Ergenekon: Court quashes 'coup plot' convictions], BBC News (21 April 2016).</ref> – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called "Ergenekon" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.<ref name="BBCErgenekon" /> Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, [[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer]].<ref name="BBCErgenekon" /> Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.<ref name="Chontier">{{cite news |last1=Chontier |first1=Issac |title=How Turkey Came To This |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/07/why_turkey_s_latest_attempted_coup_was_different.html |accessdate=16 July 2016 |work=Slate |date=15 July 2016}}</ref>

The AKP's alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-recep-tayyip-erdogan-turns-on-former-brother-in-arms-fethullah-gulen-1469058504 |title=Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Turns on Former Brother-in-Arms Fethullah Gülen |first=Emre |last=Peker |date=21 July 2016 |work=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.<ref name="Chontier" /> The "Ergenekon" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Court of Cassation]], which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.<ref name="BBCErgenekon" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkish-court-overturns-coup-plot-convictions-of-generals-1461247252 |title=Turkish Court Overturns Coup Plot Convictions of Generals |first=Emre |last=Peker |date=21 April 2016 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>

=== Role of corruption ===
In 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey]], were faulted by Erdoğan. The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt |title=Fethullah Gülen: who is the man Turkey's president blames for coup attempt? |last=Beaumont |first=Peter |date=16 July 2016 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be "rife" in Turkey.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/will-there-be-coup-against-erdogan-turkey-439181 |title=Will There Be a Coup Against Erdoğan in Turkey? |last=Rubin |first=Michael |date=24 March 2016 |work=Newsweek|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/what-caused-the-turkish-coup-attempt-214057 |title=What Caused the Turkish Coup Attempt |last=Pearson |first=W.

=== Immunity bill ===
On 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations. The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while cases against lower-ranking soldiers may be signed off on by district governors. The immunity bill was seen as part of the ''[[détente]]'' between the government and the armed forces, while the latter have increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hannah Lucinda Smith |title=Erdoğan gives Turkish military immunity |work=The Times |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/turkish-military-given-immunity-as-erdogan-seeks-allies-3fcpwc2jk |date=15 July 2016 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

== Reasons for failure ==
One of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters' ranks.  Turkey's [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT) head [[Hakan Fidan]] discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.  One of the main organizers, General [[Semih Terzi]], was shot dead by loyalist [[Sergeant major|Sgt. Maj.]] [[Ömer Halisdemir]] at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting [[command and control]] of the rebels. These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.<ref name="Al-Monitor Anonymous">{{cite news |last1=Anonymous Reporter in Turkey |title=How They Blew The Coup |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-intelligence-agency-thwart.html |accessdate=25 July 2016 |agency=Al-Monitor |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724195008/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-intelligence-agency-thwart.html |archivedate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The highest ranking [[staff officers]] opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.<ref name="Beauchamp">{{cite web|last1=Beauchamp |first1=Zach |title=Why Turkey's Coup Failed, according to an expert |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/16/12205352/turkey-coup-failed-why |website=Vox |accessdate=17 July 2016|date=16 July 2016}}</ref> Acting outside the military [[chain of command]], the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.

Equally important to the coup's failure, according to military strategist [[Edward N. Luttwak]], was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.<ref name="Luttwak">{{cite web |last1=Luttwak |first1=Edward |title=Why Turkey's Coup D'Etat Failed: And Why Erdoğan's Craven Excesses Made it Inevitable |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/16/why-turkeys-coup-detat-failed-erdogan/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref>  A unit of [[Special Forces (Turkish Armed Forces)|special forces]] was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.

According to Naunihal Singh, author of ''Seizing Power'', the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media, and thus shape the narrative. Successful coups require that the mass media be controlled by the rebels.<ref name="Beauchamp" /> This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable. Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them, or at least not to resist. The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.<ref name="Beauchamp" /> They failed to capture [[Türksat (company)|Türksat]], Turkey's main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country's television and mobile phone networks. This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.<ref name="Al-Monitor Anonymous" />

Other scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh's miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.<ref name="auto8" /> Luttwak's argument is that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces were not able to silence Erdoğan. Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn't control the message. Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it's their effect—civil disobedience—that is important. We might find that "[Gülen's movement] ... [might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup," writes Kinney. "... [A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military."<ref name="auto8" />

Erdoğan wasn't censored (Luttwak's point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators' ability to project success (Singh's point). The end result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power. The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they "usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes," but rather put a premium on "the inner-workings of the [military] operation."

[[File:Fethullah Gülen 2016.jpg|thumb|Turkish authorities blamed [[Fethullah Gülen]] who condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it]]

[[Fethullah Gülen]], whom President Erdoğan said as being one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it. "I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey," he said in an emailed statement reported by ''The New York Times''. "Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. I pray to God for Turkey, for Turkish citizens and for all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly. As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations."<ref name="Hürriyet Gülen" />

President Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: "I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt. Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!

On 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat [[James Jeffrey]], who was the [[United States ambassador to Turkey]] from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: "The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of. They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier. I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the [[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer case]], [[Hakan Fidan]] case, and the corruption cases in 2013. It is very clear that significant segment of the bureaucracy in Turkey were infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement. That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous. It is highly likely that it led to the coup attempt."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/most-indications-point-to-gulenists-in-failed-coup-attempt-former-us-envoy.aspx?pageID=238&nID=102824&NewsCatID=358|title=AMERICAS – Most indications point to Gülenists in failed coup attempt: Former US envoy|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/hear-what-james-jeffrey-says.aspx?PageID=238&NID=102916&NewsCatID=411|title=MUSTAFA AKYOL – Hear what James Jeffrey says|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>

=== Social unrest ===

On 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of [[Istanbul]] with high concentration of [[Alevis]], including [[Okmeydanı]] and [[Sultangazi|Gazi]]. Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of [[Antakya]] with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a [[sharia]] advocate was lynched.

=== Calls to reintroduce the death penalty ===
{{See also|Capital punishment in Turkey}}

Following the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting "we want the death penalty". President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that "in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get." Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.

European Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.

Turkey is a member of the [[Council of Europe]], and ratified the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.

On 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister [[Numan Kurtulmuş]] declared the governments intention to extend the [[state of emergency]] by a further three months raising objections from both the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) and [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.

Following the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council's]] recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] said that "The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup" and that it was "raising the prospect of opportunist measures."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-extends-state-of-emergency-1475507092 |title=Turkey Extends State of Emergency; The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=23 October 2016}}</ref>

{{See also|July 2016 Turkish military asylum incident in Greece}}

On 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in [[Greece]]'s northeastern city of [[Alexandroupolis]] on board a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk helicopter]] and claimed political [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in Greece. While The Turkish foreign minister [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] demanded extradition of "the eight traitors as soon as possible", the Greek authorities stated: "We will follow the procedures of international law. However, we give very serious considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/turkish-soldiers-fly-to-greece-for-asylum-10503641|title=Turkish Soldiers Fly To Greece For Asylum|publisher=Sky News}}</ref> The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.<ref name="bbcdilemma">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36824862 |title=Turkey coup attempt: Greek dilemma over soldiers who fled |publisher=BBC |date=19 July 2016}}</ref> The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to [[Athens]], mainly for safety reasons.

On 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river. However, once they entered the country, the group split. The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum. They were being held in the city of [[Alexandroupolis]]. The two men belonged to the Turkish navy, and the names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.

After the coup attempt, two Turkish military attaches in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attache Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.

According to [[Amnesty International]], detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, [[Torture in Turkey#Torture after the 2016 coup d'état attempt|have been beaten and tortured]], and have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.

Also, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.<ref name="independent" /><ref name="amnesty" />

Turkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister [[Bekir Bozdağ]] said on his Twitter account: "There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody," in response to reports by Amnesty International.

==== Increase regarding Greek islands ====
Greek authorities on a number of [[Aegean islands]] have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] has increased noticeably after the failed coup. At [[Athens]] officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in [[Greece]] had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aegean islands alarm as refugee numbers rise after Turkey coup attempt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/30/refugee-numbers-rise-greece-aegean-turkey-coup-attempt |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 July 2016 |last1=Smith |first1=Helena }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Migration arrivals inch up after failed Turkey coup: Greece |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/migration-arrivals-inch-up-after-failed-turkey-coup-greece-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=102251&NewsCatID=351 |work=Hürriyet Daily News }}</ref> Also, the mayor of [[Kos]] expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The [[Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises]] (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the [[European migrant crisis|refugee/migrant crisis]] due to the Turkish political instability.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sector group: Coup attempt in Turkey to negatively affect Greek tourism |url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1133579/sector-group-coup-attempt-in-turkey-to-negatively-affect-greek-tourism |publisher=naftemporiki |year=2016 }}</ref>

[[Berlin]] mayor, [[Michael Müller (politician, born 1964)|Michael Müller]] (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the [[Gülen movement]] in Germany. He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to critically confront the Gülen movement in Berlin and, if necessary, to support measures against it.

German authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey's internal politics are spilling over into German cities. For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey's state-run religious institution [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs]] usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and [[Gülen Movement Schools]] for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany. DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.

According to [[Volker Beck (politician)|Volker Beck]], a member of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|center-left Greens]] in Germany's [[parliament|Bundestag]], "That was not a religious text.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey."We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy," the PM said in a statement issued from his office.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Pakistani politicians said about the coup attempt in Turkey|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1271409|last=Hanif|first=Anees|date=17 July 2016|website=Dawn|language=en|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

The majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint. On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed [[United Nations Security Council]] statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by [[Egypt]], a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements. Egyptian diplomats said that the council is "in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government&nbsp;– or any other government for that matter&nbsp;– as democratically elected or not". Objection by the United States and the UK&nbsp;– permanent members of the Security Council&nbsp;– led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to "respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.<ref name=egypt_denounce /> The leader of the opposition [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]] supported the coup attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://life.ru/t/%D0%B7%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%BA/878522/zhirinovskii_obiasnil_pochiemu_voiennyi_pierievorot_v_turtsii_provalilsia |title=Жириновский объяснил, почему военный переворот в Турции провалился |author=Alexey Demin |publisher=Life.ru |language=Russian |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>

==== Greek maritime patrols for coup fugitives ====
On July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of [[Symi]], in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece. These reports put the Greek armed forces on alert. Also, the Greek Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from [[Datca]], on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters. Furthermore, a contingent of the Greek Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there. Athens had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and so took the reports seriously. In addition, Turkish F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean. Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have "hijacked" a vessel to flee to Greece.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/210616/article/ekathimerini/news/reports-of-commandos-in-aegean-put-athens-on-alert |title=Reports of commandos in Aegean put Athens on alert |publisher=ekathimerini}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/interior-ministry-refutes-hijacked-coastguard-vessels-reports.aspx?pageID=517&nID=101895&NewsCatID=341 |title=Interior Ministry refutes 'hijacked coastguard vessels' reports |work=Hürriyet Daily News}}</ref> The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1130561/entatikopoiountai-oi-peripolies-sto-aigaio |title=Εντατικοποιούνται οι περιπολίες στο Αιγαίο |publisher=naftemporiki}}</ref>

== Causes ==
According to [[Michael Rubin (scholar)|Michael Rubin]], from the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup. Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly "dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks." After "fanning the flames" at the [[Gezi Park protests|2013 Gezi Park protests]], he transformed the predominantly [[Turkish Kurdistan|Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey]] "into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s." The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been [[Foreign policy of the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government|Erdoğan's foreign policy]], which managed to turn the initial "no problems with neighbors" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Rubin |title=Erdoğan Has Nobody to Blame for the Coup But Himself |magazine=[[Foreign Policy]] |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/15/erdogan-has-nobody-to-blame-for-the-coup-but-himself/ |date=15 July 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2016|author-link=Michael Rubin}}</ref>

British Middle East correspondent [[Robert Fisk]] warned that "too late did Erdoğan realise the cost of the role he had chosen for his country. It's one thing to say sorry to [[Putin]] and patch up relations with [[Netanyahu]]; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon." Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expects another to follow in the months or years to come.<ref>{{cite news |author=Robert Fisk |title=Turkey's coup may have failed&nbsp;– but history shows that it won't be long before another one succeeds |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/turkey-coup-erdogan-ankara-istanbul-military-army-turkeys-coup-may-have-failed-but-history-shows-a7140521.html |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2016|author-link=Robert Fisk}}</ref>

Turkish professor [[Akın Ünver]] described the coup d'état attempt as "more of a mutiny".<ref>{{cite news |title=Turkey's failed coup gives its president a chance to seize more power |work=[[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21702321-recep-tayyip-erdogan-calls-his-opponents-traitors-and-now-considers-his-case-proved-turkeys |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>

=== Peace at Home Council ===
The name of the "[[Turkish Peace Council|Peace at Home Council]]"&nbsp;– ''Yurtta Sulh Konseyi''&nbsp;– is derived from [[Atatürk]]'s famous saying '[[Peace at Home, Peace in the World]]'.<ref name="bbcwho">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36815476 |title=Turkey coup: Who was behind Turkey coup attempt?&nbsp;– BBC News |accessdate=17 July 2016|agency=BBC News |date=16 July 2016 |last1=Basaran |first1=Ezgi}}</ref> Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that "the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's famous address to the Turkish Youth. [...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a [[Kemalist]] junta rather than a [[Gülenist]] one."<ref name="bbcwho" />

The citizen journalism site [[Bellingcat]] published an analysis of the messages of a [[WhatsApp]] group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people. The messages were cross referenced with video footage. The group was named “Yurtta sulh” which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.<ref>{{cite web |title="We've shot four people.

News reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was [[Adil Öksüz]].

=== Timing ===
German [[Islamic studies]] scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Rainer Hermann|de}} said the [[putsch]]ists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt. According to Turkish investigative journalist [[Ahmet Şık]], a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan. According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt, before they would be disposed and arrested.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rainer Hermann |title=Wollten Putschisten Erdoğans Säuberungswelle verhindern? |trans-title=Did the putschists aim at forestalling Erdoğan's purges? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/verhaftungen-in-der-tuerkei-wollten-putschisten-erdogans-saeuberungswelle-verhindern-14344728.html |date=17 July 2016 |accessdate=19 July 2016 |language=de}}</ref>

=== Staged coup reports ===
During and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it. The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]] contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt. Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a 'tragic comedy' and 'theatre play'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ensonhaber.com/bekir-coskun-darbe-girisiminin-tiyatro-olduguna-inaniyor-2016-07-17.html|title=Bekir Coşkun darbe girişiminin tiyatro olduğuna inanıyor|date=17 July 2016|website=Ensonhaber}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/as-the-coup-in-turkey-unfolded-the-whole-night-felt-like-doomsday.html |title=As Turkey Coup Unfolded, 'the Whole Night Felt Like Doomsday' |date=17 July 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="Vocativ" /> Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an [[executive presidency]], while being able to legitimise further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/turkey-coup-conspiracy-theory-erdogan-military-gift-from-god-soldiers-istanbul-a7140516.html |title=Turkey coup: Conspiracy theorists claim power grab attempt was faked by Erdoğan |date=16 July 2016}}</ref> <!-- NEEDS REWORDING FOR NEUTRALITY AND A BETTER SOURCE Opponents of Erdoğan{{who|date=July 2016}} claimed that very little stood in the way of his government eroding the founding principles of the Turkish Republic such as [[Secularism in Turkey|secularism]], which the AKP has been accused of wanting to abolish, and pursuing a more authoritarian ag<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biliyomuydun.com/su-ana-kadar-okudugum/ |title=Şu ana kadar okuduğum en anlaşılabilir, en net darbe yorumu}}</ref>enda. -->

Other elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the highly visible nature of the coup actions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-military-coup-attempt-more-questions-than-answers.html |title=Was Turkey's coup attempt just an elaborate hoax by Erdoğan? |date=17 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718070201/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-military-coup-attempt-more-questions-than-answers.html |archivedate=18 July 2016}}</ref>

[[Fethullah Gülen]], whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, "I don't believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan. There is a possibility that it could be a ''staged coup'' and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists]."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan |title=Fethullah Gülen: Turkey coup may have been 'staged' by Erdoğan regime |first=Amana |last=Fontanella-Khan |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Journalist [[Cengiz Çandar]], a veteran observer of Turkey's coups, said "I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-military-coup-attempt-more-questions-than-answers.html |title=Was Turkey's coup attempt just an elaborate hoax by Erdoğan? |date=17 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720014044/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-military-coup-attempt-more-questions-than-answers.html |archivedate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Prominent ''[[Hizmet]]'' (Gülen movement) spokesman [[Alp Aslandogan]] said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan prior to 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within "the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn't actually happen. There were events that did happen, but by the time that the document started, those events didn't happen. It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poconorecord.com/news/20190721/doubt-cast-on-gxfclens-role-in-failed-turkish-coup|title=Doubt cast on Gülen's role in failed Turkish coup|first=Brian|last=Myszkowski|website=Pocono Record|date=21 July 2019}}</ref>

==== Evidence of pre-planning ====
The organisation and spontaneous synchronisation by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how the call to prayer could have been strategically used by Erdoğan to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on [[Secularism in Turkey|state secularism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/yilmaz-ozdil-erdogan-sahte-darbenin-ruzgariyla-cumhurbaskani-oldu-monte-darbenin-ruzgariyla-baskan-oluyor,350423|title=Yılmaz Özdil: Erdoğan 'sahte darbe'nin rüzgârıyla cumhurbaşkanı oldu, 'monte darbe'nin rüzgârıyla başkan oluyor|website=t24.com.tr}}</ref>

Thousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16–18 July 2016. The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the "Turkish government had all those lists ready", as suggested by [[Johannes Hahn]], [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]], on 18 July 2016. Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the "event was prepared" and the lists were to be used "at a certain stage".<ref name="NewEurope-Hahn">{{cite news |last=Kostaki |first=Irene |date=18 July 2016 |title=2,745 judges, almost 3,000 suspected military plotters, ranging from top commanders to foot soldiers, and prosecutors were sacked and arrested, immediately after the failed Turkey coup attempt |url=https://www.neweurope.eu/article/eu-commissioner-hahn-the-event-was-prepared-as-arrest-lists-were-ready/ |work=[[New Europe (newspaper)|New Europe]] |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>

==== Possible connections of the coup leaders to Erdoğan ====
Mehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar's neck to make him sign, is the brother of [[Şaban Dişli]], a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.<ref>{{cite web |title=AK Party vice chair's brother Maj.

==== Possible government motives ====
A number of social media users have compared the coup attempt to the [[Reichstag fire]] in 1933, which [[Adolf Hitler]] used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.<ref name="staged" /> ''[[Politico]]'' correspondent Ryan Heath said that "the coup was staged to give Erdoğan an opportunity to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country".<ref name="staged">{{cite news |author=Lusher, Adam |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/turkey-coup-conspiracy-theory-erdogan-military-gift-from-god-soldiers-istanbul-a7140516.html |title=Turkey coup: Conspiracy theorists claim attempt was faked by Erdoğan |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a "fake coup" which would help a "fake democracy warrior" (referring to Erdoğan).

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Arango, Tim |author2=Yeginsujuly, Ceylan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/as-the-coup-in-turkey-unfolded-the-whole-night-felt-like-doomsday.html?ref=world&_r=0 |title=As Turkey Coup Unfolded, 'the Whole Night Felt Like Doomsday' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a [[false flag]] event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.<ref name="Vocativ">{{cite web |title=Critics Raise False Flag After Failed Military Coup In Turkey |url=http://www.vocativ.com/341593/critics-raise-false-flag-after-failed-military-coup-in-turkey/ |publisher=Vocativ |accessdate=16 July 2016|date=16 July 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Fethullah-Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Fontanella-Khan |first1=Amana |title=Fethullah Gülen: Turkey coup may have been 'staged' by Erdoğan regime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan |accessdate=16 July 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=16 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716221649/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan |archivedate=16 July 2016 |location=Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Turkey coup: Conspiracy theorists claim attempt was faked by Erdoğan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/turkey-coup-conspiracy-theory-erdogan-military-gift-from-god-soldiers-istanbul-a7140516.html |website=The Independent |quote=Social media users claim Erdoğan will use the attempted coup in the same way Hitler used the Reichstag Fire to suppress all opposition. |accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.<ref name=skeptics>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-attempt-turkish-authorities-hoax-claims-president-erdogan-latest-news-a7154411.html |title=Turkey Coup: Authorities investigate those claiming attempted takeover was a hoax |author=Harry Cockburn |work=Independent |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>

Politicians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a 'civil coup' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated [[Gülen Movement|Gülen supporters]] by the government shortly after the events. Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical [[Islamist]] agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.<ref>{{cite web |title=Şu ana kadar okuduğum en anlaşılabilir, en net darbe yorumu |url=http://biliyomuydun.com/su-ana-kadar-okudugum |publisher=biliyomuydun.com |accessdate=17 July 2016 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720030900/http://biliyomuydun.com/su-ana-kadar-okudugum/ |archivedate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

Justice Minister [[Bekir Bozdağ]] said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: "Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.

On 12 July 2017, [[Stockholm Center for Freedom]], a monitoring group with reported links to the Hizmet movement that tracks Turkey, published a controversial [http://stockholmcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/15_July_Erdogans_Coup_13.07.2017.pdf 181-pages report] stating that the coup bid was in fact orchestrated by President Erdogan as a false flag in order to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria. According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt. The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockholmcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/15_July_Erdogans_Coup_13.07.2017.pdf|title=Erdogan's Coup in Turkey}}</ref>

=== Allegations of CIA involvement ===
In early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for {{Interlanguage link|Henri J. Barkey|tr}}, former Director of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars#Middle East Program|Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], stating that he is an agent of the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.<ref name="almonitor_barkey_warrant" /> Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for [[Graham E.
