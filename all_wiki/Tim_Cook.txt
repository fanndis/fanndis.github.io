===Apple era===
====Early career====
In 1998, [[Steve Jobs]] asked Cook to join Apple. In a [[commencement speech]] at [[Auburn University]], Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:

{{quote|Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1776338/tim-cook-apple-ceo-auburn-university-commencement-speech-2010 |title=Commencement Address at Auburn University, 20110 |last=Cook |first=Tim |publisher=Fast Co Design |access-date=October 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000233/http://www.fastcompany.com/1776338/tim-cook-apple-ceo-auburn-university-commencement-speech-2010 |archive-date=October 5, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

In September 2017 at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'s Global Business Forum, Cook defended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA immigration program]]. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of [[Donald Trump]]'s administration, stating: "This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/apple-ceo-tim-cooks-views-on-immigration-and-daca.html |title=CEO Tim Cook says Apple is pushing extremely hard on DACA: 'I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this' |website=CNBC |access-date=October 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008130232/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/apple-ceo-tim-cooks-views-on-immigration-and-daca.html |archive-date=October 8, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/20/16338626/tim-cook-bloomberg-forum-dreamers-immigration |title=Tim Cook says DACA is the 'biggest issue of our time' |website=Recode |access-date=October 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007112356/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/20/16338626/tim-cook-bloomberg-forum-dreamers-immigration |archive-date=October 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed his opinions on the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public "very uncomfortable."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-attacks-tech-firms-that-hoard-data-2018-10 |title=Tim Cook mounted his most stinging attack yet on companies like Facebook and Google that hoard 'industrial' quantities of data |url-status=live |access-date=September 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927054757/https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-attacks-tech-firms-that-hoard-data-2018-10 |archive-date=September 27, 2019 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Cook is a [[physical fitness|fitness]] enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He is known for being solitary, using an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and little is publicly shared about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a "basic level of privacy".<ref name="cnnnov2008" /><ref name="Dig">{{Cite web |url=http://mobilitydigest.com/tim-cook-coming-into-his-own/ |title=Tim Cook Coming Into His Own |last=Walter Smyth |date=March 2, 2014 |website=Mobility Digest |publisher=Mobility Digest |access-date=August 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922003625/http://mobilitydigest.com/tim-cook-coming-into-his-own/ |archive-date=September 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cook was misdiagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1996, an incident he said made him "see the world in a different way". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. He later told the [[Auburn University|Auburn]] alumni magazine that his symptoms came from "lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304610404579405420617578250 |title=The Job After Steve Jobs: Tim Cook and Apple |last=Kane |first=Yukari |website=Wall Street Journal |access-date=September 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917005841/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304610404579405420617578250 |archive-date=September 17, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cook has said that in 2009 he offered a portion of his [[liver]] to Jobs since they share a rare blood type. Cook said that Jobs responded by yelling, "I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that."<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/tim_cook_tried_to_foist_his_liver_on_steve_jobs/ I BEG YOU, mighty Jobs, TAKE MY LIVER, Cook told Apple's dying co-founder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816154815/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/tim_cook_tried_to_foist_his_liver_on_steve_jobs |date=August 16, 2017 }}. [[The Register]]. March 13, 2015</ref>

While delivering the 2010 [[commencement speech]] at Auburn, Cook emphasized the importance of [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] during significant decision-making processes, and explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAXuHvzjao |title=Auburn University Spring 2010 Commencement Speaker Tim Cook |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=Auburn University |access-date=August 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826192715/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAXuHvzjao |archive-date=August 26, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

He ended his [[op-ed]] writing "We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick."<ref name="bloomberg.com" /> Cook became the first and only [[openly]] gay CEO on the [[Fortune 500]] list.<ref name=":0" /> In September 2015, Cook clarified on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]],'' "Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth."<ref>{{Citation |title=Apple CEO tells Colbert why he came out as gay |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAWUitFgOIM |language=en |access-date=August 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102101115/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAWUitFgOIM |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 2019, he talked about the decision and remarked on how it was thanks to [[LGBTQ]] people who had fought for [[LGBT rights in the United States|their rights]] before him that paved the way for his success; and that he needed to let younger generations know that—in a coding analogy—he saw being gay as a feature his life had to offer rather than any problem.<ref name=":0" /> He hoped his openness could help [[Homelessness among LGBT youth in the United States|LGBTQ youth dealing with homelessness]], and [[Suicide among LGBT youth|suicide]] hope that their situation could get better.<ref name=":0" />
