Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]], the area was inhabited by the [[Nisenan]], [[Maidu]] and other [[indigenous peoples of California]]. Spanish cavalryman [[Gabriel Moraga]] surveyed and named the ''Rio del Santísimo Sacramento'' ([[Sacramento River]]) in 1808, after the [[Blessed Sacrament]], referring to the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist in the Catholic Church]]. In 1839, [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], [[List of Governors of California before 1850|Mexican governor]] of [[Alta California]], granted the responsibility of colonizing the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born Mexican citizen [[John Sutter|John Augustus Sutter]], who subsequently established [[Sutter's Fort]] and the settlement at the ''Rancho [[New Helvetia|Nueva Helvetia]].'' Following the American [[Conquest of California]] and the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]], the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed, and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento.

=== Pre-Columbian period ===
<!--If we could talk about this heading instead or re-editing that would be great.  Please see talk page. -->
[[Nisenan]] (Southern [[Maidu]]), [[Modoc people|Modoc]], and [[Plains Miwok]] Native Americans had lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years. Unlike the settlers who would eventually make Sacramento their home, these Native Americans left little evidence of their existence. Traditionally, their diet was dominated by [[acorn]]s taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region, and by fruits, bulbs, seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.

=== Spanish period ===
[[File:Sutterfort (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Sutter's Fort]] was founded in 1840 by [[John Augustus Sutter]] during the period of [[Mexican California]].]]
In 1808, the Spanish explorer [[Gabriel Moraga]] encountered and named the Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento River. A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote: "Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and ''(the Spaniards)'' drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. "¡Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It's like the Blessed Sacrament.)"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |title=Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament – Sacramento, California |publisher=Cathedralsacramento.org |date=November 11, 2012 |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116093832/http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |archive-date=November 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The valley and the river were then christened after the "Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ", referring to the Catholic [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].

=== Mexican period ===
[[John Sutter]] Sr. first arrived in the area on August 13, 1839, at the divergence of the American and Sacramento Rivers with a Mexican land grant of 50,000 acres. The next year, his party and he established Sutter's Fort, a massive adobe structure with walls 18 feet high and three feet thick.<ref name="legendsofamerica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-oldsacramento.html|title=Old Sacramento, California – Walking on History|publisher=Legends of America|access-date=October 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525050816/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-oldsacramento.html|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Representing Mexico, Sutter Sr. called his colony New [[Helvetia]], a Swiss-inspired name, and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement. Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a 10-acre orchard and a herd of 13,000 cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847, Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire,<ref name="legendsofamerica.com" /> but unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s "empire" had been built on thin margins of credit.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnsutterlifeon00hurt/page/83 <!-- quote=his father's loose business habits. --> John Sutter: A Life on the North American Frontier] By Albert L.

=== American period ===
[[File:Sacramento california 1849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|Sacramento in 1849, when the city was an economic center of the [[California Gold Rush]]]]
In 1848, when gold was discovered by [[James W. Marshall]] at [[Sutters Mill|Sutter's Mill]] in [[Coloma, California|Coloma]] (some {{convert|50|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} northeast of the fort), a large number of gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848, Sutter Sr.'s son, [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|John Sutter Jr.]], arrived in the area to assist his father in relieving his indebtedness. Now compounding the problem of his father's indebtedness, was the additional strain placed on the Sutters by the ongoing arrival of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many quite content to squat on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands, or to abscond with various unattended Sutter properties or belongings if they could. In Sutter's case, rather than being a 'boon' for Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be more of a personal 'bane' for him.

By December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with [[Sam Brannan]], began laying out the City of Sacramento, 2 miles south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., but the father, being deeply in debt, was in no position to stop the venture. For commercial reasons, the new city was named "Sacramento City" after the [[Sacramento River]]. Sutter Jr. and Brannon hired topographical engineer William H. Warner to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.). Unfortunately, a certain bitterness grew between the elder Sutter and his son as Sacramento became an overnight commercial success (Sutter's Fort, Mill, and the town of [[Sutterville, California|Sutterville]], all founded by John Sutter Sr., would eventually fail).

The citizens of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |title=About the City of Sacramento |publisher=City of Sacramento |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123091648/http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |archive-date=November 23, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> During the early 1850s, the Sacramento valley was devastated by floods, fires and cholera epidemics. Despite this, because of its position just downstream from the [[Mother Lode]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the new city grew, quickly reaching a population of 10,000.

The [[California State Legislature]], with the support of Governor [[John Bigler]], moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], where, in 1849, the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] would be the new state's capital. After 1850, when California's statehood was ratified, the legislature met in San Jose until 1851, [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in 1852, and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] in 1853, before moving to Sacramento. In the [[California Constitutional Conventions|Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879]], Sacramento was named to be the permanent state capital.

Begun in 1860 to be reminiscent of the [[United States Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Classical Revival]] style [[California State Capitol]] was completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of massive flooding in Sacramento. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869 while construction continued. From 1862 to 1868, part of the [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park|Leland Stanford Mansion]] was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse.

With its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered and became the western end of the [[Pony Express]]. Later it became a terminus of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by "[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]"—[[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis P. Huntington]], and [[Leland Stanford]]. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers would be key elements in the economic success of the city. In fact, Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic [[Sacramento Railyards|Sacramento Rail Yards]].

In 1850 and again in [[Great Flood of 1862|1861]], Sacramento citizens were faced with a completely flooded town. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1861, had to attend his inauguration in a rowboat, which was not too far from his house in town on N Street. The flood waters were so bad, the legend says, that when he returned to his house, he had to enter into it through the second floor window. From 1862 until the mid-1870s Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets, and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. Thus the previous first floors of buildings became the [[basement]]s, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the "[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park#Old Sacramento Underground|Sacramento Underground]]".

During the 1850s the city was consolidated with the County of Sacramento.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=P_sBAAAAYAAJ&num=9  The California State register and year book of facts: for the year 1859], Henry G. Langley and Samuel A. Morison, San Francisco, 1859, p.315</ref>

The city has expanded continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of [[North Sacramento]] with Sacramento substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the [[Natomas, Sacramento, California|Natomas]] area eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Sacramento County (along with a portion of adjacent [[Placer County, California|Placer County]]) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the [[Sacramento Municipal Utility District]] (SMUD). Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=September 26, 2012|title=Endorsements: Michael Picker is best pick for SMUD Ward 5|author=Editorial Board|access-date=November 21, 2012|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/26/4855122/endorsements-michael-picker-is.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109061646/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/26/4855122/endorsements-michael-picker-is.html|archive-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> In April 1946, after 12&nbsp;years of litigation, a judge ordered [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas & Electric]] to transfer title of Sacramento's electric distribution system to SMUD.

Early in World War II, the Sacramento Assembly Center (also known as the Walerga Assembly Center) was established to house Japanese Americans [[Internment of Japanese Americans|forcibly "evacuated" from the West Coast]] under [[Executive Order 9066]]. The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 [[Japanese Americans]], two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent [[War Relocation Authority]] camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as [[Camp Kohler]].
[[File:Ford rushed from Sacramento assassination attempt image A6320-24A.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|1975 assassination attempt]] of President [[Gerald Ford]] in [[Capitol Park (Sacramento, California)|Capitol Park]].]]
After the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center. Camp Kohler was destroyed by a fire in December 1947, and the assembly center site is now part of the Foothill Farms-North Highlands subdivision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Sacramento%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |title=Sacramento (detention facility) |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810173504/http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Sacramento%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel ''Taipei Victory'' arrived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Avella|first=Steven M.|title=Sacramento: Indomitable City|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-2444-3|page=124}}</ref> The [[Nationalist Chinese]] flagship docked at the [[Port of Sacramento]], being first ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship ''Harpoon'' in 1934.

In 1967, [[Ronald Reagan]] became the last [[Governor of California]] to live permanently in the city. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: [[McClellan Air Force Base]], [[Mather Air Force Base]], and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood.

In spite of military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America. In 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, [[Theodore Kaczynski]].

After acquiring the majority stake in the [[Sacramento Kings]], the team's new owner, [[Vivek Ranadivé]] with the help of the city, agreed to build a new Arena in the downtown area. With a final estimated cost of $558.2&nbsp;million, Sacramento's [[Golden 1 Center]] opened on September 30, 2016.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city covers {{convert|100.1|sqmi|km2}}, 97.81% of it land, and 2.19% of it water.

Depth to groundwater is typically about {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}. Much of the land to the west of the city (in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]]) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the [[Yolo Bypass]]), due to the city's historical vulnerability to floods. As a result, the contiguous urban area sprawls only four miles (6&nbsp;km) west of downtown (as [[West Sacramento, California]]) but {{convert|30|mi|km}} northeast and east, into the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills, and {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the south into valley farmland.

The city is at the confluence of the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[American River]], and has a deep-water port connected to the [[San Francisco Bay]] by a channel through the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]]. It is the shipping and rail center for the [[Sacramento Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Sacramento Vacation Information {{!}} Hotels, Restaurants, Events, and Things to Do|url = http://www.visitsacramento.com/|publisher = Visit Sacramento|accessdate = November 16, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151109180143/http://www.visitsacramento.com/|archive-date = November 9, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{Sacramento, California weatherbox}}
Sacramento has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''), characterized by very hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters with occasional rainfall. The wet season is generally October through April, though there may be a day or two of light rainfall in June or September. The normal annual mean temperature is {{convert|61.0|°F|1}}, with the monthly daily average temperature ranging from {{convert|46.4|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|75.5|°F|1}} in July.<ref name="NOAA">{{cite web|url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sto|title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate = December 6, 2012 }}</ref> Summer heat is sometimes moderated by a sea breeze known as the "delta breeze" which comes through the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] from the [[San Francisco Bay]], and temperatures cool down sharply at night.
[[File:American River at Sunrise Park, June 1974 (26251615404).jpg|thumb|left|The [[American River]] is popular for [[kayaking]] and [[recreational boating]].]]
The foggiest months are December and January. [[Tule fog]] can be extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than {{convert|100|ft|sp=us}} and making driving conditions extremely hazardous. Chilling tule fog events have been known to last for several consecutive days or weeks. During Tule fog events, temperatures do not exceed {{convert|50|°F|0}}.

Snowfall is rare in Sacramento, which is only {{convert|25|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|18.52|in|sp=us}}. On average, precipitation falls on 60 days each year in Sacramento, and nearly all of this falls during the winter months. Average January rainfall is {{convert|3.67|in|abbr=on}}, and measurable precipitation is rare during the summer months. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain, resulting in an accumulation of {{convert|6.41|in|abbr=on}} for the period. On rare occasions, monsoonal moisture surges from the Desert Southwest can bring upper-level moisture to the Sacramento region, leading to increased summer cloudiness, humidity, and even light showers and thunderstorms.

The [[Sacramento metropolitan area]] is the fifth largest in California after the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the [[Inland Empire]], and the [[San Diego metropolitan area]], and is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|27th largest in the United States]].<ref name="auto"/>

[[Sutter Health]], [[Blue Diamond Growers]], [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]], [[Teichert (company)|Teichert]], and [[The McClatchy Company]] are among the companies based in Sacramento.

The [[Port of Sacramento]] has been plagued with operating losses in recent years and faces bankruptcy. This severe loss in business is due to the heavy competition from the [[Port of Stockton]], which has a larger facility and a deeper channel. As of 2006, the city of [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]] took responsibility for the Port of Sacramento. During the [[Vietnam War]] era, the Port of Sacramento was the major terminus in the supply route for all military parts, hardware and other cargo going to Southeast Asia.

[[File:Sacramento Memorial Auditorium March 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|The [[Sacramento Convention Center Complex]] hosts the [[Sacramento Ballet]] and the [[Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra]].]]
The [[Sacramento Ballet]], [[Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Sacramento Opera perform at the Community Center Theater.

There are several major theater venues in Sacramento. The [[Sacramento Convention Center Complex]] governs both the [[Community Center Theatre]] and [[Memorial Auditorium (Sacramento)|Memorial Auditorium]]. The [[H Street Theatre Complex]] consists of the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]], built in 2003 atop the old Music Circus tent foundations, the McClatchy Mainstage and the Pollock Stage, originally built as a television studio and renovated at the same time the Pavilion was built. These smaller venues seat 300 and 90, offering a more intimate presentation than the 2300-seat Pavilion. The newest venue in the city, the [[Sophia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], consists of the 365-seat Sutter Theatre for Children and the Mainstage, seating 250.

Professional theatre is represented in Sacramento by a number of companies. [[Broadway Sacramento]] and its locally produced [[Summer stock theatre]], [[Broadway at Music Circus]], lures many directors, performers, and artists from New York and Los Angeles to work alongside a large local staff at the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]]. During the fall, winter and spring seasons Broadway Sacramento brings bus and truck tours to the [[Community Center Theater]]. Resident at the [[H Street Theatre Complex]] for the remainder of the year (from September to May), the [[Sacramento Theatre Company]] prepares to celebrate its 75th season, beginning in the Fall of 2019. In addition to a traditional regional theatre fare of classical plays and musicals, the Sacramento Theatre Company has a large School of the Arts with a variety of opportunities for arts education. The [[B Street Theatre]], having completed its 2018 move into the new [[Sophia Tsokopoulos Center for the Arts|Sofia Tsakopoulos Center for the Arts]], continues its pursuit of producing smaller and more intimate professional works for families and children. Rounding out the professional companies is [[Capital Stage]], which performed aboard the Delta King until the end of the 2010–2011 season and soon took up residence at its own venue along the J-Street corridor.

The Sacramento area has one of the largest collection of community theatres in California. Some of these include the Thistle Dew Dessert Theatre and Playwrights Workshop, Davis Musical Theatre Co., El Dorado Musical Theatre, Runaway Stage Productions, River City Theatre Company, Flying Monkey Productions, The Actor's Theatre, KOLT Run Productions, Kookaburra Productions, Big Idea Theatre, Celebration Arts, Lambda Player, Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento, Synergy Stage and the historic Eagle Theatre. The [[Sacramento Shakespeare Festival]] provides entertainment under the stars every summer in William Land Park. Many of these theatres compete annually for the Elly Awards overseen by The Sacramento Area Regional Theatre Alliance or SARTA.<ref>{{Cite web|last=kimadmin|title=Theatres|url=http://sarta.com/theatres/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=SARTA|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Visual arts ===
The [[Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission]] is an organization that was established as the Sacramento [[arts council]] in 1977 to provide several arts programs for the city. These include Art in Public Places, Arts Education, Grants and Cultural Programs, Poet Laureate Program, Arts Stabilization Programs and Other Resources and opportunities.

Sacramento Second Saturday Art Walk is a program of local art galleries that stay open into the late evenings every second Saturday of each month, providing a unique experience for the local population as well as tourists to view original art and meet the artists themselves.

=== Museums ===
[[File:Crocker Museum in Sacramento Ca..JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.13|The [[Crocker Art Museum]] is the oldest public [[art museum]] in the [[Western United States]] and has one of the premier public art collections in the country.]]
Sacramento has several major museums. The [[Crocker Art Museum]] is the oldest public [[art museum]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. On July 26, 2007, the museum broke ground for an expansion that more than tripled the museum's floor space. The modern architecture is very different from the museum's original Victorian style building. Construction was completed in 2010.

Also of interest is the [[Governor's Mansion State Historic Park]], a large Victorian Mansion which was home to 13 of California's Governors, as well as the official residence for former governor [[Jerry Brown]] following renovations in 2015. The [[Leland Stanford Mansion State Historic Park]], which was completely restored in 2006, serves as the State's official address for diplomatic and business receptions. Guided public tours are available. [[The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts]], home of the [[California Hall of Fame]], is a cultural destination dedicated to telling the rich history of California and its unique influence on the world of ideas, innovation, art and culture. The museum educates tens of thousands of school children through inspiring programs, sharing with world visitors California's rich art, history and cultural legacy through dynamic exhibits, and serving as a public forum and international meeting place.

The [[California State Railroad Museum]] in Old Sacramento has historical exhibits and live steam locomotives that patrons may ride. The [[California Automobile Museum]], just south of Old Sacramento, is filled with automotive history and vehicles from 1880 to 2006 and is the oldest non-profit automotive museum in the West. The mission of it is to preserve, promote, and teach automotive culture and its influence on our lives—past, present and future. In addition, the [[Sacramento History Museum]], in the heart of Old Sacramento, focuses on the history of Sacramento from the region's pre-Gold Rush history through the present day.

There is a Museum Day held in Sacramento every year, when 26 museums in the greater Sacramento area offer free admission. The 2009 Sacramento Museum Day brought out more than 80,000 people, the largest number the event has gathered. Sacramento Museum Day is held every year on the first Saturday of February.

Each year, the city hosts the Sammies, the Sacramento Music Awards. Sacramento also has a reputation as a center for [[Dixieland]] jazz, because of the [[Sacramento Jazz Jubilee]] which is held every [[Memorial Day]] weekend. Events and performances are held in multiple locations throughout the city. Each year thousands of jazz fans from all over the world visit for this one weekend.

=== LGBTQ ===
Sacramento has one of the highest [[LGBT]] populations per capita, ranking seventh among major American cities, and third in California behind San Francisco and slightly behind Oakland, with roughly 10
% of the city's total population identifying themselves as gay, lesbian, transgender, or bisexual.<ref name="The Seattle Times" /> [[Lavender Heights, Sacramento, California|Lavender Heights]] is the hub for LGBTQ activities in the city and is a centrally located district in [[Midtown Sacramento]] centered within and around K & 20th streets. The area owes its name to the high number of gay-owned homes and businesses residing there. The area is also home to many of the city's LGBTQ inclusive music and arts festivals, including the Second Saturday Block Party from May to September.

=== Old Sacramento ===
{{Main|Old Sacramento State Historic Park}}
[[File:Central Sacramento, Sacramento, CA, USA - panoramio - Roman Eugeniusz.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park|Old Sacramento]] is a [[National Historic Landmark District]].]]
The oldest part of the town besides [[Sutter's Fort]] is [[Old Sacramento State Historic Park|Old Sacramento]], which consists of cobbled streets and many historic buildings, several from the 1850s and 1860s. Buildings have been preserved, restored or reconstructed, and the district is now a substantial tourist attraction, with rides on steam-powered historic trains and horse-drawn carriages.

The historic buildings include the Lady Adams Building, built by the passengers and ship's carpenters of the ship ''Lady Adams''.<ref name="Historic Old Sacramento Foundation 2006">Sacramento Archives and Museum Collection Center and the Historic Old Sacramento Foundation. ''Old Sacramento and Downtown''. Arcadia, 2006, 20.</ref> Having survived the Great Conflagration of November 1852, it is the oldest surviving building in Sacramento other than Sutter's Fort.<ref name="Historic Old Sacramento Foundation 2006" />

Another surviving landmark is the B.F. Hastings building, built in 1853. Early home of the California Supreme Court and the location of the office of [[Theodore Judah]], it also was the western terminus of the [[Pony Express]].<ref>Sacramento Archives and Museum Collection Center and the Historic Old Sacramento Foundation. ''Old Sacramento and Downtown''. Arcadia, 2006, 23.</ref>

The "Big Four Building", built in 1852, was home to the offices of [[Collis Huntington]], [[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Leland Stanford]], and [[Charles Crocker]]. The [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] were founded there. The original building was destroyed in 1963 for the construction of Interstate 5, but was re-created using original elements in 1965. It is now a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Also of historic interest is the [[Eagle Theatre (Sacramento, California)]], a reconstruction of California's first permanent theatre in its original location.

=== Chinatown ===
[[File:Sacramento Chinatown Mall Paifang.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.13|Historic Sacramento Chinatown [[Paifang]].]]
The [[Opium Wars]] of the 1840s and 1850s, along with the Gold Rush, brought many Chinese to California. Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as "Dà Bù" ({{zh|c=大埠 |j=daai<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>}}). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called "Yee Fow" ({{zh|links=no|c=二埠 |j=ji<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>}}). Today the city is known as "{{lang|zh-Hans|萨克拉门托}}" ({{zh|p=Sàkèlāméntuō}}) by Mainland Chinese and as "{{lang|zh-Hant|沙加緬度}}" ({{zh|links=no|p=Shājiāmiǎnduó}}) by Taiwanese.

Sacramento's [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]] was on "I" Street from Second to Sixth Streets. At the time, this area of "I" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the Chinese working class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=344958 |title=Sacramento's Chinatown – News – Local Stories – June 28, 2007 |work=Sacramento News & Review |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009230841/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=344958 |archive-date=October 9, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as [[The Sacramento Union]] wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. As the years passed, a railroad was created over parts of the Chinatown, and further policies and laws would make it even harder for Chinese workers to sustain a living in Sacramento.

While most of Sacramento's Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento's Chinatown and the contributions Chinese Americans have made to the city. Amtrak sits along what was part of Sacramento's Chinatown "I" Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yeefowmuseum.org/ |title=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum |publisher=Yee Fow Museum |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107131139/http://www.yeefowmuseum.org/ |archive-date=January 7, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/index.html |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown |publisher=Yee Fow Museum |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304082409/http://www.yeefow.com/past/index.html |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Bicycling]] is an increasingly popular transportation mode in Sacramento, which enjoys a mild climate and flat terrain. Bicycling is especially common in the older neighborhoods of Sacramento's center, such as [[Alkali Flat, Sacramento, California|Alkali Flat]], [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]], [[McKinley Park, Sacramento, California|McKinley Park]], [[Land Park]], and [[East Sacramento]]. Many employees who work downtown commute by bicycle from suburban communities on a dedicated bicycle path on the [[American River Parkway]]. Sacramento was designated as a Silver Level Bicycle Friendly Community by the [[League of American Bicyclists]] in September 2006. The advocacy organization [[Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates]] co-sponsors the Sacramento Area Council of Governments' May is Bike Month campaign.
