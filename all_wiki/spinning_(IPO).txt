'''Spinning (IPO)''' is the act or practice of an [[investment bank]] offering under-priced shares of a company's [[initial public offerings]] to the senior executives of a [[Party (law)|third party]] company in exchange for future business with the investment bank.<ref>[[Frederic Mishkin|Mishkin, Frederic]] 2010. The Economics Of Money, Banking & Financial Markets (9th ed.) p. 191. [[Addison-Wesley]]. {{ISBN|0-321-59979-9}}.</ref> This [[conflict of interest]] was a relatively common way for investment banks to attract new clients in the past, but has since been prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Those opposed to the practice liken IPO spinning to a disguised form of corporate [[bribery]] and believe that it cheats two classes of investors:

* The shareholders in the third party company who are unable to receive similar favorable IPO terms as those received by its senior executives, and that constitutes a breach of [[fiduciary duty]] to shareholders required of the company's senior executives, specifically that they not use their corporate office to extract favors that are not shared equally by all shareholders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* The [[retail]] shareholder public who are compelled to purchase large sizes of stock in an IPO at exorbitant prices from the special favored executive friends of the brokerage [[underwriting]] the IPO.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
