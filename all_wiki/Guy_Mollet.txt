'''Guy Alcide Mollet''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡi mɔlɛ}}; 31 December 1905 – 3 October 1975) was a [[France|French]] politician. He led the socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) from 1946 to 1969 and was the [[French Prime Minister]] from 1956 to 1957.

As Prime Minister, Mollet passed some significant domestic reforms and worked for [[European integration]], proposing the [[Franco-British Union]]. He became unpopular in both the left and the right in the country for his international policy, especially during the [[Suez Crisis]] and the [[Algerian War]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Flers, Orne|Flers]] in [[Normandy]], the son of a [[textile]] worker. He was educated in [[Le Havre]] and became an English teacher in [[Arras]] Grammar School.<ref name="CBD" /> Like most other teachers,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} he was an active member of the socialist [[SFIO]], joining in 1923,<ref name="CBD">{{CBD|1100}}</ref> and in 1928 he became SFIO Secretary for the [[Pas-de-Calais]] ''département''.

==World War II==
He joined the French Army in 1939 and was taken prisoner by the Germans. Released after seven months, he joined the [[French Resistance]], where he was a captain,<ref name="CBD" /> in the Arras area and was three times arrested and interrogated by the [[Gestapo]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Early political career==
In October 1945, Mollet was elected to the [[French National Assembly]] as a representative from [[Pas-de-Calais]].  In 1946, he became Secretary-General of the SFIO, standing against [[Daniel Mayer]], the candidate supported by [[Léon Blum]].  He was also Mayor of Arras at this time.<ref name="CBD" /> Mollet represented the left wing of the party, which feared the dissolution of the Socialist identity in a centrist alliance.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Although he retained [[Marxist]] terminology, he accepted the alliance with the centre and centre-right parties during the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], and his relations with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), which had become the largest left-wing party, were very poor:{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} "the Communist Party is not on the left, but in the East".

==Cabinet roles==
He served as deputy prime minister in 1946,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} in Blum's government.<ref name="CBD" />

From 1950 to 1951, he was Minister for European Relations in the government of the Radical [[René Pleven]], and in 1951, he was deputy prime minister in the government of [[Henri Queuille]].

==Europe==
Mollet supported a [[Western European Federation]].<ref name="CBD" /> He represented France at the [[Council of Europe]], and he was President of the Socialist Group on the council's Assembly.

==Socialist international==
From 1951 to 1969, he was vice-president of the [[Socialist International]].

==Premiership==
During the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative campaign]], Mollet created a centre-left coalition, the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], containing the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] of [[Pierre Mendès-France]], the [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] of [[François Mitterrand]] and the Social Gaullists of [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

The coalition won the election with a promise to re-establish the peace in [[Algeria]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As leader of the main party of the coalition, Mollet led and formed a cabinet in January 1956.

===Foreign policy===
In foreign policy, Mollet negotiated and signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], creating the [[European Economic Community]]. Liberalising reforms were carried out in various parts of the French Empire but not in Algeria. Gaston Defferre's ''[[Loi-cadre Defferre|loi-cadre]]'' of 23 June 1956 generalised universal suffrage throughout the ''territories d'outre-mer'' and based their assemblies on a single voting roll.<ref name="Larkin"/>

The government established the [[BEPTOM]] (Bureau d'études des postes et télécommunications d'outre-mer) to support communications in the newly independent former colonies.<ref name="Décret 1994">Decree #94-1142 of 22 December 1994 on [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=INDX9400145D legifrance.gouv.fr] and on [http://www.admi.net/jo/19941228/INDX9400145D.html admi.net].</ref>

====Suez Crisis====
Despite those successes, Mollet, who wanted to concentrate on domestic issues, found himself confronted with several major foreign policy crises. [[Egypt]]'s president, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], continued to support the Algerian rebels and also nationalised the [[Suez Canal]], which led to the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lahav|first=Pnina|author-link=Pnina Lahav|title=The Suez Crisis of 1956 and Its Aftermath: A Comparative Study of Constitutions, Use of Force, Diplomacy and International Relations|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1199&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=Boston University Law Review}}</ref>

The [[Anglophile]] Mollet and British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] shared a mutual concern for maintaining their overseas possessions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Lahav|first=Pnina|authorlink=Pnina Lahav|date=20 November 2015|title=The Suez Crisis of 1956 and its Aftermath: a Comparative Study of Constitutions, Use of Force, Diplomacy and International Relations|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1199&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=95}}</ref> Eden also feared that Nasser intended to cut off oil supplies to [[Europe]]. In October 1956 Mollet; Eden and the prime minister of [[Israel]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], met and colluded, in the [[Protocol of Sèvres]], in a joint attack of Egypt.

The Israelis invaded Egypt first, with British and French troops invading the northern Suez Canal area shortly afterward, under the pretext of restoring order in the area. However, the scheme met with unexpected opposition from the [[United States]], both at the [[first emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly|United Nations General Assembly]] and with economical measures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lahav|first=Pnina|author-link=Pnina Lahav|title=The Suez Crisis of 1956 and Its Aftermath: A Comparative Study of Constitutions, Use of Force, Diplomacy and International Relations|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1199&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=Boston University Law Review}}</ref> France and Britain were forced into a humiliating backdown.

Eden resigned as a result, but Mollet survived the crisis despite fierce leftist criticism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[Michael Karpin]]'s 2001 documentary ''A Bomb in the Basement'', Abel Thomas, the chief of political staff for France's defense minister in 1956, said that [[Francis Perrin]], the head of the [[French Atomic Energy Commission]], told Mollet that Israel should be provided with a nuclear bomb. According to the documentary, France provided Israel with a nuclear reactor and staff to set it up in Israel, together with enriched uranium and the means to produce plutonium, in exchange for support in the Suez War.<ref name=tel20011223>{{cite news|title=Israel reveals secrets of how it gained bomb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1366164/Israel-reveals-secrets-of-how-it-gained-bomb.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 December 2001|author=Inigo Gilmore}}</ref><ref name=fox20011102>{{cite news|title=Documentary Says Israel Got Nuclear Weapons From France|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,37959,00.html|newspaper=Fox News|date=2 November 2001|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

====Algeria====
{{further|Algerian War}}
In the post-war period, Mollet was aware of, and approved of, the fraudulent elections held in French Algeria while the Socialist [[Marcel-Edmond_Naegelen|Naegelen]] was governor-general of Algeria from 1948 to 1951.<ref>http://guy.perville.free.fr/spip/article.php3?id_article=115</ref> Like the rest of the French left, Mollet opposed [[French colonialism]] and had supported Mendès-France's efforts in office to withdraw from [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]], which were granted independence in 1956 by the ''loi-cadre Deferre''. Mollet's government was left with the issue of the three French departments of Algeria, where the presence of a million non-Muslim French residents made a simple withdrawal politically difficult.<ref name=":0" />

At first, Mollet's policy was to negotiate with the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN). Once in office, however, he changed his mind and argued that the FLN insurgents must be defeated before negotiations could begin. Mollet's visit to [[Algiers]], the capital of French Algeria, was a stormy one, with almost everyone against him. He was pelted with rotten tomatoes at a demonstration in Algiers on 6 February 1956, a few weeks after he became prime minister. The memorable event was referred to as ''la journée des tomates'' ("the day of tomatoes").{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

He poured French troops into Algeria, where they conducted a campaign of counterterrorism, including [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]], particularly during the [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] (January to October 1957). It was too much for most French people, and Mollet's government collapsed in June 1957 on the issue of the taxation to pay for the Algerian War. The Secretary of State to Foreign Affairs, [[Alain Savary]], also a SFIO member, resigned because of his opposition to Mollet's hardline stance in Algeria.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Domestic policy===
Mollet's cabinet carried out a programme of progressive social reform, which was almost unnoticed because of both the international context and the Algerian War. Substantial improvements were made in welfare provision for the sick and elderly, funding for regional aid and housing was increased<ref>A Concise History of France by Roger Price</ref> veterans' payments were extended<ref>Ideology and Politics: The Socialist Party of France by George A. Codding Jr. And William Safran</ref> and a third week of paid holidays was introduced. Mollet's government passed other pieces of social legislation during its time in office, including an increase in wages and improved medical benefits.<ref>The Course of French History by [[Pierre Goubert]]</ref>

The level and mechanism of state pensions to both the elderly and chronically-ill was improved, and working-class housing was also given close attention. [[HLM]]s were a top priority in the government's target of 320,000 houses in 1956.<ref name="Larkin">France Since The Popular Front: Government and people 1936–1996 by [[Maurice Larkin]]</ref> Educational opportunities were increased, and wage-price levels were adjusted in favour of workers and civil servants.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=The Major Governments of Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yYOAAAAQAAJ|page=274}}</ref>

In June 1956, a national solidarity fund for the elderly was set up, which provided supplementary allowances for elderly people to provide them with a more adequate income.<ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=The Social Institutions of France: Translations from the First French Edition|author1=Evans, R.|author2=Evans, P.|author3=Laroque, P.|date=1983|publisher=Gordon and Breach|isbn=9780677309705|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A0ry66D_KAC|page=632}}</ref><ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=Documents|author=Europe, C.|date=1990|publisher=Council of Europe|isbn=9789287118547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxLNvMbNfLIC|pages=2–34}}</ref> In addition, a law of December 1956 established an allowance for the mothers of household for non-salaried workers.<ref name="google4">{{cite book|title=The Social Institutions of France: Translations from the First French Edition|author1=Evans, R.|author2=Evans, P.|author3=Laroque, P.|date=1983|publisher=Gordon and Breach|isbn=9780677309705|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2A0ry66D_KAC|page=116}}</ref> Sales tax on essential commodities was abolished<ref name="google5">{{cite book|title=The National and English Review|date=1957|issue=v. 148-149|publisher=National Review Limited|issn=0952-6447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utsvAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> while regional differences in minimum wage standards across France were reduced.<ref>New York Times – 2 February 1957 edition</ref>

A decree of November 1956 abolished written homework for children until the sixth grade, thereby lightening the load on French schoolchildren; official instructions of January 1957 also specified that nursery schools should include such facilities as a medical room and a recreational room.<ref>files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED046810.pdf</ref> An act was passed in April 1957 to allow people who employed domestic help in their service to form an employers' association,<ref name="google6">{{cite book|title=Labour Law in France|author1=Michel Despax|author2=Rojot, J.|author3=Laborde, J.P.|date=2011|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041134639|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcnZ1lgBOFEC&pg=PA198|page=198}}</ref> and a law was passed for the legal status of the [[Agence France-Presse]] news agency.<ref name="google7">{{cite book|title=Media Moguls|author1=Palmer, A.L.P.P.P.M.|author2=Palmer, M.|author3=Tunstall, J.|author4=Tunstall, R.P.S.J.|date=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781134937349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XliIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73|page=73}}</ref> In addition, an act in July 1957 confirmed a 1955 decree that created a complementary procedure for mediation.<ref name="google8">{{cite book|title=Labour Law in France|author1=Michel Despax|author2=Rojot, J.|author3=Laborde, J.P.|date=2011|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041134639|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcnZ1lgBOFEC&pg=PA344|page=344}}</ref>

To encourage scientific research, a decree in March 1957 made provision for research bonuses to be awarded to research workers of the [[National Centre for Scientific Research]] and to staff of universities and technical colleges engaged in research. Under a decree in June 1956, the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|Atomic Energy Authority]] founded the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre|National Institute of Technical Nuclear Science at Saclay]]. Under an act in March 1957, a [[Institut national des sciences appliquées de Lyon|National Institute of Applied Science]] was opened in [[Lyon]]. Under a decree in November 1956, the National Institute of Nuclear Science and Techniques was authorised "to organise courses for third-cycle doctorates in metallurgy and in accelerator physics awarded by science faculties, as well as to award the necessary certificates for the obtention of these doctorates." A ministerial decision of November 1956, instituted a course in atomic engineering at the National Institute of Nuclear Science and Techniques" that was "designed to train engineers in the construction and working of nuclear reactors."

A decree in August 1956 started a national diploma in fine arts, and a ministerial decision in December 1956 started a national certificate of [[oenology]].  A decree in February 1957 founded in each faculty of arts or science, under the dean's authority, "a training institute for secondary school teachers, run by a professor" to train future teachers for secondary, teacher training, national vocational and technical schools.<ref>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001329/132931eo.pdf</ref>

Although the Mollet government introduced a broad range of reforms during its time in office, financial constraints prevented the passage of other planned reforms, such as the refunding of a higher percentage of prescription charges, extended rights for ''comités d'enterprise'' and the compulsory arbitration of works disputes.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===End of government===
Mollet's cabinet was the last government formed by the SFIO, which was in increasing decline, and it was also the last stable government of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]].

===Supporter of de Gaulle===
The [[May 1958 crisis|Algiers coup]] in May 1958, led by veterans of the [[First Indochina War]] and the Suez Crisis, brought [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power from retirement and in effect seized power. Mollet supported de Gaulle on the grounds that France needed a new constitution to allow the formation of strong governments.

De Gaulle appointed him one of four Secretaries of State in his first cabinet. That caused the creation of the PSU, the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]], formed by the PSA [[Autonomous Socialist Party (France)|Autonomous Socialist Party]] and the UGS ([[Union de la gauche socialiste]], a split of the SFIO).

==Later life==
[[File:Guy Mollet-Golda Meir-Israel Indepence Day 1959.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Guy Mollet, with his wife and [[Golda Meir]], watch Israel's Independence Day Parade in [[Tel Aviv]], 13 May 1959]]
[[File:Erich Ollenhauer-Yoseph Almogi-Guy Mollet Haifa1960.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Guy Mollet at a [[Socialist International]] meeting in [[Haifa]] in 1960, with [[Erich Ollenhauer]] (left)]]
Mollet resigned from de Gaulle's cabinet in 1959 and did not hold office again. He remained Secretary General of the SFIO, but Gaulle's new [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] made it a powerless opposition party. By the 1960s, it was in terminal decline.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

During the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential campaign]], he presented himself again as the guardian of Socialist identity, opposing the candidacy of [[Gaston Defferre]], who proposed the constitution of a "[[Third Force (France)|Great Federation]]" with the non-Gaullist centre-right. Mollet supported [[François Mitterrand]]'s candidacy and participated in the centre-left coalition [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]], which would split three years later.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His leadership over the party was being more and more challenged. He could not prevent Defferre being the SFIO candidate at the [[1969 French presidential election|1969 presidential election]].

The disastrous result (5%) induced the SFIO to merge with left-wing clubs to form the new [[French Socialist Party]]. Mollet abandoned the leadership to [[Alain Savary]]. However, the internal opposition to Savary accused Mollet of being the true party leader from the sidelines and allied with [[François Mitterrand]], who joined the party during the [[Épinay Congress]] and took the leadership in 1971.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Mollet and his followers were ejected in the minority of the party. He mocked the Socialist speeches of Mitterrand: "He is not socialist, he has learned to speak socialist".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Mollet died in Paris in 1975 of a heart attack.

==Legacy==
He is one of the most controversial of the French Socialist leaders. His name is tied up with the SFIO decline and his repressive policy in Algeria. In French political language, the word ''molletisme'' equates to duplicity, making left-wing speeches to win elections and then implementing a conservative policy. French Socialist politicians currently prefer the [[moral authority]] of [[Pierre Mendès-France]], even though he was not a member of the party.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His biography, by Denis Lefebvre, was called ''Guy Mollet: Le mal aimé'' ("Guy Mollet: The Unloved One").

==Cabinet==
The cabinet lasted from 1 February 1956 to 13 June 1957 and contained the following members:
