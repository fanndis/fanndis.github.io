'''Grant Murray Robertson''' (born 30 October 1971) is a New Zealand politician and member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] who has served as [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]] since [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020]] and [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] since [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017]]. He has served as [[New Zealand House of Representatives|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for {{NZ electorate link|Wellington Central}} since [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]].

Robertson maintained and competed for several leadership positions during the party's stint in opposition following the end of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]]. He was elected Labour's [[Deputy Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|deputy leader]] in 2011, under leader [[David Shearer]] but also contested the leadership of the party in both the [[2013 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|2013 leadership election]],<ref name="Robertson challenges">{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11114182 |title=Grant Robertson to contest leadership|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=25 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="Cunliffe wins">{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9166765/Cunliffe-wins-Labour-leadership |title=Cunliffe wins Labour leadership |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=15 September 2013 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> and [[2014 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|the 2014 leadership election]]. Subsequently, Robertson was named the party's Finance spokesperson and given a number 3 ranking in the party list. Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] appointed him to the Finance portfolio in the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Sixth Labour Government]]. 

In November 2020, Robertson was named [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]] by Jacinda Ardern. He assumed the role on 6 November.

==Early life==
Robertson was born in [[Palmerston North]], the youngest of three boys. His Presbyterian family also lived in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] before settling in [[South Dunedin]]. His father was an accountant, and his mother initially stayed at home, later becoming a teacher. In 1991, his father was imprisoned after stealing around $120,000 from the law firm he worked for.<ref name="Espiner profile">{{cite news| url= http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/politics/interview-labour-deputy-grant-robertson/ | title=Profile: Labour deputy Grant Robertson | work=[[New Zealand Listener]] | date=3 March 2012 | accessdate=26 September 2014 | authorlink=Guyon Espiner |last=Espiner |first=Guyon}}</ref> His grandfather Bob Wilkie ran unsuccessfully for Labour in the [[Wairarapa (New Zealand electorate)|Wairarapa]] electorate in {{NZ election link year|1954}} and {{NZ election link year|1957}}.<ref name="Espiner profile"/>

Robertson attended [[King's High School, Dunedin|King's High School]] in Dunedin, where he was head boy.<ref name="Espiner profile"/> He later studied [[political science|political studies]] at the [[University of Otago]], graduating with a Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |title=Concern over archives restructuring |first=John |last=Gibb |url= http://www.odt.co.nz/tags/archives-new-zealand/101423/concern-over-archives-restructuring |newspaper=Otago Daily Times |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> His honours dissertation studied the restructuring of the [[New Zealand Union of Students' Associations|New Zealand University Students' Association]] in the 1980s.<ref name="robertson 1995">{{cite web |url= http://otago.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=OTAGO_ALMA21123505480001891&displayMode=full&vid=DUNEDIN&group=GUEST&onCampus=true&lang=eng |title= 'A step to the right': the restructuring of the New Zealand University Students Association in 1986 |work=University of Otago Library catalogue |accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> Robertson served as President of the [[Otago University Students' Association]] in 1993 and as Co-President of the New Zealand University Students' Association in 1996.<ref name="Espiner profile"/><ref name="NZUSA history">{{cite web |url= http://www.students.org.nz/history |title=History |work=Students Aotearoa |publisher=New Zealand Union of Students' Associations |accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

==Professional life==
Robertson joined the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] in 1997 after leaving university. His overseas postings included the [[United Nations]] in New York. Robertson also managed the [[NZ Overseas Aid Programme]] to [[Samoa]] – a $7.7 million fund with projects in diverse areas such as basic education, healthcare, public sector capacity building, small business development and the empowerment of women.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He left MFAT in 2001.<ref name="Espiner profile"/>

Robertson returned to New Zealand during the first term of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] to work as a Ministerial advisor to Minister for the Environment [[Marian Hobbs]] and later Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]]. During his time in Clark's office, Robertson was rumoured to have the nickname "H3" during the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]] (H1 being Clark, and H2 being Clark's Chief of Staff [[Heather Simpson (civil servant)|Heather Simpson]]).<ref name="listener article">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzlistener.co.nz/issue/3573/features/12143/street_party_central.html |title=Street party central |first=Jane |last=Clifton |work=New Zealand Listener |date=1 November 2008 |access-date=22 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029044928/http://www.nzlistener.co.nz/issue/3573/features/12143/street_party_central.html |archive-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In late 2006, sitting MP for Wellington Central, [[Marian Hobbs]] announced that she would be retiring at the 2008 general election. Robertson was considered to be a front runner<ref name="Marian Hobbs retires">{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2006/12/marian_hobbs_retires.html|title=Marian Hobbs retires}}</ref> and was subsequently selected unopposed.<ref name="Grant Robertson Labour's pick for Wellington Central">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4278229a6160.html |title=Grant Robertson Labour's pick for Wellington Central |publisher=Stuff |accessdate=2010-05-06}}</ref> Robertson ran a well-staffed campaign, based on local issues like the closure of the Crossways Community Centre and threats to the Public Service. He was also involved in the formation of a Wellington inner-city residents' association.<ref name="grant in the media">{{cite web|url=http://www.grantrobertson.co.nz/about/grant-in-the-media/|title=Grant Robertson in the Media|access-date=22 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207171607/http://www.grantrobertson.co.nz/about/grant-in-the-media/|archive-date=7 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 1 September 2008, the Labour Party published its list for the 2008 general election and ranked Robertson at number 46.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0808/S00518.htm|title=Labour Party list for 2008 election announced|publisher=Scoop NZ|date=22 November 2008|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

In the Wellington Central electorate, Robertson defeated National candidate [[Stephen Franks]] by 1,904 votes.<ref name="results_2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2008/electorate-59.html|title= Elections NZ 2008: Official Count Results – Wellington Central}}</ref> Robertson's plurality, although far less than the 6,180 vote difference held by his predecessor from the previous election,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2005/electorate-58.html |title=Official Count Results – Wellington Central |publisher=Electionresults.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> reflected a large swing in party votes to the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] from Labour in the electorate and Robertson's status as a non-incumbent candidate.

===First term in Parliament: 2008–2011===
Helen Clark's government was defeated at the 2008 election. Robertson was appointed as the opposition's spokesperson for State Services, and associate spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage and Foreign Affairs by new Labour leader [[Phil Goff]].<ref name="labour shadow cabinet">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4767140a28435.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225120056/http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4767140a28435.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-12-25 |title=Five newcomers to Labour's frontbench }}</ref>

On 15 June 2010, Opposition Leader Phil Goff appointed Robertson to be Portfolio Spokesperson for Tertiary Education and the 20th-ranked Labour MP, the highest of the 2008 intake of Labour MPs to be promoted at that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3811449/Fresh-look-for-Labours-shadow-Cabinet|title=Fresh look for Labour's shadow Cabinet|publisher=stuff.co.nz|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> In the election year reshuffle, on 2 February 2011, Robertson was further promoted to the front bench to take the Health portfolio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1102/S00048/labour-caucus-2011.htm |title=Labour Caucus – 2011 |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Commenting on the promotion, Phil Goff said that Robertson has "made a very strong impact in a very short time" and that he "has a promising future ahead of him."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1102/S00045/labour-leader-reveals-new-caucus-line-up.htm |title=Labour Leader reveals new caucus line-up |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref>

At the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], Robertson re-contested Wellington Central against eleven other candidates. He subsequently was re-elected with 49.2 percent of the electorate vote, increasing his majority to 6,376 over National Party candidate [[Paul Foster-Bell]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/electorate-59.html |title= Wellington Central results, 2011 |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 10 December 2011 |accessdate= 29 April 2012}}</ref> However, the National Government was returned.

===Second term: 2011–2014===
[[File:Grant Robertson (10147870444).jpg|thumbnail|Robertson speaking to a rally opposing the National Government's changes to University Councils, at the University of Otago, October 2013]]
Following the election and Annette King's resignation as Labour deputy leader, Robertson was [[2011 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|elected]] by the Labour caucus as the new deputy leader under [[David Shearer]]. In Shearer's shadow Cabinet, Robertson also served as Spokesperson for Employment, Skills and Training, and Arts, Culture and Heritage. Following Shearer's resignation from the leadership in 2013, Robertson contested the party-wide [[2013 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]]. Although Robertson achieved the plurality support from his colleagues in Caucus, [[David Cunliffe]] garnered more support from party members and affiliates to win the overall vote.<ref name="Cunliffe wins"/>  Under Cunliffe's leadership, Robertson was the third-ranked Labour MP and held various portfolios including Spokesperson for Economic Development and Shadow Leader of the House.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Cunliffe|date=6 May 2014|title=Fresh look for the incoming Government|url=https://www.labour.org.nz/media/fresh-look-incoming-government|accessdate=6 May 2014|publisher=Labour.org.nz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Vernon Small|date=6 May 2014|title=Hipkins drops in Labour reshuffle|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10011887/Hipkins-drops-in-Labour-reshuffle|accessdate=6 May 2014|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref>

Throughout 2014, Robertson was critical of National Party minister [[Judith Collins]], after she was accused of having a conflict of interest in regards to her visiting the dairy products company Oravida in China. He repeatedly called for her to resign during the Oravida saga, and when Collins later released information to the media about One News journalist Katie Bradford, he reiterated his call for her to resign, claiming she had "lost all perspective".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/judith-collins-has-lost-all-perspective-robertson-5948235 | title=Judith Collins has 'lost all perspective' – Robertson | work=TVNZ | date=5 May 2014 | accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>

===Third term: 2014–2017===
Robertson was re-elected in the Wellington Central electorate in the [[2014 New Zealand general election|September 2014 general election]]. The Labour Party performed poorly and leader David Cunliffe immediately came under pressure to resign. He was seen by some in the party as taking insufficient blame for the defeat. The leading challengers for the leadership were Robertson and David Shearer. Media reports suggest that some of the Labour caucus were trying to get Cunliffe to resign so Robertson and [[Jacinda Ardern]] could replace the current leadership unopposed.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/255570/labour-leader-weighing-up-his-future | title=Labour leader weighing up his future | work=Radio New Zealand | date=26 September 2014 | accessdate=26 September 2014 | author=Banas, Liz | location=Wellington}}</ref> On 26 September, the voting record in the previous leadership race of unions affiliated to Labour was released, showing Cunliffe had won very strong union support in the previous race, and highlighting the challenge for Robertson's bid.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10548216/Does-Grant-Robertson-have-the-numbers | title=Does Grant Robertson have the numbers? | work=Stuff | date=26 September 2014 | accessdate=26 September 2014 | author=Rutherford, Hamish}}</ref>

On 28 September, after Cunliffe had signalled his intention to resign, Robertson put his name forward to run for the Labour Party leadership. Robertson pointed to Labour's poor performance in the election as leading him to run: "I couldn't stand by and see the party poll at 24 per cent and not do something now that David's triggered the contest. That's why I've put my name forward." He also argued that the Labour Party needed unity, and he would be a unifying figure, with the support of most of the Labour caucus. Because there were four candidates for the leadership, the Labour Party held a [[2014 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10554296/Labour-out-of-options-Robertson-says | title=Labour out of options, Robertson says | work=Stuff |publisher=Fairfax | date=28 September 2014 | accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

Robertson lost the leadership election to [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] by a small margin, Little receiving 50.52 per cent of the vote to Robertson's 49.48 per cent (after the votes from the other unsuccessful candidates had been reallocated) despite Robertson once again winning the support of most of the caucus, as well as a majority of the membership. After the results were announced, Robertson said he would not seek the Labour Party leadership again in the future.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63305825/Andrew-Little-new-Labour-Party-leader-by-a-whisker | title=Andrew Little new Labour Party leader – by a whisker | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=18 November 2014 | accessdate=19 November 2014 |author1=Small, Vernon  |author2=Gulliver, Aimee}}</ref>

[[File:Grant Robertson 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Robertson at [[Government House, Wellington]], in 2015]]
In Andrew Little's shadow cabinet reshuffle of November 2014, Robertson received the Finance portfolio, and was ranked number 3 on the Labour list.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11363521 | title=Winners, losers in Labour reshuffle | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=24 November 2014 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Davidson, Isaac}}</ref>

As part of his Finance portfolio, he was engaged in researching international economic policy, and was also responsible for the Labour Party's "Future of Work Commission."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futureofwork.nz|title=Future of Work Commission|publisher=NZ Labour Party}}</ref> His aims for the portfolio were to cut down on the number of policies, and "humanise" the policy.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11442658 | title=Battling Bill: Grant Robertson's big job – creating an economic policy | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=4 May 2015 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Young, Audrey}}</ref>

===Fourth term: 2017–2020===
Robertson was elected as a Cabinet Minister by the Labour Party caucus following Labour's formation of a government with [[New Zealand First]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/342022/video-who-s-in-who-s-out|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Who's in?

As Finance Minister, Robertson has been a close confidante of Ardern. During the New Zealand government's COVID-19 lockdown response, Robertson would sometimes deputise for Ardern at her daily press conferences. Their close working relationship has led some commentators to describe him as her "de facto political deputy," over Labour Party deputy leader [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-19|title=Election 2020: Why Kelvin Davis will probably be the next deputy prime minister|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/123133786/election-2020-why-kelvin-davis-will-probably-be-the-next-deputy-prime-minister|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Election 2020: Audrey Young - the awkward problem Labour could have over Deputy Prime Minister|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-2020-audrey-young-the-awkward-problem-labour-could-have-over-deputy-prime-minister/VK5USKZAGUPFAGPOT2YMPC6GGU/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=NZ Herald|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

=== Fifth term and Deputy Prime Minister: 2020–present ===
Robertson was re-elected for a fifth term as Wellington Central MP at the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]], at which the Labour Party won an outright majority.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Campbell|first=Georgina|title=Election results 2020: Candidates in Wellington's hottest race, Hutt South, front|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-results-2020-candidates-in-wellingtons-hottest-race-hutt-south-front/TEWWH5AHRQDBPQT5TDSOVETHC4/|access-date=2020-10-28|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|language=en-NZ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031011313/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-results-2020-candidates-in-wellingtons-hottest-race-hutt-south-front/TEWWH5AHRQDBPQT5TDSOVETHC4/|archive-date=31 October 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Robertson retained [[Wellington Central (New Zealand electorate)|Wellington Central]] by a margin of 18,878 votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wellington Central - Official Result |url=https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020/electorate-details-60.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=13 November 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

He was appointed to be the next [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]] in a cabinet reshuffle announced on 2 November. In addition, Robertson retained his portfolios as Minister of Finance and Minister for Sport and Recreation, while picking up the ministerial portfolios for Infrastructure and Racing.
He became Deputy Prime Minister after Deputy Labour Leader Kelvin Davis declined the position.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-11-02|title=Grant Robertson new Deputy Prime Minister as Jacinda Ardern reshapes Cabinet for new Government|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300147692/grant-robertson-new-deputy-prime-minister-as-jacinda-ardern-reshapes-cabinet-for-new-government|access-date=2020-11-02|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102082713/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300147692/grant-robertson-new-deputy-prime-minister-as-jacinda-ardern-reshapes-cabinet-for-new-government|archive-date=2 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ministerial List for Announcement on Monday |url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-11/ministerial-list-2-nov-2020.pdf |publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] |accessdate=4 November 2020 |date=2 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103122141/https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-11/ministerial-list-2-nov-2020.pdf|archive-date=3 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The previous Deputy Prime Minister was New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters who had lost his seat in the recent election.

Robertson, himself a former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, becoming Deputy Prime Minister makes it unusual that the position is held by someone who was neither the current deputy leader of the senior coalition party or in this case the only governing party nor the leader of a coalition partner.

==Personal life==
Robertson lives in Northland, [[Wellington]], with his partner Alf, whom he met through playing rugby together for the Wellington-based Krazy Knights, New Zealand's first gay rugby team.<ref name="Maiden Statement" /> After 10 years in a relationship, they held a civil union ceremony in January 2009.<ref name="civil union">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/790029|title=No 8 and halfback tie the knot}}</ref>

In his maiden statement (given on 9 December 2008), Robertson alluded to his sexuality as a part, but not the whole, of his identity:

{{cquote|I am proud and comfortable with who I am. Being gay is part of who I am, just as is being a former diplomat, a fan of the mighty ... Wellington Lions, and a fan of New Zealand music and New Zealand literature. My political view is defined by my sexuality only inasmuch as it has given me an insight into how people can be marginalised and discriminated against, and how much I abhor that. I am lucky that I have largely grown up in a generation that is not fixated on issues such as sexual orientation. I am not—and neither should others be.<ref name="Maiden Statement">{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/49HansS_20081211_00000878/robertson-grant-maiden-statements|title=Robertson, Grant: Maiden Statements}}</ref><ref name="Dominion Post - MP stands up for bureaucrats">{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4790079a6160.html|title=MP stands up for bureaucrats |work=The Dominion Post|date=11 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="DGay NZ:New gay MPs debut in Parliament (Media article)">{{cite news|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/32/article_6895.php|title=New gay MPs debut in Parliament|work=gaynz.com|access-date=25 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414235206/http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/32/article_6895.php|archive-date=14 April 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}

In a 2012 interview with [[Guyon Espiner]], he hit out at the suggestion that being gay could prevent him from understanding the concerns of ordinary New Zealanders:

{{cquote|That’s one of the things that irritates me the most. How can you say that? That someone won’t understand New Zealanders because they’re gay. I understand all sorts of things about being a New Zealander. I understand what happens when your dad goes to prison. I understand what it’s like when the All Blacks lose. You know? I understand what it’s like when you’re trying to work out if you’ve got enough money to do [renovation] to the house? It’s bullshit.<ref name="Espiner profile"/>}}
