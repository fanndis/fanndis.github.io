The '''Good Girl Gone Bad Tour''' was the second overall and first world [[concert tour]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], in support of her third studio album  ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]''. The setlist was composed of songs mostly from ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' but also included some songs from her first two albums. [[Akon]] was selected as the opening act for the Canadian dates of the North American leg, while [[Ciara]] and [[David Jordan (singer)|David Jordan]] supported the UK dates of the European leg. [[Chris Brown]] joined the tour during the Oceanian leg.

The show featured Rihanna wearing revealing leather costumes during each show. Many changes were made to the set list throughout the tour. The original set list features a cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Is This Love (Bob Marley & The Wailers song)|Is This Love]]" and during the European leg of the tour, the set list was shortened to fifteen songs. In the third set list of the Oceanian and Asian leg, the show ended with an encore. A DVD of the [[Manchester]] concert at the [[Manchester Arena]] titled ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad Live]]'' was released on June 17, 2008.

During the Australia leg of the tour the stage also featured a small rising platform at the front center of the stage. For "Disturbia" she started high in the air on the platform, and rose on it again during "Unfaithful".
