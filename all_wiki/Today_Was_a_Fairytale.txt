"'''Today Was a Fairytale'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Produced by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], it was released on January 19, 2010 by [[Big Machine Records]] as a single from the corresponding [[Valentine's Day (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the 2010 film ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]'', which she acted in. Swift had previously written the song and offered it to producers for the film's soundtrack. Musically, "Today Was a Fairytale" is [[country pop]]-influenced and, lyrically, speaks of a magical date.

It received generally positive reception from contemporary critics, some who deemed it the best song on the soundtrack, and enjoyed commercial success by reaching the top ten in three countries. In Canada, "Today Was a Fairytale" became Swift's first number-one song. The song debuted and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Swift promoted "Today Was a Fairytale" at several venues and included it on a revised set list for the continuation of her [[Fearless Tour]] in 2010.

==Background==
Swift solely penned "Today Was a Fairytale" in the summer of 2008 and stored it away for a while.<ref name="tennessean">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/01/21/taylor-swift-earns-swift-success-with-today-was-a-fairytale/|title=Taylor Swift earns swift success with 'Today Was A Fairytale'|last=Cooper|first=Peter|date=January 21, 2010|work=[[The Tennessean]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105010638/http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/01/21/taylor-swift-earns-swift-success-with-today-was-a-fairytale/|archive-date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> After being cast as Felicia Miller on ''Valentine's Day'', Swift offered the song to the film producers for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her [[Speak Now|upcoming album]]. "When this movie opportunity came about, I reached back into my pocket and thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told ''[[The Tennessean]]''.<ref name="tennessean" /> "Today Was a Fairytale" was released as a single from the ''Valentine's Day'' soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the [[iTunes Store]].<ref name="Today Was a Fairytale - Single">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/today-was-a-fairytale-single/id350563351|title=Today Was a Fairytale - Single|work=[[iTunes Store]] (AUS)|publisher=[[Apple, Inc]]|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> The single was re-released on February 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/today-was-a-fairytale-single/id417966403|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221141426/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/today-was-a-fairytale-single/id417966403|title=Today Was a Fairytale – Single by Taylor Swift|publisher=iTunes Store (US).

"Taylor's vowels have gotten flattened and Yankee-ified," commented Rosen, though Weiner pointed out that Swift's pop-heavy music was the primary reason for her success.<ref name="slate">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/browbeat/archive/2010/01/28/track-of-the-week-taylor-swift-today-was-a-fairytale.aspx|title=Track of the Week: Taylor Swift, "Today Was a Fairytale"|first=Jonah|last=Weiner|author2=Jody Rosen |date=January 28, 2010|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> Melanie Bertoldi of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' believed Swift's vocals displayed a newfound maturity.<ref name="billboardr">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069774/taylor-swift-today-was-a-fairytale|title=Taylor Swift, "Today Was a Fairytale"|first=Melanie|last=Bertoldi|date=February 5, 2010|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> There are two different versions of the song's intro: the first one having much more electronic production while the second one is only accompanied by an acoustic guitar.

==Critical reception==

The song received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. Melanie Bertoldi of ''Billboard'' compared the song's lyrics to those of Swift's previous singles "[[You Belong with Me]]" and "[[Fifteen (song)|Fifteen]]"; she was convinced that "Today Was a Fairytale" would "help [Swift] reach an even broader audience."<ref name="billboardr" /> Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' did not see a departure from Swift, recalling lyrics to be familiar of those of "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]" and "You Belong with Me". However, she ended with "What do we know?
