=== 20th century ===
The School joined the federal [[University of London]] in 1900, and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences.<ref name="LSEHistory1895" /> Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by [[George V|King George V]] in 1920;<ref name="LSEHistoryAbout" /> the building was opened in 1922.<ref name="LSEHistory1895" />

[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[Friedrich Hayek]], who taught at LSE during the 1930s and 1940s]]
The 1930s economic debate between LSE and Cambridge is well known in academic circles. Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's [[Edwin Cannan]] (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, [[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)<ref>Dahrendorf (1995), p.210-213</ref>

The dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser.<ref>Gerard Loot, cited in Dahrendorf (1995), P.212</ref> Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/41/1/307/2625390/The-London-and-Cambridge-Economic-Service-history?redirectedFrom=fulltext|title=The London and Cambridge Economic Service: history and contributions|author=Robert A. Cord|doi=10.1093/cje/bew020|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |date=2016|volume= 41|issue=1|pages=307–326}}</ref> However, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=CambDebate>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/embed/index.html?source=0Ah9w-9lcqZALdHdTbmF2MS1iYmtVdmlpX3A5N2VPc0E&font=Georgia-Helvetica&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&amp%20-%200#33|title=Debate with Cambridge|work=LSE timeline 1895–1995|accessdate=17 January 2017}}</ref>

The main figures in this debate were [[John Maynard Keynes]] from Cambridge and the LSE's [[Friedrich Hayek]]. The LSE Economist [[Lionel Robbins]] was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as [[Keynesian economics]], involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the [[Austrian School]], which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.<ref name=CambDebate/>

During World War II, the School decamped from London to the [[University of Cambridge]], occupying buildings belonging to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg |title=Peterhouse Images |publisher=Peterhouse, Cambridge |accessdate=23 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001601/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album%2Fhostel%2Fhostel_03.jpg |archive-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

LSE continues to have a wide impact within British society, through its relationships and influence in politics, business and law. ''[[The Guardian]]'' described such influence in 2005 when it stated:
<blockquote>Once again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers.... The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], was a former LSE professor. The former chairman of the House of Commons education committee, [[Barry Sheerman]], sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer [[Frank Judd, Baron Judd|Lord (Frank) Judd]]. Also on the board are Tory MPs [[Virginia Bottomley]] and [[Richard Shepherd]], as well as [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Lord Saatchi]] and [[Elspeth Howe, Baroness Howe of Idlicote|Lady Howe]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/columnist/story/0,,1515788,00.html |title=A Time Honoured Tradition a|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=27 June 2005 | accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Commenting in 2001 on the rising status of the LSE, the British magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that "two decades ago the LSE was still the poor relation of the University of London's other colleges. Now... it regularly follows Oxford and Cambridge in league tables of research output and teaching quality and is at least as well-known abroad as Oxbridge". According to the magazine, the School "owes its success to the single-minded, American-style exploitation of its brand name and political connections by the recent directors, particularly Mr [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] and his predecessor, [[John Ashworth (biologist)|John Ashworth]]" and raises money from foreign students' high fees, which are attracted by academic stars such as [[Richard Sennett]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/687641 |title=The brain trade |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=5 July 2001 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>

==== ''The World Turned Upside Down'' ====
[[File:The World Turned Upside Down (sculpture by Mark Wallinger).jpg|thumb|upright|''The World Turned Upside Down''. The island of Taiwan is coloured differently from mainland China]]

A sculpture by [[Mark Wallinger]], ''[[The World Turned Upside Down (sculpture)|The World Turned Upside Down]]'', which features a globe resting on its north pole, was installed in Sheffield Street on the LSE campus on 26 March 2019.

==Campus and estate==
[[File:LSE main entrance.jpg|thumb|Old Building|left]]
[[File:Centre Building, LSE from LSE Square.jpg|thumb|Centre Building, opened in 2019]]
Since 1902, LSE has been based at [[Clare Market]] and Houghton Street in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]]. It is surrounded by a number of important institutions including the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], all four [[Inns of Court]]s, [[Royal College of Surgeons]], [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], and the [[West End of London|West End]] is immediately across [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] from campus, which also borders the [[City of London]] and is within walking distance to [[Trafalgar Square]] and the [[Houses of Parliament]].

[[File:The Land Registry Offices, Lincoln Inn Fields.jpg|thumb|[[32 Lincoln's Inn Fields]] houses the Department of Economics and the [[International Growth Centre]]]]
In 1920, [[George V|King George V]] laid the foundation of the Old Building. The campus now occupies an almost continuous group of around 30 buildings between [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] and the [[Aldwych]]. Alongside teaching and academic space, the institution also owns 11 student halls of residence across London, a West End theatre (the [[Peacock Theatre|Peacock]]), early years centre, [[National Health Service|NHS]] medical centre and extensive sports ground in Berrylands, south London. LSE operates the George IV public house<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/services/catering/outlets|title=Restaurants and cafes on campus|website=info.lse.ac.uk|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> and the students' union operates the Three Tuns bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/estates-division/facilities-guide/food-and-drink|title= Food and drink |website=info.lse.ac.uk|accessdate=22 April 2020}} {{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The School's campus is noted for its numerous public art installations which include [[Richard Wilson (sculptor)|Richard Wilson]]'s ''Square the Block'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/09/RichardWilson.aspx|title=LSE unveils new Richard Wilson sculpture, Square the Block|accessdate=8 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> Michael Brown's ''Blue Rain'',<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2009/08/Bluerain.aspx|title=Blue Rain at LSE|accessdate=8 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> [[Christopher Le Brun]]'s ''Desert Window''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/faithCentre/desertWindow.aspx|title=Faith Centre – Desert Window|accessdate=17 October 2015|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref>

Since the early 2000s, the entire campus has undergone an extensive refurbishment project and a major fund-raising "Campaign for LSE" raised over £100 million in what was one of the largest university fund-raising exercises outside North America.  This process was begun with the £35 million renovation of the Lionel Robbins Building by [[Norman Foster|Sir Norman Foster]] to house the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]] (BLPES), the world's largest social science library and the second largest single entity library in Britain, after the British Library at King's Cross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/guides/VisitorsLibraryGuide.pdf |title=Visitors' Library Guide |publisher=London School of Economics |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref>

[[File:NABuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The New Academic Building houses the Departments of Management and Law]]
In 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway, and engaged [[Nicholas Grimshaw|Sir Nicholas Grimshaw]] to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over £45&nbsp;million – increasing the size of the campus by {{convert|120000|sqft|m2}}. The New Academic Building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty the Queen]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on 5 November 2008.<ref name="New Academic Building">{{cite web| url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/estatesDivision/lseEstate/campusBuildings/newAcademicBuilding/Home.aspx|title=New Academic Building|accessdate=24 August 2012|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref> In November 2009 the School purchased the adjacent Sardinia House to house three academic departments and the nearby Old White Horse public house, before acquiring the freehold of the grade-II listed [[HM Land Registry|Land Registry Building]] at [[32 Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in October 2010, which was reopened in March 2013 by [[The Princess Royal]] as the new home for the Department of Economics, [[International Growth Centre]] and its associated economic research centres.

===Saw Swee Hock Student Centre===
The first new building on the site for more than 40 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre opened in January 2014 following an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]].

===Expansion===
[[File:View of LSE from NAB.jpg|thumb|LSE Campus as viewed from the terrace of the New Academic Building in January 2018, showing the Centre Buildings redevelopment and the demolition of 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields]]
It is currently embarking on redevelopment and expansion with the development of a £120 million new facility designed by [[Richard Rogers|Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners]] following the completion of a global design competition managed by [[RIBA Competitions]]. Completed in 2018, the Global Centre for the Social Sciences houses the Departments of Government, International Relations and the European Institute and feature a new square at the centre of the campus.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2013/11/-Rogers-Stirk-Harbour--Partners-selected-to-design-LSEs-New-Global-Centre-for-the-Social-Sciences-.aspx|title=Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners selected to design LSE's New Global Centre for the Social Sciences|accessdate=8 December 2013|publisher=London School of Economics}}</ref>

==Organisation and administration==

===Governance===
Although LSE is a constituent college of the federal University of London, it is in many ways comparable with free-standing, self-governing and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degrees.

LSE is incorporated under the [[Companies Act]] as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the [[Charities Act 1993]].<ref name=annrep>{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/financeDivision/pdf/2011AnnualAccounts.pdf|title=Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 July 2011|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref> The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the Academic Board; and the Director and Director's Management Team.<ref name=annrep/>

The LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the school. It has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including: the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; "educational character and mission", and student experience. The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees that report directly to it.<ref name=annrep/>

The Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activities. The court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of court, its subcommittees and of the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the School; the amendment of the Memorandum and Articles of Association; and the appointment of external auditors.<ref name=annrep/>

The Academic Board is LSE's principal academic body, and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the School and its development. It is chaired by the director, with staff and student membership, and is supported by its own structure of committees. The Vice Chair of the Academic Board serves as a non-director member of the council and makes a termly report to the council.<ref name=annrep/>

The director is the head of LSE and its chief executive officer, responsible for executive management and leadership on academic issues. The director reports to and is accountable to the council. The director is also the accountable officer for the purposes of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] Financial Memorandum. The LSE's current director is [[Minouche Shafik|Dame Nemat Shafik]], who replaced interim director, Professor [[Julia Black]], on 1 September 2017.

The director is supported by a deputy director and provost who oversees the heads of academic departments and institutes, three pro-directors each with designated portfolios (teaching and learning, research and planning and resources) and the School secretary who acts as company secretary.

The [[Times Higher Education]] Pay Survey 2017 revealed that, among larger, non-specialist institutions, LSE professors and academics were the highest paid in the UK, with average incomes of £103,886 and £65,177 respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/times-higher-education-pay-survey-2017|title= Times Higher Education Pay Survey 2017|date=4 May 2017|author=Simon Baker|work=Times Higher Education}}</ref>

====Endowment====

The London School of Economics (LSE) is aiming to increase the size of its endowment fund to more than £1bn, which would make it one of the best resourced institutions in the UK and the world. The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of Governors. The plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaign. The plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than £1bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/83554b84-a8a9-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=LSE looks to boost endowment fund to £1bn |website=Financial Times |date=4 January 2016 |accessdate=21 August 2017}}</ref> The LSE has stated that currently "limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students".<ref name="financial statement 2016"/>

===Academic year===
LSE continues to adopt a three-term structure and has not moved to semesters. [[Michaelmas Term]] runs from October to mid-December, [[Lent Term]] from mid-January to late March and Summer Term from late April to mid-June.  Certain departments operate reading weeks in early November and mid-February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/diaryAndEvents/termDates/Home.aspx |title=Term dates – Term dates – Diary and events – Staff and students – Home |website=Lse.ac.uk |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>

===Logo, arms and mascot===
[[File:LSE_Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|LSE's "red block" logo]]
The school's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto – ''rerum cognoscere causas'', a line taken from [[Virgil]]’s ''[[Georgics]]'' meaning "to know the causes of things", together with the school's mascot – a beaver. Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as "a hard working and industrious yet sociable animal", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/studentsatlse/2012/10/25/guest-blog-the-lse-beaver/ |title=Guest Blog: The LSE Beaver &#124; Students@LSE |website=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> The school's weekly newspaper is still entitled ''The Beaver'', Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsesu.com/activities/sports/clubs/7708/ |title=Basketball – Men's |website=Lsesu.com |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> The institution has two sets of colours – brand and academic – red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and purple, black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress.

LSE's present 'red block' logo was adopted as part of a rebrand in the early 2000s, before which the school's coat of arms was used exclusively to represent the institution. As a trademarked brand, it is carefully protected but can be produced in various forms to reflect different requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/policies/pdfs/school/guiHouSty.pdf |title=GUIDANCE ON LSE HOUSE STYLE AND BEST COMMUNICATIONS PRACTICE |website=Lse.ac.uk |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>  In its full form it contains the full name of the institution to the right of the block with a further small empty red square at the end, but it is adapted for each academic department or professional service division to provide a cohesive brand across the institution.

Its collections are recognised for their outstanding national and international status and hold 'Designation' status by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA). BLPES responds to around 7,500 visits from students and staff each day. In addition, it provides a specialist international research collection, serving over 12,000 registered external users each year.

The Shaw Library, housed in LSE's Founders Room in the Old Building contains the School's collection of fiction and general readings.  It also hosts a weekly series of lunchtime music concerts and press launches and is the home of the [[Fabian Window]] which was unveiled by [[Tony Blair]] in 2003.

In 2013, LSE purchased the [[Women's Library]], Britain's main library and museum resource on women and the women's movement and a UNESCO classified resource from [[London Metropolitan University]], moving the resources and artefacts into a new purpose-built facility within the Lionel Robbins Building complete with its own reading room and exhibition space. Several subject specific libraries also exist including the Seligman Library for Anthropology, the Himmelweit Library for Social Psychology, the Leverhulme Library for Statistics, the Robert McKenzie library for Sociology, the Michael Wise Library for Geography and the Gender Institute Library. Additionally, students are permitted to use the libraries of any other University of London college, and the extensive facilities at [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] Library, off [[Russell Square]].

Disparities between national and international league tables have caused LSE to offer public explanations for the difference, including the statement in 2012: 
:''"At mid-2012, LSE has seen pleasing improvements over the last couple of years in our standing in all the main global rankings: those produced by Times Higher Education, QS and Shanghai Jiaotong University [the Academic Ranking of World Universities]. We have also seen good rises in the domestic UK rankings. But we remain concerned that all of the global rankings – by some way the most important for us, given our highly international orientation – suffer from inbuilt biases in favour of large multi-faculty universities with full STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) offerings, and against small, specialist, mainly non-STEM universities such as LSE."<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055639/http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/leagueTables/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx|archive-date=4 March 2016|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/leagueTables/LSEinUniversityLeagueTables.aspx | title= LSE in university league tables  | accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>''

It is self-catering, accommodating 447 students in flats of four our five bedrooms with shared facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/lifeAtLSE/accommodation/forStudents/residentialHalls/highHolborn/highHolbornHomePage.aspx|title=High Holborn Residence|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref> Other accommodation is located in the surrounding area – Butler's Wharf is situated next to [[Tower Bridge]], Rosebery Hall is located in the [[London Borough of Islington]] close to [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], and Carr-Saunders Hall, named after the LSE professor, is approximately 5&nbsp;minutes from [[Telecom Tower]] in the heart of [[Fitzrovia]].

Since 2005, the school has opened three new residences to provide accommodation for all first-year students. Lilian Knowles, independently operated in [[Spitalfields]], is home for approximately 360 students and opened in 2006.  It is located in a converted Victorian night refuge; the remnants of which can still be seen on the outside facade.  It is a common stop on [[Jack the Ripper]] tours as one of his victims is commonly believed to have been a one-time resident. Planning permission was sought to convert the Grade II listed Northumberland House, on [[Northumberland Avenue]] into a new residence in June 2005, and the accommodation opened to students in October 2006. It was formerly a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] grand hotel and lately government offices.

The closest residence to the Aldwych campus is reserved for postgraduate students and is located on the eastern side of [[Drury Lane]] at the crossroads of [[Great Queen Street]] and [[Long Acre (street)|Long Acre]]. Grosvenor House, converted from a Victorian office building, opened in September 2005. The residence is unique in that all of its 169 rooms are small, self-contained studios, with private toilet and shower facilities and a mini-kitchen.
