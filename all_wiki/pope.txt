{{Main|History of the papacy}}

===Title and etymology===
The word ''pope'' derives from Greek {{lang|el|πάππας}} ({{transl|el|páppas}}), meaning 'father'. In the early centuries of [[Christianity]], this title was applied, especially in the east, to all bishops<ref name=ODCC:Pope>{{citation |title=Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3 |contribution=Pope}}</ref> and other senior clergy, and later became reserved in the west to the bishop of Rome, a reservation made official only in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Elwell+%22term+pappa%22 |first=Walter A. |last=Elwell|title=''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'' |publisher=Baker Academic|year= 2001|isbn= 9780801020759|page=888|access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Greer+Lewis+%22any+bishop+or%22 |first=Thomas H.|last= Greer|author2=Gavin Lewis|title=A Brief History of the Western World|publisher=Cengage Learning|year= 2004|isbn=9780534642365|page=172  |access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Mazza+%22synonymous+with+bishop%22 |first=Enrico|last= Mazza|title=The Eucharistic Prayers of the Roman Rite|publisher=Liturgical Press|year= 2004|isbn=9780814660782|page=63 |access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=O%27Malley+%22term+was+applied+to+all+bishops%22 |first=John W.|last= O'Malley|title=A History of the Popes|publisher=Government Institutes|year= 2009|isbn= 9781580512275| page=xv|access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Schatz+%22number+of+individual+bishops%22 |first=Klaus|last= Schatz|title=Papal Primacy|publisher=Liturgical Press|year= 1996|isbn=9780814655221|pages=28–29|access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref> The earliest record of the use of this title was in regard to the by then deceased [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria]] (232–248).<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' Book VII, chapter 7.4</ref> The earliest recorded use of the title "pope" in English dates to the mid-10th century, when it was used in reference to the 7th century Roman [[Pope Vitalian]] in an Old English translation of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''.<ref>"pope, n.1".

===Position within the Church===
The Catholic Church teaches that the pastoral office, the office of [[Shepherd#In religion|shepherding]] the Church, that was held by the apostles, as a group or "college" with [[Saint Peter]] as their head, is now held by their successors, the bishops, with the bishop of Rome (the pope) as their head.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – Christ's Faithful – Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life}}</ref> Thus, is derived another title by which the pope is known, that of "supreme pontiff".

The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus personally appointed Peter as the visible head of the Church,<ref name = quote>"Continuing in that same undertaking, this Council is resolved to declare and proclaim before all men the doctrine concerning bishops, the successors of the apostles, who together with the successor of Peter, the Vicar of Christ, the visible Head of the whole Church, govern the house of the living God."(Lumen Gentium, Pope Paul VI 1964, Chapter 3)</ref> and the Catholic Church's dogmatic constitution ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' makes a clear distinction between apostles and bishops, presenting the latter as the successors of the former, with the pope as successor of Peter, in that he is head of the bishops as Peter was head of the apostles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title=''Lumen gentium'', 22 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=11 August 2010}}</ref> Some historians argue against the notion that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, noting that the episcopal see in Rome can be traced back no earlier than the 3rd century.<ref name="O'Grady 146">{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=[https://archive.org/details/romancatholicchu0000ogra/page/146 146] |isbn=978-0-8091-3740-4 |year=1997 |url=https://archive.org/details/romancatholicchu0000ogra/page/146 }}</ref> The writings of the [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]] who wrote around AD 180 reflect a belief that Peter "founded and organized" the Church at Rome.<ref>{{cite book |first=J |last=Stevenson |title=A New Eusebius |page=[https://archive.org/details/neweusebiusdocum00euse/page/114 114] |isbn=978-0-281-00802-5 |year=1957 |url=https://archive.org/details/neweusebiusdocum00euse/page/114 }}</ref> Moreover, Irenaeus was not the first to write of Peter's presence in the early Roman Church. [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]] wrote in a letter to the Corinthians, ''c.'' 96,<ref name="fn_2">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1010.htm |title=Letter to the Corinthians (Clement)|publisher=New Advent |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia: The Fathers of the Church|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref> about the persecution of Christians in Rome as the "struggles in our time" and presented to the Corinthians its heroes, "first, the greatest and most just columns", the "good apostles" Peter and Paul.<ref name="Gröber, 510">Gröber, 510</ref> [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote shortly after Clement and in his letter from the city of Smyrna to the Romans he said he would not command them as Peter and Paul did.<ref name="fn_3">{{cite web |url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/244/Letter_of_Ignatius_of_Antioch_to_the_Romans.html |title=Letter of Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans |publisher=Crossroads Initiative}}</ref> Given this and other evidence, such as Emperor Constantine's erection of the "Old St. Peter's Basilica" on the location of St. Peter's tomb, as held and given to him by Rome's Christian community, many scholars agree that Peter was martyred in Rome under [[Nero]], although some scholars argue that he may have been martyred in Palestine.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title = Saint Peter the Apostle|year=2013|author=O'Connor, Daniel William|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle/5632/Tradition-of-Peter-in-Rome|page=5|access-date=14 April 2013|quote=[M]any scholars… accept Rome as the location of the martyrdom and the reign of Nero as the time.}}</ref><ref>{{citation |language=de |title=Zeitschr. fur Kirchengesch. |year=1901 |pages=1 sqq., 161 sqq}}</ref><ref>''The Secrets of the 12 Disciples'', [[Channel 4]], transmitted on 23 March 2008.</ref>

First-century Christian communities would have had a group of presbyter-bishops functioning as leaders of their local churches. Gradually, episcopacies were established in metropolitan areas.<ref name="O'Grady 140">{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=[https://archive.org/details/romancatholicchu0000ogra/page/140 140] |isbn=978-0-8091-3740-4 |year=1997 |url=https://archive.org/details/romancatholicchu0000ogra/page/140 }}</ref> Antioch may have developed such a structure before Rome.<ref name="O'Grady 140"/> In Rome, there were many who claimed to be the rightful bishop, though again Irenaeus stressed the validity of one line of bishops from the time of St. Peter up to his contemporary [[Pope Victor I]] and listed them.<ref>{{cite book |first=J |last=Stevenson |title=A New Eusebius |pages=[https://archive.org/details/neweusebiusdocum00euse/page/114 114–115] |isbn=978-0-281-00802-5 |year=1957 |url=https://archive.org/details/neweusebiusdocum00euse/page/114 }}</ref> Some writers claim that the emergence of a single bishop in Rome probably did not occur until the middle of the 2nd century. In their view, Linus, Cletus and Clement were possibly prominent presbyter-bishops, but not necessarily monarchical bishops.<ref name="O'Grady 146"/>

Documents of the 1st century and early 2nd century indicate that the bishop of Rome had some kind of pre-eminence and prominence in the Church as a whole, as even a letter from the bishop, or patriarch, of Antioch acknowledged the Bishop of Rome as "a first among equals",<ref>''The Early Christian Church'' by Chadwick</ref> though the detail of what this meant is unclear.<ref>"From an historical perspective, there is no conclusive documentary evidence from the 1st century or the early decades of the second of the exercise of, or even the claim to, a primacy of the Roman bishop or to a connection with Peter, although documents from this period accord the church at Rome some kind of pre‑eminence" ([http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8523 Emmanuel Clapsis, Papal Primacy], extract from ''Orthodoxy in Conversation'' (2000), p. 110); and "The see of Rome, whose prominence was associated with the deaths of Peter and Paul, became the principle center in matters concerning the universal Church" (Clapsis, p. 102). The same writer quotes with approval the words of [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]]: "In Phanar, on 25 July 1976, when [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Patriarch Athenegoras]] addressed [[Pope Paul VI|the visiting pope]] as Peter's successor, the first in honor among us, and the presider over charity, this great church leader was expressing the essential content of the declarations of the primacy of the first millennium" (Clapsis, p. 113).</ref>

===Early Christianity (c. 30–325)===
It seems that at first the terms "episcopos" and "presbyter" were used interchangeably.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1997 edition revised 2005, page 211: "It seems that at first the terms 'episcopos' and 'presbyter' were used interchangeably".</ref> The consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the 1st and 2nd centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable.<ref>''Cambridge History of Christianity'', volume 1, 2006, "The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable."</ref> Some say that there was probably "no single 'monarchical' bishop in Rome before the middle of the 2nd century...and likely later."<ref>''Cambridge History of Christianity'', volume 1, 2006, page 418</ref> Other scholars and historians disagree, citing the historical records of [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]] (d 107) and St. [[Irenaeus]] who recorded the linear succession of bishops of Rome (the popes) up until their own times.<ref>See Irenaeus' Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)</ref> However, 'historical' records written by those wanting to show an unbroken line of popes would naturally do so, and there are no objective substantiating documents. They also cite the importance accorded to the Bishops of Rome in the [[ecumenical council]]s, including the early ones.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=Brian W. |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9101fea2.asp |title=Papal Authority at the Earliest Councils |journal=This Rock |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=January 1991 |publisher=[[Catholic Answers]] |access-date=22 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002305/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9101fea2.asp |archive-date=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the early Christian era, Rome and a few other cities had claims on the leadership of worldwide Church. [[James the Just]], known as "the brother of the Lord", served as head of the [[Jerusalem]] church, which is still honored as the "Mother Church" in Orthodox tradition. [[Alexandria]] had been a center of Jewish learning and became a center of Christian learning. Rome had a large congregation early in the apostolic period whom Paul the Apostle addressed in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], and according to tradition Paul was martyred there. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During the 1st century of the Church (c. 30–130), the Roman capital became recognized as a Christian center of exceptional importance. [[Clement I]], at the end of the 1st century, wrote an epistle to the Church in [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] intervening in a major dispute, and apologizing for not having taken action earlier.<ref>Chadwick, Henry, ''Oxford History of Christianity'', Oxford University Press, quote: "Towards the latter part of the 1st century, Rome's presiding cleric, named Clement, wrote on behalf of his church to remonstrate with the Corinthian Christians who had ejected clergy without either financial or charismatic endowment in favor of a fresh lot; Clement apologized not for intervening but for not having acted sooner. Moreover, during the 2nd century the Roman community's leadership was evident in its generous alms to poorer churches. About 165, they erected monuments to their martyred apostles, to Peter in a necropolis on the Vatican Hill, to Paul on the road to Ostia, at the traditional sites of their burial. Roman bishops were already conscious of being custodians of the authentic tradition of true interpretation of the apostolic writings. In the conflict with Gnosticism Rome played a decisive role, and likewise in the deep division in Asia Minor created by the claims of the Montanist prophets."</ref> However, there are only a few other references of that time to recognition of the [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|authoritative primacy]] of the [[Holy See|Roman See]] outside of Rome. In the [[Declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, theologians chosen by the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches stated: "41. Both sides agree ... that Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St [[Ignatius of Antioch]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/244/Letter_of_Ignatius_of_Antioch_to_the_Romans.html |title=Letter of Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans: Prologue|publisher=Crossroads Productions |access-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the [[bishop]] of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs. Translated into English, the statement means "first among equals". What form that should take is still a matter of disagreement, just as it was when the Catholic and Orthodox Churches split in the Great East-West Schism. They also disagree on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the Bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium." {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 2nd century AD, there were more manifestations of Roman authority over other churches. In 189, assertion of the primacy of the Church of Rome may be indicated in [[Irenaeus]]'s ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (3:3:2): "With [the Church of Rome], because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree ... and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition." In AD 195, [[Pope Victor I]], in what is seen as an exercise of Roman authority over other churches, excommunicated the [[Quartodecimans]] for observing Easter on the 14th of [[Nisan]], the date of the Jewish [[Passover]], a tradition handed down by [[John the Evangelist]] (see [[Easter controversy]]). Celebration of Easter on a Sunday, as insisted on by the pope, is the system that has prevailed (see [[computus]]).

===Nicaea to East-West Schism (325–1054)===
The [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 granted freedom to all religions in the Roman Empire,<ref>Davidson, Ivor (2005). ''The Birth of the Church''.

====Middle Ages====
[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|thumb|upright|Gregory the Great (''c'' 540–604) who established medieval themes in the Church, in a painting by [[Carlo Saraceni]], c. 1610, Rome.]]
After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the pope served as a source of authority and continuity. [[Pope Gregory I]] (''c'' 540–604) administered the church with strict reform. From an ancient senatorial family, Gregory worked with the stern judgement and discipline typical of ancient Roman rule. Theologically, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook; his popular writings are full of dramatic [[miracle]]s, potent [[relic]]s, [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s, [[ghost]]s, and the [[Eschatology|approaching end of the world]].{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=517–551}}

Gregory's successors were largely dominated by the [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravenna]], the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]'s representative in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. These humiliations, the weakening of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the face of the [[Muslim conquests]], and the inability of the emperor to protect the papal estates against the [[Lombards]], made [[Pope Stephen II]] turn from Emperor [[Constantine V]]. He appealed to the [[Franks]] to protect his lands. [[Pepin the Short]] subdued the Lombards and donated Italian land to the papacy. When [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]] (800) as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]], he established the precedent that, in [[Western Europe]], no man would be emperor without being crowned by a Pope.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=517–551}}

The low point of the papacy was 867–1049.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}} This period includes the [[Saeculum obscurum]], the [[Crescentii]] era, and the [[Tusculan Papacy]]. The papacy came under the control of vying political factions. Popes were variously imprisoned, starved, killed, and deposed by force. The family of a certain papal official made and unmade popes for fifty years. The official's great-grandson, [[Pope John XII]], held orgies of debauchery in the [[Lateran Palace]]. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]] had John accused in an ecclesiastical court, which deposed him and elected a layman as [[Pope Leo VIII]]. John mutilated the Imperial representatives in Rome and had himself reinstated as pope. [[History of the papacy (1048–1257)|Conflict between the Emperor and the papacy]] continued, and eventually dukes in league with the emperor were buying bishops and popes almost openly.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

In 1049, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] became pope, at last a pope with the character to face the papacy's problems. He traveled to the major cities of Europe to deal with the church's moral problems firsthand, notably [[simony]] and [[clerical marriage]] and [[concubinage]]. With his long journey, he restored the prestige of the papacy in [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

From the 7th century it became common for European monarchies and nobility to found churches and perform [[investiture]] or deposition of clergy in their states and fiefdoms, their personal interests causing corruption among the clergy.<ref name="H.G.B">''História Global Brasil e Geral''.

===East–West Schism to Reformation (1054–1517)===
[[File:Mediterranean1400.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A historical map of the Mediterranean states in 1400. The [[Western Schism]] lasted from 1378 to 1417.]]
With the [[East–West Schism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the Catholic Church split definitively in 1054. This fracture was caused more by political events than by [[Eastern Orthodox – Catholic theological differences|slight divergences of creed]]. Popes had galled the Byzantine emperors by siding with the king of the Franks, crowning a rival Roman emperor, appropriating the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], and driving into Greek Italy.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], popes struggled with monarchs over power.<ref name="World History"/>

From 1309 to 1377, the pope resided not in Rome but in [[Avignon]]. The [[Avignon Papacy]] was notorious for greed and corruption.{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=3–25}} During this period, the pope was effectively an ally of the [[Kingdom of France]], alienating France's enemies, such as the [[Kingdom of England]].{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=26–57}}

The pope was understood to have the power to draw on the [[Treasury of Merit]] built up by the saints and by Christ, so that he could grant [[indulgence]]s, reducing one's time in [[purgatory]].  The concept that a monetary fine or donation accompanied contrition, confession, and prayer eventually gave way to the common assumption that indulgences depended on a simple monetary contribution.  The popes condemned misunderstandings and abuses, but were too pressed for income to exercise effective control over indulgences.{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=3–25}}

Popes also contended with the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], who sometimes attempted to assert the authority of [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils]] over the pope's. [[Conciliarism]] holds that the supreme authority of the church lies with a General Council, not with the pope.  Its foundations were laid early in the 13th century, and it culminated in the 15th century.  The failure of Conciliarism to gain broad acceptance after the 15th century is taken as a factor in the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name="ReferenceA">"Conciliar theory". Cross, FL, ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005.</ref>

Various [[Antipope]]s challenged papal authority, especially during the [[Western Schism]] (1378–1417). In this schism, the papacy had returned to Rome from Avignon, but an antipope was installed in Avignon, as if to extend the papacy there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Eastern Church continued to decline with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, undercutting Constantinople's claim to equality with Rome. Twice an Eastern Emperor tried to force the Eastern Church to reunify with the West. First in the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1272–1274) and secondly in the [[Council of Florence]] (1431–1449). [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|Papal claims of superiority]] were a sticking point in reunification, which failed in any event. In the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] captured [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Constantinople-1453|title=Fall of Constantinople {{!}} Summary|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>

===Reformation to present (1517 to today)===
[[File:Council Trent.jpg|thumb|As part of the Catholic Reformation, [[Pope Paul III]] (1534–49) initiated the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), which established the triumph of the papacy over those who sought to reconcile with Protestants or oppose Papal claims.]]

Popes instituted a [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Reformation]]<ref name="World History"/> (1560–1648), which addressed the challenges of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and instituted internal reforms. [[Pope Paul III]] initiated the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), whose definitions of doctrine and whose reforms sealed the triumph of the papacy over elements in the church that sought conciliation with Protestants and opposed papal claims.<ref>"Counter-Reformation". Cross, FL, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>

Gradually forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.<ref name="World History"/>

In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] proclaimed the [[dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] for those rare occasions the pope speaks ''[[ex cathedra]]'' when issuing a solemn definition of faith or [[morals]].<ref name="World History">Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt & co. 1994.</ref>

Later the same year, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] [[Capture of Rome|seized Rome]] from the pope's control and substantially completed the [[Italian unification]].<ref name="World History"/>

In 1929, the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Holy See]] established [[Vatican City]] as an independent [[city-state]], guaranteeing papal independence from secular rule.<ref name="World History"/>

In 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]] defined the [[Assumption of Mary]] as dogma, the only time that a pope has spoken ''ex cathedra'' since papal infallibility was explicitly declared.

The [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrine Doctrine]] is still controversial as an issue of doctrine that continues to divide the eastern and western churches and separate Protestants from Rome.

== Saint Peter and the origin of the papal office ==
{{See also|Primacy of Simon Peter}}
The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that, within the Christian community, the bishops as a body have succeeded to the body of the apostles (''[[apostolic succession]]'') and the Bishop of Rome has succeeded to Saint Peter.<ref name="section880"/>

Scriptural texts proposed in support of Peter's special position in relation to the church include:
*[[Matthew 16]]: {{quote|I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18–19|ESV}}</ref>}}
*[[Luke 22]]: {{quote|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|22:31–32|ESV}}</ref>}}
*[[John 21]]:{{quote|Feed my sheep.<ref>{{bibleverse||John|21:17|ESV}}</ref>}}

The symbolic keys in the [[Papal coats of arms]] are a reference to the phrase "[[Keys of Heaven|the keys of the kingdom of heaven]]" in the first of these texts. Some Protestant writers have maintained that the "rock" that Jesus speaks of in this text is Jesus himself or the faith expressed by Peter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lightfoot |first=John |author-link=John Lightfoot|title=Commentary on Matthew 16:18 |url=http://www.studylight.org/com/jlc/view.cgi?book=mt&chapter=16&verse=18#Mt16_18|work=Commentary on the Gospels |access-date=23 May 2013 |publisher=StudyLight.org |quote=It is readily answered by the Papists, that "Peter was the rock."

==Election, death and resignation==
===Election===
{{Main|Papal conclave}}
[[File:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Delivery of the Keys (Perugino)|Delivery of the Keys]]'' painted by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1492)]]

The pope was originally chosen by those senior [[clergy]]men resident in and near Rome. In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. The electors are now limited to those who have not reached 80 on the day before the death or resignation of a pope.{{sfn|John Paul II|1996|p=Introduction}} The pope does not need to be a Cardinal Elector or indeed a Cardinal; however, since the pope is the Bishop of Rome, only those who can be ordained a bishop can be elected, which means that any male baptized Catholic is eligible. The last to be elected when not yet a bishop was [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1831, the last to be elected when not even a priest was [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513, and the last to be elected when not a cardinal was [[Pope Urban VI]] in 1378.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-popes-and-conclaves/|title=Popes and conclaves: everything you need to know|date=3 March 2013}}</ref> If someone who is not a bishop is elected, he must be given episcopal ordination before the election is announced to the people.{{sfn|John Paul II|1996|pp=88–89}}

The [[Second Council of Lyon]] was convened on 7 May 1274, to regulate the election of the pope. This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope's death, and that they must remain in seclusion until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year ''[[sede vacante]]'' following the death of [[Pope Clement IV]] in 1268. By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Traditionally, the vote was conducted by [[acclamation (Papal elections)|Acclamation]], by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote.

[[File:Konklave Konzilsgebaude Konstanz.jpg|thumb|left|The conclave in [[Konstanz]] where [[Pope Martin V]] was elected]]
The election of the pope almost always takes place in the [[Sistine Chapel]], in a sequestered meeting called a "[[Papal conclave|conclave]]" (so called because the cardinal electors are theoretically locked in, ''cum clave'', i.e., with key, until they elect a new pope). Three cardinals are chosen by lot to collect the votes of absent cardinal electors (by reason of illness), three are chosen by lot to count the votes, and three are chosen by lot to review the count of the votes. The ballots are distributed and each cardinal elector writes the name of his choice on it and pledges aloud that he is voting for "one whom under God I think ought to be elected" before folding and depositing his vote on a plate atop a large chalice placed on the altar. For the [[Papal conclave, 2005]], a special urn was used for this purpose instead of a chalice and plate. The plate is then used to drop the ballot into the chalice, making it difficult for electors to insert multiple ballots. Before being read, the ballots are counted while still folded; if the number of ballots does not match the number of electors, the ballots are burned unopened and a new vote is held. Otherwise, each ballot is read aloud by the presiding Cardinal, who pierces the ballot with a needle and thread, stringing all the ballots together and tying the ends of the thread to ensure accuracy and honesty. Balloting continues until someone is elected by a two-thirds majority. (With the promulgation of ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' in 1996, a simple majority after a deadlock of twelve days was allowed, but this was revoked by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by ''[[motu proprio]]'' in 2007.)
[[File:Habemus Papam 1415.jpg|thumb|The formal declaration of "[[Habemus Papam]]" after the election of Pope Martin V]]

One of the most prominent aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from [[Saint Peter's Square]]. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound to create black smoke, or ''[[fumata nera]]''. (Traditionally, wet straw was used to produce the black smoke, but this was not completely reliable. The chemical compound is more reliable than the straw.) When a vote is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (''[[fumata bianca]]'') through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://abcnews.go.com/International/white-smoke-pope-black-smoke-nope-conclave-smoke/story?id=18719208|title = White Smoke, Pope; Black Smoke, Nope: How Conclave Smoke Gets Its Color|date = March 2013|website = ABC News|last = Effron|first = Lauren}}</ref> Starting with the [[Papal conclave, 2005]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Conference on the Tenth General Congregations of the College of Cardinals (11 March) and Regarding Events of the Coming Days: Tenth and Last General Congregation|url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/30611.php?index=30611&lang=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505172837/http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/30611.php?index=30611&lang=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|publisher=Holy See Press Office|access-date=15 April 2013}}</ref> [[church bell]]s are also rung as a signal that a new pope has been chosen. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[dean of the College of Cardinals]] then asks two solemn questions of the man who has been elected. First he asks, "Do you freely accept your election as supreme pontiff?" If he replies with the word ''"Accepto"'', his reign begins at that instant. If he replies ''not'', his reign begins at the inauguration ceremony several days afterward. The dean asks next, "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope announces the [[regnal name]] he has chosen. If the dean himself is elected pope, the vice dean performs this task. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The new pope is led through the "Door of Tears" to a dressing room where three sets of white papal vestments (''immantatio'') await: small, medium, and large. Donning the appropriate vestments and reemerging into the Sistine Chapel, the new pope is given the "[[Fisherman's Ring]]" by the [[camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], whom he first either reconfirms or reappoints. The pope assumes a place of honor as the rest of the cardinals wait in turn to offer their first "obedience" (''adoratio'') and to receive his blessing. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Cardinal protodeacon|senior cardinal deacon]] announces from a balcony over [[St. Peter's Square]] the following proclamation: ''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum! [[Habemus Papam]]!'' ("I announce to you a great joy! We have a pope!"). He announces the new pope's [[Christian name]] along with his newly chosen regnal name. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Until 1978 the pope's election was followed in a few days by the [[papal coronation]], which started with a procession with great pomp and circumstance from the [[Sistine Chapel]] to [[St. Peter's Basilica]], with the newly elected pope borne in the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]''. After a solemn [[Papal Mass]], the new pope was crowned with the ''[[Papal tiara|triregnum]]'' (papal tiara) and he gave for the first time as pope the famous blessing ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' ("to the City [Rome] and to the World"). Another renowned part of the coronation was the lighting of a bundle of [[flax]] at the top of a gilded pole, which would flare brightly for a moment and then promptly extinguish, as he said, ''[[Sic transit gloria mundi]]'' ("Thus passes worldly glory"). A similar warning against papal [[hubris]] made on this occasion was the traditional exclamation, ''"Annos Petri non-videbis"'', reminding the newly crowned pope that he would not live to see his rule lasting as long as that of St. Peter. According to tradition, he headed the church for 35 years and has thus far been the longest-reigning pope in the history of the Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}<ref>St [[Augustine of Hippo]], speaking of the honours paid to bishops in his time, mentions the ''absides gradatae'' ([[Apse]]s with steps, a reference to the seating arrangement for the presbyters in the apse of the church, with the bishop in the middle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=LTb6zWm5PMcC&pg=PA186 William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Christian Antiquities''], "elevated stalls" in the [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2512021/Letters-of-Augustine-of-Hippo Sparrow-Simpson translation] (p. 83), and appearing as "thrones ascended by flights of steps" in [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf101.vii.1.XXIII.html the Cunningham translation]), and ''[[cathedra]]e velatae'' (canopied thrones, appearing as "canopied pulpits" in both those translations) – [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ms7AAAAcAAJ Letter 203 in the old arrangement], 23 in the chronological rearrangement</ref>

A [[traditionalist Catholic]] belief that lacks reliable authority claims that a [[Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)|Papal Oath]] was sworn, at their coronation, by all popes from [[Pope Agatho|Agatho]] to [[Paul VI]] and that it was omitted with the abolition of the coronation ceremony.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Latin]] term, ''[[sede vacante]]'' ("while the see is vacant"),<ref>[[Ablative absolute]], equivalent to a temporal clause</ref> refers to a papal [[interregnum]], the period between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor. From this term is derived the term [[sedevacantism]], which designates a category of dissident Catholics who maintain that there is no canonically and legitimately elected pope, and that there is therefore a ''sede vacante''. One of the most common reasons for holding this belief is the idea that the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], and especially the reform of the [[Tridentine Mass]] with the [[Mass of Paul VI]], are heretical and that those responsible for initiating and maintaining these changes are heretics and not true popes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

For centuries, from 1378 on, those elected to the papacy were predominantly [[Italians]]. Prior to the election of the [[Poles|Polish]] cardinal [[Karol Wojtyla]] as Pope John Paul II in 1978, the last non-Italian was [[Pope Adrian VI]] of the Netherlands, elected in 1522. John Paul II was followed by election of the [[Germans|German-born]] [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who was in turn followed by [[Argentines|Argentine-born]] [[Pope Francis]], who is the first non-European after 1272 years and the first Latin American, despite having an Italian ancestry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21777141|title=Profile: Pope Francis|date=2017-12-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Max |title=Sorry, Jorge Mario Bergoglio is not the first non-European pope |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/03/13/sorry-jorge-mario-bergoglio-is-not-the-first-non-european-pope/?noredirect=on |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Pope John Paul II funeral.jpg|thumb|Funeral of [[Pope John Paul II]] at the Vatican in April 2005, presided over by Cardinal Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI]]
The current regulations regarding a papal [[interregnum]]—that is, a ''[[sede vacante]]'' ("vacant seat")—were promulgated by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his 1996 document ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]''. During the "sede vacante" period, the [[College of Cardinals]] is collectively responsible for the government of the Church and of the Vatican itself, under the direction of the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]]; however, [[canon law]] specifically forbids the cardinals from introducing any innovation in the government of the Church during the vacancy of the [[Holy See]]. Any decision that requires the assent of the pope has to wait until the new pope has been elected and accepts office. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In recent centuries, when a pope was judged to have died, it was reportedly traditional for the cardinal camerlengo to confirm the death ceremonially by gently tapping the pope's head thrice with a silver hammer, calling his birth name each time.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/religion/hammer.asp|title = Hammer Time|date = 5 April 2005|access-date = 2 November 2014|website = Snopes.com}}</ref> This was not done on the deaths of popes [[John Paul I]]<ref>Sullivan, George E.

The body [[lies in state]] for several days before being interred in the [[crypt]] of a leading church or cathedral; all popes who have died in the 20th and 21st centuries have been interred in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. A nine-day period of [[mourning]] (''novendialis'') follows the interment.<ref name="Global Catholic Network {{!}} EWTN"/>

===Resignation===
{{Main|Papal resignation}}
It is highly unusual for a pope to resign.<ref>As the reign of the pope has conventionally been from election until death, papal resignation is an uncommon event. Before the 21st century, only five popes unambiguously resigned with historical certainty, all between the 10th and 15th centuries.</ref> The [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P16.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law – IntraText}}</ref> states, "If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone." [[Benedict XVI]], who vacated the [[Holy See]] on 28 February 2013, was the most recent to do so since [[Gregory XII]]'s resignation in 1415.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/benedict-placehold-pope-weakened-church | title=Benedict, the placeholder pope who leaves a battered, weakened church | work=The Guardian | date=11 February 2013 | access-date=12 February 2013 | author=Brown, Andrew}}</ref>

===Regnal name===
Popes adopt a new name on their accession, known as [[papal name]], in Italian and Latin. Currently, after a new pope is elected and accepts the election, he is asked "By what name shall you be called?". The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known from that point on. The senior cardinal deacon, or cardinal protodeacon, then appears on the balcony of Saint Peter's to proclaim the new pope by his birth name, and announce his papal name in Latin. It's customary when referring to popes to translate the regnal name into all local languages. Thus, for example, Papa Franciscus is Papa Francesco in Italian, but he is also known as Papa Francisco in his native Spanish, Pope Francis in English, etc.

===Official list of titles===
The official list of titles of the pope, in the order in which they are given in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', is:

{{quote|Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], [[Vicar of Christ|Vicar of Jesus Christ]], Successor of the [[Saint Peter|Prince of the Apostles]], [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme]] [[Pontiff#Christianity|Pontiff]] of the Universal Church, [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Italy, [[Metropolitan bishop|Archbishop and Metropolitan]] of the [[List of Catholic dioceses in Italy#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman]] [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]], [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]], [[Servant of the servants of God]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio'', published annually by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, p. 23*. ISBN of the 2012 edition: 978-88-209-8722-0.</ref>}}

The best-known title, that of "pope", does not appear in the official list, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures. Thus [[Paul VI]] signed as "Paulus PP. VI", the "PP." standing for "''papa pontifex''" ("pope and pontiff").<ref>{{cathEncy|author=Shahan, Thomas Joseph|wstitle=Ecclesiastical Abbreviations|volume=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013|title =Pope |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online|access-date=14 April 2013|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469994/pope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibDevelop/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html |author=Adriano Cappelli |title= Lexicon Abbreviaturarum |page=283 |access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_11.html |title=Contractions and Abbreviations |publisher=Ndl.go.jp |date=4 August 2005 |access-date=21 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210050234/http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_11.html |archive-date=10 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Papa+Pontifex |title=What Does PP Stand For? |publisher=Acronyms.thefreedictionary.com |access-date=21 November 2011}}</ref>

The title "pope" was from the early 3rd century an honorific designation used for ''any'' bishop in the West.<ref name=ODCC:Pope/> In the East, it was used only for the [[bishop of Alexandria]].<ref name=ODCC:Pope/> [[Pope Marcellinus|Marcellinus]] (d. 304) is the first bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title "pope" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of [[Constantinople]] normally reserved this designation for the bishop of Rome.<ref name=ODCC:Pope/> From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century,<ref name=ODCC:Pope/> when [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] declared it reserved for the bishop of Rome. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In [[Eastern Christianity]], where the title "pope" is used also of the bishop of Alexandria, the bishop of Rome is often referred to as the "pope of Rome", regardless of whether the speaker or writer is in communion with Rome or not. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Vicar of Jesus Christ===
"Vicar of Jesus Christ" (''Vicarius Iesu Christi'') is one of the official titles of the pope given in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. It is commonly used in the slightly abbreviated form "vicar of Christ" (''vicarius Christi''). While it is only one of the terms with which the pope is referred to as "vicar", it is "more expressive of his supreme headship of the Church on Earth, which he bears in virtue of the commission of Christ and with vicarial power derived from him", a vicarial power believed to have been conferred on Saint Peter when Christ said to him: "Feed my lambs...Feed my sheep" ({{bibleverse||John|21:16–17}}).<ref name="New Advent - Vicar of Christ">{{cathEncy|wstitle=Vicar of Christ|author=Fanning, William Henry Windsor}}</ref>

The first record of the application of this title to a bishop of Rome appears in a synod of 495 with reference to [[Gelasius I]].<ref name="Macbrien">McBrien, Richard P. ''Os Papas. Os Pontífices de São Pedro a João Paulo II'' (original title: ''Lives of the Popes.

On at least one occasion the title "vicar of God" (a reference to Christ as God) was used of the pope.<ref name="New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/>

The title "vicar of Peter" (''vicarius Petri'') is used only of the pope, not of other bishops.

The office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], or head of the [[College of Pontiffs]], was held by [[Julius Caesar]] and thereafter, by the Roman emperors, until [[Gratian]] (375–383) relinquished it.<ref name="smithpontifex"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title = Gratian|year=2013|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242251/Gratian|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref><ref>[https://www.livius.org/pn-po/pontifex/maximus.html Pontifex Maximus] Livius.org article by Jona Lendering retrieved 15 August 2006</ref> [[Tertullian]], when he had become a [[Montanist]], used the title derisively of either the pope or the [[episcopal see of Carthage|Bishop of Carthage]].<ref name=ODCC:PM/> The popes began to use this title regularly only in the 15th century.<ref name=ODCC:PM>''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Pontifex Maximus''</ref>

===Servant of the servants of God===
Although the description "[[servant of the servants of God]]" ({{lang-la|servus servorum Dei}}) was also used by other Church leaders, including [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Benedict of Nursia]], it was first used extensively as a papal title by [[Gregory the Great]], reportedly as a lesson in humility for the patriarch of Constantinople, [[John the Faster]], who had assumed the title "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|ecumenical patriarch]]". It became reserved for the pope in the 12th century and is used in [[papal bull]]s and similar important papal documents.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Servus servorum Dei|author=Meehan, Andrew Brennan}}</ref>

===Patriarch of the West===
{{See also|Patriarch|Pentarchy}}
From 1863 until 2005, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' also included the title "[[patriarch]] of the West". This title was first used by [[Pope Theodore I]] in 642, and was only used occasionally. Indeed, it did not begin to appear in the pontifical yearbook until 1863. On 22 March 2006, the Vatican released a statement explaining this omission on the grounds of expressing a "historical and theological reality" and of "being useful to ecumenical dialogue". The title patriarch of the West symbolized the pope's special relationship with, and jurisdiction over, the [[Latin Church]]—and the omission of the title neither symbolizes in any way a change in this relationship, nor distorts the relationship between the Holy See and the [[Eastern Churches]], as solemnly proclaimed by the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/general-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20060322_patriarca-occidente_fr.html |title=Communiqué concernant la suppression du titre "Patriarche d'Occident" dans l'Annuaire pontifical 2006 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=11 August 2010}}</ref>

===Other titles===
Other titles commonly used are "[[His Holiness]]" (either used alone or as an honorific prefix "His Holiness Pope Francis"; and as "Your Holiness" as a form of address), "Holy Father". In Spanish and Italian, "''Beatísimo/Beatissimo Padre''" (Most Blessed Father) is often used in preference to "''Santísimo/Santissimo Padre''" (Most Holy Father). In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], "''[[Dominus Apostolicus]]''" ("the [[Saint Peter|Apostolic]] Lord") was also used.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S1WWdGYowvIC&pg=PA21 |title=Popes and the Tale of Their Names|last=Guruge|first=Anura|date=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781434384409|language=en}}</ref>

Pope Francis signs some documents with his name alone, either in Latin ("Franciscus", as in an [[encyclical]] dated 29 June 2013)<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20130629_enciclica-lumen-fidei.html Encyclical letter ''Lumen fidei'']</ref> or in another language.<ref>Examples are "Francesco" in the frontispiece of the 2013 ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' published in Italian shortly after his election (''Annuario Pontificio 2013'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}) and [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/letters/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140401_cardinale-baldisseri.html a letter in Italian dated 1 April 2014].</ref> Other documents he signs in accordance with the tradition of using Latin only and including, in the abbreviated form "PP.",<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01022a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:''Ecclesiastical Abbreviations'']</ref> for the Latin ''Papa Pontifex'' ("Pope and Pontiff").<ref>Examples are documents dated [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/papa-francesco-motu-proprio_20130808_prevenzione-contrasto.html 8 August 2013]; [http://www.holyseemission.org/press/release.aspx?id=452 17 January 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514214821/http://www.holyseemission.org/press/release.aspx?id=452 |date=14 May 2014 }}; [http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/de/bollettino/pubblico/2014/04/04/0238/00534.html 2 April 2014]</ref> Popes who have an ordinal numeral in their name traditionally place the abbreviation "PP." before the ordinal numeral, as in "Benedictus PP. XVI" (Pope Benedict&nbsp;XVI), except in [[papal bull|bulls]] of canonization and decrees of ecumenical councils, which a pope signs with the formula, "Ego N. Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae", without the numeral, as in "Ego Benedictus Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae" (I, Benedict, Bishop of the Catholic Church). The pope's signature is followed, in bulls of canonization, by those of all the cardinals resident in Rome, and in decrees of ecumenical councils, by the signatures of the other bishops participating in the council, each signing as Bishop of a particular see.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Papal bull]]s are headed ''N. Episcopus [[Servant of the servants of God|Servus Servorum Dei]]'' ("Name, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God"). In general, they are not signed by the pope, but John Paul II introduced in the mid-1980s the custom by which the pope signs not only bulls of canonization but also, using his normal signature, such as "Benedictus PP. XVI", bulls of nomination of bishops. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Regalia and insignia==
{{Main|Papal regalia and insignia}}
* ''[[Papal tiara|Triregnum]]'', also called the "tiara" or "triple crown", represents the pope's three functions as "supreme pastor", "supreme teacher" and "supreme priest". Recent popes have not, however, worn the ''triregnum'', though it remains the symbol of the papacy and has not been abolished. In liturgical ceremonies the pope wears an episcopal [[mitre]] (an erect cloth hat). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Crosier]] topped by a [[crucifix]], a custom established before the 13th century (see [[Papal ferula]]). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Pallium]], or pall, a circular band of fabric worn around the neck over the [[chasuble]]. It forms a yoke about the neck, breast and shoulders and has two pendants hanging down in front and behind, and is ornamented with six crosses. Previously, the pallium worn by the pope was identical to those he granted to the [[Primate (bishop)|primates]], but in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI began to use a distinct papal pallium that is larger than the primatial, and was adorned with red crosses instead of black. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* "Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven", the image of two keys, one gold and one silver. The silver key symbolizes the power to bind and loose on [[Earth]], and the gold key the power to bind and loose in [[Heaven]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Ring of the Fisherman]], a gold or gilt ring decorated with a depiction of St. Peter in a boat casting his net, with the pope's name around it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dictionary : RING OF THE FISHERMAN|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=36109|access-date=2020-10-23|website=www.catholicculture.org}}</ref>
* ''[[Umbraculum]]'' (better known in the Italian form ''ombrellino'') is a canopy or umbrella consisting of alternating red and gold stripes, which used to be carried above the pope in processions. <ref>{{Cite web|title=UMBRACULUM - Definition and synonyms of umbraculum in the English dictionary|url=https://educalingo.com/en/dic-en/umbraculum|access-date=2020-10-23|website=educalingo.com|language=en}}</ref>
* ''[[Sedia gestatoria]]'', a mobile throne carried by twelve [[footmen]] (''palafrenieri'') in red uniforms, accompanied by two attendants bearing ''[[flabella]]'' (fans made of white ostrich feathers), and sometimes a large [[baldachin|canopy]], carried by eight attendants. The use of the ''flabella'' was discontinued by [[Pope John Paul I]]. The use of the ''sedia gestatoria'' was discontinued by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Vatican: The Possible Return of the Sedia Gestatoria |url=https://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/vatican-possible-return-sedia-gestatoria-56887 |website=Society of Saint Pius X |access-date=2 December 2020 |language=en |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>

In [[heraldry]], each pope has his own [[papal coats of arms|personal coat of arms]]. Though unique for each pope, the arms have for several centuries been traditionally accompanied by two keys in [[saltire]] (i.e., crossed over one another so as to form an ''X'') behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield) (one silver key and one gold key, tied with a red cord), and above them a silver ''triregnum'' with three gold crowns and red ''infulae'' ([[lappet]]s—two strips of fabric hanging from the back of the triregnum which fall over the neck and shoulders when worn). This is [[blazon]]ed: "two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or". The 21st century has seen departures from this tradition. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, while maintaining the crossed keys behind the shield, omitted the papal tiara from his personal coat of arms, replacing it with a [[mitre]] with three horizontal lines. Beneath the shield he added the pallium, a papal symbol of authority more ancient than the tiara, the use of which is also granted to metropolitan [[archbishop]]s as a sign of communion with the See of Rome. Although the tiara was omitted in the pope's personal coat of arms, the coat of arms of the Holy See, which includes the tiara, remained unaltered. In 2013, Pope Francis maintained the mitre that replaced the tiara, but omitted the pallium. He also departed from papal tradition by adding beneath the shield his personal pastoral motto: ''[[Coat of arms of Pope Francis#Motto|Miserando atque eligendo]]''. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[flag]] most frequently associated with the pope is the yellow and white [[flag of Vatican City]], with the arms of the Holy See (blazoned: "Gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or") on the right-hand side (the "fly") in the white half of the flag (the left-hand side—the "hoist"—is yellow). The pope's escucheon does not appear on the flag. This flag was first adopted in 1808, whereas the previous flag had been red and gold. Although Pope Benedict XVI replaced the triregnum with a mitre on his personal coat of arms, it has been retained on the flag.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/elezione/documents/stemma-benedict-xvi.html The Vatican (Holy See)]</ref>

===Papal garments===
[[Pope Pius V]] (reigned 1566–1572), is often credited with having originated the custom whereby the pope wears white, by continuing after his election to wear the white [[Religious habit|habit]] of the [[Dominican order]]. In reality, the basic papal attire was white long before. The earliest document that describes it as such is the ''Ordo XIII'', a book of ceremonies compiled in about 1274. Later books of ceremonies describe the pope as wearing a red mantle, [[mozzetta]], [[camauro]] and shoes, and a white [[cassock]] and stockings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bagliani|first1=Agostino Paravicini|title=From red to white|url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/from-red-to-white|access-date=29 June 2014|work=Osservatore Romano|date=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Vatican newspaper examines history of red, white papal garb|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=18897|access-date=29 June 2014|work=Catholic Culture|date=2 September 2013}}</ref> Many contemporary portraits of 15th and 16th-century predecessors of Pius V show them wearing a white cassock similar to his.<ref>Compare the portrait reproduced in the article on Pius V with those in the articles on his immediate predecessors [[Pope Pius IV]] and [[Pope Paul IV]] and in the articles on [[Pope Julius III]], [[Pope Paul III]], [[Pope Clement VII]], [[Pope Adrian VI]], [[Pope Leo X]], [[Pope Julius II]], [[Pope Pius II]], [[Pope Callixtus III]], [[Pope Nicholas V]], and [[Pope Eugene IV]].</ref>

==Status and authority==
{{Main|Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|Papal infallibility}}
[[File:Illustration for Papal Infallibility page 131 Christ in His Church by Lucas Caspar Businger.jpg|thumb|1881 illustration depicting papal infallibility]]

===First Vatican Council===
The status and authority of the pope in the Catholic Church was [[dogma]]tically [[Papal infallibility|defined]] by the [[First Vatican Council]] on 18 July 1870. In its Dogmatic Constitution of the Church of Christ, the council established the following canons:<ref>The texts of these canons are given in [[Denzinger]], [http://catho.org/9.php?d=byj#dez Latin original]; [http://denzinger.patristica.net/ English translation]</ref>

<blockquote>If anyone says that the blessed Apostle Peter was not established by the Lord Christ as the chief of all the [[twelve apostles|apostles]], and the visible head of the whole [[Church militant and church triumphant|militant Church]], or, that the same received great honour but did not receive from the same our Lord Jesus Christ directly and immediately the primacy in true and proper jurisdiction: let him be [[anathema]].<ref>Denzinger 3055 (old numbering, 1823)</ref>

If anyone says that it is not from the institution of Christ the Lord Himself, or by divine right that the blessed Peter has perpetual successors in the primacy over the universal Church, or that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in the same primacy, let him be anathema.<ref>Denzinger 3058 (old numbering, 1825)</ref>

If anyone thus speaks, that the Roman pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate, or over the churches altogether and individually, and over the pastors and the faithful altogether and individually: let him be anathema.<ref>Denzinger 3064 (old numbering, 1831)</ref>

We, adhering faithfully to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith, to the glory of God, our Saviour, the elevation of the Catholic religion and the salvation of Christian peoples, with the approbation of the sacred Council, teach and explain that the dogma has been divinely revealed: that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and teacher of all Christians by his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, through the divine assistance promised him in blessed Peter, operates with that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer wished that His church be instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals; and so such definitions of the Roman Pontiff from himself, but not from the consensus of the Church, are unalterable. But if anyone presumes to contradict this definition of Ours, which may God forbid: let him be anathema.<ref>Denzinger 3073–3075 (old numbering, 1839–1840)</ref></blockquote>

===Second Vatican Council===
[[File:GestatorialChair1.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]], wearing the traditional 1877 [[Papal tiara]], is carried through St. Peter's Basilica on a ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'' c. 1955.]]
In its [[Lumen gentium|Dogmatic Constitution on the Church]] (1964), the [[Second Vatican Council]] declared:

{{quote|Among the principal duties of bishops the [[Evangelism|preaching of the Gospel]] occupies an eminent place. For bishops are [[preacher]]s of the faith, who lead new disciples to Christ, and they are authentic teachers, that is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach to the people committed to them the faith they must believe and put into practice, and by the light of the [[Holy Spirit]] illustrate that faith. They bring forth from the treasury of Revelation new things and old, making it bear fruit and vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock. Bishops, teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff, are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth. In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic [[magisterium]] of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown so that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.

... this infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed His Church to be endowed in defining doctrine of faith and morals, extends as far as the deposit of Revelation extends, which must be religiously guarded and faithfully expounded. And this is the infallibility which the Roman Pontiff, the head of the [[College of Bishops]], enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith, by a definitive act he proclaims a doctrine of faith or morals. And therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly styled irreformable, since they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, promised to him in blessed Peter, and therefore they need no approval of others, nor do they allow an appeal to any other judgment. For then the Roman Pontiff is not pronouncing judgment as a private person, but as the supreme teacher of the universal Church, in whom the [[charism]] of infallibility of the Church itself is individually present, he is expounding or defending a doctrine of Catholic faith. The infallibility promised to the Church resides also in the body of Bishops, when that body exercises the supreme magisterium with the successor of Peter. To these definitions the assent of the Church can never be wanting, on account of the activity of that same Holy Spirit, by which the whole flock of Christ is preserved and progresses in unity of faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title=''Lumen gentium'', 25 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=11 August 2010}}</ref>}}

On 11 October 2012, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council 60 prominent theologians, (including [[Hans Küng]]), put out a Declaration, stating that the intention of Vatican II to balance authority in the Church has not been realised. "Many of the key insights of Vatican II have not at all, or only partially, been implemented... A principal source of present-day stagnation lies in misunderstanding and abuse affecting the exercise of authority in our Church."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchauthority.org/index.asp |title=''the Jubilee Declaration''}}</ref>

==Politics of the Holy See==
{{Politics of the Holy See}}
[[File:433px-Pope Pius VII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Pius VII]], bishop of Rome, seated, and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Caprara.]]

===Residence and jurisdiction===
The pope's [[cathedra|official seat]] is in the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], considered the [[cathedral]] of the Diocese of Rome, and his official residence is the [[Apostolic Palace]]. He also possesses [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|a summer residence]] at [[Castel Gandolfo]], situated on the site of the ancient city of [[Alba Longa]]. Until the time of the [[Avignon Papacy]], the residence of the pope was the [[Lateran Palace]], donated by Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The pope's ecclesiastical jurisdiction (the [[Holy See]]) is distinct from his secular jurisdiction ([[Vatican City]]). It is the Holy See that conducts international relations; for hundreds of years, the papal court (the [[Roman Curia]]) has functioned as the government of the Catholic Church. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The names "Holy See" and "[[Apostolic See]]" are ecclesiastical terminology for the [[ordinary jurisdiction]] of the Bishop of Rome (including the Roman Curia); the pope's various honors, powers, and privileges within the Catholic Church and the international community derive from his Episcopate of Rome in lineal succession from the [[Saint Peter]], one of the [[twelve apostles]] (see [[Apostolic succession]]). Consequently, Rome has traditionally occupied a central position in the Catholic Church, although this is not necessarily so. The pope derives his pontificate from being bishop of Rome but is not required to live there; according to the Latin formula ''ubi Papa, ibi Curia'', wherever the pope resides is the central government of the Church, provided that the pope is Bishop of Rome. As such, between 1309 and 1378, the popes lived in [[Avignon]], France (see [[Avignon Papacy]]), a period often called the "Babylonian captivity" in allusion to the [[Bible|Biblical]] narrative of [[Jews]] of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]] living as captives in [[Babylonia]].

Though the pope is the diocesan bishop of Rome, he delegates most of the day-to-day work of leading the diocese to the [[cardinal vicar]], who assures direct episcopal oversight of the diocese's pastoral needs, not in his own name but in that of the pope. The current cardinal vicar is [[Angelo De Donatis]], who was appointed to the office in June 2017.

[[File:PapalPolitics2.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''Antichristus'', a woodcut by Lucas Cranach of the pope using the temporal power to grant authority to a generously contributing ruler]]

Though the progressive [[Christianisation]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century did not confer upon bishops civil authority within the state, the gradual withdrawal of imperial authority during the 5th century left the pope the senior imperial civilian official in Rome, as bishops were increasingly directing civil affairs in other cities of the Western Empire. This status as a secular and civil ruler was vividly displayed by [[Pope Leo I]]'s confrontation with [[Attila]] in 452. The first expansion of papal rule outside of Rome came in 728 with the [[Donation of Sutri]], which in turn was substantially increased in 754, when the [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler [[Pippin the Younger]] gave to the pope the land from his conquest of the [[Lombards]]. The pope may have utilized the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to gain this land, which formed the core of the [[Papal States]]. This document, accepted as genuine until the 15th century, states that [[Constantine the Great]] placed the entire Western Empire of Rome under papal rule. In 800, [[Pope Leo III]] [[coronation|crowned]] the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]] as [[Roman emperor]], a major step toward establishing what later became known as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; from that date onward the popes claimed the prerogative to crown the emperor, though the right fell into disuse after the coronation of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530. [[Pius VII]] was present at the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] in 1804 but did not actually perform the crowning. As mentioned above, the pope's sovereignty over the Papal States ended in 1870 with their annexation by Italy.

Popes like [[Alexander VI]], an ambitious if spectacularly corrupt politician, and [[Julius II]], a formidable general and statesman, were not afraid to use power to achieve their own ends, which included increasing the power of the papacy. This political and temporal authority was demonstrated through the papal role in the Holy Roman Empire (especially prominent during periods of contention with the emperors, such as during the pontificates of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] and [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]]). [[Papal bull]]s, [[interdict]], and [[excommunication]] (or the threat thereof) have been used many times to increase papal power. The bull ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' in 1155 authorized King [[Henry II of England]] to invade Ireland. In 1207, [[Innocent III]] placed England under interdict until [[John, King of England|King John]] made his kingdom a [[fiefdom]] to the Pope, complete with yearly [[tribute]], saying, "we offer and freely yield...to our lord Pope Innocent III and his catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom of Ireland with all their rights and appurtenences for the remission of our sins".<ref>Quoted from the [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/innIII-policies.html Medieval Sourcebook]</ref> The Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' in 1493 led to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world into areas of Spanish and Portuguese rule. The bull ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'' in 1570 excommunicated Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] and declared that all her subjects were released from all allegiance to her. The bull ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' in 1582 established the [[Gregorian calendar]].<ref>See [http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/getImage.pl?target=/data/www/NASD/4a7f1db4-5792-415c-be79-266f41eef20a/009/499/PTIFF/00000673.tif&rs=2 selection from ''Concordia Cyclopedia'': Roman Catholic Church, History of] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144949/http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/getImage.pl?target=%2Fdata%2Fwww%2FNASD%2F4a7f1db4-5792-415c-be79-266f41eef20a%2F009%2F499%2FPTIFF%2F00000673.tif&rs=2 |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

===International position===
Under international law, a serving [[head of state]] has [[sovereign immunity]] from the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries, though not from that of international tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/commentary/the-icc-bashir-and-the-immunity-of-heads-of-state/ |first1=Anthony |last1=Dworkin |first2=Katherine |last2=Iliopoulos |title=The International Criminal Court, Bashir, and the Immunity of Heads of State |publisher=Crimesofwar.org |access-date=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809081228/http://www.crimesofwar.org/commentary/the-icc-bashir-and-the-immunity-of-heads-of-state/ |archive-date=9 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZNZ7r4hYL8C |first=Yitiha |last=Simbeye |title=Immunity and International Criminal Law |page=94}}</ref> This immunity is sometimes loosely referred to as "[[diplomatic immunity]]", which is, strictly speaking, the immunity enjoyed by the ''diplomatic representatives'' of a head of state.

International law treats the [[Holy See]], essentially the central government of the Catholic Church, as the juridical equal of a state. It is distinct from the state of [[Vatican City]], existing for many centuries before the foundation of the latter. (It is common for publications and news media to use "the Vatican", "Vatican City", and even "Rome" as [[metonym]]s for the Holy See.) Most countries of the world maintain the same form of diplomatic relations with the Holy See that they entertain with other states. Even countries without those diplomatic relations participate in international organizations of which the Holy See is a full member.

It is as head of the state-equivalent worldwide religious jurisdiction of the Holy See (not of the territory of Vatican City) that the [[U.S. Justice Department]] ruled that the pope enjoys head-of-state immunity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,169909,00.html |title=U.S. Says Pope Immune From Molestation Lawsuit, 2005 |publisher=Fox News |date=20 September 2005 |access-date=11 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128045143/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,169909,00.html |archive-date=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This head-of-state immunity, recognized by the United States, must be distinguished from that envisaged under the United States' [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] of 1976, which, while recognizing the basic immunity of foreign governments from being sued in American courts, lays down nine exceptions, including commercial activity and actions in the United States by agents or employees of the foreign governments.

==Objections to the papacy==
[[File:Antichrist1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Antichristus'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], from Luther's 1521 ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist''. The pope is signing and selling [[indulgence]]s.]]

The pope's claim to authority is either disputed or not recognised at all by other churches. The reasons for these objections differ from denomination to denomination.

===Orthodox, Anglican and Old Catholic churches===
Other traditional Christian churches ([[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Independent Catholic churches]], etc.) accept the doctrine of [[Apostolic succession]] and, to varying extents, papal claims to a primacy of honour, while generally rejecting the pope as the successor to Peter in any other sense than that of other bishops. Primacy is regarded as a consequence of the pope's position as bishop of the original capital city of the [[Roman Empire]], a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th [[canon law|canon]] of the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of ''universal immediate jurisdiction'', or to claims of [[papal infallibility]]. Several of these churches refer to such claims as ''[[ultramontanism]]''.

===Protestant denominations===
{{Main|Historicism (Christianity)}}

In 1973, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' [[Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs]] and the USA National Committee of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in the official [[Catholic–Lutheran dialogue]] included this passage in a larger statement on papal primacy:

{{quote|In calling the pope the "Antichrist", the early [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] stood in a [[Antichrist#Pre-Reformation Western Church accusers|tradition that reached back into the eleventh century]]. Not only dissidents and [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]] but even saints had called the bishop of Rome the "Antichrist" when they wished to castigate his [[abuse of power]]. What Lutherans understood as a [[Papal supremacy|papal claim to unlimited authority]] [[Temporal power (papal)|over everything and everyone]] reminded them of the [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic imagery]] of [[Daniel 11]], a passage that even prior to the Reformation had been applied to the pope as the Antichrist of the [[End time#Christianity|last days]].<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/ecumenical-and-interreligious/ecumenical/lutheran/attitudes-papal-primacy.cfm Differing Attitudes Toward Papal Primacy]</ref>}}

[[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of Christianity reject the claims of [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrine primacy]] of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. These denominations vary from simply not accepting the pope's claim to authority as legitimate and valid, to believing that the pope is the [[Antichrist]]<ref>"Therefore, on the basis of a renewed study of the pertinent Scriptures we reaffirm the statement of the Lutheran Confessions, that 'the Pope is the very Antichrist'" from [http://www.wels.net/about-wels/doctrinal-statements/antichrist Statement on the Antichrist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222233710/http://www.wels.net/about-wels/doctrinal-statements/antichrist |date=22 February 2013 }} from the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], also ''[http://www.ianpaisley.org/antichrist.asp Ian Paisley, The Pope is the Antichrist]''</ref> from 1 John 2:18, the [[Man of Sin]] from 2 Thessalonians 2:3–12,<ref>See Kretzmann's [http://www.kretzmannproject.org/EP_MINOR/2TH_2.htm ''Popular Commentary''], 2 Thessalonians chapter two and [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/JeskeThessalonians.pdf An Exegesis of 2 Thessalonians 2:1–10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321144249/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/JeskeThessalonians.pdf |date=21 March 2014 }} by Mark Jeske</ref> and the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast out of the Earth]] from Revelation 13:11–18.<ref>See See Kretzmann's [http://www.kretzmannproject.org/REV/REV_13.htm ''Popular Commentary''], Revelation Chapter 13</ref>

This sweeping rejection is held by, among others, some denominations of Lutherans: [[Confessional Lutheran]]s hold that the pope is the Antichrist, stating that this article of faith is part of a ''quia'' ("because") rather than ''quatenus'' ("insofar as") subscription to the [[Book of Concord]].

Historically, Protestants objected to the papacy's claim of temporal power over all secular governments, including territorial claims in Italy,<ref>See the [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr3lGJei6fkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r#PPA168,M1 Baltimore Catechism] on the temporal power of the pope over governments and Innocent III's [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/innIII-policies.html Letter to the prefect Acerbius and the nobles of Tuscany]. For objection to this, see the [https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia], p. 564 and 750.</ref> the papacy's complex relationship with secular states such as the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Empires, and the autocratic character of the papal office.<ref>See Luther, [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4 Smalcald Articles, Article four]</ref> In [[Western Christianity]] these objections both contributed to and are products of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

==Antipopes==
{{Main|Antipope|Western Schism}}
Groups sometimes form around [[antipope]]s, who claim the Pontificate without being canonically and properly elected to it.

Traditionally, this term was reserved for claimants with a significant following of cardinals or other clergy. The existence of an antipope is usually due either to doctrinal controversy within the Church ([[heresy]]) or to confusion as to who is the legitimate pope at the time (schism). Briefly in the 15th century, three separate lines of popes claimed authenticity (see [[Western Schism|Papal Schism]]). Even Catholics do not all agree whether certain historical figures were popes or antipopes. Though antipope movements were significant at one time, they are now overwhelmingly minor fringe causes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Other uses of the title "Pope"==
In the earlier centuries of Christianity, the title "Pope", meaning "father", had been used by all bishops. Some popes used the term and others did not. Eventually, the title became associated especially with the Bishop of Rome. In a few cases, the term is used for other Christian clerical authorities.

In English, Catholic priests are still addressed as "father", but the term "pope" is reserved for the head of the church hierarchy.

===In the Catholic Church===
"Black Pope" is a name that was popularly, but unofficially, given to the [[superior general of the Society of Jesus]] due to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits']] importance within the Church. This name, based on the black colour of his cassock, was used to suggest a parallel between him and the "White Pope" (since the time of [[Pius V]] the popes dress in white) and the cardinal prefect of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] (formerly called the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), whose red cardinal's cassock gave him the name of the "Red Pope" in view of the authority over all territories that were not considered in some way Catholic. In the present time this cardinal has power over mission territories for Catholicism, essentially the Churches of Africa and Asia,<ref name="Magister">[http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7049&eng=ylink Sandro Magister] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621082856/http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7049 |date=21 June 2006 }}, Espresso Online.</ref> but in the past his competence extended also to all lands where [[Protestantism|Protestants]] or [[Eastern Christianity]] was dominant. Some remnants of this situation remain, with the result that, for instance, New Zealand is still in the care of this Congregation.

===In the Eastern Churches===
Since the [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|papacy of Heraclas]] in the 3rd century, the bishop of Alexandria in both the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] continues to be called "pope", the former being called "Coptic pope" or, more properly, "[[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle]]" and the latter called "[[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patriarchateofalexandria.com/index.php?lang=en |title=The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa }}</ref>

In the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], it is not unusual for a village priest to be called a "pope" ("поп" ''pop''). However, this should be differentiated from the words used for the head of the Catholic Church (Bulgarian "папа" ''papa'', Russian "папа римский" ''papa rimskiy'').

===In new religious movements and other Christian-related new religious movements===
Some [[new religious movement]]s within Christianity, especially those that have [[Independent Catholicism|disassociated themselves from the Catholic Church]] yet retain a Catholic hierarchical framework, have used the designation "pope" for a founder or current leader. Examples include the African [[Legio Maria|Legio Maria Church]] and the European [[Palmarian Catholic Church]] in Spain. The [[Cao Dai]], a Vietnamese faith that duplicates the Catholic hierarchy, is similarly headed by a pope.

==Lengths of papal reign==
===Longest-reigning popes===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Pius IX]], is the pope with the longest verifiable reign]]

Although the average reign of the pope from the [[Middle Ages]] was a decade, a number of those whose reign lengths can be determined from contemporary historical data are the following:

# [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] (c. 30–64/68): c. 34 – c. 38 years (12,410–13,870 days)
# [[Pope Pius IX|Bl. Pius IX]] (1846–1878): 31 years, 7 months and 23 days (11,560 days)
# [[Pope John Paul II|St. John Paul II]] (1978–2005): 26 years, 5 months and 18 days (9,665 days)
# [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] (1878–1903): 25 years, 5 months and 1 day (9,281 days)
# [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]] (1775–1799): 24 years, 6 months and 15 days (8,962 days)
# [[Pope Adrian I|Adrian I]] (772–795): 23 years, 10 months and 25 days (8,729 days)
# [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] (1800–1823): 23 years, 5 months and 7 days (8,560 days)
# [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] (1159–1181): 21 years, 11 months and 24 days (8,029 days)
# [[Pope Sylvester I|St. Sylvester I]] (314–335): 21 years, 11 months and 1 day (8,005 days)
# [[Pope Leo I|St. Leo I]] (440–461): 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days (7,713 days)
# [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–1644): 20 years, 11 months and 24 days (7,664 days)

During the [[Western Schism]], [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] (1394–1423) ruled for 28 years, seven months and 12 days, which would place him third in the above list. However, since he is regarded as an [[anti-pope]], he is not mentioned in the list above.

===Shortest-reigning popes===
[[File:Urban VII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Urban VII]], the shortest-reigning pope]]
There have been a number of popes whose reign lasted about a month or less. In the following list the number of calendar days includes partial days. Thus, for example, if a pope's reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.
#[[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]] (15–27 September 1590): reigned for 13 calendar days, died before [[papal coronation|coronation]].
#[[Pope Boniface VI|Boniface VI]] (April 896): reigned for 16 calendar days
#[[Pope Celestine IV|Celestine IV]] (25 October&nbsp;– 10 November 1241): reigned for 17 calendar days, died before coronation.
#[[Pope Theodore II|Theodore II]] (December 897): reigned for 20 calendar days
#[[Pope Sisinnius|Sisinnius]] (15 January&nbsp;– 4 February 708): reigned for 21 calendar days
#[[Pope Marcellus II|Marcellus II]] (9 April&nbsp;– 1 May 1555): reigned for 23 calendar days
#[[Pope Damasus II|Damasus II]] (17 July&nbsp;– 9 August 1048): reigned for 24 calendar days
#[[Pope Pius III|Pius III]] (22 September&nbsp;– 18 October 1503): reigned for 27 calendar days
#[[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]] (1–27 April 1605): reigned for 27 calendar days
#[[Pope Benedict V|Benedict V]] (22 May&nbsp;– 23 June 964): reigned for 33 calendar days
#[[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] (26 August&nbsp;– 28 September 1978): reigned for 34 calendar days

[[Pope-elect Stephen|Stephen]] (23–26 March 752) died of [[stroke]] three days after his election, and before his [[consecration]] as a bishop. He is not recognized as a valid pope, but was added to the lists of popes in the 15th century as ''Stephen II'', causing difficulties in enumerating later popes named Stephen. The [[Holy See]]'s ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', in its [[list of popes]] and antipopes, attaches a footnote to its mention of [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II (III)]]:

{{quote|On the death of [[Pope Zachary|Zachary]] the Roman priest Stephen was elected; but, since four days later he died, before his ''[[episcopal consecration|consecratio]]'', which according to the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the time was the true commencement of his pontificate, his name is not registered in the ''Liber Pontificalis'' nor in other lists of the popes.<ref>Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 11*</ref>}}

Published every year by the [[Roman Curia]], the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding [[Pope Leo VIII]], [[Pope Benedict V]] and some mid-11th-century popes.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 12*</ref>
