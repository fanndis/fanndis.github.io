The '''2011 Scottish Parliament election''' was held on Thursday, 5 May 2011 to [[Members of the 4th Scottish Parliament|elect 129 members]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]].

The election delivered the first [[majority government]] since the opening of Holyrood, a remarkable feat as the [[Additional Member System]] used to elect [[Member of Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] was originally implemented to prevent any party achieving an overall parliamentary majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |title=SNP wins majority in Scottish elections |publisher=channel4.com |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref> The Scottish National Party (SNP) won a [[landslide victory|landslide]] of 69 seats, the most the party has ever held at either a Holyrood or Westminster election, allowing leader [[Alex Salmond]] to remain as [[First Minister of Scotland]]. The SNP gained 32 constituencies, twenty two from [[Scottish Labour]], nine from the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] and one from the [[Scottish Conservatives]]. Such was the scale of their gains that, of the 73 constituencies in Scotland, only 20 came to be represented by [[Member of Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] of other political parties. Scottish Labour lost seven seats and suffered their worst election defeat in Scotland since [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], with huge losses in their traditional [[Central Belt]] constituencies and for the first time having to rely on the [[Additional member system|regional lists]] to elect members within these areas. They did, however, remain the largest opposition party. Party leader [[Iain Gray]] announced his resignation following his party's disappointing result.  The [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] were soundly defeated; their popular vote share was cut in half and their seat total reduced from 17 to 5. [[Tavish Scott]] announced his resignation as party leader shortly after the election.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-13321726 | work=BBC News | title=Scots Lib Dem leader Tavish Scott quits post | date=7 May 2011}}</ref> For [[Scottish Conservatives]], the election proved disappointing as their popular vote dropped slightly and their number of seats fell by 2, with party leader [[Annabel Goldie]] also announcing her resignation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13340641 |title=BBC News - Scots Tory leader Annabel Goldie announces resignation |publisher=BBC|date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref>

During the campaign, the four main party leaders engaged in a series of televised debates, as they had in every previous general election. These key debates were held on 29 March ([[STV (TV network)|STV]]), 1 May ([[BBC Scotland|BBC]]), and 3 May (STV). The results of the election were broadcast live on BBC Scotland and STV, on the night of the election.

It was the fourth [[general election]] since the devolved parliament was established in 1999 and was held on the same day as elections to the [[2011 National Assembly for Wales election|National Assembly for Wales]] and the [[2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Northern Ireland Assembly]], as well as [[2011 United Kingdom local elections|English local elections]] and the UK-wide [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum on the alternative vote]].

==Date==
Under the [[Scotland Act 1998]], an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament was held on the first Thursday in May four years after the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]].<ref name="ScotlandAct1">{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 |title=Scotland Act 1998 - Section 2 Ordinary General Elections |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref>

Because of the problems of voter confusion and a [[2007 Scottish Parliament election#Incidents|high number of spoilt ballots in 2007]] due to holding Scottish parliamentary and local elections simultaneously and under different voting systems, the next Scottish local elections were held in [[2012 Scottish local elections|2012]] instead of 2011. This policy decision was contradicted, however, by the staging of the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|Alternative Vote referendum]] on 5 May 2011 as well.<ref name = "date"/> Labour MP [[Ian Davidson (Scottish politician)|Ian Davidson]] expressed opposition to the referendum being staged on the same date as other elections.<ref name = "date"/> [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] [[Michael Moore (UK politician)|Michael Moore]] stated that having the referendum on another date would cost an additional Â£17 million.<ref name = "date">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11444206 |title=Scots politicians oppose AV referendum date|publisher=BBC |work=BBC News|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>

[[British citizen|British]], [[Irish citizen|Irish]], [[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth]] and [[European Union]] citizens living in Scotland who were aged 18 or over on election day were entitled to vote. The deadline to [[Elections in the United Kingdom#Registration procedure|register to vote]] in the election was midnight on Friday 15 April 2011, though anyone who qualified as an [[anonymous elector#United Kingdom|anonymous elector]] had until midnight on Tuesday 26 April 2011 to register.<ref>The deadline for the receipt and determination of anonymous electoral registration applications was the same as the publication date of the notice of alteration to the Electoral Register (i.e. the fifth working day before election day).</ref>

It was held on the same day as elections for Northern Ireland's 26 [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local councils]], the [[2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Northern Irish Assembly]] and [[2011 National Assembly for Wales election|Welsh Assembly]] elections, a number of local elections in England and the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum]].

==Election system, seats, and regions==
{{main|Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011}}The total number of [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs) elected to the Parliament is 129.

The First Periodical Review of the [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|Scottish Parliament's constituencies and regions]] by the [[Boundary Commission for Scotland]] was announced on 3 July 2007. The Commission published its provisional proposals for the regional boundaries in 2009.

The Scottish Parliament uses an [[Additional Members System]], designed to produce approximate [[proportional representation]] for each region.
There are 8 regions each sub-divided into smaller constituencies.
There are a total of 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]].
Each constituency elects one (MSP) by the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] ([[first past the post]]) system of election.
Each region elects seven additional member MSPs using an [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional member]] system.
A modified [[D'Hondt method]], using the constituency results, is used to calculate which additional member MSPs the regions elect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2840087.stm |title=Electoral system: How it works, 02&nbsp;April 2003 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2 April 2003 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_8227000/8227617.stm D'Hondt system], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 September 2009. Retrieved 4 May 2011</ref>

The Scottish Parliament constituencies have not been coterminous with [[Scottish Westminster constituencies]] since the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], when the 72 former Westminster constituencies were replaced with a new set of 59, generally larger, constituencies (see [[Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004]]).

For details of the Revised proposals for constituencies at the Next Scottish Parliament election - [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011]]

The Boundary Commission have also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect "list" members of the Scottish Parliament. The recommendations<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/1st_holyrood/rev_rec_regions/regions_revised_recommendations_map_A2.pdf |title=Revised Recommendations |publisher=Boundary Commission for Scotland |accessdate=26 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612043941/http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/1st_holyrood/rev_rec_regions/regions_revised_recommendations_map_A2.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2011}}</ref> can be summarised below;

==Campaign==

The parliament was dissolved on 22 March 2011 and the campaign began thereafter. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] saw 3 of their candidates drop out of the election during the period 25â28 March: Malcolm McAskill from the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow regional ballot]], Iain Whyte from the [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill & Springburn]] constituency ballot and David Meikle from the Glasgow regional ballot.

The [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] regional candidate for the [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] region [[Hugh O'Donnell (politician)|Hugh O'Donnell]] also withdrew on 27 March, citing discontent with the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition at Westminster.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12874085 |title=BBC News - Scottish elections: Lib Dem candidate quits party |publisher=BBC|date=27 March 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> Another Liberal Democrat, [[John Farquhar Munro]], came out in support of Alex Salmond for First Minister, even though he also claimed not to support the SNP.<ref>{{cite news|author=Andrew Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-12961012 |title=BBC News - Scottish election: John Farquhar Munro backs Salmond |publisher=BBC|date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> In the [[Clydesdale (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clydesdale]] constituency, the Liberal Democrat candidate John Paton-Day failed to lodge his papers in time for the nomination deadline, leaving the constituency as the only one in Scotland with no Liberal Democrat candidate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-12961657 |title=BBC News - Scottish election: Lib Dem fails to lodge papers |publisher=BBC|date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> On 17 April, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader [[Tavish Scott]] described himself as 'uncomfortable' with his Scottish party being 'related' to the Conservatives due to the coalition at Westminster.

==Opinion polls==
{{Further|Opinion polling in the Scottish Parliament election, 2011}}
In March 2011, two months before the election, Labour held a double-digit lead over the SNP in the opinion polls,<ref name="scotsman1" /> 44% to 29%.<ref>[http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/uploads/files/holyrood-voting-intentions-poll-7th-march-2011_1299492491.pdf HOLYROOD VOTING INTENTIONS POLL] - TNS/bmrb, 7 March 2011</ref> The SNP's support subsequently rallied, with the two parties level in April polling. In the final poll on the eve of the election, the SNP were eleven points clear of Labour.<ref name="scotsman1">[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Holyrood-Elections-A-shared-goal.6763342.jp Holyrood Elections: A shared goal but there could only be one winner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925185156/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Holyrood-Elections-A-shared-goal.6763342.jp |date=25 September 2011 }} - The Scotsman, 6 May 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/uploads/files/may-2011-voting-intentions-poll_1304440562.pdf HOLYROOD VOTING INTENTIONS POLL] - TNS/bmrb, 3 May 2011</ref>

==Result==

The election produced a majority SNP government, making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party had commanded a parliamentary majority. The SNP took 16 seats from Labour, many of whose key figures failed to be returned to parliament, although Labour leader [[Iain Gray]] retained [[East Lothian (Scottish Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] by 151 votes. The SNP took a further eight seats from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives. The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the [[Scottish Parliament]] to hold a referendum on [[Scottish independence]].<ref name = "snp win"/>

Labour's defeat was attributed to several factors: the party focused too heavily on criticising the Conservative-led coalition at Westminster, and assumed that former Lib Dem voters would automatically switch their vote to Labour, when in fact they appeared to have haemorrhaged support to the SNP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-13307761|title=Scottish Election: Campaign successes and stinkers|first=Andrew|last=Black|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> [[Jackie Baillie]] compared the result to Labour's performance in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 UK general election]].<ref name = "snp win">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13305522|title=Scottish election: SNP wins election|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> Iain Gray announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour group of MSPs that autumn.<ref name = "snp win"/>

The election saw a rout of the Liberal Democrats, with no victories in mainland constituencies<ref name = "LD collapse">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13318151|title=Scottish election: SNP wins election|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref> and 25 lost deposits (candidates gaining less than five per cent of the vote).<ref name = "LD collapse"/> Leader [[Tavish Scott]] said their performance was due to the Liberal Democrats' involvement in the [[CameronâClegg coalition|Westminster Government]], which had been unpopular with many former LibDem supporters.<ref name="SNPPress"/> Scott resigned as leader two days after the election.<ref name="SNPPress">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13321478|title=Scottish election: SNP press Cameron on Scotland Bill|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 May 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref>

For the Conservatives, the main disappointment was the loss of [[Edinburgh Pentlands (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Pentlands]], the seat of former party leader [[David McLetchie]], to the SNP. McLetchie was elected on the Lothian regional list and the Conservatives only made a net loss of five seats, with leader [[Annabel Goldie]] claiming that their support had held firm.<ref name = "snp win"/> Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] congratulated the SNP on the result, but vowed to campaign for the Union in any independence referendum.<ref name = "snp win"/>

[[George Galloway]], under a Unionist anti-cuts banner, failed to receive enough votes to be elected to the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow regional list]].<ref name = "snp win"/> The [[Scottish Green Party|Scottish Greens]] won two seats, including their co-convenor [[Patrick Harvie]].<ref name = "snp win"/> [[Margo MacDonald]] again won election as an independent on the Lothian regional list.<ref name = "snp win"/>

The SNP's overall majority assured Salmond of another term as First Minister, and he was reelected unopposed on 18 May.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3s_wyP7Hpw Holyrood Roundup, Election of First Minister] from Scottish Parliament's YouTube, 18 May 2011</ref>

==Top target seats of the main parties==
Below are listed all the constituencies which required a [[Swing (United Kingdom)|swing]] of less than 5% from the 2007 result to change hands. Because the election was fought under new boundaries, the figures are based on notional results from 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_09_10_boundaryreport.pdf|title=The New Scottish Parliament Constituencies 2011|date=8 September 2010|publisher=BBC News online|accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>
