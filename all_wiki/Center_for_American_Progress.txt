The Center for American Progress has a youth-engagement organization, [[Generation Progress]], and a sister advocacy organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAPAF).

==History and mission==

The Center for American Progress was created in 2003 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] alternative to think tanks such as the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]].<ref>[[Robert Dreyfuss]], [https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/idea-factory-democrats/ "An Idea Factory for the Democrats"], ''The Nation'' March 1, 2004</ref> In 2011, the ''Washington Post's'' Jason Horowitz described the Center for American Progress as "Washington’s leading liberal think tank," and "an incessant advocate for a broad progressive agenda and as such, a sharp thorn in President Obama’s left side. Horowitz further concluded that the Center, more broadly, had since become one of "Washington’s leading liberal think tanks."<ref name="WaPo2011">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house/think-tank-post-puts-spotlight-on-veteran-democratic-operative-neera-tanden/2011/11/01/gIQAn6fpjM_story.html |title=Think-tank post puts spotlight on veteran Democratic operative Neera Tanden |last=Horowitz |first=Jason |work=The Washington Post|date=November 3, 2011 |access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref>

Since its inception, the center has assembled a group of high-profile senior fellows, among them, [[Lawrence Korb]], [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Assistant Secretary of Defense]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]]; [[Gene Sperling]], Director of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] under Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and Barack Obama; [[Ruy Teixeira]], [[political science|political scientist]] and author of ''The Emerging Democratic Majority''; and, most recently, former [[United States Senate Minority Leader|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Tom Daschle]] and [[Elizabeth Edwards]], late wife of former presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator from North Carolina [[John Edwards]]. [[Sarah Rosen Wartell]], a co-founder and executive vice-president of the center, has been named President of the [[Urban Institute]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/901469.html|title=Sarah Rosen Wartell, Think Tank Executive and Housing Finance Expert, to be the Urban Institute's Third President|first=Urban|last=Institute|date=December 20, 2011|website=webarchive.urban.org}}</ref>

The center helped Congressman [[John Murtha]] (D-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) develop "strategic redeployment",<ref name="strategicredeployment">[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/09/05/strategic_redeployment.html CAP article, strategic redeployment].

Citing Podesta's influence in the formation of the [[Obama Administration]], [[Michael Scherer]] in a November 2008 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that "not since the [[Heritage Foundation]] helped guide [[Ronald Reagan]]'s transition in 1981 has a single outside group held so much sway".<ref>Scherer, Michael (November 21, 2008).

===ThinkProgress===
{{Main|ThinkProgress}}
''ThinkProgress'', active during the years 2005-2019, was an American progressive news website affiliated with the Center for American Progress but with editorial independence. In September 2019, 'ThinkProgress" was shut down when CAP was unable to find a publisher willing to take it over.  The news site was then "folded into CAP's online presence" to "focus on analysis from CAP scholars and CAP Action staff."<ref name=DBShutdown>{{cite news |date=September 6, 2019 |title=ThinkProgress, a Top Progressive News Site, Has Shut Down |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/thinkprogress-a-top-progressive-news-site-is-shutting-down |work=Daily Beast |access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name="TP_Hill">{{Cite web |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/460268-liberal-news-site-thinkprogress-shutting-down |title=Liberal news site ThinkProgress shutting down |last=Frazin |first=Rachel |work=The Hill |quote=Liberal news website ThinkProgress is shutting down after its parent organization said it was unable to find a new publisher for the site. |date=September 6, 2019 |access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

==Policies==

===Health care===

In 2017, the Center opposed Bernie Sanders' single-payer health plan.<ref>[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/single-payer-health-care-medicare-obamacare-sanders-clinton-democrats/ Democrats Against Single Payer] Single-payer health care has always been a goal of the Left. But Democrats have turned it into a punching bag. Branko Marcetic. Jacobin. 03.29.2017</ref> Critics said that this was because of funding from the health care industry, such as The [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], the [[Health Care Service Corporation]] and [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], who would be eliminated under Sanders' plan.<ref>[http://billmoyers.com/story/disappointed-democratic-party-platform-follow-money/ Disappointed By the Democratic Party Platform?

==Criticism==
===Pro-UAE, pro-Saudi policy===
In October 2016, the ''Intercept'' reported that [[United Arab Emirates]] Ambassador to the US [[Yousef Al Otaiba]] praised "a [https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/17125124/MiddleEast-report-print.pdf CAP report] released [in October 2016] that advocates for continued cooperation with Gulf states like [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jilani |first1=Zaid |title=At Hillary Clinton’s Favorite Think Tank, a Doubling Down on Anti-Iran, Pro-Saudi Policy |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/10/26/at-hillary-clintons-favorite-think-tank-a-doubling-down-on-anti-iran-pro-saudi-policy/ |work=The Intercept |date=October 26, 2016}}</ref>

In January 2019, two CAP staffers were fired after an investigation concerning the leaking of an internal email exchange involving discussions over the phrasing of CAP’s response to the murder of ''The Washington Post'' contributing columnist [[Jamal Khashoggi]].  CAP released a statement noting that while they conducted an investigation into the leaks, this was not the cause for the firings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amid Internal Investigation Over Leaks to Media, the Center for American Progress Fires Two Staffers |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/01/16/center-for-american-progress-cap-uae-leak/ |work=The Intercept |date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

===Lack of transparency for funding sources===
Some [[open government]] groups, such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] and the [[Campaign Legal Center]], criticized the Center's failure to disclose its contributors, particularly because it was so influential to the Obama administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16318.html |title=Where's transparency of Podesta group? |author=Ben Smith and Chris Frates |publisher=Politico.com |date= December 9, 2008 |access-date=2011-07-07}}</ref><ref name="PKties">{{Cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/opinion/29krugman.html |title=March of the Peacocks |last=Krugman|first= Paul|date=January 28, 2010| work=The New York Times|access-date=January 30, 2010}}</ref> CAP's website states that corporate donors are not allowed to remain anonymous.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/c3-our-supporters/|title=Our Supporters|website=Center for American Progress|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> Nathan Robinson, writing in 2018 for ''[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]'' wrote that CAP "continues to conceal the identities of many of its largest donors."

===Israel controversy===
CAP was criticized by several Jewish organizations after some employees "publicly used language that could be construed as [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel]] or even [[anti-Semitic]]".<ref name=WP>{{cite news|last=Wallsten|first=Peter |title =Center for American Progress, group tied to Obama, under fire from Israel advocates | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/center-for-america-progress-group-tied-to-obama-accused-of-anti-semitic-language/2012/01/17/gIQAcrHXAQ_story.html | work=The Washington Post |access-date=January 24, 2012|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref> Bloggers associated with CAP published several posts using phrases such as "[[Israel and the apartheid analogy|apartheid]]" and "Israel-firsters", which the [[American Jewish Committee]] described as "hateful" and called on CAP to disassociate themselves from these statements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=251699|title=NGOs slam ‘anti-Semitic’ US think tank comments| first=Benjamin|last=Weinthal| work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=16 August 2016}}</ref> The latter phrase, "Israel-firsters", which was used in reference to US supporters of Israel, was also criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and described as anti-semitic. Officials at CAP said the “inappropriate” language came only in personal tweets—not on CAP's website or its ThinkProgress blog. The Tweets were deleted, and the authors apologized.<ref name=WP/>

Other writers, however, criticized CAP for what they saw as censorship of reasonable comments critical of [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied West Bank]] and other policies. Based on leaked emails, columnist [[Glenn Greenwald]], for example, wrote that CAP had deleted references to Israeli settlement policies in reports by their staffers.<ref name="greenwald">[https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/ Leaked Emails From Pro-Clinton Group Reveal Censorship of Staff on Israel, AIPAC Pandering, Warped Militarism], Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept, Nov. 5, 2015</ref><ref name="Nation">{{cite web | last=Gharib| first=Ali | title=Why Is the Center for American Progress Hosting Benjamin Netanyahu? | website=[[The Nation]] | date=2015-10-28 | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-is-the-center-for-american-progress-hosting-benjamin-netanyahu/ | access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref><ref name="DemocracyNow">[http://www.democracynow.org/2015/11/12/center_for_american_progress_hosts_netanyahu Center for American Progress Hosts Netanyahu as Leaked Emails Show Group Censored Staff on Israel], By Nermeen Shaikh, Democracy Now, November 12, 2015</ref><ref name="Alternet">[http://www.alternet.org/story/153468/has_the_israel_lobby_gone_too_far Has the Israel Lobby Gone Too Far?] Will a recent attack on progressive journalists help spark a sea-change in the debate over Middle East policy?

Greenwald and others also criticized CAP for hosting a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], while Netanyahu was hostile to the Obama Administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/09/should-the-center-for-american-progress-host-a-speech-by-the-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu/|title=Center for American Progress under fire for hosting speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu|work=The Washington Post|date=9 November 2015|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> Greenwald described CAP's positions as "servitude to [[AIPAC]] and pandering to Netanyahu."<ref name="greenwald"/> Eighteen organizations and over one hundred academics signed an open letter, circulated by [[Jewish Voice for Peace]] and the [[Arab American Institute]], against the meeting. 26,300 people signed a petition opposing the meeting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center for American Progress under fire for hosting speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/09/should-the-center-for-american-progress-host-a-speech-by-the-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu/|work=The Washington Post|date=November 9, 2015}}</ref>

===WikiLeaks 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign controversy===
After the release by [[WikiLeaks]] of hacked [[Podesta emails]], the Center for American Progress was criticized for emails sent between John Halpin, a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, and [[Jennifer Palmieri]], a Hillary Clinton campaign team member.<ref name="washingtonpostcatholic">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/12/wikileaks-emails-show-clinton-spokeswoman-joking-about-catholics-and-evangelicals|title=WikiLeaks emails appear to show Clinton spokeswoman joking about Catholics and evangelicals|first=Sarah|last=Pulliam Bailey|work=The Washington Post|access-date=April 25, 2018|quote=The latest batch of documents published by WikiLeaks appears to show Hillary Clinton's campaign communications director joking with a confidant about Catholics and evangelicals in emails sent to John Podesta, chairman of Clinton’s campaign.}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' characterized the comments as "joking"; Kellyanne Conway and others called them anti-Catholic attacks.<ref name="washingtonpostcatholic"/><ref name=cnncatholic2>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/religious-leaders-hillary-clinton-campaign-wikileaks|title=First on CNN: Religious leaders slam Clinton campaign over emails |first1=Dana|last1=Bash|first2=Daniella|last2=Diaz|publisher=CNN|access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>

===Michael Bloomberg===

In February 2020, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the center had removed reporting of [[Police surveillance in New York City|New York City police surveillance of Muslim communities]] from a 2015 report, allegedly out of deference to [[Michael Bloomberg]], who had given the center grants worth $1.5 million. [[Yasmine Taeb]], an author of the report, said that they were instructed to remove the chapter or make dramatic revisions, alleging this was "because of how it was going to be perceived by Mayor Bloomberg." CAP officials disputed her account, characterizing the changes as editorial decisions: detailed discussion of NYC policing was off-topic because the report had been "commissioned to examine right-wing groups targeting Muslims with explicit bigotry and conspiracy theories." Bloomberg told ''The New York Times'' reporters he was unaware of any such dispute at CAP; in 2017, he contributed an additional $400,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Alexander |last2=Russell |first2=Kari |title=Bloomberg’s Billions: How the Candidate Built an Empire of Influence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/15/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-spending.html |access-date=6 April 2020 |work=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>
