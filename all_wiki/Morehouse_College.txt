'''Morehouse College''' is a [[Private college|private]] [[historically black college|historically black]] [[Men's colleges in the United States|men's]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Anchored by its main campus of {{convert|61|acre|ha|sp=us}} near [[downtown Atlanta]], the college has a variety of residential dorms and academic buildings east of [[Ashview Heights]]. Along with [[Spelman College]], [[Clark Atlanta University]], and the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]], the college is a member of the [[Atlanta University Center]] consortium. Founded by [[William J. White (journalist)|William Jefferson White]] in 1867 in response to [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Adoption|the liberation]] of enslaved African-Americans following the [[American Civil War]], Morehouse adopted a [[seminary]] university model and stressed religious instruction, in the [[Baptist]] tradition. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the college experienced rapid albeit financially unstable institutional growth by establishing a [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts]] curriculum. The three-decade tenure of [[Benjamin Mays]] during the mid-20th century led to strengthened finances, an enrollment boom, and increased academic competitiveness. The college has played a key role in the development of the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Racial inequality in the United States|racial equality in the United States]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kelly|first=Jason|date=January 1, 2013|title=Benjamin Mays found a voice for civil rights|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/features/benjamin_mays/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=The University of Chicago|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Clint|date=November 3, 2018|title=Why Historically Black Colleges Are Enjoying a Renaissance|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/04/black-colleges-universities-race-class-gender-sexuality/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 1, 2020|website=National Geographic Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
===Establishment===
Just two years after the [[American Civil War]], the Augusta Institute was founded by the [[William J. White (journalist)|William Jefferson White]], an Atlanta Baptist minister and cabinetmaker (William Jefferson White's half brother James E. Tate, was one of the founders of Atlanta University, now known as Clark Atlanta University), with the support of the Rev. Richard C. Coulter, a former slave from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the Rev. Edmund Turney, organizer of the [[Wayland Seminary|National Theological Institute]] for educating freedmen in Washington, D.C.<ref name="NewGA"/> The institution was founded to educate African American men in theology and education and was located in Springfield Baptist Church ([[Augusta, Georgia]]), the oldest independent black church in the United States. The institution moved from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1879. The school received sponsorship from the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]], an organization that helped establish several historically black colleges.<ref name="NewGA"/><ref name="Brawley 1917 135–141">{{cite book |last=Brawley|first=Benjamin|title=History of Morehouse College|year=1917|publisher=Morehouse College|location=Atlanta|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historymorehous00brawgoog/page/n165 135]–141 |url=https://archive.org/details/historymorehous00brawgoog|quote=Benjamin Griffith Brawley.}}</ref> The Institute's first president was Rev. Joseph T. Robert (1871–1884) (father of [[Henry Martyn Robert|Brigadier General Henry Martyn Robert]], author of [[Robert's Rules of Order]]). An anti-slavery Baptist minister from South Carolina and 1828 graduate of [[Brown University]], Robert raised funds, taught the classes, and stabilized the institution.

===Early years===
[[File:Morehouse College courtyard entrance.jpg|thumb|left|A view of an entrance to the campus' courtyard.]]

In 1879, the institute moved to Atlanta and changed its name to the Atlanta Baptist Seminary.<ref name="NewGA"/> It later acquired a {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in downtown Atlanta. In 1885, Samuel T. Graves became the second president. That year the seminary moved to its present location, on land donated by prominent Baptist and industrialist, [[John D. Rockefeller]]. In 1890, George Sale became the seminary's third president.

In 1906 [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]] became the first African-American president and led the institution's growth in enrollment and academic stature.<ref name="NewGA"/> He envisioned an academically rigorous college that would be the antithesis to [[Booker T. Washington]]'s view of agricultural and trade-focused education for African-Americans. In 1913, the college was renamed Morehouse College, in honor of [[Henry Lyman Morehouse|Henry L. Morehouse]], corresponding secretary of the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] (who had long organized Rockefeller and the Society's support for the College).<ref name="NewGA"/><ref name="Brawley 1917 135–141"/> Morehouse entered into a cooperative agreement with Clark College and Spelman College in 1929 and later expanded the association to form the [[Atlanta University Center]].<ref name="NewGA"/>

[[Samuel Archer|Samuel H. Archer]] became the fifth president of the college in 1931 and selected the school colors, maroon and white, to reflect his own alma mater, [[Colgate University]]. [[Benjamin Mays]] became president in 1940.<ref name="NewGA"/> Mays, who would be a mentor to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], presided over the growth in international enrollment and reputation. During the 1960s, Morehouse students were actively involved in the [[American civil rights movement|civil rights movement]] in Atlanta.<ref name="NewGA"/> Mays' speeches were instrumental in shaping the personal development of Morehouse students during his tenure.

In 1967, Hugh M. Gloster became the seventh president. The following year, the college's [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Honors Society was founded. In 1975, Gloster established the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]], which became independent from Morehouse College in 1981. Gloster also established a dual-degree program in engineering with the Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Michigan and Boston University.<ref name="morehouse.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.morehouse.edu/about/pdf/FBE4.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143327/http://www.morehouse.edu/about/pdf/FBE4.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=2010-05-27|title=Morehouse College Fact Book 2004-2008|page=7|accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Morehouse celebrated several historic milestones in 2013.  One century prior, in 1913, Atlanta Baptist College was renamed Morehouse College after [[Henry Lyman Morehouse]], corresponding secretary for the American Baptist Home Mission Society.  2013 was also the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, when Morehouse graduate [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], class of 1948, delivered his iconic "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].  The year also marked the 50th anniversary of King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail."  The College also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the "A Candle in the Dark" Gala, which is an annual event that honors some of the world's leaders and raises scholarship funds for Morehouse students.

==Administration and organization==
Morehouse's governing body is its Board of Trustees.  The Morehouse Board of Trustees has 37 members, including three student trustees and three faculty trustees. As of December 2014, five of the six executive board members and seven of the 31 general trustees are Morehouse alumni.

The president of the college is the senior executive officer, appointed officially by the Board of Trustees.  The current President of Morehouse is [[David A. Thomas (academic)|David A. Thomas]]. The President's Office has several leaders within its Executive Leadership Team including Academic Affairs (headed by the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs), General Counsel, Business and Finance, Marketing and Communications, Information Technology, Institutional Advancement, External Relations, and Student Affairs.

Morehouse's majors and programs are divided into three divisions: the Division of Business Administration & Economics; the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the Division of Science & Mathematics.  Each division is headed by a dean.

Morehouse's students are represented by two main bodies.  The Morehouse Student Government Association is an executive board with 13 members who are elected annually.  There is also the Campus Alliance for Student Activities (CASA), a 17-member board responsible for co-curricular planning across campus.

Morehouse is also a member of the [[Atlanta University Center]], a consortium of the historically black colleges and universities [[Spelman College]], [[Clark Atlanta University]], the [[Interdenominational Theological Center]], and [[Morehouse School of Medicine]].  The AUC campuses are co-located in the city of Atlanta, which provides an opportunity for cross-registration and social intermingling amongst the students there, particularly the undergraduate population.

In October 2009, Morehouse College initiated a campus wide attire policy that prohibits students from wearing women's clothes, [[Grill (jewelry)|jewelry on their teeth]], [[pajamas]] as classroom attire, [[do-rag|tight fitting caps or bandannas]] on their heads, or [[Sagging (fashion)|pants which hang below the waist]] at official college-sponsored events. This dress code is part of the ''Five Wells'' which holds that "Morehouse Men are Renaissance Men with a social conscience and global perspective who are Well-Read, Well-Spoken, Well-Traveled, Well-Dressed and Well-Balanced."<ref>[http://giving.morehouse.edu/Document.Doc?id=37 "The Soul of Morehouse and the Future of the Mystique: President's Town Hall Meeting"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601050137/http://giving.morehouse.edu/Document.Doc?id=37 |date=2013-06-01 }} (Robert M.

==Oprah Winfrey Scholars==
In 1990, [[Oprah Winfrey]] pledged to put 100 deserving young men through Morehouse.  She made a donation to establish the "Oprah Winfrey Endowed Scholarship Fund".  The school uses the fund to select deserving students based on academic achievement and financial need.  Selected students are deemed "Oprah Scholars" or "Sons of Oprah".  Their financial support covers most of the costs of their education including prior student debt.<ref name="BNS">{{cite web|url=http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2011/05/24/story-columbus-man-credits-oprah-college-scholarship.html|title=Columbus Man Credits Oprah For College Education|date=24 May 2011|website=10tv.com}}</ref> Recipients must maintain their grade point average and provide additional volunteer support to the community.<ref name="CCR">{{cite web|url=http://coastalcourier.com/m/archives/32495/|title=Local Oprah Scholar on final show|website=Coastalcourier.com|access-date=2015-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004072800/http://coastalcourier.com/m/archives/32495|archive-date=2015-10-04|url-status = dead|df=}}</ref>

In 2004 Winfrey increased her donation by $5&nbsp;million for a total donation of $12&nbsp;million.  The fund has since supported over 400 students. In 2011, several hundred Oprah Scholars surprised Winfrey by showing up at her [[The Oprah Winfrey Show#Final episodes|final TV show]] carrying candles to thank her for her generosity.  They, in turn, pledged $300,000 to help educate future Morehouse students.<ref name = "DIV">{{cite web|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/15709/|title=Oprah's Generosity Spurs Past Morehouse Scholarship Recipients to Pledge New Scholarship Funding|date=27 May 2011|website=Diverseeducation.com}}</ref>
