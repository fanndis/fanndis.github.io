JPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies since 1996, including [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]], [[Bank One]], [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Washington Mutual]]. Going back further, its predecessors include major banking firms among which are [[Chemical Bank]], [[Manufacturers Hanover]], [[First Chicago Bank]], [[National Bank of Detroit]], [[Texas Commerce Bank]], [[Providian Financial]] and [[Great Western Bank]]. The company's oldest predecessor institution, the [[The Manhattan Company|Bank of the Manhattan Company]], was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by [[Aaron Burr]].

===Chase Manhattan Bank===
{{Main|Chase Manhattan Bank}}
[[File:Chase logo pre historical.jpg|thumb|The logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1954]]

The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] was formed upon the 1955 purchase of [[Chase National Bank]] (established in 1877) by the [[The Manhattan Company|Bank of the Manhattan Company]] (established in 1799),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/document/shorthistory.pdf |title=The History of J.P.

The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of [[Aaron Burr]], who transformed The Manhattan Company from a water carrier into a bank.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/nyregion/hamilton-burr-and-the-great-waterworks-ruse.html|title=Hamilton, Burr and the Great Waterworks Ruse|last=Schulz|first=Bill|date=2016-07-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

According to page 115 of ''An Empire of Wealth'' by [[John Steele Gordon]], the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:

<blockquote>At the turn of the nineteenth century, obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature. This of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s political enemy—and eventual murderer—[[Aaron Burr]] was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company, called the Manhattan Company, to provide clean water to New York City. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today J. P. Morgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States.</blockquote>

Led by [[David Rockefeller]] during the 1970s and 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banking concerns, with leadership positions in syndicated lending, treasury and securities services, credit cards, mortgages, and retail financial services. Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s, it was acquired by [[Chemical Bank]] in 1996, retaining the Chase name.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Before its merger with J.P. Morgan & Co., the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions. In 1999, it acquired San Francisco-based [[Hambrecht & Quist]] for $1.35&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/29/business/chase-agrees-to-acquire-hambrecht-quist.html|title=Chase Agrees to Acquire Hambrecht & Quist|last1=Kahn|first1=Joseph|date=1999-09-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-30|last2=McGeehan|first2=Patrick|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In April 2000, UK-based [[Robert Fleming & Co.]] was purchased by the new Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955444046817267542|title=Chase to Acquire Robert Fleming In $7.73 Billion Stock-Cash Deal|last=Journal|first=Michael R.

===Chemical Banking Corporation===
{{Main|Chemical Bank}}
The New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its [[charter]] to perform banking activities and created the [[Chemical Bank of New York]]. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with [[Corn Exchange Bank]] in 1954, [[Texas Commerce Bank]] (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in 1991 (the first major bank merger "among equals"). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of [[leveraged buyout]] transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched [[Chemical Venture Partners]] to invest in [[private equity]] transactions alongside various [[financial sponsor]]s. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a [[leveraged finance|syndicated leveraged finance]] business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of the pioneering investment banker, [[James B. Lee, Jr.|Jimmy Lee]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3522103.arc.htm Jimmy Lee's Global Chase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628221303/http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3522103.arc.htm |date=June 28, 2011 }}.

''The New York Times'', August 11, 1995</ref> At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of [[assets]] or [[deposit market share]]).

In 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/29/us/banking-s-new-giant-deal-chase-chemical-agree-merge-10-billion-deal-creating.html|title=Banking's New Giant: The Deal; Chase and Chemical Agree to Merge in $10 Billion Deal Creating Largest U.s.

In August 1914, [[Henry P. Davison]], a Morgan partner, made a deal with the [[Bank of England]] to make J.P. Morgan & Co. the monopoly underwriter of [[war bonds]] for the UK and France.

In the 1930s, J.P.

In 1935, after being barred from the securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, [[Henry S.

[[File:Bear Stearns Logo.svg|thumb|The Bear Stearns logo]]
At the end of 2007, [[Bear Stearns]] was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of the year.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|last=Tracy|first=Justin Baer and Ryan|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ten-years-after-the-bear-stearns-bailout-nobody-thinks-it-would-happen-again-1520959233|title=Ten Years After the Bear Stearns Bailout, Nobody Thinks It Would Happen Again|date=2018-03-13|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-02-10|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> On Friday, March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove [[insolvent]], and on March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23630235|title=Bear Stearns Gets Bailout From the Federal Reserve|last=CNBC.com|date=2008-03-14|website=www.cnbc.com|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>

On March 16, 2008, after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a [[stock swap]] worth $2.00 per share or $240&nbsp;million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days.<ref name=":5" /> In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows.<ref>{{cite web|first=Francesco|last=Guerrera|title=Bear races to forge deal with JPMorgan|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e2206ed2-f380-11dc-b6bc-0000779fd2ac.html|work=Financial Times|date=March 16, 2008|access-date=March 16, 2008}}</ref> On March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for $236&nbsp;million.<ref name=":4" /> The stock swap agreement was signed that night.<ref>{{cite news| first=James| last=Quinn| title=JPMorgan Chase bags bargain Bear Stearns| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2786381/JP-Morgan-Chase-bags-bargain-Bear-Stearns.html| work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=March 19, 2008| access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

On March 24, 2008, after public discontent over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share.<ref name=":4" /> Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns using newly issued shares at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board, representing another 10% of the share capital, that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on May 30, 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=313372| title=JPMorgan Chase Completes Bear Stearns Acquisition (NYSE:JPM)| website=Investor.shareholder.com| access-date=November 12, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113112824/https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=313372| archive-date=November 13, 2017| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Washington Mutual===

[[File:Wamu.svg|thumb|The Washington Mutual logo prior to its 2008 acquisition by JPMorgan Chase]]

On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of [[Washington Mutual]] from the [[receivership]] of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]. That night, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations, and deposits to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.836&nbsp;billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. As a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their [[Equity investment|equity]].<ref>Ellis, David.

The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.

===2013 settlement===
On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.<ref>[https://money.cnn.com/2013/11/19/investing/jpmorgan-mortgage-settlement/index.html JPMorgan agrees to $13 billion mortgage settlement].

Conduct at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to their 2008 acquisitions accounted for much of the alleged wrongdoing. The agreement did not settle criminal charges.<ref>[http://money.msn.com/investing/post--jp-morgan-to-pay-dollar13-billion-in-deal-with-us JPMorgan to pay $13 billion in deal with US] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192044/http://money.msn.com/investing/post--jp-morgan-to-pay-dollar13-billion-in-deal-with-us |date=October 29, 2013 }}.

JPMorgan had been chosen by the county commissioners to refinance the county's sewer debt, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] had alleged that JPMorgan made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal and made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps.<ref>Braun, Martin Z. & Selway, William (November 4, 2009), [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aKdo.y7rr1ys&pos=3 "JPMorgan Ends SEC Alabama Swap Probe for $722&nbsp;million"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131100131/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aKdo.y7rr1ys&pos=3 |date=January 31, 2010 }}, [[Bloomberg L.P.]].

===Failure to comply with client money rules in the UK===
In June 2010, J.P. Morgan Securities was fined a record [[pounds sterling|£]]33.32&nbsp;million ($49.12&nbsp;million) by the UK [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) for failing to protect an average of £5.5&nbsp;billion of clients' money from 2002 to 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8995981/PwC-fined-record-1.4m-over-JP-Morgan-audit.html |title=PwC fined record £1.4m over JPMorgan audit |date=January 5, 2012 |last=White |first=Anna |work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London}}</ref><ref name=AFXnews/> 
FSA requires financial firms to keep clients' funds in separate accounts to protect the clients in case such a firm becomes insolvent.

===Mortgage overcharge of active military personnel===
In January 2011, JPMorgan Chase admitted that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages, including active-duty personnel in Afghanistan. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed on more than a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active-duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was "grim" and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41043127 "No. 2 bank overcharged troops on mortgages"], [[NBC News]], January 17, 2011</ref> Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed.

===Truth in Lending Act litigation===
In 2008 and 2009, 14 lawsuits were filed against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts on behalf of Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the [[Truth in Lending Act]], breached its contract with the consumers, and committed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, with little or no notice, increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.<ref>{{cite news| title=JPMorgan Chase settles with credit card customers for $100 million| url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/jpmorgan-chase-settles-credit-card-customers-100-million-908078| date=July 24, 2012| first1=Andrew| last1=Longstreth| first2=Jonathan| last2=Stempel| work=[[NBC News]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122180104/https://www.nbcnews.com/business/jpmorgan-chase-settles-credit-card-customers-100-million-908078| archive-date=November 22, 2012}}</ref>

===Alleged manipulation of energy market===
In July 2013, The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) approved a stipulation and consent agreement under which JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation (JPMVEC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $410 million in penalties and [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]] to ratepayers for allegations of [[market manipulation]] stemming from the company's bidding activities in electricity markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 through November 2012. JPMVEC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million to the [[U.S. Treasury]] and to disgorge $125 million in unjust profits. JPMVEC admitted the facts set forth in the agreement, but neither admitted nor denied the violations.<ref name=ferc-2013>{{cite web| title=FERC, JPMorgan Unit Agree to $410 Million in Penalties, Disgorgement to Ratepayers| url=https://www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2013/2013-3/07-30-13.asp| access-date=August 5, 2013| publisher=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission| date=July 30, 2013}}</ref>

The case stemmed from multiple referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC's bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants that were usually out of the money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates.<ref name=ferc-2013/>

FERC investigators further determined that JPMVEC knew that the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO received no benefit from making inflated payments to the company, thereby defrauding the ISOs by obtaining payments for benefits that the company did not deliver beyond the routine provision of energy. FERC investigators also determined that JPMVEC's bids displaced other generation and altered day ahead and real-time prices from the prices that would have resulted had the company not submitted the bids.<ref name=ferc-2013/>

Under the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], Congress directed FERC to detect, prevent, and appropriately sanction the gaming of energy markets. According to FERC, the Commission approved the settlement as in the public interest.<ref name=ferc-2013/>

===Criminal investigation into obstruction of justice===
FERC's investigation of energy market manipulations led to a subsequent investigation into possible obstruction of justice by employees of JPMorgan Chase.<ref name=flitter-2013>{{cite news| last=Flitter| first=Emily| title=Exclusive: JPMorgan subject of obstruction probe in energy case| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-jpm-ferc-doj-idUSBRE9830QM20130904| access-date=September 4, 2013| agency=Reuters|date=September 4, 2013| archive-date=November 5, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105160908/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-jpm-ferc-doj-idUSBRE9830QM20130904|url-status=live}}</ref> Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|US Attorney's Office in Manhattan]] were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation.<ref name=flitter-2013/> The reported impetus for the investigation was a letter from Massachusetts Senators [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Edward Markey]], in which they asked FERC why no action was taken against people who impeded the FERC investigation.<ref name=flitter-2013/> At the time of the FBI investigation, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was also looking into whether JPMorgan Chase employees impeded the FERC investigation.<ref name=flitter-2013/> [[Reuters]] reported that JPMorgan Chase was facing over a dozen investigations at the time.<ref name=flitter-2013/>

===Sanctions violations===
On August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) regime. The U.S. Department of Treasury released the following civil penalties information under the heading: "JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Settles Apparent Violations of Multiple Sanctions Programs":

===National Mortgage Settlement===
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com/faq| title=Joint State-Federal Mortgage Servicing Settlement FAQ| website=Nationalmortgagesettlement.com| access-date=June 15, 2015}}</ref> The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/business/states-negotiate-26-billion-agreement-for-homeowners.html| title=Mortgage Plan Gives Billions to Homeowners, but With Exceptions| date=February 10, 2012| newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards.

In August 2013, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was being investigated by the [[United States Department of Justice]] over its offerings of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] leading up to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. The company said that the Department of Justice had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of [[subprime]] and [[Alt-A]] residential mortgage securities during the period 2005 to 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/uk-jpmorgan-probes-idUKBRE9761A420130807 |title=JPMorgan faces criminal and civil probes over mortgages |agency=Reuters |date=August 7, 2013}}</ref>

==="Sons and Daughters" hiring program===
In November 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $264 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges involving a systematic bribery scheme spanning 2006 to 2013 in which the bank secured business deals in Hong Kong by agreeing to hire hundreds of friends and relatives of Chinese government officials, resulting in more than $100 million in revenue for the bank.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Merle|first1=Renae|title=JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in fines for bribing foreign officials by hiring their friends and family|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/11/17/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-264-million-in-fines-for-bribing-foreign-officials-by-hiring-their-friends-and-family/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=July 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Madoff fraud===
{{Further|Madoff investment scandal}}
[[Bernie Madoff]] opened a business account at Chemical Bank in 1986 and maintained it until 2008, long after Chemical acquired Chase.

In 2010, [[Irving Picard]], the SIPC receiver appointed to liquidate Madoff's company, alleged that JPMorgan failed to prevent Madoff from defrauding his customers. According to the suit, Chase "knew or should have known" that Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. However, Chase did not report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it notified the UK [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]. Picard argued that even after Morgan's investment bankers reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, Chase's retail banking division did not put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/020311madoffjpm.pdf |title=Madoff trustee suit against JPMorgan Chase |access-date=November 27, 2013}}</ref> The receiver's suit against J.P.

In the fall of 2013, JPMorgan began talks with prosecutors and regulators regarding compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer banking regulations in connection with Madoff.

On January 7, 2014, JPMorgan agreed to pay a total of $2.05 billion in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal charges related to its role in the Madoff scandal. The government filed a two-count [[criminal information]] charging JPMorgan with Bank Secrecy Act violations, but the charges will be dismissed within two years provided that JPMorgan reforms its anti-money laundering procedures and cooperates with the government in its investigation. The bank agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion.

The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of shareholders against Chief Executive [[Jamie Dimon]] and other high-ranking JPMorgan employees, used statements made by [[Bernie Madoff]] during interviews conducted while in prison in [[Butner, North Carolina]] claiming that JPMorgan officials knew of the fraud. The lawsuit stated that "JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them ... But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits, JPMorgan - at its highest level - chose to turn a blind eye."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-madoff-idUSBREA1J21W20140220 |title=Madoff said JPMorgan executives knew of his fraud: lawsuit |author= Jonathan Stempel  |work=Reuters}}</ref>

=== Paying Lip Service ===
On May 14, 2020, ''[[Financial Times]]'', citing a report which revealed how companies are treating employees, their supply chains and other stakeholders, following the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], documented that JP Morgan Asset Management alongside [[Fidelity Investments]] and [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]] have been accused of paying lip services to cover human rights violations. The UK based media also referenced that a few of the world’s biggest fund houses took the action in order to lessen the impact of abuses, such as [[modern slavery]], at the companies they invest in. However, JP Morgan replying to the report said that it took “human rights violations very seriously” and “any company with alleged or proven violations of principles, including human rights abuses, is scrutinised and may result in either enhanced engagement or removal from a portfolio.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ba19215c-3774-4bd5-b3a8-225f5e41b996|title=Fidelity, Vanguard and JPMorgan accused of ignoring human rights |access-date=14 May 2020|website=Financial Times |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==Offices==
Although the old [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]'s headquarters were located at '''One Chase Manhattan Plaza''' (now known as [[28 Liberty Street]]) in downtown [[Manhattan]], the current temporary world headquarters for JPMorgan Chase & Co. are located at [[383 Madison Avenue]]. In 2018, JPMorgan announced they would demolish the current headquarters building at [[270 Park Avenue]], which was [[Union Carbide]]'s former headquarters, to make way for a newer building that will be 500 feet (150 m) taller than the existing building. Demolition is expected to begin in early 2019, and the new building will be completed in 2025. The replacement 70-story headquarters will be able to fit 15,000 employees, whereas the current building fits 6,000 employees in a space that has a capacity of 3,500. The new headquarters is part of the East Midtown rezoning plan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/nyregion/jpmorgan-chase-headquarters.html|title=Out With the Old Building, in With the New for JPMorgan Chase|last=Bagli|first=Charles V.|date=2018-02-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When construction is completed in 2025, the headquarters will then move back into the new building at 270 Park Avenue.

==Credit derivatives==
The derivatives team at JPMorgan (including [[Blythe Masters]]) was a pioneer in the invention of [[credit derivative]]s such as the [[credit default swap]]. The first CDS was created to allow [[Exxon]] to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the [[European Bank of Reconstruction and Development]]. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the [[Synthetic CDO]].<ref>Fool's Gold, by Gillian Tett, Free Press, 2009.</ref><ref>Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations 2nd ed, Janet Tavakoli, 2008, Wiley</ref> As of 2013 JPMorgan had the largest credit default swap and credit derivatives portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowyourbank.com/jpmorgan-chase/4521/ |title=Chase Locations and Reviews |publisher=Knowyourbank |access-date=April 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525033610/http://www.knowyourbank.com/jpmorgan-chase/4521/ |archive-date=May 25, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/dq411.pdf | title=OCC's Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities Fourth Quarter 2011}}</ref>

===Multibillion-dollar trading loss===
{{Main|2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss}}
In April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of [[2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss|Bruno Iksil]], a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co., referred to as "the London whale" in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P.

On September 18, 2013, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay a total of $920 million in fines and penalties to American and UK regulators for violations related to the trading loss and other incidents. The fine was part of a multiagency and multinational settlement with the Federal Reserve, [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the United States and the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] in the UK. The company also admitted breaking American securities law.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-19/jpmorgan-chase-agrees-to-pay-920-million-for-london-whale-loss.html JPMorgan Pays $920 Million to Settle London Whale Probes].

A report by the SEC was critical of the level of oversight from senior management on traders, and the FCA said the incident demonstrated "flaws permeating all levels of the firm: from portfolio level right up to senior management."<ref name=BBC_whale1/>

On the day of the fine, the BBC reported from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] that the fines "barely registered" with traders there, the news had been an expected development, and the company had prepared for the financial hit.<ref name=BBC_whale1/>
