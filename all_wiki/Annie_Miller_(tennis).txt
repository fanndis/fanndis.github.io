==Career end==
At the time when Miller started thriving in professional tennis – at the age of 21, a mere four years into her career – she took an indefinite leave of absence from the [[Women’s Tennis Association]].   This was the best season of her career, with her solid run to the third round of the U.S. Open, which was her personal best, ranking her Number 43 in the world.

Miller also beat both [[Lindsay Davenport]] (who was Number 7 in the world) and [[Mary Pierce]], which earned her reputation for being a “young player on the rise.”  When she played at the Open against [[Monica Seles]] – a game that was televised – she accrued a whole slew of new fans, due to her impressive playing and attractiveness.

After the 1998 US Open, Miller made the decision to attend college at University of Michigan, where she received a Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA) and Master of Accounting degree at University of Michigan Ross School of Business.  Following her tennis career, she worked at Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Fenway Sports Group (now Fenway Sports Management) and adidas. 

==Awards==
In a 1991 junior competition Miller won the U.S. National 16s and 1992 Easter Bowl 18s. The following year she received the Clairol/WTA Tennis Scholarship at the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]].  Two years later she received the 1994 International Hall of Fame Sportsmanship Award.

==Teams==
Miller was a member of both the U.S. Maureen Connolly Brinker Cup team and the U.S. National Team 1991-92.

==Education==
In 1995, Miller graduated from [[Bradenton Academy]] with honors. Following her tennis career, she studied business at the [[University of Michigan]].
