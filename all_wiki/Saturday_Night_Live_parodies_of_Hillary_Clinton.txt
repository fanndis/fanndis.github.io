==Early portrayals==

[[Jan Hooks]] was the first to portray Hillary Clinton, and after Hooks left the show in 1991, she returned later to make several subsequent guest appearances as Hillary, with [[Phil Hartman]] as Hillary's husband [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=TVGuide1/> One of the earliest Jan Hooks sketches, which aired in May 1993, features her interpretation of Hillary eager to be a "co-president" with Bill, now the newly elected President. Hooks' Hillary tells her husband about her big plans for his health care bill, and gets into a fistfight with Senator [[Bob Dole]].<ref name=Bloomberg1>Ali Elkin – [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-27/the-snl-archaeology-of-hillary-clinton "The SNL Archaeology of Hillary Clinton: The satirical show may offer the truest biography of the Democratic frontrunner], Bloomberg Politics, March 27, 2015.

Beginning with the 1994 season, [[Janeane Garofalo]] played Hillary as First Lady, with [[Michael McKean]] portraying the president.<ref name=TVGuide1/>

[[Ana Gasteyer]] played Hillary during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] of the late 1990s, as well as during her run for the U.S. Senate in New York, with [[Darrell Hammond]] playing the role of her husband.<ref name=TVGuide1/> In one Gasteyer sketch, set in the Clintons' [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]] kitchen, with Hillary making an attempt to appear more personable for the cameras during her Senate campaign, she says, "I can't wait to prepare some food dishes in this kitchen, such as salads and toast."<ref name=Bloomberg1/>

==Amy Poehler parodies==

''SNL'' cast member [[Amy Poehler]] had the longest-running role as Clinton, playing the role regularly from 2003 to 2008 (and reprising it twice, in 2012 and 2015).<ref name=TVGuide1/>

In a sketch in the 2007–08 season, Poehler as Clinton hosts a Halloween party for the entire field of then-Democratic candidates for the [[2008 presidential primaries|2008 presidential primary election]]. Poehler's Clinton tells rival candidate [[John Edwards]], played by ''SNL''{{'}}s [[Will Forte]], "come next November, we all have to support the Democratic nominee, no matter who she may be."<ref name=Bloomberg1/>

Near the end of the party, a man walks in wearing an Obama mask, which he then removes to reveal the real then-Senator [[Barack Obama]], making a [[cameo appearance]]. "I have nothing to hide," he tells Clinton. "I enjoy being myself. I'm not going to change who I am just because it's Halloween."<ref>[http://www.aol.com/article/2015/11/06/palin-clinton-other-politicians-whove-appeared-on-snl/21260462/?icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-sb-bb%7Cdl24%7Csec3_lnk3%26pLid%3D1579045135 "Palin, Clinton, other politicians who've appeared on 'SNL',"] Associated Press, November 6, 2015.

==Present portrayal==
[[Kate McKinnon]] has portrayed Clinton regularly since March 2015 (after playing the role once prior in 2013). As of December 2016, she is the most-frequently appearing Hillary with 20 performances in the role, ahead of [[Amy Poehler]] at 19 performances, and [[Ana Gasteyer]] (at 16), despite having played it for less than half as long as either.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snlarchives.net/Impressions/?3352|title=SNL Archives - Impressions - John Boehner|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> Darrell Hammond has stated that he only agreed to reprise his role as [[Bill Clinton]] because he felt McKinnon was so good in her role, calling her a "virtuoso".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/interviews/a35440/darrell-hammond-interview/|title=Darrell Hammond on Playing Colonel Sanders and 'SNL'|date=3 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>

McKinnon appeared as Clinton alongside [[Amy Poehler]]'s Clinton (and [[Tina Fey]]'s Sarah Palin) when the duo returned to host in 2015, with the premise that 2008 Hillary had come to congratulate 2016 Hillary in a dream.

===2014–15 season===

In the 2014–2015 season, ''SNL'' began airing another series of Hillary Clinton sketches, on the occasion of Clinton's announcement of her candidacy for the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], with [[Kate McKinnon]] now as Clinton.<ref name=Time0415>[http://time.com/3818695/snl-hillary-clinton/ Jack Linshi – "Watch SNL Parody Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Announcement", ''Time'', April 12, 2015.
