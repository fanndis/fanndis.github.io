From mid-1994, clashes between the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] backed [[Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal|Jatioabadi Chhatra Dal]] and [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] backed [[Bangladesh Chhatra League]] led to increasing violence in the form of bomb and arson attacks on party bureaus, newspaper offices and government buildings.<ref name=":0" /> In the midst of violence, the opposition led by the Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina]], pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996.
