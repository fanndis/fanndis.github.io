==Voice==
Bocelli is a widely popular singer with a substantial fan base worldwide. However, he is also a polarizing figure in classical music, whose voice and performances
have routinely been the subject of negative reviews by critics. Italian [[spinto]] tenor [[Franco Corelli]] praised Bocelli's voice after hearing it for the first time during a [[master class]] in 1986, in [[Turin]], and he later gave Bocelli private lessons.<ref name="Bocelli fans">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/3668298/Andrea-Bocelli-Some-voices-have-tears-inside.html Andrea Bocelli: 'Some voices have tears inside'], [[The Daily Telegraph]], 4 October 2007 article.</ref><ref name="Bocelli Cieli di Toscana"/><ref name="2009 Bocelli Interview">[http://living.scotsman.com/features/Interview-Andrea-Bocelli-opera-singer.5762157.jp Interview: Andrea Bocelli, opera singer], [[The Scotsman]], 27 October 2009 article.</ref>

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] soprano [[Ana María Martínez]], who regularly performs with Bocelli, said, "More than anything, Andrea has something that is unique in that he brings this light that is always around him. And this purity of heart and beauty of sound just touches the listener. It can't be described."<ref name="Bocelli Cieli di Toscana">[http://www.bluecoupe.com/classical/andreatoscana.html Andrea Bocelli's ''Cieli di Toscana'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106142546/http://www.bluecoupe.com/classical/andreatoscana.html |date=6 January 2016 }}, ''bluecoupe.com'', 2001 article.</ref>

[[Celine Dion]] said while introducing him during her Christmas Special for ''[[These Are Special Times]]'', in 1998, that "if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli,"<ref name="Decca"/><ref name="2009 Bocelli Interview"/> and [[David Foster]], a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world. Similarly, [[jazz]] singer [[Al Jarreau]], who performed with Bocelli on the "[[Night of the Proms]]" tour in Europe in 1995, described him as "the most beautiful voice in the world,"<ref name="Bocelli - People 1997 ">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123691,00.html Blind Ambition] [[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] 10 November 1997 issue.</ref> and American talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] commented on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|her talk show]] that, "when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears."<ref name="Bocelli fans"/><ref name="Bocelli Cieli di Toscana"/> After attending Bocelli's concert at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in 2009, British-American actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] said, "My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being.

Bocelli's voice, more specifically his interpretation of opera, has been regularly criticized by classical music critics. These include [[Bernard Holland]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="NYT991101">{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=A Blind Pop Tenor Takes on the Operatic Stage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/arts/opera-review-a-blind-pop-tenor-takes-on-the-operatic-stage.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 November 1999}}</ref> In 1999, ''The New York Times'' chief music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] in his review of Bocelli's North American opera debut at the Detroit Opera House in the title role of Massenet's ''Werther'' commented, "The basic colour of Mr. Bocelli's voice is warm and pleasant, but he lacks the technique to support and project his sound. His sustained notes wobble. His soft high notes are painfully weak. Inadequate breath control often forces him to clip off notes prematurely at the end of phrases."<ref name="NYT991101"/> In December 2000, Tommasini again criticised Bocelli, this time for his ''La bohème'' album when he stated that Bocelli "still has trouble with basic things, like breath support" and his voice had been "carefully recorded ... to help it match the trained voices of the other cast members in fullness and presence."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tommasini|first=Anthony|title=Bocelli Seeks Legitimacy (And Bucks) In 'Boheme'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/arts/music-bocelli-seeks-legitimacy-and-bucks-in-boheme.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2000}}</ref>

In describing Bocelli's singing, ''The New York Times'' music critic Bernard Holland noted, "the tone is rasping, thin and, in general, poorly supported. Even the most modest upward movement thins it even more, signalling what appears to be the onset of strangulation. To his credit, Mr Bocelli sings mostly in tune. But his phrasing tends toward carelessness and rhythmic jumble... The diction is not clear."<ref>{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Bernard|title=Spectator-Friendly, and Critic-Proof in a Sea of Approval|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/arts/music/08boce.html?_r=0|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 September 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, Holland observed that "The critic's duty is to report that Mr Bocelli is not a very good singer." The [[Associated Press]] reported "Passion? Yes. Power. No. Bocelli's voice – though robust in spirit and precisely in tune, even in the upper register – had a thin quality that never opened up."<ref>{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=David|title='Rasping': New York critics' verdict on Bocelli|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rasping-new-york-critics-verdict-on-bocelli-415229.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 September 2006}}</ref> Similarly, classical music critic Andrew Clements found Bocelli's studio opera recordings consistently disappointing in quality: "Bocelli's profoundly unmusical contribution, with its unvaryingly coarse tone, wayward intonation and never a phrase properly shaped, fatally undermines all their contributions."<ref>{{cite news|last=Clements|first=Andrew|title=CD: Verdi: Il Trovatore: Bocelli/ Villaroel/ Zaremba/ Guelfi/ Colombara/ Teatro Massimo Bellini Catania Chorus & Orchestra/ Mercurio|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/16/classicalmusicandopera.shopping5|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 July 2004}}</ref> [[Anne Midgette]] of ''The New York Times'' agreed, noting "a thinness of voice, oddly anemic phrasing (including shortchanging upper notes of phrases in a most untenorial manner), a curious lack of expression."<ref>{{cite news|last=Midgette|first=Anne|title=Andrea Bocelli Does Opera, Take 2|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/arts/music-high-notes-andrea-bocelli-does-opera-take-2.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 May 2003}}</ref>

During a 2009 performance in New York, the music critic Steve Smith wrote "For cognoscenti of vocal artistry the risks involved in Mr. Bocelli's undertakings, both then and now, need no explanation. Substantial technical shortcomings masked by amplification are laid bare in a more conventional classical setting. Mr. Bocelli's tone can be pleasant, and his pitch is generally secure. But his voice is small and not well supported; his phrasing, wayward and oddly inexpressive."<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Steve|title=No Mikes: Just a Man, His Voice and Fans|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/arts/music/10bocelli.html?ref=music|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 September 2009}}</ref>

In 2010, Joe Banno of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave an unfavorable review of Bocelli's [[Carmen: Duets & Arias|''Carmen'' recording]], describing the oft-noted failings in Bocelli's vocal resources on full display in this performance: "Bocelli, to be fair, possesses an essentially lovely tenor and knows his stuff when it comes to selling a pop ballad. And Decca's close miking of his puny voice inflates his sound to near-Franco Corelli-like dimensions. But his short-breathed, clumsily phrased, interpretively blank and often pinched and strained singing makes his Don Jose a tough listen."<ref>{{cite news|last=Banno|first=Joe|title=CD review: Decca's 'Carmen,' featuring Andrea Bocelli|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/05/AR2010080507429.html|access-date=10 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 August 2010}}</ref>

On 30 April 2000, Bocelli's father, Alessandro Bocelli, died. His mother encouraged him to honor his commitments, and so he sang for [[Pope John Paul II]], in Rome, on 1 May, and immediately returned home for the funeral. At his 5 July performance, filmed for PBS as ''American Dream—Andrea Bocelli's [[Statue of Liberty]] Concert'', Bocelli dedicated the encore ''Sogno'' (Dream), from his 1999 album ''[[Sogno]]'', to the memory of his father.<ref name="BOC2000"/>

Although he is blind, Bocelli has enjoyed [[horseback riding]] for much of his life.<ref>Interview segment with [[Gayle King]] for ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' (broadcast several times during 2018).</ref>

Bocelli is a self-declared fan of Italian soccer club [[Inter Milan]]. In an interview in Pisa, he told a group of Inter fans that "My passion for Inter started during my college years, when Inter was winning everything in Italy and the world. When Inter won the Champions League in 2010, I was with my friends and I was listening to the game on the radio, and everything was a little bit in advance so I was celebrating before them. That night I was also brought to tears of joy. The treble is a feeling no one in Italy will be able to equal".<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrea Bocelli is a fan of Inter|url=http://www.fcinternews.it/news/bocelli-interista-dagli-anni-del-collegio-il-triplete-gioia-ineguagliabile-la-sera-di-madrid-esultai-prima-perche-266762|website=fcinternews.it}}</ref>
