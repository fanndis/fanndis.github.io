==Archaeology==
Fragments of early pottery have been found in the parish, as well as flints, scrapers, and an axe and arrow head. Aerial photographs show ancient crop marks.

==Toponym==
The [[Toponymy|toponym]] "Begbroke" is [[Old English]] for "Little Brook". This refers to Rowel Brook which runs through the village and was the reason for its early settlement. Rowel Brook is a tributary of the [[River Cherwell]].

==Manor==
Begbroke Manor House was built in about 1700.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=450}} In the 19th century it became part of the Priory of St Philip, which until 2000 was the [[novitiate]] house for the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic]] [[Servite Order|Servite Friars]] in England. It was then sold to a Church of England order of nuns, the [[Community of St John Baptist]]. The brethren of the Servites were well known in the village and served as [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) wardens in World War II.

==Parish church==
The [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]] was a 12th-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] building.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1291232 |desc=Church of St Michael |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> The uppermost stage of the tower was rebuilt in the 14th century and the nave and chancel were repeatedly "[[Victorian restoration|restored]]" in the 19th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=450}}

==Economic and social history==
The former Begbroke Hill Farm was owned by the Giffard and FitzHerbert families for nearly 500 years. It was built early in the 17th century{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=450}} for either Humphrey FitzHerbert (died 1616) or his son Robert (died 1632).{{sfn|Sturdy|1961–62|p=332}} It is now the site of the Oxford University [[Begbroke Science Park]] (which, despite the name, is accessible only from the neighbouring village of [[Yarnton]] and but is in the boundary of Begbroke parish).

Orchard House, next to St Michael's parish church, also belonged to the FitzHerberts. More recently it was the home of science fiction author [[Brian Aldiss]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Begbroke Place was built in 1906.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=450}} From 1940 it until 1984 the house was incorporated into the campus of St Juliana's Convent School, an independent girls' school run by the sisters of the Servite Order.

Commuter homes were built in the village beginning in the 1930s, mainly on the east side of Woodstock Road.

==Amenities==
