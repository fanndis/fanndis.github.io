The '''2004 United States Senate elections''' were held on November 2, 2004, with all [[Classes of United States senators|Class 3 Senate seats]] being contested. They coincided with the [[2004 United States presidential election|re-election]] of [[George W. Bush]] as [[President of the United States|president]] and the [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House election]], as well as many state and local elections. Senators who were elected in [[1998 United States Senate elections|1998]], known as [[Classes of United States Senators|Senate Class 3]], were seeking re-election or retiring in 2004. This was the third consecutive election for Senate Class 3 where the Democrats either broke even or lost seats.  This also marked the first time since 1980 in which a presidential candidate from either party won with coattails in the Senate. As of 2020, these are the last elections held during a Presidential election year in which the Republicans made a net gain of seats.

==Gains and losses==
Republicans won six seats but lost two themselves, giving them a net gain of four seats. Five of the six gains came from Southern states. Conservative Democrat [[Zell Miller]] of [[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]], who campaigned for President [[George W. Bush|Bush]], chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[Johnny Isakson]] won his seat; Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] of [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]] chose not to run for re-election and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]]; Democratic vice presidential nominee [[John Edwards]] did not run for re-election and Republican [[Richard Burr]] won his [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]] seat; Democrat [[Bob Graham]] of [[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]] chose not to run for re-election, and his seat went to Republican [[Mel Martinez]]; [[List of United States Senators from Louisiana|Louisiana]] Democrat [[John Breaux]] chose not to run for re-election and Republican [[David Vitter]] won his seat, and in [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|South Dakota]], Republican [[John Thune]] defeated the incumbent Senate minority leader [[Tom Daschle]], the first time since [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952]] that a sitting party leader lost re-election. Republican Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] of [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Barack Obama]] won in a landslide, becoming the Senate's only black member and only the third popularly elected since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Also, Republican Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] of [[List of United States Senators from Colorado|Colorado]] chose not to run for re-election and Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.

==Political parties==
[[File:109th US Congress Senate3.PNG|thumb|375px|Senate composition following the 2004 elections.]]
The Senate, as of the pre-election [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]], was composed of 51 [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]s, 48 [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]s, and 1 independent. (The independent, [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]], was allied with the Democratic caucus and had voted with Democrats to give them the majority in the past.) The Democrats, therefore, needed to make a net gain of at least two seats from retiring or incumbent Republicans to gain control of the Senate (one seat if Kerry won the presidency). In the election, incumbent senators won reelection in all races but one ([[Senate Minority Leader|Democratic leader]] [[Tom Daschle]], in [[South Dakota]], lost to Republican [[John Thune]]). The seats of retiring senators were taken by the opposing party in [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. In fact, the only retiring senator whose seat was taken by a member of his party was Republican [[Don Nickles]] of [[Oklahoma]], who was succeeded by [[Tom Coburn]].

Republicans gained four seats in the 2004 elections, and entered the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] with a 55–44–1 lead. While such a majority is formidable, it is still less than the 60 seats needed to override a [[filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] and completely control the body's agenda and procedures.

One Republican seat, that of retiring Senator Peter Fitzgerald in Illinois, was easily taken by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who would be elected [[President of the United States]] four years later. In Colorado, retiring Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]'s seat was narrowly taken by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]]. In Alaska, Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] won reelection in a tight race. In Oklahoma, [[Tom Coburn]] kept [[Don Nickles]]' seat in Republican hands, while in Kentucky, Republican [[Jim Bunning]] won a second term by a very narrow margin.

The Democrats' prospects were weakened by the fact that five of their six incumbent senators in Southern states were retiring (the sixth, [[Blanche Lincoln]] of [[Arkansas]], easily won reelection). Retiring Georgia Sen. [[Zell Miller]]'s seat, contested by [[Denise Majette]], was lost in a landslide, as was that of South Carolina Sen. [[Ernest Hollings]]. In North Carolina, Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] lost [[John Edwards]]'s seat to Republican [[Richard Burr]]. Especially close races in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota all resulted in turnovers to the Republicans.

===Third and minor parties===
The [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]], [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution]], and [[United States Green Party|Green]] parties contested many of the seats. No candidate from any of these parties received sufficient support to achieve election, but some may have affected the outcome of the Alaska and Florida races by drawing votes away from the major party candidates. Of the 34 senate seats up for grabs, the Libertarians ran candidates in 20 of the races, the Constitutionalists ran 10 candidates, and the Greens ran 7 candidates.

[[List of political parties in the United States|Minor parties]] in a number of states contested one or more Senate seats. Examples include the America First Party, the [[Labor Party (United States, 1996)|Labor Party]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party (United States)|Peace and Freedom Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. None of these parties gained a seat in this election nor received a significant number of votes.

Incumbent Republican [[Lisa Murkowski]] of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], sought election to her first full term after being appointed to serve out the rest of [[Frank Murkowski|her father's]] unexpired term when he resigned in December 2002 to become [[Governor of Alaska]]. Her main challenger was Democratic former Governor [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]], her father's predecessor as governor. Murkowski won by a slight margin.

Although [[Alaska]] is heavily Republican, popular opinion had swung against the Murkowski family because of a tax increase passed by Governor Frank Murkowski, Lisa Murkowski's father. In addition, many voters disapproved of apparent [[nepotism]] in the appointment of Lisa Murkowski to the Senate. Knowles, who as mentioned above preceded Frank Murkowski as governor, had enlisted extensive out-of-state support for his bid to take over Lisa Murkowski's Senate seat. However, veteran Republican Senator [[Ted Stevens]] taped advertisements warning Alaskans that electing a Democrat could result in less federal dollars for Alaska.

Lisa Murkowski had very low approval ratings as senator due to her father, [[Frank Murkowski]], who at the time was the [[Governor of Alaska]] with extremely low approval ratings himself. Former Governor Tony Knowles ran against Murkowski. He ran as a Democrat who supported drilling in [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge|ANWR]], in contrast to most Democrats. Ted Stevens tried to "rescue" her campaign and help her maintain her seat.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hulse | first=Carl |author2=Sheryl Gay Stolberg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/politics/campaign/races-to-determine-control-of-house-and-senate-have-been.html | title=The 2004 Campaign: Control of Congress; Races for House and Senate Have Been Nasty, Expensive and Focused on Local Issues | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 31, 2004 | accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref>

Since 1998, McCain challenged Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]] in the Presidential primary and despite winning the New Hampshire primary, he lost the nomination. Solidifying his image as a [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]], he voted against the [[Bush tax cuts]]. He supported limits on [[stem cell research]]. He had a lopsided favorable ratings of 39% to 9% unfavorable in the most recent ''[[The New York Times]]''/[[CBS News]] poll.

Stuart Starky, an eighth-grade teacher in [[South Phoenix]], was widely known as a long-shot challenger.

Incumbent Democrat [[Blanche Lincoln]] ran for re-election. Lincoln won re-election over Republican State Senator [[Jim Holt (Arkansas politician)|Jim Holt]] while President [[George W. Bush]] carried the state with almost the same margin of victory.

The Democratic Party held [[super-majority]] status in the [[Arkansas General Assembly]]. A majority of local and statewide offices were also held by Democrats. This was rare even for the time in the [[Southern United States|South]], where a majority of statewide offices were and still are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential election—native son [[Bill Clinton]]—while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas had since become more reliably Republican in presidential elections. The state voted for [[George W. Bush]] over [[John Kerry]] in 2004. Lincoln won by 2% less than she had in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/AR/|title=CNN.com Election 2004}}</ref>

Democrats at the time had an overwhelming majority of registered voters, and the [[Democratic Party of Arkansas]] was more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives at the time were members of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military spending, and socially conservative than the Democratic mainstream.

Boxer originally had decided to retire in 2004 but changed her mind to "fight for the right to dissent" against conservatives like Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]]. Jones was widely considered as the underdog.<ref name="nationalreview.com"/> Jones got a major endorsement from the popular Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/2004-01-15-schwarzenegger-jones_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Schwarzenegger to endorse Jones for Senate|website=www.usatoday.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> The two major candidates had a debate. Pre-election polling had Boxer leading in double digits.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-08-11/bay-area/17437664_1_gun-control-iraq-jones-iraq-today|title=CAMPAIGN 2004 / Jones, Boxer mix it up in only live debate / Challenger plays up Schwarzenegger ties, senator counters|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> But he never released a single TV ad. Boxer portrayed Jones as too conservative for California, citing his votes in the California Assembly (1982 to 1994) against gun control, increased minimum wage, support for offshore drilling, and a loosening of environmental regulations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/688264021.html?dids=688264021:688264021&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+05,+2004&author=Scott+Martelle&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=The+State;+Bill+Jones'+Campaign+Quandary;+With+only+tepid+support+from+Bush,+the+GOP+challenger+to+Sen.+Boxer+could+use+a+boost+from+the+governor+--+who+so+far+has+kept+his+distance.&pqatl=google|title=Los Angeles Times: Archives - The State|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

Jones raised about $700,000 more than Boxer during the third quarter, pulling in $2.5 million to Boxer's $1.8 million. But overall, Boxer has raised $16 million to Jones' $6.2 million. And Boxer has spent about $7 million on radio and television ads alone.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/713103661.html?dids=713103661:713103661&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+16,+2004&author=Scott+Martelle&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=CALIFORNIA+ELECTIONS;+Jones+Pulls+Out+Cash+He+Lent+to+Campaign&pqatl=google|title=Los Angeles Times: Archives - CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

The election was not close, with Boxer winning by an authoritative 20 point margin. Jones only performed well in rural parts of the state. Boxer on the other hand won almost all major metropolitan areas in the state. The race was called right when the polls closed at 11:00 P.M. EST, and 7:00 P.M. PTZ. Jones conceded defeat to Boxer at 11:12 P.M. EST, and 7:12 PTZ.

Incumbent Republican [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. The Democratic [[Attorney General of Colorado]] [[Ken Salazar]] won the open seat.

Before Campbell's retirement, no prominent Democrat had entered the race, with educator Mike Miles and businessman [[Rutt Bridges]] pursuing the Democratic nomination. After Campbell's retirement, many expected popular Republican Governor [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] to enter the race{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, however he declined to run. Campbell's retirement and Owens' decision not to run prompted a number of prominent Democrats to reexamine the race{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

On March 10, the same day Owens announced he would not run, U.S. Congressman [[Mark Udall]] entered the race{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The next day, state Attorney General [[Ken Salazar]] entered the race{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, leading Udall to immediately withdraw and endorse him{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Salazar lost to Mike Miles at the State nominating convention. In spite of this loss, the national Democratic Party backed Salazar with contributions from the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee|DSCC]] and promotion of Salazar as the only primary candidate{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

The two candidates got into an ideological battle, as U.S. Representative [[Bob Schaffer]] attacked [[Pete Coors]], former CEO and chairman of [[Coors Brewing Company]], because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] employees, in addition to promoting its beer in [[gay bar]]s. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], and supported a [[constitutional amendment]] to ban it, although he noted that he supported civil unions for gay couples. According to the ''Rocky Mountain News'', Coors described his company's pro-[[LGBT]] practices as "good business, separate from politics."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/election/article/0,1299,DRMN_36_3034875,00.html|title=Rocky Mountain News : Denver News, Business, Homes, Jobs, Cars, & Information<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819022154/http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/election/article/0,1299,DRMN_36_3034875,00.html|archive-date=19 August 2004|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Coors defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

Pete Coors ran as a moderate conservative. However, Salazar was also a moderate and a highly popular State Attorney General.<ref>{{cite news  |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/conason/2004/10/22/coors/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210110435/http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/conason/2004/10/22/coors/index.html |archive-date=2009-02-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Coors is also a great-grandson of [[Adolph Coors]], founder of the brewing company. His father is [[Joseph Coors]], president of the company and founding member of the conservative think tank, the [[Heritage Foundation]]. Salazar narrowly won the open seat. It was one of only two Democratic pickups in the 2004 Senate elections (Illinois was the other).

According to the non-partisan [[Center for Responsive Politics]] (CPS), Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

A state record of over $11 million was raised during the election.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-2762144.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026101940/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-2762144.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 October 2012|title=U.S. Senate race rakes in record $11.1 million Candidates ready for tough campaigning in home stretch|date=16 October 2004|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

Until the spring of 2004, Castor's fundraising was much slower than her Democratic and Republican rivals{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In the spring, the campaign hired fundraising staff from the defunct presidential campaigns of [[Howard Dean]] and [[Bob Graham]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, and subsequently posted much higher fundraising numbers over the summer{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Online grassroots techniques devised for the Dean campaign (Castor became a [[Dean Dozen]] candidate in August{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}) were one contributing factor{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: another was the support of [[EMILY's List]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, which named Castor as its highest-rated candidate for the 2004 election cycle{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, even when her support for banning intact dilation and extraction (D&X) abortions was not in line with the EMILY's List support for woman's issues{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The latter was a source of criticism during the August primary heat - a complaint was filed by a Deutsch supporter with the Federal Election Commission accusing inappropriate coordination with EMILY's List{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. The complaint was dismissed by the Federal Election Commission in 2005{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

Castor's handling of [[Sami Al-Arian]] became another source of criticism during the campaign{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. In June, [[American Democracy Project (527 group in Florida)|The American Democracy Project]], a [[527 group]] founded by [[Bernie Friedman]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, began attacking Castor's handling of the incident, alleging that she had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian in the mid-1990s{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Castor responded by stating that she never had sufficient evidence to fire Al-Arian, who was a [[tenure|tenured professor]] at the time{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. On June 29, Senator Graham, who had previously remained outside of the Al-Arian controversy, released a statement that "Betty Castor acted appropriately as President of the University of South Florida to deal with Sami Al-Arian"{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}: later, Graham and Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]] brokered an agreement between the Democratic candidates to refrain from negative campaigning against each other{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}, although this agreement appeared to break down in the final weeks of the race, when Deutsch launched attack ads on television{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

Despite these controversies, Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31. She was defeated, however, by Republican candidate [[Mel Martínez]] in a close race on November 2, 2004. The overwhelming support for Martínez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor's relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.

There was some speculation that Castor would run for [[Governor of Florida]] in 2006 to replace [[Jeb Bush]], who was ineligible for re-election due to term limits, but she announced in 2005 that she would not be a candidate.

Incumbent Democrat [[Zell Miller]] retired. Democratic U.S. Representative [[Denise Majette]] became both the first African American and the first woman to be nominated for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Republican U.S. Representative [[Johnny Isakson]] won the open seat.

The results were almost a complete reversal from the previous election in 2000.

Majette's announcement that she would seek to replace Miller also caught Democrats by surprise, as she was not on anyone's call list when Democrats began seeking a candidate to replace Miller. Further skepticism among Democrats about the viability of her candidacy surfaced when she announced that "God" had told her to run for the Senate. She received important endorsements from U.S. Senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[Debbie Stabenow]] of Michigan, along with many others in Washington who campaigned and raised money for Majette. Her Senate campaign slogan was "I'll be nobody's Senator, but yours."

A number of factors led to Majette's loss. These include her late start, her valuable time and money spent in the runoff, larger conservative turnout from a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages (which Majette opposed), the popularity of President [[George W. Bush]] in Georgia, and her lack of experience (being a one-term congresswoman).

Incumbent Republican [[Peter Fitzgerald (senator)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].

State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary and [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Ryan later withdrew from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release child custody records. The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate.

The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama's 43% margin of victory was the largest in the state history of U.S. Senate elections. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections – $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes – is also among the largest in history in both absolute and relative terms.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | chapter=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | title=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>

Obama touted his legislative experience and early public opposition to the [[Iraq War]] to distinguish himself from his Democratic primary rivals. Illinois Comptroller [[Daniel Hynes|Dan Hynes]] won the endorsement of the [[AFL-CIO]].  Obama succeeded in obtaining the support of three of the state's largest and most active member unions: [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]], [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]], and the [[American Federation of Teachers|Illinois Federation of Teachers]]. Hynes and multimillionaire former securities trader [[Blair Hull]] each won the endorsements of two of the nine Democratic Illinois members of the US House of Representatives. Obama had the endorsements of four: [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]], [[Danny K. Davis|Danny Davis]], [[Lane Evans]], and [[Jan Schakowsky]].

Obama surged into the lead after he finally began television advertising in Chicago in the final three weeks of the campaign, which was expanded to [[downstate Illinois]] during the last six days of the campaign. The ads included strong endorsements by the five largest newspapers in Illinois—the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[The Rockford Register Star]]'', and ''[[Peoria Journal Star]]''—and a testimonial by [[Sheila Simon]] that Obama was "cut from that same cloth" as her father, the late former U.S. Senator [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], who had planned to endorse and campaign for Obama before his unexpected death in December 2003.

On March 16, 2004, Obama won the Democratic primary by an unexpected landslide—receiving 53% of the vote, 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival, with a vote total that nearly equaled that of all eight Republican candidates combined—which overnight made him a rising star in the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, ''[[Dreams from My Father]]''.<ref>

GOP frontrunner Jack Ryan had divorced actress [[Jeri Ryan]] in 1999, and the records of the divorce were sealed at their mutual request. Five years later, when Ryan's Senate campaign began, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper and [[WLS-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, sought to have the records released.  On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan's GOP primary opponents urged Ryan to release the records.<ref>Fornek, Scott; Herrmann, Andrew.

As a result of the GOP and Democratic primaries, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] was pitted against Republican [[Jack Ryan (Senate candidate)|Jack Ryan]].

Ryan trailed Obama in early polls, after the media reported that Ryan had assigned Justin Warfel, a Ryan campaign worker, to track Obama's appearances.<ref name="Mendell">{{Cite news | first=David | last=Mendell | title=Ryan aide to give Obama more space | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=May 23, 2004 | accessdate=February 11, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205204729/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0405230433may23,1,3572265.story | archive-date=December 5, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy}}</ref> The tactic backfired when many people, including Ryan's supporters, criticized this activity.  Ryan's spokesman apologized, and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space.  Obama acknowledged that it is standard practice to film an opponent in public, and Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan's decision to have Warfel back off.<ref name="Mendell"/>

As the campaign progressed, the lawsuit brought by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' to open [[Child custody laws in the United States|child custody]] files from Ryan's divorce was still continuing. Barack Obama's backers emailed reporters about the divorce controversy, but refrained from on-the-record commentary.<ref name="Fornek"/> On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans' divorce records should be opened to the public, and ruled that a court-appointed referee would later decide which custody files should remain sealed to protect the interests of Ryan's young child.<ref>Ford, Liam.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/elections/chi-0403300182mar30,1,7640086.story “Some Ryan divorce files should be unsealed”], ''Chicago Tribune'' (March 30, 2004).</ref> A few days later, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama changed his position about the Ryans' soon-to-be-released divorce records, and called on Democrats to not inject them into the campaign.<ref name="Fornek">Fornek, Scott.

On June 22, 2004, after receiving the report from the court appointed referee, the judge released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan's young child. In those files, [[Jeri Ryan]] alleged that Jack Ryan had taken her to sex clubs in several cities, intending for them to have sex in public.<ref name="nyt1">{{Cite news | first=Stephen | last=Kinzer | author-link=Stephen Kinzer |author2=Jo Napolitano  | title=Illinois Senate Campaign Thrown Into Prurient Turmoil | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/us/illinois-senate-campaign-thrown-into-prurient-turmoil.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 23, 2004 |page=A14 | accessdate=February 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/20040622-0304-illinoissenate.html | title=Illinois Republican vows to stay in Senate race despite embarrassing allegations  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | date=June 22, 2004 | author=Lannan, Maura Kelly | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

The decision to release the files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child. Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated GOP opponent, commented that "these are allegations made in a divorce hearing, and we all know people tend to say things that aren't necessarily true in divorce proceedings when there is money involved and custody of children involved."<ref name="nyt1"/>

Although their [[sensationalism|sensational nature]] made the revelations fodder for [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] and television programs specializing in such stories, the files were also newsworthy because of questions about whether Ryan had accurately described the documents to GOP party leaders.  Prior to release of the documents, Ryan had told leading Republicans that five percent of the divorce file could cause problems for his campaign.<ref>Martinez, Michael; Pearson, Rick.  [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406180364jun18,1,3423709.story “Court sets release of Ryan's divorce file”], Chicago Tribune (June 18, 2004).</ref> But after the documents were released, GOP officials including state GOP Chair [[Judy Baar Topinka]] said they felt Ryan had misleadingly indicated the divorce records would not be embarrassing.<ref>Pearson, Rick; Ford, Liam.

That charge of dishonesty led to intensifying calls for Ryan's withdrawal, though Topinka, who was considering running herself, said after the June 25 withdrawal that Ryan's "decision was a personal one" and that the state GOP had not pressured Ryan to drop out.<ref>Ford, Liam; Bush, Rudolph. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0406260116jun26,1,277974.story?coll=chi-news-hed “Ryan Quits Race”], Chicago Tribune June 26, 2004.</ref>  Ryan's campaign ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004.  Obama was left without an opponent.

The Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. Keyes, a [[American conservatism|conservative Republican]] from Maryland, faced an uphill battle. First, Keyes had few ties to Illinois political leaders. Second, the lack of an opponent allowed Obama to campaign throughout the more conservative downstate regions to build up name recognition. Third, Keyes was seen as a [[carpetbagger]], only establishing legal residency in [[Calumet City, Illinois]] days before running.

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in an [[editorial]], stated that "Mr. Keyes may have noticed a large body of water as he flew into [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. That is called [[Lake Michigan]]."<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-08-06/news/0408060313_1_mr-keyes-judy-baar-topinka-alan-keyes | title=Commentary: The GOP's rent-a-senator  | accessdate=January 21, 2013 | date=August 6, 2004 | publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> In 2000, Keyes attacked [[Hillary Clinton]] for running for US Senator from New York even though she had never lived there, calling her a carpetbagger.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | title=Plan B for Illinois | date= August 10, 2004 | work= The New York Times | accessdate= December 25, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111228091458/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/opinion/10tue2.html | archive-date=December 28, 2011}}</ref> Keyes attacked Barack Obama for voting against a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion.<ref>{{cite news | last=Robinson | first=Mike | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5654128 | title=Keyes assails Obama's abortion views | publisher=NBC News | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=December 27, 2009 | date=August 9, 2004}}</ref>

Obama ran the most successful Senate campaign in 2004, and was so far ahead in polls that he soon began to campaign outside of Illinois in support of other Democratic candidates. He gave large sums of campaign funds to other candidates and the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] and sent many of his volunteers to work on other races, including that of eventual three-term Congresswoman [[Melissa Bean]] who defeated then-Congressman [[Phil Crane]] in that year's election. Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including [[education voucher|school vouchers]] and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.<ref>Alan Keyes Archives, [http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm 2004 Illinois Debates] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225055002/http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm | date=February 25, 2007}}</ref>

The Obama-Keyes race was one of the first to be called on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], November 2, 2004.

At the start of Keyes's candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the [[opinion poll|polls]]. He received 27% of the vote in the November general election to Obama's 70%.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/IL/S/01/index.html | title= America Votes 2004: U.S. Senate/Illinois  | accessdate=August 12, 2007 | publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Following the [[election]], Keyes refused to call Obama to congratulate him. Media reports claimed that Keyes also failed to concede the race to Obama.{{Citation needed | date=January 2008}} Two days after the election, a  Two days after the electionradio interviewer asked Keyes whether he had conceded the race. Keyes replied, "Of course I've conceded the race.

On the radio program, Keyes explained that his refusal to congratulate Obama was "not anything personal," but was meant to make a statement against "extend[ing] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line." He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. "I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I can't do this. And I will not make a false gesture," Keyes said.<ref name="radio"/>

Incumbent Democrat [[Evan Bayh]] won re-election to a second term, beating Republican [[Marvin Scott]], a professor at [[Butler University]].

Bayh was viewed early in 2004 as a serious vice presidential candidate for [[John Kerry]]. Bayh was on the final shortlist for a Kerry running mate, but North Carolina Senator [[John Edwards]] was chosen as Kerry's running mate.

Bayh won 86 of [[List of counties in Indiana|Indiana's counties]] compared to 6 for Scott.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.in.gov/apps/sos/election/general/general2004?page=district&countyID=-1&officeID=4&districtID=514&candidate= | title = United States Senator by County | publisher = Indiana Secretary of State | date = November 2, 2004 | accessdate = November 8, 2008}}</ref>

During his re-election bid in 2004, controversy erupted when Bunning described Mongiardo as looking "like one of Saddam Hussein's sons." Bunning apologized, then later went on to declare that Mongiardo's "thugs" had assaulted his wife.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bunning apologizes for Saddam comparison | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/kentucky/2004-04-01-bunning-apology_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | agency=Associated Press | date=April 1, 2004 | accessdate=March 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name=Farhi>{{Cite news | author=Paul Farhi | title=Bunning's Wild Pitches Tighten Kentucky Senate Race | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34265-2004Oct15.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 15, 2004 | accessdate=March 5, 2008 | pages=A06}}</ref>

Bunning had an estimated $4 million campaign war chest, while Mongiardo had only $600,000. The Democrats began increasing financial support to Mongiardo when it became apparent that Bunning's bizarre behavior was costing him votes, purchasing more than $800,000 worth of additional television airtime on his behalf.

The November 2 election was one of the closest in Kentucky history. The race turned out to be very close, with Mongiardo leading with as many as 80% of the returns coming in. However, Bunning eventually won by just over one percentage point. Some analysts felt that because of President George Bush's 20% margin of victory in the state, Bunning was able to effectively ride the President's coattails to victory.

Incumbent Democrat [[John Breaux]] retired. Republican U.S. Representative [[David Vitter]] won the jungle primary over Democratic U.S. Representative [[Chris John]] with 51% of the vote and avoided a runoff.

Breaux endorsed Chris John prior to the [[jungle primary]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/la_senate.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111202304/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/la_senate.html |archive-date=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the campaign, Vitter was accused by a member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee of having had a lengthy [[affair]] with a [[prostitute]] in New Orleans. Vitter responded that the allegation was "absolutely and completely untrue" and that it was "just crass Louisiana politics." The allegation later turned out to be true.<ref name="WP-07-10-07">Shailagh Murray, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/09/AR2007070902030.html "Senator's Number on 'Madam' Phone List"], ''The Washington Post'', July 10, 2007</ref>

Vitter won the Louisiana jungle primary with 51% of the vote, avoiding the need for a runoff. John received 29.2% of the vote and Kennedy (no relation to the Massachusetts Kennedys), took 14.9%.

Vitter won at least a plurality in 56 of Louisiana's 64 parishes. John carried nine parishes, all but two of which (Iberville and Orleans) are part of the House district he represented.

Kennedy changed parties and ran as Republican in 2008 against Louisiana's senior senator, Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]]. Landrieu was re-elected. Kennedy succeeded Vitter when he won the 2016 election for the seat over Democrat [[Foster Campbell]].

Vitter was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. Senator. The previous Republican Senator, [[William Pitt Kellogg]], was chosen by the state legislature in 1876, in accordance with the process used before the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] went into effect in 1914.<ref>{{cite news | date=November 1, 2004 | last=Rudin | first=Ken | author-link=Ken Rudin | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4136425 | title=Final Call: Kerry Wins Narrow Electoral Margin; GOP Gains in House, Senate | publisher=[[NPR]] | accessdate=April 30, 2008}}</ref>

Incumbent Democrat [[John Edwards]] decided to retire from the Senate, ran unsuccessfully for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential nomination]], and became his party's vice presidential nominee. Republican [[Richard Burr]] won the open seat.

Erskine Bowles won the Democratic Party's nomination unopposed. He had been the party's nominee for the state's other Senate seat in [[2002 United States Senate election in North Carolina|2002]].

Both major-party candidates engaged in negative campaign tactics, with Bowles' campaign attacking Burr for special interest donations and his positions on trade legislation, and Burr's campaign attacking Bowles for his connections to the Clinton administration. Both attacks had basis in reality: Burr's campaign raised funds from numerous [[political action committees]] and at least 72 of the 100 largest [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]], while Bowles departed from the Clinton administration in the midst of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]].

Burr won the election by 4%. He joined the Senate in January 2005. Bowles went on to become the president of the [[UNC system]].

A popular U.S. Senator, Voinovich was the heavy favorite to win the election. He had over $9 million in the bank, while his opponent barely had $1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s_site=ohio&p_multi=AK&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=105F8769674F4B04&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Beacon Journal: Search Results|website=nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> Fingerhut's campaign was overshadowed by the possible campaign of Democrat and former mayor of [[Cincinnati]] [[Jerry Springer]], who eventually declined to run.

Voinovich is considered{{By whom | date=May 2010}} a moderate on some issues. He supports [[gun control]] and amnesty for illegal immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/George_Voinovich.htm|title=George Voinovich on the Issues|last=Issues2000.org|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

Surprisingly,{{Citation needed | date=May 2010}} Voinovich's biggest advantage was getting support from the most Democratic-leaning county in the state, [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]]. Kerry carried it with almost 67% of the vote, by far his best performance in the state in 2004. It is the home of Cleveland and it is also most populous county in the state. Voinovich was a former mayor of Cleveland. In addition, he catered to Cleveland's large Jewish population by visiting [[Israel]] six times as a first-term U.S. Senator. He also consistently voted for aid to Israel through foreign appropriations bills. He's supported resolutions reaffirming Israel's right to self-defense and condemned Palestinian terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-109160310.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104024352/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-109160310.html |archive-date=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, Fingerhut's home base was in the Cleveland area, and therefore he had to cut in through the incumbent's home base in order to even make the election close.

In a September [[University of Cincinnati]] poll, the incumbent lead 64% to 34%.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&p_theme=ddnb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=105794F4CD09DFA5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=flatpage-for-wraps|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> In an October [[ABC News]] poll, Voinovich was winning 60% to 35%. He led across almost all demographic groups Only among Democrats, non-whites, liberals, and those who pick health care as #1 issue favor Fingerhut. It should be noted{{Citation needed | date=May 2010}} that the election coincided with the presidential election, where [[Ohio]] was a [[swing state]]. 27% of Voinovich's supporters preferred U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] for president.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/PollVault/story?id=178949|title=Poll: Advantage Kerry in Ohio Race|date=6 January 2006|website=ABC News|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

[[Kirk Humphreys]], the former mayor of [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], ran for the [[United States Senate]] with institutional conservative support, namely from Senators [[Don Nickles]] and [[Jim Inhofe]], as well as former Congressman [[J.

Humphreys noted, "[Coburn  is] kind of a cult hero in the conservative portion of our party, not just in Oklahoma.

Bush]] or [[John McCain]].

Ultimately, Coburn triumphed over Humphreys, Anthony, and Hunt in the primary, winning every county in [[Oklahoma]] except for tiny [[Harmon County, Oklahoma|Harmon County]].

Carson and Coburn engaged each other head-on in one of the year's most brutal [[United States Senate|Senate]] contests. Coburn and the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] attacked Carson for being too liberal for Oklahoma and for being a vote in lockstep with [[John Kerry]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Ted Kennedy]]. To drive the point home, one television advertisement aired by the Coburn campaign accused Carson of being "dangerously liberal" and not supporting the [[War on Terrorism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zHqYD2KAU|title=Tom Coburn 2004 U.S. Senate "Dangerously Liberal"|last=tulsaschoolboard|date=25 February 2012|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> Coburn was aided in this effort by the fact that the [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|Kerry campaign]] did not contest the state of Oklahoma and that incumbent President [[George W. Bush]] was expected to win Oklahoma comfortably. This was compounded by the fact that [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-President]] [[Dick Cheney]] campaigned for Coburn and appeared in several television advertisements for him.<ref>http://www3.nationaljournal.com/members/adspotlight/2004/10/1007oksen1.htm{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Carson countered by emphasizing his [[Stilwell, Oklahoma|Stilwell]] roots<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWeBg0-nST4|title=Brad Carson U.S. Senate 2004 "Stilwell"|last=tulsaschoolboard|date=25 February 2012|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> and his moderation, specifically, bringing attention to the fact that he fought for greater governmental oversight of nursing home care for the elderly.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/carsons-first-stand-should-feds-examine-nursing-homes/article/2738499|title=Carson's First Stand Should Feds Examine Nursing Homes?|date=22 April 2001|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> Carson responded to the attacks against him by countering that his opponent had committed [[Medicaid]] fraud years prior, in an event that reportedly left a woman sterilized without her consent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21673-2004Sep14.html|title=Okla.

[[File:Pa-gop-sen-prim-04.png|thumb|125x136px|Republican Primary by county]]

Specter faced a primary challenge from U.S. Representative [[Pat Toomey]]. Despite the state Republican Party's strong history of embracing a moderate philosophy, the influence of conservatism among rank-and-file members had been steadily growing for decades; because of his liberal social views, Specter was often considered to be a "[[Republican in Name Only]]" by the right.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&q=1998+ridge+itkin&pg=PA112|title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004|first=John J.|last=Kennedy|date=20 December 2017|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=9780761832799|accessdate=20 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> Although Specter had a huge fundraising advantage, Toomey was aided by $2 million of advertising from the [[Club for Growth]], a conservative [[political action committee]] that focuses on fiscal issues and targets moderate Republican incumbents.  Toomey criticized Specter as a spendthrift on economic policy and as out of touch with his own party on social issues. Although Toomey had difficulty with name recognition early in the campaign, he built huge momentum over the final weeks preceding the primary, and Specter appeared to have transitioned from having a comfortable lead to being behind his challenger <ref name="auto1"/>

Specter received a huge boost from the vocal support of President [[George W. Bush]]; most of the state's Republican establishment also closed ranks behind Specter. This included Pennsylvania's other U.S. Senator, [[Rick Santorum]], who was noted for his social conservative views. Many Republicans at the state and national level feared that if Toomey beat Specter, he wouldn't be able to defend the seat against his Democratic opponent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4847842|title=Sen.

For Democrats, hope of winning the election centered on Toomey's defeat of Specter. However, after the challenge from the right failed, enthusiasm from the party establishment waned and Hoeffel had difficulty matching the name recognition and fundraising power of his opponent  <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id%3DSPA2004102201 | title=Archived copy | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213062620/http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=SPA2004102201 | archive-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> Despite contempt from conservatives, Specter enjoyed high levels of support from independent voters and, as in previous elections, a  Despite contempt from conservatives, Specter enjoyed high levels of support from independent voters and, as in previous electionssurprisingly large crossover from Democratic voters. Even in the areas in which Toomey performed best in the Republican primary (mainly the state's conservative, rural center), Specter performed well. Except for his large margin of victory in almost uniformly Democratic [[Philadelphia]], Hoeffel was crushed at the polls; his only other wins came by close margins in three metro [[Pittsburgh]] counties; although President Bush proved to be unpopular in the state, voters were not willing to abandon Specter over party affiliation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | title=Archived copy | accessdate=April 30, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504141851/http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2004/09/27/News/Hoeffel.Trails.Specter.By.Large.Margin.In.Senate.Race-2150770.shtml | archive-date=May 4, 2009}}</ref>

The [[2002 United States Senate election in South Carolina|Senate election two years earlier in 2002]] did not have a primary election because the [[South Carolina Republican Party|South Carolina Republicans]] were more preoccupied with the [[2002 South Carolina gubernatorial election|gubernatorial contest]], despite having the first open senate seat in 40 years.  The retirement of Democratic Senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] gave the Republicans an opportunity to pick up the seat and with no other interesting positions up for election in 2004, a crowded field developed in the Republican primary.  Furthermore, the Republicans were motivated by having President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] at the top of the ticket enabling them to ride his coattails to victory.

Former [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[David Beasley]], from the [[Pee Dee]], entered the race and quickly emerged as the frontrunner because of his support from the evangelical voters.  However, during his term as governor from 1994 to 1998 he had greatly angered the electorate by proposing to remove the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack]] from the dome of the statehouse and by being against the adoption of a [[South Carolina Education Lottery|state lottery]] to provide for college scholarships. Both positions led to the loss of his [[1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election|re-election in 1998]] and the issues continued to trouble him in the Senate race.

The battle for second place in the primary was between [[The Upstate|Upstate]] congressman, [[Jim DeMint]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] developer [[Thomas Ravenel]].  DeMint was able to squeak out a second-place finish because [[Charlie Condon]], a former [[South Carolina Attorney General|Attorney General of South Carolina]], split the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] vote with Ravenel thus providing DeMint the margin he needed.  In addition, while many voters were attracted to the Ravenel campaign and felt that he had a future in politics, they believed that he should set his sights on a less high-profile office first before trying to become senator.  Resigned to defeat, Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the runoff election.

In the [[Two-round system|runoff election]] on June 22, 2004, DeMint scored a surprising victory over Beasley.  Ravenel's endorsement of DeMint proved crucial as the Lowcountry counties heavily went for the Representative from the Upstate.  Also, Beasley had burnt too many bridges while governor and was unable to increase his share of the vote in the runoff.

DeMint entered the general election campaign severely weakened from the primary fight, having spent most of his campaign funds.  He stressed to the voters that he would follow conservative principles and provide an important Republican vote in the closely divided Senate.  Democrats fared poorly in statewide elections in South Carolina, so Tenenbaum tried to make the race about issues rather than party identification.  She attacked DeMint's support of the [[FairTax]] proposal because it would increase the sales tax by 23%.  The election victory by DeMint merely cemented South Carolina's shift to the Republican column as the best candidate the Democrats could offer was soundly defeated by the typical 10 point margin.

{{Main|2004 United States Senate election in South Dakota}}
{{See also|List of United States Senators from South Dakota}}

In the 2004 Congressional elections, Daschle lost his seat to Republican challenger and former U.S. Representative [[John Thune]] in a bitterly contested battle. Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6–49.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator [[Ernest McFarland]] lost his seat to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Daschle's Senate term expired on January 3, 2005.

Throughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the "chief obstructionist" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects.

Daschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the [[September 11 attacks]] when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to "rubber stamp what the administration is doing." Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the [[Republican National Committee]] to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of "emboldening the enemy" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].

Daschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that [[Stephanie Herseth Sandlin|Stephanie Herseth]]'s election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result.

When the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49–49 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.

Thune was an aide to former Senator [[James Abdnor]], the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate.

Daschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota)|Tim Johnson]] in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, [[South Dakota]] would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty.

Incumbent Democrat [[Patty Murray]] won re-election. She became only the fourth Washington senator to win 3 consecutive terms, just after fellow Democrats [[Warren G. Magnuson]] and [[Henry M. Jackson|Scoop Jackson]]{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}.

Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt's broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unseated Speaker [[Tom Foley]] in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascades]] since [[Miles Poindexter]] in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|war in Iraq]]. Nethercutt supported the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start, and his campaign never gained much traction. In November, he lost by 12 points, receiving 43 percent of the vote to Murray's 55 percent.

Incumbent Democrat [[Russ Feingold]] won re-election to a third term.

Republican [[Tim Michels]], businessman and army veteran insisted he has more real world experience than Feingold, someone he called an "extreme liberal" who's out of touch with Wisconsin voters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112626866.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104080030/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112626866.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 November 2012|title=Michels Touts Rural Roots in Joining Gop Senate Race.(Front)|date=27 January 2004|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref> Feingold attacked back by saying that any Republican would be a rubber stamp for President Bush. The incumbent had $2.2 million in the bank, while Michels had already spent $1 million in the primary and had only about $150,000 left.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_6caAAAAIBAJ&pg=6652,3445599&dq=tim+michels&hl=en|title=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

When the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee|NRSC]] was finally convinced in October that Michels had a shot, they pledged $600,000 for him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1061D02F1E0B4413&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Pioneer Press: Search Results|website=nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>

On October 1, a poll showed Feingold leading 52% to 39%.<ref>http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1057665A96950BA6&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM</ref> In mid October, another poll showed Feingold winning 48% to 43%.
