'''''Beautiful Eyes''''' is the second [[extended play]] (EP) by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The EP was released on July 15, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]] exclusively to [[Walmart]] stores in the United States and online. The [[limited release]] EP has a primarily [[country pop]] sound and features alternate versions of tracks from her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut album]] (2006), and two original tracks, title track and "I Heart ?", which Swift had composed as early as 2003.<ref name="gac" /> "I Heart ?" was previously released for digital download with the purchase of the [[Best Buy]] exclusive version [[Compact disc|CD]] of Swift's self-titled debut album in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/757mmq/taylors_rarest_release_cd/|title=Taylor's Rarest Release CD : TaylorSwift|accessdate=June 21, 2019|website=[[Reddit]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://swiftdiscs.tumblr.com/post/148692097806/album-name-taylor-swift-best-buy-exclusive|title=Swift Discs|website=[[Tumblr]]|accessdate=June 21, 2019}}</ref> A [[DVD]], featuring music videos of singles from her self-titled debut album, is also included on the physical release of the EP.

''Beautiful Eyes'' peaked at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Top Country Albums]] chart, succeeding her self-titled debut album. "I Heart ?" was released as a [[promotional recording|promotional single]] in June 2008. Though the EP was not heavily promoted, Swift performed the title track at a few venues. While "Beautiful Eyes" and "I Heart ?" exist on [[Spotify]] as unplayable individual tracks on an alternate version of ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', the EP as a whole is Swift's only project to remain unavailable on streaming services.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/3Mvk2LKxfhc2KVSnDYC40I?highlight=spotify:track:2HxTSD72RBQR31HtyX72sf|title=Beautiful Eyes - Spotify|accessdate=May 29, 2020|website=[[Spotify]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/3Mvk2LKxfhc2KVSnDYC40I?highlight=spotify:track:1a5kAD0K7zijLlZokbRDe2|title=I Heart ? - Spotify|accessdate=May 29, 2020|website=[[Spotify]]}}</ref>

==Background==
Swift received much success with the release of her self-titled debut album ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006), and began working on her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), in 2007. During that time, she received a number of e-mails from fans requesting for new material to be released, which drove Swift into releasing ''Beautiful Eyes'': "I thought this might tide them over till the new album comes out in the fall."<ref name="gac">{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5903580_,00.html |title=Wal-Mart "Eyes" New Taylor Swift Project |date=July 15, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |work=[[Great American Country]] |publisher=[[Scripps Networks Interactive]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080719100609/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,3034,GAC_26063_5903580_,00.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 }}</ref> ''Beautiful Eyes'' is musically oriented to [[country pop]] and [[contemporary music]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1418581|pure_url=yes}}|title=Beautiful Eyes > Overview|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Macrovision Corporation]]|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It includes new versions of tracks from ''Taylor Swift'': an alternate version of "[[Should've Said No]]", the fifth single from the album, an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] version of "[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]", the second single from the album, a radio edit of "[[Picture to Burn]]", the fourth single from the album, and "I'm Only Me when I'm with You", a promotional single from the album. The EP also features two original songs, "Beautiful Eyes" and "I Heart?", which she previously wrote in 2003.<ref name="gac" /> The EP's DVD features music videos from the singles from ''Taylor Swift'', as well as a [[music video]] made for "Beautiful Eyes" from footage from Swift's eighteenth [[birthday party (event)|birthday party]].

Swift did not want any misconceptions of ''Beautiful Eyes'' as her second album and therefore partnered with the American [[retailing|retail]] company [[Wal-Mart]] to make the EP an exclusive release.<ref name="gac" /> The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website.<ref name="walmart">{{cite web |url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10177524 |title=Beautiful Eyes (Wal-Mart Exclusive) (Includes DVD) |work=Walmart.com |publisher=[[Wal-Mart]] |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |archivedate=March 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308012902/http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10177524 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Furthermore, it was made a [[Special edition|limited release]] because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture a certain number of copies of the EP.<ref name="gac" /> She said, "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases."<ref name="gac" />
