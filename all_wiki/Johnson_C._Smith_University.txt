'''Johnson C. Smith University''' ('''JCSU''') is a private, [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] university in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. It is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)]], [[National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education|National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education]] (NCATE), [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs|Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP), and [[Council on Social Work Education|Council on Social Work Accreditation]] (CSWE). The school awards [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Social Work]], and [[Master of Social Work]] degrees.

==History==
Johnson C. Smith University was established on April 7, 1867 as the '''Biddle Memorial Institute''' at a meeting of the Catawba Presbytery in the old Charlotte Presbyterian Church. [[Biddle family|Mary D. Biddle]], a churchwoman, donated $1,400 to the school. In appreciation of this first contribution, friends requested that Mrs. Biddle name the newly established school; she did so in the name of her late husband, Captain Henry Jonathan Biddle, who had been mortally wounded during the [[Battle of Glendale]] in 1862. Samuel C. Alexander and Willis L. Miller, saw the need for a school in the south and after the birth of the school, they were elected as some of the first teachers. Its corresponding [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's school]] was ''[[Barber-Scotia College#Scotia Seminary|Scotia Seminary]]'' (now [[Barber-Scotia College]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=/moa/amis/amis0033/&tif=00358.TIF|title=The American Missionary Volume 0033 Issue 11 (Nov 1879)|website=Cornell.edu|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref>

In 1876, the charter was changed by the legislature of the State of North Carolina and the name became '''Biddle University''', under which name the institution operated until 1923.

In 1891, Biddle University elected [[Daniel J. Sanders]] as the first African-American as President of a four-year institution in the south.

[[Image:JohnsonCsmith.jpg|thumb|left| Johnson Crayne Smith]]
From 1921 to 1922, Jane Berry Smith donated funds to build a theological dormitory, a science hall, a teachers' cottage, and a memorial gate. She also provided an endowment for the institution in memory of her late husband, [[Johnson C. Smith]]. Up until her death, she donated funds for five more buildings and a campus church. In recognition of these generous benefactions, the Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the institution to Johnson C. Smith University. The charter of the school, accordingly, was amended on March 1, 1923, by the legislature of the State of North Carolina.

In 1924, [[James B. Duke]] established the [[Duke Endowment]]. While the largest share of that the endowment's earnings are allocated to support [[Duke University]], Duke's donation required that 4% of its earnings be given to the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dukeendowment.org/sites/default/files/media/files/Duke-Indenture-2014DEC12.pdf |title=Trust Indenture|website=Dukendowment.org|accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref> Over the years, this share of the Endowment's distributions has exceeded $90 million.

In 1932, the university's charter was amended, providing for the admission of women. The 65-year-old institution for men then became partially coeducational. The first residence hall for women, named in memory of [[James B. Duke]], was dedicated in 1940. In 1941, women were admitted to the freshman class. In 1942, the university was a fully coeducational institution.

JCSU joined the [[United Negro College Fund]] in 1944 as a founding member. This fund was organized primarily to help church-related schools of higher learning to revamp their training programs, to expand their physical plants, to promote faculty growth and to create new areas of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncf.org |title=United Negro College Fund |website=UNCF.org |accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref>

[[Biddle Memorial Hall]] is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
