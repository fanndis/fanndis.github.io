The '''Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance''' is an award presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref> According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for solo (vocal or instrumental) country recordings and is limited to singles or tracks only.<ref name=Categorymapper>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper/new-category/124673/124753 |title=Category Mapper |accessdate=November 25, 2011 |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604022508/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper/new-category/124673/124753 |archivedate=June 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The award combines the previous categories for [[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]], [[Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]] (if it is an instrumental solo performance). The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between male and female performances.<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring Grammy Awards restructuring]</ref>
