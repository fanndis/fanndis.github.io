==Career==

===1981–84: Q, SSQ and ''Playback''===
{{Main|Q (band)|SSQ (band)}}
In 1981, Swain was introduced to [[Jon St. James]], the proprietor of Fullerton's [[Casbah Recording Studio]], which hosted recordings for the bands [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]] and [[Social Distortion]].<ref name=discogs2/><ref name=book/><ref name=kwalsh>{{cite web|url=http://www.synthbeat.com/shareef.html|title=Shareef Does Like It (Even If It’s Not Kosher) | work = Synthbeat.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> {{cquote|Jon was a big fan of synth bands like [[Kraftwerk]] and [[M (band)|M]]; when he met Stacey Swain in 1981, he knew right away that this impossibly stylish former Ringling Bros. elephant girl and veteran of the Disney Main Street parade possessed star qualities perfectly compatible with electronic music, a genre Stacey also adored. She was enamored of the obscure Japanese band [[Plastics (band)|The Plastics]] and [[The B-52's]], and simply could not get over [[David Bowie]]. As a student of style, Swain could literally turn rags into a fashion statement. On one occasion she went to the renaissance fair in [[Agoura, California|Agoura]] dressed simply in two large pieces of soft leather she bought from a shop in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]].<ref name=kwalsh/>}} St. James was developing a [[synthpop]] group called [[Q (band)|Q]], named after the [[Q (James Bond)|James Bond character]].<ref name=book/><ref name=discogs1>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/451269-Stacey-Swain|title=Discogs Stacey Swain Page|accessdate=2006-01-24}}</ref> The band consisted of St. James on guitars, and Dan Van Patten and [[John Van Tongeren]] on [[vocoder]] and synthesizer. She served as the assistant producer on the band's four tracks for ''The Q EP'' when St. James realized they needed a vocalist for their first track "Sushi", which Swain provided as she had previously recorded demos at his studio.<ref name=fb/><ref name=discogs1/> She then became the lead singer for Q, although at that time, she still considered herself more of a dancer than a singer.<ref name=os4l>{{cite web|url=http://oldschool4life.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=157&Itemid=2|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130111074100/http://oldschool4life.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=157&Itemid=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-11|title="The Stacey Q & A" at OldSchool4Life.com|accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref>{{cquote|In 1981, Q (the original project) was Jon, Dan and myself hence Jon Q, Dan Q and Stacey Q. Q, the original name of the project, references [[James Bond]] and the scientist responsible for all his high-tech gadgets.<ref name=os4l/>}}

''The Q EP'' received little airplay except on college radio. Its success led St. James and Swain to develop more songs.<ref name=book/><ref name=kwalsh/> In 1982, the group added drummer Karl Moet and synth player Rich West, but had to change their name because of copyright issues when producer [[Quincy Jones]] reportedly had "established use of the 'Q' moniker".<ref name=kwalsh/> They renamed the band [[SSQ (band)|SSQ]], which was inspired partly by a fishing endeavor where St. James "was fishing in a lake 'no bigger than a bathtub' and made a joke that the boat was the 'S.S. Q,'" and also that "SS" stood for Stacey Swain.<ref name=discogs1/> SSQ released their debut album ''[[Playback (SSQ album)|Playback]]'' in 1983 under [[Enigma Records]], which featured the single "Synthicide" that was also made into a music video.<ref name=book/>

===1985–87: Breakthrough, ''Stacey Q'' and ''Better Than Heaven''===
In 1985, Swain signed a recording contract with On the Spot Records, an independent label. Using Stacey Q as her moniker for solo works, she released her debut single "Shy Girl". Her [[Stacey Q (album)|eponymous]] album later was distributed in cassette format to limited release. The album contained an early version of "[[Two of Hearts (song)|Two of Hearts]]", which originally was released and performed by Sue Gatlin.<ref name=discogs1/> After her singles collectively sold several thousand copies, she signed with [[Atlantic Records]] with St. James as manager and the other members of SSQ as backup musicians.

She recorded the album ''[[Better Than Heaven]]'' in three weeks. Its title track was co-written by Berlin, "He Doesn't Understand" was written by [[Rusty Anderson]], and "[[We Connect]]" was written by Willie Wilcox of [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]]<ref name=book/> "[[Two of Hearts (song)|Two of Hearts]]", its lead single, received substantial radio airplay, along with its music video on [[MTV]], in the latter half of 1986. It reached number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart,<ref name=book/> and the top 10 in several other countries.<ref name=myspace/> The album reached number 59 on the US album chart, and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. "Two of Hearts" briefly was considered for a [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] parody, but the songwriters declined.<ref name=os4l/> She went on a U.S. and European club tour.<ref name=somethings/>

The success of "Two of Hearts" led Swain to television appearances on talk shows as well as guest panel appearances on game shows ''[[The Gong Show]]'' and ''[[The New Hollywood Squares]]''<ref name="book"/> She appeared as the character Cinnamon in the episode "Off-Broadway Baby" of the NBC sitcom ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' where she performed "Two of Hearts". In a follow-up episode, "A Star Is Torn", she performed "We Connect". Cast regular [[George Clooney]] made his farewell appearance when his character decides to join Cinnamon as a roadie.<ref name=book/>

===1988–92: ''Hard Machine'' and ''Nights Like This''===
Swain released ''[[Hard Machine]]'', the second Stacey Q album, in 1988. She changed her hair color from blond to red,<ref name=somethings/> and adopted a punk rock-influenced appearance. The album had other producers besides St. James, resulting in a different musical direction. The single "[[Don't Make a Fool of Yourself]]" peaked at number 66 on the [[US Hot 100]], with a remix by [[Shep Pettibone]] making the top five on the Hot Dance Chart. The single was featured in the ''[[Full House]]'' episode "[[Full House episodes (Season 1)#D.J. Tanner's Day Off|D.J. Tanner's Day Off]]", where she briefly appeared as Stacey Q. The songs "The River"  and "Another Chance" were featured in the cult action film ''One Man Force'', where she also had an appearance.<ref name=somethings/>

''[[Nights Like This (album)|Nights Like This]]'' was her third and final album with Atlantic. Released in 1989, it also marked SSQ's last participation. Its first single was "Give You All My Love," and "Heartbeat", its second single, featured backing vocals by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Its title track featured backing vocals by [[The Weather Girls]]. The musical style involved more experimenting with instruments such as [[Kawai Musical Instruments|Kawai]] keyboards.<ref name=discogs2/> She promoted the album with another national tour at various clubs.<ref name=somethings/> On television, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Mama's Family]]'' in which she was a member of an [[all-female band]] called The Bonecrushers.

===1993–97: ''Stacey Q's Greatest Hits'' and ''Boomerang''===
In 1993, Swain released the single "Too Hot for Love" under the independent label [[Thump Records]]. The single was structured toward an early-1990s dance sound and featured sexually suggestive lyrics, representing another change in direction for the artist.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Thump also gathered material from her first Atlantic Records album as well as tracks from Q and SSQ that never had been released on CD into a 1995 compilation album, ''[[Stacey Q's Greatest Hits]]''.<ref name=somethings/> Most of the tracks were either remixed or re-edited entirely from their original versions in an attempt to modernize them.<ref name=book/>

In the mid-1990s, Swain traveled to Tibet, where she was introduced to the monastic dance and song of the Far East.<ref name=book/> She also lived in Nepal where she studied at monasteries with Buddhist lamas and was trained in the ancient art of [[cham dance]].<ref name=myspace>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/officialstaceyq|title=Stacey Q at MySpace|accessdate=2007-01-31}}</ref> In 1997, she released the album ''[[Boomerang (Stacey Q album)|Boomerang]]'', which reflected her experiences there, as well as her conversion to Buddhism.  She also released a cover of a [[Janis Ian]] tune called "Tenderness", which reached number 5 on the Jamaican charts.<ref name=myspace/>

===1998–08: Other projects and hiatus===
Swain continued to be involved in various music and acting projects. She appeared in a gay-themed art film called ''Citizens of Perpetual Indulgence'',<ref name=qa/> and had a "special non-sexual appearance" in ''Playing the Odds''. She collaborated with director [[Karen Dior|Geoffrey Karen Dior]] on the compilation album ''[[Porn to Rock]]'' and Dior's 2001 album ''S E X''.<ref name=discogs2/><ref name=qa>{{cite web|url=http://home.pacbell.net/awiring/q&a.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021023110111/http://home.pacbell.net/awiring/q%26a.html|archive-date=2002-10-23|title="Stacey's Q & A" at The Official Stacey Q Fan Club|access-date=2007-04-20|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> In 2000, she played the lead female character [[Yeshe Tsogyal]] in a production of ''The Life of Padmasambhava'' by the San Francisco-based Namsay Dorje Theater Company.<ref name=myspace/> In 2002, Swain appeared in the "Identity Parade" round of the [[VH1]] game show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]''. She provided vocals for "Hear The Feeling", a 2003 single by Divine Frequency (Simply Jeff), that was used for the soundtrack of a documentary on [[rave party|raves]].<ref name=myspace/> She was the voice of [[List of Stratos 4 characters#Karin Kikuhara|Karin Kikuhara]] in the English-language version of ''[[Stratos 4]]'', a Japanese [[anime]] series.<ref name=myspace/> She provided vocals on the debut album of the Echo Junkies, a duo of former SSQ bandmates Jon St. James and Skip Hahn.<ref name=myspace/>

Thump Records released another Stacey Q compilation in 2007. ''Queen of the 80s'' contained original versions of many of her solo songs as well as songs by Q and SSQ. In November 2008, she appeared on CBS's ''The Early Show'' as part of the show's 1980s flashback segment where she sang "Two of Hearts".

===2009–present: ''Color Me Cinnamon''===
Swain provided guest vocals for Hydra Productions, a songwriting duo consisting of Shawn Winstian and Shane Condo. ''Liquid'', their debut album, featured appearances by dance-pop artists of the 1980s, including [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] and [[Gioia Bruno]] of [[Exposé (band)|Exposé]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_4XuixaEFo|title=Hydra Productions - Liquid|first=|last=poptoonz|date=6 May 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Hydra Productions signed her to a solo deal where she released "Trip", her first solo single in 12 years, in 2009. This was followed by the album ''[[Color Me Cinnamon]]'' in 2010 and the maxi-single "Pandora's Box". The album was produced by Jon St. James, and explored a modernized electro-house sound. In late October, she released the Halloween-themed ''Going Goth'' EP, which featured remixes of many songs from ''Color Me Cinnamon'' and the "Trick or Treat" maxi-single the following year. Since then, she has participated in various freestyle music festivals.

In June 2016, Stacey Q and Scott Larson released three songs on iTunes: "I Need His Voice", "Love Shouldn't Be That Way" and "Just a Little Bit". In November of the same year, a new song titled "You Are Hawaii to Me", a duet with Scott Larson, was released. In October 2017, "Dance, Love, Pray", a duet with Lori St. James, was released on iTunes.

On December 10, 2019, Stacey Q released the digital single, “Trippin’ Me Out.”

On January 1, 2020, Stacey Q's band, SSQ, released the full-length album, “Jet Town Je t’aime”, featuring “Trippin’ Me Out” plus 11 new songs. The album was produced by longtime Stacey Q producer, Jon St. James.
