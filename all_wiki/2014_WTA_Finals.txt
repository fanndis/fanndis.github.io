The tournament is run by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) as part of the [[2014 WTA Tour]]. Singapore is now the ninth city to host the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Finals since its inauguration in 1972 and will host the event for at least five years. The event will also hold two exhibition tournaments, WTA Rising Stars Invitational and the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Legends Event. The inaugural 2014 [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Rising Stars Invitational will be held during the WTA Finals from October 17–21, 2014. Four singles players age 23 or under were chosen by fan vote from qualifying nominees, two from the Asia-Pacific region and two from the Rest of World region, will participate in Singapore: [[Zarina Diyas]] and [[Zheng Saisai]], Asia-Pacific region; [[Monica Puig]] and [[Shelby Rogers]], Rest of World region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore selected to stage the end of season WTA championships|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/29/singapore-wta-championships-tennis|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 June 2014}}</ref>

===Qualifying===
In singles, point totals are calculated by combining point totals from sixteen tournaments. Of these sixteen tournaments, a player's results from the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events, the four [[WTA Premier tournaments#Premier Mandatory|Premier Mandatory]] tournaments, and the best results from two [[WTA Premier tournaments#Premier 5|Premier 5]] tournaments must be included.<br /> 
In doubles, point totals are calculated by any combination of eleven tournaments throughout the year. Unlike in singles, this combination does not need to include results from the Grand Slams or Premier-level tournaments.

===Format===
The singles event features eight players in a round robin event, split into two groups of four. Over the first four days of competition, each player meets the other three players in her group, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. The first-placed player in one group meets the second-placed player in the other group, and vice versa. The winners of each semifinal meet in the championship match.

====Round robin tie-breaking methods====
The final standings of each group were determined by the first of the following methods that applied:
# Greatest number of wins.
# Greatest number of matches played.
# Head-to-head results if only two players are tied, or if three players are tied then:
::a. If three players each have the same number of wins, a player having played less than all three matches is automatically eliminated and the player advancing to the single elimination competition is the winner of the match-up of the two remaining tied players.
::b. Highest percentage of sets won.
::c. Highest percentage of games won.

==Prize money and points==
The total prize money for the BNP Paribas 2014 WTA Finals was US$6,500,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Archive/MatchNotes/2014/808.pdf|title=Match Notes}}</ref>
