A '''hematoma''', also spelled '''haematoma''', is a localized [[bleeding]] outside of blood vessels, due to either disease or trauma including injury or surgery<ref>{{cite web |url= http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/ATHHTML/ATH040.html |title=Hematoma, toenail, gross |work=library.med.utah.edu |year=2013 |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> and may involve blood continuing to seep from broken [[capillary|capillaries]]. A hematoma is benign and is initially in liquid form spread among the tissues including in sacs between tissues where it may [[coagulate]] and solidify before blood is reabsorbed into blood vessels. An [[ecchymosis]] is a hematoma of the skin larger than 10&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hematoma/article_em.htm |title=Information on Hematoma Types, Causes, and Treatments on |publisher=Emedicinehealth.com |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref>

They may occur among/within many areas such as skin and other organs, connective tissues, bone, joints and muscle.

A collection of blood (or even a hemorrhage) may be aggravated by [[anticoagulant]] medication (blood thinner). Blood seepage and collection of blood may occur if [[heparin]] is given via an [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] route; to avoid this, heparin must be given [[intravenously]] or [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]].

It is not to be confused with [[hemangioma]], which is an abnormal buildup/growth of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001459.htm |title=Hemangioma |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |date=2016-04-05 |accessdate=2016-04-19 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Hematoma development.png|thumb|center|400px|Intramuscular hematoma development and progression on the [[vastus lateralis muscle]] from 6 hours after trauma to 86 hours.]]
Some hematomas are visible under the surface of the skin (commonly called bruises) or possibly felt as masses/lumps. Lumps may be caused by the limitation of the blood to a sac, [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] or intramuscular tissue space isolated by fascial planes. This is a key anatomical feature that helps prevent injuries from causing massive blood loss.  In most cases the hematoma such as a sac of blood eventually dissolves; however, in some cases they may continue to grow such as due to blood seepage or show no change. If the sac of blood does not disappear, then it may need to be surgically cleaned out/repaired.

The slow process of reabsorption of hematomas can allow the broken down blood cells and hemoglobin pigment to move in the connective tissue. For example, a patient who injures the base of his thumb might cause a hematoma, which will slowly move all through the finger within a week. [[Gravity]] is the main determinant of this process.

Hematomas on [[articulation (anatomy)|articulations]] can reduce mobility of a member and present roughly the same symptoms as a [[fracture (bone)|fracture]].

In most cases, movement and exercise of the affected muscle is the best way to introduce the collection back into the bloodstream.

A misdiagnosis of a hematoma in the vertebra can sometimes occur; this is correctly called a [[hemangioma]] (buildup of cells) or a benign tumor.

==Classification==

===Types===
[[File:Hematoma at backside.jpg|thumb|207x207px|Intramuscular hematoma at [[buttocks]] as a result of a [[sports injury]].]]
[[File:Types of Hematoma.jpg|thumb|307x307px|L to R: Epidural Hematoma, Subdural Hematoma, and Intracranial Hematoma.]]
* Subdermal hematoma (under the [[skin]])
* Intramuscular hematoma (inside [[muscle tissue]])
* Skull/brain:
** [[Subgaleal hematoma]] – between the [[galea aponeurosis]] and [[periosteum]]
** [[Cephalohematoma]] – between the [[periosteum]] and [[skull]].  Commonly caused by vacuum delivery and vertex delivery.
** [[Epidural hematoma]] – between the [[skull]] and [[dura mater]]
** [[Subdural hematoma]] – between the [[dura mater]] and [[arachnoid mater]]
** [[Subarachnoid hematoma]] – between the [[arachnoid mater]] and [[pia mater]] (the [[subarachnoid space]])
** [[Othematoma]] – between the skin and the layers of cartilage of the ear
* [[Breast hematoma]] ([[breast]])
* [[cauliflower ear|Perichondral hematoma]] ([[ear]])
* [[Perianal hematoma]] ([[anus]])
* [[Subungual hematoma]] (nail)
* [[Rectus sheath hematoma]]

===Degrees===
* [[Petechiae]] – small pinpoint hematomas less than 3&nbsp;mm in diameter
* [[Purpura]] (purple) – a bruise about 3 – 5&nbsp;mm in diameter, generally round in shape
* [[Ecchymosis]] – subcutaneous extravasation of blood in a thin layer under the skin, i.e. bruising or "black and blue," over 1&nbsp;cm in diameter<ref>{{Cite book|title=Robbins basic pathology|others=Kumar, Vinay, 1944-, Abbas, Abul K.,, Aster, Jon C.,, Perkins, James A.|isbn=9780323353175|edition=10th|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|pages=101|oclc=960844656|date = 2017-03-28}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The English word "hematoma" came into use in 1826. The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] αἷμα ''haima'' "blood" and -ωμα ''-oma'', a suffix forming nouns indicating a mass or tumor.<ref>[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=hematoma&allowed_in_frame=1 "hematoma"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]].''</ref>
