'''Parental leave''', or '''family leave''', is an [[employee benefit]] available in almost all countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-behind-world-parental-leave-policy-study-papua-new-guinea-swaziland-u-s-lag-article-1.134271|title=U.S. behind most of world in parental leave policy: study; Papua New Guinea, Swaziland & U.S. lag|newspaper=Daily News|location=New York|date=24 December 2011}}</ref> The term "parental leave" may include [[maternity]], [[Paternity (law)|paternity]], and [[adoption]] leave; or may be used distinctively from "maternity leave" and "paternity leave" to describe separate family leave available to either parent to care for small children.<ref name="Ruhm">{{Cite journal |last=Ruhm |first=Christopher J. |s2cid=51297709 |title=The Economic Consequences of Parental Leave Mandates: Lessons from Europe |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=113 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=285–317 |doi=10.1162/003355398555586 |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/C_Ruhm_Economic_1998.pdf }}</ref> In some countries and jurisdictions, "family leave" also includes leave provided to care for ill family members. Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.

Unpaid parental or family leave is provided when an employer is required to hold an employee's job while that employee is taking leave. Paid parental or family leave provides [[paid time off]] work to care for or make arrangements for the welfare of a child or dependent family member. The three most common models of funding are government-mandated social insurance/social security (where employees, employers, or taxpayers in general contribute to a specific public fund), employer liability (where the employer must pay the employee for the length of leave), and mixed policies that combine both social security and employer liability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Addati|first=Laura|date=1 January 2015|title=Extending maternity protection to all women: Trends, challenges and opportunities|journal=International Social Security Review|volume=68|issue=1|pages=69–93|doi=10.1111/issr.12060|issn=1468-246X}}</ref>

Parental leave has been available as a [[legal right]] and/or governmental program for many years, in one form or another. In 2014, the [[International Labour Organization]] reviewed parental leave policies in 185 countries and territories, and found that all countries except [[Papua New Guinea]] have laws mandating some form of parental leave.<ref>International Labour Organization. (2014).

Private employers sometimes provide either or both unpaid and paid parental leave outside of or in addition to any legal mandate.

== Economic models ==

=== Benefits of universal, paid parental leave ===

==== Capabilities approach ====
[[Jeremiah Carter]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] have developed a political model known as the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]], where basic freedoms and opportunities are included in economic assessments of a country's well-being, in addition to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref>Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.</ref><ref name="Nussbaum">Nussbaum, Martha. 2011. Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 34</ref> Nussbaum proposed [[Capability approach#Nussbaum.27s central capabilities|11 central capabilities]] as the minimum requirement for a decent society. In Nussbaum's model, states should provide the resources and freedoms to ensure people have the opportunity to achieve a minimum threshold of each central capability. Universal, paid parental leave is an example resource states can provide so people have the option of starting a family while also working; for instance, under [[Capability approach#Nussbaum.27s central capabilities|capacity 10 (control of one's environment)]], the state has a responsibility to ensure all people have "the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others."<ref name="Nussbaum"/>

==== Income and workforce ====
Paid parental leave [[Incentive#Economics|incentivizes]] labor market attachment for women both before and after birth, affecting GDP and national productivity, as the [[workforce]] is larger.<ref name="Geyer1">{{cite journal|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/diw/diwwpp/dp1366.html|title=The Effects of Family Policy on Mothers' Labor Supply: Combining Evidence from a Structural Model and a Natural Experiment|first1=Johannes|last1=Geyer|first2=Peter|last2=Haan|first3=Katharina|last3=Wrohlich|date=1 January 2014|via=RePEc – IDEAS}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kluve | first1 = J. | last2 = Tamm | first2 = M. | s2cid = 6446330 | year = 2013 | title = Parental Leave Regulations, Mothers' Labor Force Attachment and Fathers' Childcare Involvement: Evidence from a Natural Experiment | journal = Journal of Population Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 983–1005 | doi = 10.1007/s00148-012-0404-1 | hdl = 10419/149390 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref name=":1"/><ref>Note: Rønsen & Kitterød, in their literature review on p. 60, reference several other citations to this same point, q.v., Marit Rønsen and Marianne Sundstrøm [1996]; Jutta M.

Paid parental leave [[Incentive#Economics|incentivizes]] childbirth, which affects the future workforce. It is thus argued that paid parental leave, in contrast to unpaid parental leave, is harmful to children's welfare because in countries with an [[population aging|aging workforce]] or countries with [[sub-replacement fertility]], children are born not because the parents want the child and can meet the child's needs but because children are expected to support their parents. Some see children as responsible for supporting all those in older generations in the society (not just the child's specific parents); their earnings are expected not to be saved for the children's own old age, but to be spent on the earlier generations' demand for [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] and [[pension]]s for which there was inadequate savings.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bittman | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Parenthood Without Penalty: Time Use And Public Policy in Australia And Finland | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 27–42 | doi = 10.1080/135457099337798 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Esping-Andersen | first1 = G | s2cid = 143983889 | year = 2003 | title = Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium | journal = [[The European Legacy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| page = 606 | doi = 10.1080/1084877032000153975 }}</ref>

=== Challenges to universal, paid leave ===

==== Statistical discrimination ====
The [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomics of labour markets|neoclassical model of labor markets]] predicts that, if the cost of hiring women of child-bearing years is anticipated to increase (either because the employer is mandated to pay for maternity leave or because she will be absent from work on public leave), then the "demand" for women in the labor market will decrease. While gender discrimination is illegal, without some kind of remedy the neoclassical model would predict "statistical discrimination" against hiring women of child-bearing years.<ref>Akerlof, G. A., & Kranton, R. E. (2010). Identity Economics: How Our Identities Shape Our Work, Wages, and Well-Being. Princeton: Princeton University Press</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Esping-Andersen | first1 = G | s2cid = 143983889 | year = 2003 | title = Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium | journal = [[The European Legacy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 599–610 | doi = 10.1080/1084877032000153975 }}</ref> To counteract this, some countries have introduced policies to increase rates of paternity leave to spread the cost impact more evenly across the labor market.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/paid-parental-leave-including-mandatory-paternity-leave|title=Paid parental leave, including mandatory paternity leave {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref>

==== Occupational sex segregation ====
If women take long parental leaves, the neoclassical model would predict that their lifetime earnings and opportunities for promotion will be less than their male or [[childfree]] counterparts—the "[[motherhood penalty]]".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Theunisse | first1 = G. | last2 = Verbruggen | first2 = M. | last3 = Forrier | first3 = A. | last4 = Sels | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Career Sidestep, Wage Setback?

The study found that, while in the "family-friendly" sector there was basically no wage loss related to taking parental leave, women did have consistent earnings loss in the "non-family-friendly" private sector for one year's leave.<ref name="Geyer1"/>

==== Cost ====
Universal, paid parental leave can be privately funded (i.e., corporations are mandated to absorb the cost of paid parental [[paid time off|time off]] as part of [[employee benefit]]s) or publicly funded (i.e., transferred directly to workers on leave, like [[unemployment insurance]]). Concerns about private funding include the statistical discrimination described above as well as the costs to smaller businesses. Datta Gupta, Smith, & Verneer found in 2008 that, while publicly funded parental leave has benefits, it is very expensive to fund and question if it is the most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] use of funds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Datta Gupta | first1 = N. | last2 = Smith | first2 = N. | last3 = Verner | first3 = M. | s2cid = 56077457 | year = 2008 | title = PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE: The impact of Nordic countries' family friendly policies on employment, wages, and children | journal = Review of Economics of the Household | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 65–89 | doi=10.1007/s11150-007-9023-0}}</ref>

==== Criticism of the 'father quota' ====
{{Main|Father's quota}}
The father's quota is a policy implemented by some countries or companies that reserves a part of the parental leave or other types of family leave for the father. If the father does not take this reserved part of leave, the family loses that leave period—that is, it cannot be transferred to the mother.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1332/policypress/9781447310471.001.0001|title = Fatherhood in the Nordic Welfare states|year = 2014|isbn = 9781447310471|last1 = Eydal|first1 = Gu?n? Bj"rk|last2 = Rostgaard|first2 = Tine}}</ref> Given the high rates of women's participation in the formal labor force in many parts of the world, there is increasing interest among social scientists and policymakers in supporting a more equal division of labor between partners. Some critics question whether such policies are evidence-based and express concern that they are "a social experiment, the effects of which are unknown".<ref name="aftenposten2291665">{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2291665.ece|title=Kvinner er mer opptatt av barna sine enn menn, sier forsker|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> However, other studies have shown that paternity leave improves bonds between fathers and children and also helps mitigate the wage gap women face after taking maternity leave.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/hr/2018/mandatory-paternity-leave-the-next-must-have-benefit|title=Mandatory Paternity Leave: The Next Must-Have Benefit?|website=business.linkedin.com|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref> Other psychological perspectives summarise evidence and find that the role of a father in child development is very similar to that of a mother, counteracting the concern that greater paternal involvement in childcare could lead to unforeseen negative consequences.<ref>Lamb, Michael E. (2010) The Role of the Father in Child Development. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons</ref> Criticism is often less concerned about the idea of paternity leave itself, but condemns the fact that father's quota policies do not allow that time to be allocated to the mother instead. Critics argue that the quota harms mothers, depriving them of much needed leave, trivializes biological realities, and is an example of discrimination against mothers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kvinnesak.no/2015/10/venstre-krav-for-likestilling-likedeling-av-foreldrepermisjonen-diskriminering-av-mor-og-barn/|title=Likedeling av foreldrepermisjonen er diskriminering av mor og barn|date=21 October 2015|website=Norsk Kvinnesaksforening|language=nb-NO|access-date=26 June 2019}}</ref>

In the European Union, non-transferable parental leave remains a controversial issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/1358229118788458|title=The evolution of gender equality and related employment policies|year=2018|last1=Busby|first1=Nicole|journal=International Journal of Discrimination and the Law|volume=18|issue=2–3|pages=104–123|s2cid=149870156|doi-access=free}}</ref> It was first introduced by the [[Parental Leave Directive 2010]], which required at least one month of the minimum four months of parental leave be non-nontransferable; this non-transferable period was increased to two months by the [[Directive (EU) 2019/1158|Work–Life Balance Directive of 2019]], which must be transposed by member states at the latest on 2 August 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibanet.org/Article/NewDetailPreview.aspx?ArticleUid=9ea8ade6-022a-4f0b-bba2-6860ad994191|title=IBA - New EU Directive seeks to address employees' work–life balance|website=www.ibanet.org}}</ref> Originally, the plan under the Work–Life Balance Directive was to increase the non-transferable period to four months, but due to inability to reach consensus among [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], a compromise was reached at two months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coface-eu.org/europe/reaction-epsco-work-life-balance-directive/|title=What is left of the ambitious proposal for an EU Work–Life Balance Directive? &#124; COFACE|first=Isabell|last=Wutz}}</ref><ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L1158&from=EN</ref>(note: this refers to the specific type of leave called parental leave, under EU law there are different types of leave, such as maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carer leave which are regulated differently).

=== Comparison between countries ===
Comparison between countries in term of [[employee benefit]]s to leave for parents are often attempted, but these are very difficult to make because of the complexity of types of leave available and because terms such as maternity leave, paternity leave, pre-natal leave, post-natal leave, parental leave, family leave and home-care leave, have different meanings in different jurisdictions. Such terms may often be used incorrectly. Comparing the length of ''maternity leave'' (which is common in international rankings) may say very little about the situation of a family in a specific country. A country for example may have a long maternity leave but a short (or non-existent) parental or family leave, or vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.novinite.com/articles/187207/CNN%3A+The+world%27s+Longest+Paid+Motherhood+is+in+Bulgaria|title=CNN: The world's Longest Paid Motherhood is in Bulgaria – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency|website=novinite.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/family-leave-in-latvia-among-the-worlds-best.a283417/ | title=Family leave in Latvia – among the world's best}}</ref> In the [[European Union]], each country has its own policies, which vary significantly, but all the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/know-your-rights/equality_en|title=Equality|website=European Commission – European Commission}}</ref>

Sometimes there is a distortion in how maternity leave is reported and delimitated from other types of leave, especially in jurisdictions where there is no clear legal term of "maternity leave", and such term is used informally to denote either the minimum or the maximum period of parental leave reserved by quota to the mother.<ref name="leavenetwork.org">https://www.leavenetwork.org/fileadmin/user_upload/k_leavenetwork/country_notes/2018/FINAL.Norway2018.pdf</ref> Some countries may be listed artificially as having more or less generous benefits. Sweden is sometimes listed in international statistics as having 480 days' "maternity leave",<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?id=344 |title = Maternity leave benefits}}</ref> although these days include parental leave.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://iclg.com/practice-areas/employment-and-labour-laws-and-regulations/sweden | title=International Comparative Legal Guides}}</ref> As such, Sweden is often quoted as having an exceptionally long leave, although there are several countries with significantly longer leave, when maternity leave and other leaves are added, where a parent may take leave until a child is 3 years of age.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/ilo-bookstore/order-online/books/WCMS_242615/lang--en/index.htm |isbn = 9789221286301|title = Maternity and paternity at work: Law and practice across the world|date = 13 May 2014|last1 = Addati|first1 = Laura|last2 = Cassirer|first2 = Naomi|last3 = Gilchrist|first3 = Katherine}}</ref>

==International minimum standards==
The [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]] requires at least 14 weeks of maternity leave. In the [[European Union]], the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] requires at least 14 weeks of maternity leave; while the [[Directive (EU) 2019/1158|Work–Life Balance Directive]] requires at least 10 days of paternity leave, as well as at least 4 months of parental leave, with 2 months being non-transferable.

== Effects ==
Typically, the effects of parental leave are improvements in prenatal and postnatal care, including a decrease in infant mortality.<ref name="Motherhood Manifesto">{{cite book |last1=Blades |first1=Joan |first2=Kristin |last2=Rowe-Finkbeiner |year=2006 |title=The Motherhood Manifesto: What America's Moms Want and What to Do about It |location=New York |publisher=Nation |isbn=978-1-56025-884-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/motherhoodmanife00blad }}</ref> The effects of parental leave on the labor market include an increase in employment, changes in wages, and fluctuations in the rate of employees returning to work.

E.| last2 = Plantenga | first2 = J.}}</ref>

=== On the labor market ===
A study in Germany found that wages decreased by 18 percent for every year an employee spends on parental leave.<ref name="Utrecht"/> However, after the initial decrease in wages, the employee's salary rebounds faster than the salary of someone not offered parental leave.<ref name="Utrecht"/> A study of California's leave policy, the first state in the U.S. to require employers to offer paid parental leave, showed that wages did increase.<ref name="NBER">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/pam.21676| pmid = 23547324| title = The Effects of California's Paid Family Leave Program on Mothers' Leave-Taking and Subsequent Labor Market Outcomes| journal = [[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]| volume = 32| issue = 2| pages = 224–245| year = 2013| last1 = Rossin-Slater | first1 = M.| last2 = Ruhm | first2 = C. J.| last3 = Waldfogel | first3 = J.| pmc = 3701456| citeseerx = 10.1.1.704.5350}}</ref>

Parental leave can lead to greater job security.<ref name="Utrecht"/> Studies differ in how this helps return to work after taking time off. Some studies show that if a parent is gone for more than a year after the birth of a child, it decreases the possibility that he or she will return.<ref name="Utrecht"/> Other studies of shorter leave periods show that parents no longer need to quit their jobs in order to care for their children, so employment return increases.<ref name="NBER"/>

It does not appear that parental leave policies have had a significant effect on the gender wage gap, which has remained relatively steady since the late 1980s, despite increasing adoption of parental leave policies.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | last1 = Rønsen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kitterød | first2 = R.

==== Maternity leave and its effects ====

In the U.S., while the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] (FMLA) allows for unpaid parental leave, parents often do not utilize this eligibility to its fullest extent as it is unaffordable. As a result, some studies show that the FMLA has had a limited impact on how much leave new parents take.<ref name="HanWaldfogel">{{cite journal|last2=Waldfogel|first2=J.|year=2003|title=Parental Leave: The Impact of Recent Legislation on Parents' Leave-Taking|journal=Demography|volume=40|issue=1|pages=191–200|doi=10.1353/dem.2003.0003|pmid=12647520|last1=Han|first1=W.-J.|s2cid=22696348}}</ref> Though specific amounts can vary, having a child (including the cost of high-quality childcare) costs families approximately $11,000 in the first year.<ref name="Miller"/> These high costs contribute to new mothers in the United States returning to work quicker than new mothers in European countries; approximately one third of women in the United States return to work within three months of giving birth, compared to approximately five per cent in the U.K., Germany, and Sweden,<ref>Berger, L.M., Hill, J. et al. 2005. "Maternity Leave, Early Maternal Employment and Child Health Development in the US." ''The Economic Journal''. 115(501):F29-F47.</ref> and just over half of mothers in the United States with a child under the age of one work.<ref>(Johnson 2007)</ref>

There is some evidence that legislation for parental leave raises the likelihood of women returning to their previous jobs as opposed to finding a new job. This rise is thought to fall to between 10% and 17%. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the percentage of women who find new jobs, which falls between 6% and 11%. Thus, such legislation appears to increase how many women return to work post-childbirth by around 3% or 4%.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Baum II|first=Charles L.|date=April 2003|title=The Effects of Maternity Leave Legislation on Mothers' Labor Supply after Childbirth|jstor=1061651|journal=Southern Economic Journal|volume=69|issue=4|pages=772–799|doi=10.2307/1061651}}</ref>

Additionally, it appears that parental leave policies do allow women to stay home longer before returning to work as the probability of returning to an old job falls in the second month after childbirth before dramatically rising in the third month. Although this legislation thus appears to have minimal effect on women choosing to take leave, it does appear to increase the time women take in leave.<ref name=":0"/>

Maternity leave legislation could pose benefits or harm to employers. The main potential drawback of mandated leave is its potential to disrupt productive activities by raising rates of employee absenteeism. With mandated leave for a certain period of time and facing prolonged absence of the mothers in the workplace, firms will be faced with two options: hire a temp (which could involve training costs) or function with a missing employee. Alternatively, these policies could be positive for employers who previously did not offer leave because they were worried about attracting employees who were disproportionately likely to use maternity leave. Thus, there is potential for these policies to correct [[market failure]]s.<ref name=":0"/> A drawback of rising leave at the societal level, however, is the resulting decrease in female labor supply. In countries with a high demand for labor, including many present-day countries with aging populations, a smaller labor supply is unfavorable.<ref name=":1"/>

Something important to note for all the research cited above is that the results typically depend on how leave coverage is defined, and whether the policies are for unpaid or paid leave. Policies guaranteeing paid leave are considered by some to be dramatically more effective than unpaid-leave policies.<ref name="HanWaldfogel"/>

For women individually, long breaks in employment, as would come from parental leave, negatively affects their careers. Longer gaps are associated with reduced lifetime earnings and lower pension disbursements as well as worsened career prospects and reduced earnings. Due to these drawbacks, some countries, notably Norway, have expanded family policy initiatives to increase the father's quota and expand childcare in an effort to work towards greater gender equality.<ref name=":1"/>

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks led mothers to spend more time at home without a reduction in family income.<ref name="What is the case">{{Cite journal|last1=Dahl|first1=Gordon B.|last2=Løken|first2=Katrine V.|last3=Mogstad|first3=Magne|last4=Salvanes|first4=Kari Vea|s2cid=57565748|date=23 March 2016|title=What Is the Case for Paid Maternity Leave?|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=98|issue=4|pages=655–670|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00602|issn=0034-6535|hdl=10419/90025|url=http://ekstern.filer.uib.no/svf/2013/WP9.13.pdf}}</ref>

==== Paternity leave and its effects ====
The term 'paternity leave' refers to the leave that is exclusively granted to the fathers to enable them in spending time with their new-born child. Although parental leave is increasingly granted to fathers, mothers continue to take the majority of guaranteed parental leave.<ref name="Ruhm"/> When guaranteed leave is unpaid, research indicates that men's leave usage is unaffected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Waldfogel|first1=J|last2=Han|first2=WJ|s2cid=22696348|date=February 2003|title=Parental leave: the impact of recent legislation on parents' leave taking|journal= Demography|volume=40|issue=1|pages=191–200|pmid=12647520|doi=10.1353/dem.2003.0003}}</ref> In Germany, where parental leave is guaranteed for both parents, the financial incentive, alone, was not enough to encourage fathers to take paternal leave.<ref>VOGL, S., & KRELL, C. (2012). PARENTAL LEAVE AND PARENTING BENEFITS: Potential Effects on Father Participation in Germany. ''International Journal of Sociology of the Family,'' ''38''(1), 19–38. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388</ref> While uncommon on a world scale, some countries do reserve parts of the paid leave for the father, meaning it can't be transferred to the mother and lapses unless he uses it. Among the earliest countries to actively push for increased usage of paternity leave are the Nordic welfare states, starting with Sweden making parental leave gender neutral in 1974 and soon followed by Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Finland. These countries lack a unified concept of paternity leave, each imposing different conditions, ratios and timescales, but are regarded as among the most generous in the world.

Partly in an initiative to combat the "motherhood penalty", [[Norway]] in 1993 initiated a policy change to incentivize [[Fathers rights movement#Parental leave|paternal leave]], the so-called "[[father's quota]]", and Sweden followed suit in 1995. This means a certain number of parental leave-days can only be used by the father, and are otherwise lost. In countries in which leave entitlements include a father's quota, there has been a pronounced impact, with the quota being credited for increasing paternal involvement and challenging gender roles within the family, promoting a more equal division of labor.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Ronsen|first1=Marit|last2=Kitterod|first2=Ragni Hege|s2cid=154808826|date=July 2014|title=Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence from Norway|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|pages=59–89|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}</ref> To evaluate this change, Rønsen and Kitterød looked at the rate and timing of women's return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy. In their 2015 study, Rønsen and Kitterød found [[women in Norway]] returned to work significantly faster after the policy change.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Kitterød|first2=R. H.|year=2015|title=Gender-equalizing family policies and mothers' entry into paid work: recent evidence from Norway|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|issue=1|pages=59–89 [84]|last1=Rønsen|first1=M.|s2cid=154808826|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}</ref> However, public or subsidized daycare was greatly expanded at the same time, so Rønsen and Kitterød did not find that the "father's quota" was solely responsible for the timing of work entry. But it can be understood to have an effect on [[Division of labour#Gendered division of labour|division of household labor]] by gender when both parents can take time to care for a new baby.<ref name=":1"/>

Another impact from fathers taking more leave is that in Norway it has been shown to have the potential to either decrease or increase the time women take, depending on whether the mother's and father's childcare are seen as [[Substitute good|substitutes]] or [[Complement good|complements]]. If substitute goods, mothers are able to return to work sooner as fathers take some of the childcare responsibility. Research has suggested a class element is at play: middle class fathers consider themselves a suitable alternative to the mother as primary caregiver, while working-class men may see themselves more as supporters of their partner during her leave. Consequently, middle class fathers may be more likely to use their allotment of leave right after the mother returns to work, while working class fathers may opt to take their leave during the mother's leave.<ref>[[Berit Brandth|Brandth, B.]], & [[Elin Kvande|Kvande, E.]] (2016). Fatherhood in the Nordic Welfare States: Comparing Care Policies and Practice. Bristol, United Kingdom: Policy Press.</ref> In some cases, longer leave for fathers can motivate mothers to also stay home.<ref name=":1"/>

Fathers tend to use less parental leave than mothers in the United States as well as in other countries where paid leave is available,<ref name="HanWaldfogel"/><ref name="Bygren">{{cite journal|last2=Duvander|first2=A.-Z.|year=2006|title=Parents' Workplace Situation and Fathers' Parental Leave Use|url=https://zenodo.org/record/997940|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=68|issue=2|pages=363–372|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2006.00258.x|last1=Bygren|first1=M}}</ref> and this difference may have factors other than the financial constraints which impact both parents. Bygren and Duvander,<ref name="Bygren"/> looking at the use of parental leave by fathers in Sweden, concluded that fathers' workplace characteristics (including the size of the workplace, whether there were more men or women in the workplace, and whether the workplace was part of the private or public sector) influenced the length of parental leave for fathers, as did the presence of other men who had taken parental leave at an earlier point in time. As of 2016 paternity leave accounts for 25% of paid parental leave in Sweden.

==== Length of leave ====

In 2013, Joseph, Pailhé, Recotillet, and Solaz published a [[natural experiment]] evaluating a 2004 policy change in [[France]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The economic impact of taking short parental leave: Evaluation of a French reform|last1 = Joseph|first1 = Olivier|year = 2013|journal = Labour Economics, 25(European Association of Labour Economists 24th Annual Conference, Bonn, Germany, 20–22 September 2012)|doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2013.04.012|last2 = Pailhé |volume=25 |pages=63–75}}</ref> They were interested in the economic effects of full-time, short paid parental leave. Before the reform, women had a mandatory two-month parental leave, and could take up to three years' unpaid parental leave with their job guaranteed, though most women only took the two months. The new policy, ''complément libre choix d'activité'' (CLCA), guarantees six months of paid parental leave. The authors found positive effects on employment: compared to women in otherwise similar circumstances before the reform, first-time mothers who took the paid leave after the reform were more likely to be employed after their leave, and less likely to stay out of the labor force. The authors point to similar results of full-time, short paid parental leave observed in Canada in 2008 by Baker and Milligan,<ref>Baker, M., Milligan, K.,2008. How does job-protected maternity leave affect mothers' employment? [https://www.jstor.org/journal/jlaboreconomics Journal of Labor Economics] 26,655–692.</ref> and in Germany in 2009 by Kluve and Tamm.<ref>Kluve, J., Tamm, M.,2009. [http://ftp.iza.org/dp4500.pdf Now daddy's changing diapers and mommy's making her career: evaluating a generous parental leave regulation using a natural experiment]. IZA Discussion Papers 4500. Institute for the Study of Labor(IZA).</ref> However, Joseph {{Lang|la|et al.}} also found that wages were lower (relative to women before the reform) for moderately and highly educated women after the leave, which could be because the women returned to work part-time or because of a "motherhood penalty", where employers discriminate against mothers, taking the six-month leave as a "signal" that the woman will not be as good of an employee because of her mothering responsibilities.

Rasmussen analyzed a similar [[natural experiment]] in Denmark with a policy change in 1984 where parental leave increased from 14 to 20 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rasmussen | first1 = A. W. | year = 2010 | title = Increasing the length of parents' birth-related leave: The effect on children's long-term educational outcomes | journal = Labour Economics | volume = 17 | pages = 91–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2009.07.007 }}</ref> Rasmussen found the increased length of parental leave had no negative effect on women's wages or employment and in the short run (i.e., 12 months) it had a positive effect on women's wages, compared to the shorter leave. There was no difference on children's long-term educational outcomes before and after the policy change.

=== On health and development ===

According to a 2020 study, parental leave leads to better health outcomes for children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danzer|first=Natalia|last2=Halla|first2=Martin|last3=Schneeweis|first3=Nicole|last4=Zweimüller|first4=Martina|date=2020-11-10|title=Parental Leave, (In)formal Childcare and Long-Term Child Outcomes|url=http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/11/04/jhr.58.2.0619-10257R1|journal=Journal of Human Resources|language=en|pages=0619|doi=10.3368/jhr.58.2.0619-10257R1|issn=0022-166X}}</ref> A Harvard report cited research showing paid maternity leave "facilitates breastfeeding and reduces risk of infection"<ref name="Motherhood Manifesto"/> but is not associated with changes in immunization rate.<ref name=":2"/> This research also found that countries with parental leave had lower infant mortality rates.<ref name="Motherhood Manifesto"/> Returning to work within 12 weeks was also associated with fewer regular medical checkups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Lawrence M.|last2=Hill|first2=Jennifer|last3=Waldfogel|first3=Jane|s2cid=80026676|date=February 2005|title=Maternity leave, early maternal employment and child health and development in the US|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=115|issue=501|pages=F29–F47|doi=10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00971.x}}</ref> Data from 16 European countries during the period 1969–1994 revealed that the decrease of infant mortality rates varied based on length of leave. A 10-week leave was associated with a 1–2% decrease; a 20-week leave with 2–4%; and 30 weeks with 7–9%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruhm|first=C.|year=2000|title=Parental leave and child health|journal=Journal of Health Economics|volume=19|issue=6|pages=931–60|doi=10.1016/s0167-6296(00)00047-3|pmid=11186852|citeseerx=10.1.1.1021.2259|s2cid=24034206}}</ref> The United States, which does not have a paid parental leave law, ranked 56th in the world in 2014 in terms of infant mortality rates, with 6.17 deaths per every 1,000 children born.<ref name="CIA">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref> The research did not find any infant health benefits in countries with unpaid parental leave.

Paid leave, particularly when available prior to childbirth, had a significant effect on birth weight. The frequency of low birth rate decreases under these policies, which likely contributes to the decrease in infant mortality rates as low birth weight is strongly correlated with infant death. However, careful analysis reveals that increased birth weight is not the sole reason for the decreased mortality rate.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Sakiko|s2cid=78050964|date=January 2005|title=Parental leave and child health across OECD countries|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=115|issue=501|pages=F7–F28|doi=10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00970.x}}</ref>

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had little effect on children's schooling.<ref name="What is the case"/> However, when infants bond and have their needs met quickly by caregivers (mothers, fathers, etc.) they will become confident and be prepared to have healthy relationships throughout their life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/medicalcenter/healthtips/20100114_infant-bonding.html|title=Bonding is essential for normal infant development|website=UC Davis Medical Center|last1=Steinfeld|first1=Mary|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>

Children whose mothers worked in the first 9 months were found to be less ready for school at the age of 3 years. The effects of mothers' employment appeared to be the most detrimental when employment started between the sixth and ninth month of life. The reasons for this were uncertain, but there is conjecture that there was something unusual for the group of mothers who returned to work in this time period as they represented only 5% of all families studied. Negative impacts in terms of school-readiness were most pronounced when the mother worked at least 30 hours per week. These findings were complicated by many factors, including race, poverty, and how sensitive the mother was considered. The effects were also greater in boys, which is explained by the fact that many analysts consider boys more vulnerable to stress in early life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brooks-Gunn|first1=Jeanne|last2=Han|first2=Wen-Jui|last3=Waldfogel|first3=Jane|date=August 2002|title=Maternal Employment and Child Cognitive Outcomes in the First Three Years of Life: The NICHD Study of Early Child Care|journal=Child Development|volume=73|issue=4|pages=1052–1072|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00457|pmid=12146733}}</ref>

The same Harvard report also linked paid parental leave and a child's psychological health. It found that parents with paid parental leave had closer bonds with their children.<ref name="Motherhood Manifesto"/> Based on research of heterosexual couples, better immersion of the father in the process of raising a child can lead to improved development outcomes for the child and a better relationship between the parents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fira.ca/cms/documents/29/Effects_of_Father_Involvement.pdf|title=Allen, Sarah and Kerry Daly. 2007.

Families do take into account relative income levels of each parent when planning for parental leave; the partner earning a lower wage may be more likely to take parental leave.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-001-x/2008106/article/10639-eng.htm|title=Perspectives on Labour and Income: Fathers' use of paid parental leave|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref> There is also often workplace pressure on men not to take paternity leave, or to take less than the maximum time allowed. To counteract these pressures and encourage paternity leave, some countries have experimented with making paternity leave mandatory or otherwise incentivizing it.<ref name="auto"/>

There are also observable improvements in the mental health of mothers when they are able to return to work later. While the probability of experiencing postpartum depression had no significant statistical change, longer leave (leave over 10 weeks) was associated with decreased severity of depression and decreased number of experienced symptoms. This reduction was, on average, between 5% and 10%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Chatterji |first1=Pinka |last2=Markowitz |first2=Sara |s2cid=149917144 |title=Does The Length of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |year=2005 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=16–41 |doi=10.2307/20062092 |jstor=20062092 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10206.pdf }}</ref>

Studies looking for a connection between paid parental leave have shown conflicting results. Some research looked at women 25–34 years old, who are more likely to be affected by leave legislation. Fertility rates peaked for those between 25–29 and 30–34 across European countries.<ref name="Utrecht"/> Conversely, however, research in Spain found that after the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave, fertility rates fell, suggesting that when fathers are more engaged in raising children, they may become more aware of the challenges; their priorities may shift to quality over quantity of children; and/or that mothers are better able to remain connected to the workforce.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farré|first1=Lidia|last2=González|first2=Libertad|date=December 2018|title=Does Paternity Leave Reduce Fertility?|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp12023.pdf|journal=IZA Institute of Labor Economics Discussion Paper Series|volume=IZA DP No. 12023}}</ref>

A study of a 2012 law in Sweden that allowed fathers to take up to 30 days of paid family leave in the first year after the birth of the child at the same time as the mother was on leave led to substantial improvements in the mental and physical health of mothers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/upshot/sweden-finds-a-simple-way-to-improve-new-mothers-health-it-involves-fathers.html|title=Sweden Finds a Simple Way to Improve New Mothers' Health.

=== On economy ===
The economic consequences of parental leave policies are subject to controversy. According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had net costs that amounted to 0.25% of GDP, negative redistribution properties and implied a considerable increase in taxes at a cost to economic efficiency.<ref name="What is the case"/> In the U.S., paid family leave tends to lead to a higher employee retention rate and higher incomes for families.<ref name="auto2"/> Evidence from selected countries in Western Europe suggests that moderate levels of parental leave can encourage mothers to reenter the work force after having children, promoting national economic development.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Kimberly J.|title=Working mothers and the welfare state religion and the politics of work-family policies in Western Europe and the United States|year=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804754132}}</ref>

=== On gender equality ===
[[File:Gender equality symbol (clipart).png|thumb|upright|Symbol for gender equality]]

Parental leave policies have an impact on [[gender equality]] as it relates to [[parenting]] and are therefore used by various countries as a tool to promote gender equality.<ref>Elborgh-Woytek, Katrin, Monique Newiak, Kaplana Kochhar, Stefania Fabrizio, Kangni Kopdar, Philippe Wingender, Benedict Clements, and Gerd Schwartz. 2013.

As more women have joined the formal labor force, the lack of men's participation in parenting has been called out as a key example of gender inequality. Various studies highlight the importance of egalitarian parental leave policies in achieving equal distribution of childcare between parents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gornick|first1=Janet C.|last2=Meyers|first2=Marcia K.|date=September 2008|title=Creating Gender Egalitarian Societies: An Agenda for Reform|journal=Politics & Society|volume=36|issue=3|pages=313–349|doi=10.1177/0032329208320562|s2cid=154439230|issn=0032-3292}}</ref> Moreover, when discussing parental leave policies, the focus is often on comparing improvements in maternity leave policies to what was available in the past, rather than comparing the impact of diverse policies around the world that distribute parental leave differently between both parents.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Castro-García|first1=Carmen|last2=Pazos-Moran|first2=Maria|s2cid=155442384|date=16 October 2015|title=Parental Leave Policy and Gender Equality in Europe|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=22|issue=3|pages=51–73|doi=10.1080/13545701.2015.1082033|issn=1354-5701}}</ref>

Statistics show a positive correlation between maternity leave policies and women's employment, but the causation relationship cannot be firmly established.<ref name=":4"/> While many believe that maternity leave policies encourage women's participation in the labor force, [[Anita Nyberg]] suggests that it is the other way around: that development of maternity leave policies was a response to women's participation in the labor force.<ref>Nyberg, Anita. (2004). Parental Leave, Public Childcare and the Dual Earner/ Dual Carer-Model in Sweden.</ref>

Economist Christopher Ruhm argues that men's involvement in childcare at the same level as women is essential for eliminating differences in gender roles. Thus, an increase in the use of parental leave by women (and lack thereof by men) will have a negative impact on gender equality. Inversely, an increase in the use of leave by men will have a positive impact.<ref name=":4"/> Transferable leave policies appear to be fair and equal in theory, since they do not specifically allocate leave focused on childcare to women and even allow the family to choose. In practice, however, it leads to the majority of available parental leave being used by women.<ref name="Ruhm, Christopher 1998">{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhm | first1 = Christopher | s2cid = 51297709 | year = 1998 | title = The Economic Consequences of Parental Leave Mandates: Lessons from Europe | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/C_Ruhm_Economic_1998.pdf| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 113 | issue = 1| pages = 285–317 | doi=10.1162/003355398555586}}</ref> The [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]], summarizing different studies, states that there is only limited evidence to support a relationship between the father's quota and gender equality; the few relevant studies point in different directions;<ref name="norway1">{{cite web |url=http://kvinnesak.no/2013/08/fedrekvoten-og-likestilling/ |title=Fedrekvoten har dårlig dokumentert effekt på likestilling |publisher=[[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]] |language=Norwegian }}</ref> the association's former president, psychologist and former Chairman of UNICEF [[Torild Skard]], argues that psychological research does not support the assertion that mothers can be replaced by fathers in the first year.<ref name="norway2">{{cite web |url=http://kvinnesak.no/2016/04/sjansespill-med-sarbare-babyer/ |title=Sjansespill med sårbare babyer |publisher=[[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]] |language=Norwegian }}</ref> A Norwegian study from 2018 found that an extension of the father's quota had no effect on gender equality.<ref name="nrk">{{cite news |date=15 November 2018|title=Ny rapport: – Lengre pappaperm har ikke økt likestilling

Through examination of leave policies in twenty-one European countries by describing the existing policy schemes' duration, payment, and transferability, Carmen Castro-Garcia created the Parental Leave Equality Index (PLEI), which can predict the participation of each parent in raising their children based on their gender and the existing policy regarding parental leave.<ref name=":4"/> His model shows that a policy that provides equal, nontransferable, and well-paid leave for each parent (which no country has at the moment) will best encourage men's and women's equal participation in childcare.<ref name=":4"/>

The [[European Union]] recognizes the ability for countries to utilize varying parental leave policies to affect labor force participation, the [[Labour economics|labor market]], maternal health, the [[work–life balance]] of parents, and the physical and emotional [[Child development|development of children]]. And by affecting the work–life balance of parents, it may reduce the barriers to participation of both parents in parenting.

In 2014, the [[European Parliament]] concluded that, by promoting the uptake of parental leave and paternity leave by fathers, governments can aim to facilitate a more gender-equal distribution of care work, support mothers' return to the labor market, equalize the circumstances in which women and men enter the labor market,<ref name=":11"/> and improve the work–life balance of families.<ref name=":11">European Parliament. 2014.

As of 17 October 2018: <nowiki>http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm</nowiki>.</ref> The uptake of leave by fathers can reduce the motherhood penalty by enabling mothers to return to the labor market, as illustrated by studies that have shown that the involvement of fathers in childcare has a positive effect on mothers' full-time employment.<ref>Norman, H., M.

Reduction of the [[gender pay gap]] (GPG) is also an important goal for the EU. In 2014 the GPG in the EU-28 was 16.1 percent, which means that for every euro men got paid in the EU, women got paid 83.9 cents.<ref>Eurostat. 2016. 'Gender pay gap statistics.' European Commission.

==== Nordic countries ====
The advancement of gender equality has also been on the political agenda of [[Nordic countries]] for decades. Although all Nordic countries have extended the total leave period, their policies towards father's quota are different.

In Iceland, each parent receives paid leaves, and an additional three months can be divided between them however they like.<ref name="nikk">[https://www.nikk.no/en/facts/in-depth/parental-leave/ Parental leave], Nordic Information on Gender</ref> In [[Sweden]], 90 days cannot be transferred from one parent to the other—i.e. each parent gets at least 90 days of parental leave, thus the quota applies equally to both parents and is not specifically fathers.<ref name="Sweden"/> In total, Sweden offers new parents 480 days of parental leave and these days can be used up until the child is 12 years old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Authorlink|date=15 September 2020|title=Forsakringskassen Parental Leave Sweden|url=https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/foralder/nar_barnet_ar_fott/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziTTxcnA3dnQ28_U2DXQwczTwDDcOCXY1CnU31w8EKDHAARwP9KEL6o_ApcXUyQldg4W5sauAYGGBobOJv5OUVbABVgMcNwal5-gW5EQaZAemKACsOmAk!/?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Fcontentse_responsive%2Fprivatpers%2Fforalder%2Fnar_barnet_ar_fott%2Fforaldrapenning|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Forsakringskassen}}</ref> The only Nordic country that does not provide fathers with a quota is [[Denmark]], where women have the right to four weeks parent leave before giving birth and 14 weeks leave after giving birth. Thereafter, 32 weeks of parent leave are voluntarily divided between the man and the woman, making eight months leave entirely up to the family to decide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Denmark – Maternity benefit |url=https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1107&langId=en&intPageId=4487 |website=Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=1 June 2020}}</ref> However, the dual earner/dual care model seems to be the direction of all the Nordic countries are moving in the construction of their parental leave systems.<ref name=":10">{{cite journal|last1=Eydal|first1=G|last2=Gíslason|first2=I|last3=Rostgaard|first3=T|last4=Brandth|first4=B|last5=Duvander|first5=A|last6=Lammi-Taskula|first6=J|s2cid=153869177|year=2015|title=Trends in parental leave in the Nordic countries: Has the forward march of gender equality halted?|journal=Community, Work & Family|volume=18|issue=2|pages=167–181|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.1002754}}</ref>

A study done in Norway found that when parental leave is granted for both parents, there is still gender inequality observed in the form of mothers being more likely to have part-time jobs compared to their partners.<ref name=":12"/> Since then, the government has provided child care support for parents who want them in order to encourage mothers to return to full-time jobs earlier, and it is effective to a certain extent.<ref name=":12">{{cite journal | last1 = Rønsen | first1 = Marit | last2 = Hege Kitterød | first2 = Ragni | s2cid = 154808826 | year = 2015 | title = Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence From Norway | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 59–89 | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2014.927584 }}</ref>

==== Germany ====
[[File:Paid parental leave picnic (7174336376).jpg|thumb|upright|Mother spending time with her child]]
In [[Germany]], original laws tackling gender inequality with respect to parenting date back to 1986 in both [[New states of Germany|Eastern]] and [[Western Germany]], where one parent could take up to two years of leave after the birth of the child with a maximum allowance.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfar.eu/policy/family-children/germany|title=Family Policies: Germany (2014)|last=Radenacker|first=Anke|website=perfar.org|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> According to a study done in 2006, 97% of the people who took the leave were mothers.<ref name=":9">VOGL, S., & KRELL, C. (2012). PARENTAL LEAVE AND PARENTING BENEFITS: Potential Effects on Father Participation in Germany. ''International Journal of Sociology of the Family,'' ''38''(1), 19–38. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388</nowiki></ref>

In 2007, declining [[birth rate]]s and demographic change led to a new law, the "Parenting Benefits and Parental Leave Law" (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeit-Gesetz).<ref name=":13"/><ref name=":9"/> This change in family policy had mainly two aims: to reduce parents' financial loss in the first year after childbirth, and to encourage fathers to actively participate in childcare by taking parental leave.<ref name=":13"/><ref name=":9"/>

With this shift in paradigm, a better work–life balance and less support for the male breadwinner model was targeted. This was part of a "sustainable family policy" promoted by German unification and European integration with the underlying objective to raise birth rates by providing financial incentive.<ref>Leitner, S., Ostner, I. & Schmitt, C. (2008). Family Policies in Germany. In Ostner & Schmitt (Eds), Family Policies in the Context of Family Change, (pp. 175–202). The Nordic Countries in Comparative Perspective. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag</ref>

The law's impact was mainly perceived positively with men reporting high motivation to take leave. So far this has not been reflected in official statistics, but Susanne Vogl concludes that if there is a general willingness of men to participate in parental leave the new Parenting Benefits regulations will help facilitate the actual decision to take a leave.<ref name=":9"/>

==== United States ====
{{See|Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993}}
Even though, according to a survey conducted by [[WorldatWork]] and Mercer in 2017, 93% of Americans agree that mothers should receive paid parental leave and 85% agree that fathers should receive paid parental leave, as of October 2018 the [[United States]] does not have nationwide laws that guarantee paid parental leave to its workforce;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatwork.org/docs/research-and-surveys/Survey-Report-Survey-of-Paid-Parental-Leave-in-the-US.pdf|title=Survey of Paid Parental Leave in the United States|last=WorldatWork}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://humanevents.com/2019/05/04/bring-back-the-american-family/ |title = Bring Back the American Family|date = 4 May 2019}}</ref> however, certain states have passed laws providing paid workers with such rights. As of July 2019, eight states ([[California]],<ref>(A.B. 908, 2015–2016 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2016) (enacted)</ref><ref>(S.B. 63, 2017–2018 Leg., Reg. Sess.

(Ore. 2019)</ref>) and the [[District of Columbia]]<ref>(D.C. Law 21-264 (D.C. 2016))</ref> have enacted laws that grant parental leave as part of state paid family and medical leave insurance laws, with 4 being effective currently. In states without such laws, a proportion of companies do provide paid parental leave.<ref name=":6"/><ref name="wsj-webber"/>

According to Eileen Appelbaum, the lack of parental leave policies results in many low-income families struggling to support themselves financially if both parents are off work. As a result, many mothers leave work to take care of their children while the father remains at work to financially support the family.<ref>Kleman, Jacob, Kelly Daley, and Alyssa Pozniak. 2013.

==== Australia ====
The Australian government provides paid parental leave for both parents, but more for the mother compared to the father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave|title=Maternity and Parental Leave|website=Fair Work|access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite journal | last1 = Bittman | first1 = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Parenthood Without Penalty: Time Use And Public Policy in Australia And Finland | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 27–42 | doi = 10.1080/135457099337798 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave/paid-parental-leave|title=Paid Parental Leave|website=Fair Work}}</ref> Michael Bittman stated that the reason they provide parental leave is unique in that they view children as "[[Public good (economics)|public good]]s" and, therefore, the state is responsible to provide and support the child.<ref name=":7"/> But like most places around the world, studies done in Australia show that the inequality still persists within the family, and that women spend more time doing unpaid work (like parenting) compared to men.<ref>Bryson, Lois, Michael Bittman and Susan Donath. 1994.

==== China ====
According to a study done by Nan Jia, during the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist era]], women's full participation in the labor force played a key role in the Chinese government's efforts to advance women's position in society. To facilitate women's labor force participation, the Chinese government initiated a series of measures to mitigate the work–family conflict that women face during pregnancy and childbirth.<ref name=":8"/> These measures included an entitlement to 56 days of paid maternity leave.<ref name=":8">{{cite journal | last1 = Nan Jia | first1 = Xiao-yuan Dong | last2 = Yue-ping | first2 = Song | year = 2018 | title = Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding in Urban China | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 31–53 | doi = 10.1080/13545701.2017.1380309 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In the post-reform era, a series of new regulations have been introduced to protect women's employment and reproductive rights in the new market economy. The [[Labour law|Labor Law]] adopted in 1995 ensured that women and men have equal employment rights and that employers will not lay off women employees or lower their wages for reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave, or breastfeeding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/12/content_1383754.htm|title=laws|website=npc.gov.cn|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> The Labor Contract Law enacted in 2008 introduced the provision that prohibits employers from unilaterally terminating labor contracts with women employees who are pregnant, give birth, and care for a baby postpartum. Thus, under the Labor Law and Labor Contract Law, women employees are entitled to job-protected maternity leave.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2009-02/20/content_1471106.htm|title=laws|website=npc.gov.cn|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

The post-reform era saw further improvements in maternity benefits. The length of paid maternity leave was extended from fifty-six days prior to reform, to ninety days in 1988, and to 98 days in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/china-maternity-leave-further-extended-by-provinces/|title=China: Maternity Leave Further Extended by Provinces|last=Zhang|first=Laney|date=3 May 2016|website=Library of Congress|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> Most recently in 2016, paid maternity leave was extended to a minimum of 128 days after the long-standing one-child policy was replaced with a policy that encourages each couple to have two children. This latest extension of paid leave aims to increase fertility rates and slow the population aging process.<ref name=":8"/> None of the policies directly aim to tackle gender roles and gender inequality, but rather to solve immediate problems the country is facing at the time. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== On relationships ===
A 2020 study in the ''Economic Journal'' found that reforms in Iceland that incentivized fathers to take parental leave reduced the likelihood of parents separating. The strongest impact was on relationships where the mother was more educated than or equally educated as the father.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Olafsson|first1=Arna|last2=Steingrimsdottir|first2=Herdis|title=How Does Daddy at Home Affect Marital Stability?|journal=The Economic Journal|year=2020|volume=130|issue=629|pages=1471–1500|doi=10.1093/ej/ueaa009}}</ref>

Some businesses adopt policies that are favorable to workers and [[public opinion]]. In their study of maternity leave policies in the United States, Kelly and Dobbin found that public policy surrounding [[pregnancy]] as a temporary disability (for instance, California's [[Pregnancy discrimination#Legislation|Family Temporary Disability Insurance]] program) gave rise to business practices that included maternity leave as a benefit.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = E. | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = F. | year = 1999 | title = Civil Rights Law at Work: Sex Discrimination and the Rise of Maternity Leave Policies | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3202909| journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 455–492 | doi=10.1086/210317| s2cid = 30745479 }}</ref>

Companies are starting to offer paid parental leave as a benefit to some American workers, seeing a profitable aspect of doing so, including: reduced [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] costs, increased [[productivity#Drivers of productivity growth|productivity]] from workers, and increased rates of [[Employee retention|retention]] among women after childbirth. Some see the increase in paid parental leave as indicative of companies reaching out to women, as more women are working and returning to work after having children, and by doing so these companies generate positive publicity as employers with family-friendly workplaces.<ref name="Miller">Miller, K., Helmuth, A.S. et al. 2009.

The report also noted that it would take newer workers four years to accrue enough paid leave (sick leave and annual leave) to equal the 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave provided under the FMLA, and that private sector companies that offer paid parental leave have a significant advantage over the federal government in the recruitment and retention of younger workers who may wish to have children.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Unless otherwise specified, the information in the tables below is gathered from the most recent [[International Labour Organization]] reports. Maternity leave refers to the legal protection given to the mother immediately after she gives birth (but may also include a period before the birth), paternity leave to legal protection given to the father immediately after the mother gives birth, and parental leave to protected time for childcare (usually for either parent) either after the maternity/paternity leave or immediately after birth (for example when the parent is not eligible for maternity/paternity leave, and/or where the time is calculated until the child is a specific age—therefore excluding maternity/paternity leave—usually such jurisdictions protect the job until the child reaches a specific age.)<ref>e.g. in [[Czech Republic]]: "Section 196 Parental Leave reads: "In order to extend the care being given to a child, the employer shall grant a female or male employee parental leave if so requested (applied for). Parental leave is granted to the mother of a child upon termination of her maternity leave and to the father of a child from the day when the child is born and it is granted within the scope as requested (as applied for), but '''no longer than until the day when the child reaches the age of three years'''." [http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/3221/labour_code.pdf#]</ref> Others allow the parental leave to be transferred into part-time work time. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified. Leave marked "Unpaid" indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave. Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave and how long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. In the [[European Union]], the policies vary significantly by country—with regard to length, to payment, and to how parental leave relates to prior maternity leave—but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].<ref name="auto3"/>

| 4 weeks 100% (or 8 weeks for staff members serving at locations where they are not allowed to live with their family)
|Special leave without pay for a period of up to two years may be granted as parental leave under staff rule 105.2 (a) (iii) b to a staff member who is the mother or the father of a newly born or adopted child, provided the staff member has a permanent appointment, or has completed three years of continuous service on a fixed-term appointment and is expected by the Secretary-General to continue in service for at least six months beyond the date of return from the proposed parental leave.
| The fact that a staff member is or will be on parental leave cannot be a factor in deciding contract renewal. To ensure that this is enforced, if a contract ends while the staff member is on parental leave, the contract must be extended to cover the duration of such leave.

== Parental leave policies by countries ==

=== Luxembourg ===
Luxembourg's parental law covers a breadth of different situations like childbirth to adoption and several others, depending on the age and situation. If there is a childbirth, the mother regardless of whether she works for an organization, is an apprentice or has her own business gets a pre-natal maternity leave of 8 weeks before the expected date and 12 weeks' post-natal leave.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/vivre/famille/parents/conge-parents/index.html|title=Types de congés pour parents|website=luxembourg.public.lu|language=fr|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> The father, meanwhile, gets 10 days' leave and 4 days in case he is a civil servant and is required to take it within the first 2 months of the child's birth.<ref name=":02"/> If there is an adoption, one of the two spouses can take up to 12 weeks' leave if the adopted child is under the age of 12 years.<ref name=":02"/> Luxembourg provides a fix compensation rate during parental leave, which is €1,778, while most of the other European countries get compensation as a percentage of the salary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1600/RR1666/RAND_RR1666.pdf|title=Paternity and parental leave policies across the European Union|last=Belle|first=Janna van|website=rand.org|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> Luxembourg doesn't have a policy for maternity allowance in place or in addition to the maternity leave pay.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf|title=OECD – Social Policy Division – Directorate of Employment, Labour and Social Affairs, PF2.1: Key characteristics of parental leave systems|website=oecd.org|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> Maternity allowance means the money paid during pregnancy or just after child birth.<ref name=":15"/> According 2013 OECD data, public expenditure on maternal and paternal leaves on per child born was the most in Luxembourg out of almost all the European counties at the 35,000 at prices and PPPs of 2013 in USD.<ref name=":15"/>

On 1 December 2016, "family leave reform bill 7060" was passed in the Luxembourg parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etui.org/ReformsWatch/Luxembourg/Luxembourg-modified-labour-code-improves-paternity-leave-from-1-January-2018|title=European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) – Luxembourg: modified labour code improves paternity leave from 1 January 2018 / Luxembourg / ReformsWatch / Home|website=etui.org|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> According to this new reform, now fathers and mothers can take leave together.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/4731-luxembourg-s-new-parental-leave-law-enters-into-force-december-1|title=Luxembourg's new parental leave law enters into force 1 December|website=luxtimes.lu|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> The first leave has to be taken right after maternity leave and the second can be taken before the child turns 6 years old.<ref name=":03"/> This new reform provides much more flexibility. The parent has four different options: either they can take 4 to 6 months' full leave, 8 to 12 months' part-time leave, take one day off per week for 20 months or can take 4 individual months within 20 months.<ref name=":03"/> The official Luxembourg government portal suggests that according to the data collected more than 85% of the parents are extremely happy with this new reform and 79% people think that this new system is better than the older system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/actualites/2018/03/06-congeparental/index.html|title=The new reform of parental leave makes parents happy|website=luxembourg.public.lu|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

=== France ===
Parental leave in France ([[:fr:Congé parental en France|Congé Parental]]) refers to the system of leave that is guaranteed to both fathers and mothers in cases of either childbirth or adoption. The maternity leave, the number of weeks a biological mother is allowed to leave work is 16 weeks in France—6 weeks before birth and 10 weeks post-birth.<ref name=":16">Ray, Rebecca. "A detailed look at parental leave policies in 21 OECD countries." ''Washington, DC: Center for Economic and Policy Research'' (2008).</ref> Maternity leave is mandatory and complete renouncement of the leave is forbidden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2265|title=Congé maternité d'une salariée du secteur privé|website=service-public.fr|language=Fr|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref> The paid parental and home care leave that is available to French mothers is 26 weeks which raises the total leave weeks for women to 42 weeks.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf|title=OECD Parental Leave Systems|website=oe.cd/fdb}}</ref> For fathers, paid paternity leave period is 11 days for one child and 18 days for two or more children. Twenty-six weeks of leave are available to French fathers to take paid parental and home care leave. This brings the effective leave period for French fathers to 28 weeks,<ref name=":17"/> one of the highest in Europe. However, it is important to note that in the 26-week period the payment rate is 13.7% of original wages which brings the effective number of full-rate paid weeks to 3.6 weeks only.<ref name=":17"/>

In 2017, a group of men started an online petition<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/01/extend-paternity-leave-and-enshrine-it-in-law-says-french-petition|title=Extend paternity leave and enshrine it in law, says French petition|last=Willsher|first=Kim|date=1 November 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 August 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> to increase the length of paid paternity leave from the current 11 consecutive days to 4 weeks. A survey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/publications/etudes-et-resultats/article/les-francais-et-les-conges-de-maternite-et-paternite-opinion-et-recours|title=Les Français et les congés de maternité et paternité : opinion et recours – Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé|website=drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref> shows that more than 57% of respondents indicated that the length of paternity leave was sufficient. However, 63% of respondents between the ages of 18–24 and 60% of respondents between the ages of 25–34 indicated that they wanted to increase the length of paternity leave. Just 4% of the parental leave taken up by French parents is taken by men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.oecd.org/employment/publicationsdocuments/policybriefs/2/|title=Policy Briefs – OECD|website=www1.oecd.org|page=http://www.oecd.org/policy-briefs/parental-leave-where-are-the-fathers.pdf|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref>

In the case of adoption, new parents are entitled to 10 weeks of leave which begins 10 days prior to the expected adoption day. If the total number of dependent children in a family will be at least three after the adoption, then the parents receive 18 weeks of leave. If a family is adopting multiple children, the parents are entitled up to 22 weeks of leave. The leave can be shared between two parents or taken up by one. However, the laws incentivize parents to share the leave since if both parents take some of leave, the total amount of leave can be extended.<ref name=":16"/>
