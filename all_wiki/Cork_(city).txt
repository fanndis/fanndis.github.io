Originally a monastic settlement, Cork was expanded by [[Viking]] invaders around 915. Its charter was granted by [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in 1185. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can be found around South and North Main streets.

The city's charter was granted by [[King John of England|Prince John]], as [[Lord of Ireland]], in 1185.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Council " Charters|url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/|publisher=Cork City Council|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/aboutcork/historyofcork/thewallsofcork/ |title=Cork City Council website – History – Walls of Cork |publisher=Corkcity.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923123434/http://corkcity.ie/aboutcork/historyofcork/thewallsofcork/ |archive-date=23 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile [[Gaels|Gaelic]] countryside and cut off from the English government in [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]]. Neighbouring Gaelic and [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords extorted "Black Rent" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the [[Barony of Cork City]]; it now takes in much of the neighbouring [[Barony of Cork]]. Together, these [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are located between the [[Barony of Barrymore]] to the east, [[Muskerry East]] to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.
[[File:The Burning of Cork (9713428703).jpg|thumb|left|Workers clearing rubble on St Patrick's street following the [[Burning of Cork]].]]
The city's municipal government was dominated by about 12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe – in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.

The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the [[Black Death]] arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.

The title of [[Lord Mayor of Cork|Mayor of Cork]] was established by [[royal charter]] in 1318, and the title was changed to ''Lord Mayor'' in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent mayor by [[Queen Victoria]] on her visit to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |title=Charters issued to Cork city |publisher=Cork City Council |accessdate=19 October 2010 }}</ref>

Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly [[Irish nationalist]] city, with widespread support for [[Third Home Rule Act|Irish Home Rule]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], but from 1910 stood firmly behind [[William O'Brien]]'s dissident [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the ''[[Cork Free Press]]''. Cork was overtaken by [[Belfast]] as Ireland's second largest city in the nineteenth-century.

In the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British [[Black and Tans]],<ref name="burning">{{cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/historyofcorkcity/early20thcentury/theburningofcork/ |title=Cork City Library – History of Cork – The Burning of Cork |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie |date=11 December 1920 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> in an event known as the "[[The Burning of Cork|Burning of Cork]]"<ref name="burning"/> and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the [[Irish Civil War]], Cork was for a time held by anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] in [[Irish_Free_State_offensive#Fall_of_Cork_and_landing_in_the_west|an attack from the sea]].

==Climate==
The climate of Cork, like the vast majority of Ireland, is mild [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant [[Hardiness zone]] 9b. [[Met Éireann]] maintains a climatological [[weather station]] at [[Cork Airport]],<ref name="met2003">{{cite web |url=http://www.met.ie/publications/met_ar2003.pdf |title=Met Éireann – Annual Report 2003 |accessdate=12 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614111721/http://www.met.ie/publications/met_ar2003.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a few kilometres south of the city centre. The airport is at an altitude of {{convert|151|m|ft}} and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the rest of the city. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at [[University College Cork|UCC]] and Clover Hill.<ref name="met2003"/> Due to its position on the coast, Cork city is subject to occasional flooding.<ref>{{cite report|author = Devoy, R.J.N. | date = 2008 | title = Coastal vulnerability and the implications of sea-level rise for Ireland | publisher = Journal of Coastal Research | pages = 327–331 | url = http://epa.ie/pubs/reports/other/events/oclr/adaptationworkshop/R%20Devoy%20Coastal%20Vulnerability%20Paper1.pdf }}</ref>

Temperatures below {{convert|0|°C|°F}} or above {{convert|25|°C|°F}} are rare. Cork Airport records an average of {{convert|1227.9|mm|in}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] annually, most of which is rain.<ref name="met30">{{cite web |url=http://www.met.ie/climate/corkairport.asp |title=Met Éireann – The Irish Weather Service – 30 Year Averages – Cork Airport |publisher=Met.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808222112/http://www.met.ie/climate/corkairport.asp |archive-date=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 "rainy" days a year (over {{convert|0.2|mm|in}} of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with "heavy rain" (over {{convert|5|mm|in}}).<ref name="met30"/> Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no "recordable sunshine", mostly during and around winter.<ref name="met30"/>

The [[Cork School of Music]] and the [[Crawford College of Art and Design]] provide a throughput of new blood, as do the active theatre components of several courses at University College Cork (UCC). Important elements in the cultural life of the city are: [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]], of which [[Cillian Murphy]] was a troupe member<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/otherworks|title=Cillian Murphy – Other works|work=IMDb}}</ref> prior to Hollywood fame; the Institute for Choreography and Dance, a national contemporary dance resource;<ref>{{cite web | title = Firkin Crane History | url =http://firkincrane.ie/about/history/ | website =Firkin Crane | access-date = 22 June 2016}}</ref> the Triskel Arts Centre (capacity c.90), which includes the Triskel Christchurch independent cinema; dance venue the Firkin Crane (capacity c.240); the Cork Academy of Dramatic Art (CADA) and Graffiti Theatre Company;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graffiti.ie/about |title=About the Graffiti Theatre Company |publisher=Graffiti.ie |accessdate=17 October 2010}}</ref> and the [[Cork Jazz Festival]], [[Cork Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkfilmfest.org/ |title=Cork Film Festival Website |work=CorkFilmFest.org |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> and [[Live at the Marquee (festival)|Live at the Marquee]] events. The [[Everyman Palace Theatre]] (capacity c.650) and the Granary Theatre (capacity c.150) both host plays throughout the year.

Cork is home to the [[RTÉ Vanbrugh Quartet]], and popular rock musicians and bands including [[John Spillane]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Five Go Down to the Sea?]], [[Microdisney]], [[The Frank and Walters]], [[Sultans of Ping]], [[Simple Kid]], [[Fred (band)|Fred]] and [[Mick Flannery]]. The opera singers [[Cara O'Sullivan]], Mary Hegarty, Brendan Collins, and Sam McElroy are also Cork born.

Ranging in capacity from 50 to 1,000, the main music venues in the city are the [[Cork Opera House]] (capacity c.1000), The Everyman, Cyprus Avenue, Dali, Triskel Christchurch, The Roundy, and Coughlan's.<ref>{{cite web | title =Cork: Traditional Irish Music Venues | url =https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186600-c4976/Cork:Ireland:Traditional.Irish.Music.Venues.html | website =Trip Advisor | access-date = 22 June 2016}}</ref>

Cork was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the [[Lonely Planet]]'s top 10 "Best in Travel 2010". The guide described Cork as being "at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse".<ref>{{cite news | title = Cork enters 'Lonely Planet' guide as top 10 place to visit | publisher = Irish Times | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1103/1224257963102.html | accessdate = 9 February 2010 | date=11 November 2009}}</ref>

There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between [[Manchester]] and [[London]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] or [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]]. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves as "The Rebels"; the county is known as the [[Rebel County]]. This view sometimes manifests itself in humorous references to the ''Real Capital'' and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating ''The People's Republic of Cork''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/|title=Welcome to the People's Republic of Cork|work= People's Republic of Cork|access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref>

===Accent===
The Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of [[Hiberno-English]], displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard [[Hiberno-English]], some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2011/02/21/dialect-profile-the-cork-accent/ |title=Dialect Profile: The Cork Accent |publisher=Dialect Blog |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The Cork accent displays varying degrees of [[rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], usually indicative of the speaker's local community.

Cork is home to one of Ireland's main national newspapers, the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' (formerly the ''Cork Examiner''). Its 'sister paper', ''[[The Echo (Cork newspaper)|The Echo]]'' (formerly the ''Evening Echo''), was for decades connected to the "Echo boys", who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in parts of the city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the ''[[Cork Independent (newspaper)|Cork Independent]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corkindependent.com/|title=Cork Independent|publisher=Cork Independent|website = corkindependent.com | accessdate = 19 May 2019 }}</ref> The city's university publishes the ''UCC Express'' and ''Motley'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegenews.ie/index.php/advertise-in-the-ucc-express/ |title=Advertise in The UCC Express |publisher=CollegeNews.ie |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://motley.ie/about/|title=About|publisher=Motley Magazine |website = motley.ie | accessdate = 19 May 2019 }}</ref>

Cork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfo.ie/leaflets/bs31.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517064035/http://www.enfo.ie/leaflets/bs31.htm|title=Medieval Cork|archivedate=17 May 2008|work=enfo.ie}}</ref> The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the [[Red Abbey, Cork|Red Abbey]]. There are two cathedrals in the city; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Cork|St. Mary's Cathedral]] and [[Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral]]. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglican]]) and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect [[William Burges]].

[[St. Patrick's Street]], the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. At its northern end is a landmark statue of [[Theobald Mathew (temperence reformer)|Father Mathew]]. The reason for its curved shape is that it was originally a channel of the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]] which was built over on arches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/stpatricksstreet/historicoutline/ |title=Cork City Library – History of Cork – St Patrick's Street – Historic Outline |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The General Post Office, with its limestone façade, is on [[Oliver Plunkett Street]], on the site of the [[Theatre Royal, Cork|Theatre Royal]]  which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840.

The [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions. The old financial centre is the [[South Mall, Cork|South Mall]], with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century, such as the [[Allied Irish Bank]]'s which was once an exchange.

Cork's most famous building is the [[Church of St Anne (Shandon)|church tower of Shandon]], which dominates the North side of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shandonbells.ie/ |title=Church of St. Anne Shandon |publisher=Shandonbells.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Another site in Shandon is [[Skiddy's Almshouse]], which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to the poorest of the city.

[[Cork City Hall]], another notable building of limestone, replaced the previous one which was destroyed by the [[Black and Tans]] during the War of Independence in an event known as the "[[The Burning of Cork|Burning of Cork]]".<ref name="burning"/> The cost of this new building was provided by the UK Government in the 1930s as a gesture of reconciliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/cityhalls/cork-cityhall.html |title=Cork City Hall |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

Other notable places include [[Elizabeth Fort]], the [[Cork Opera House]], Christ Church on South Main Street (now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church), and St Mary's Dominican Church on Popes Quay. Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of [[University College Cork]], through which the River Lee flows, the [[Cork City Gaol|Women's Gaol]] at [[Sunday's Well]] (now a heritage centre) and the [[English Market]].

===Road===
[[File:St.Patrick's Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|St. Patrick's Bridge]]
The city's road infrastructure improved in the late 20th and early 21st century, including from the early 1980s construction of the Cork South Link [[dual carriageway]] which links the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly after, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued on extending the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25]] South Ring Road through the 1990s, culminating in the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]]. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the [[N20 road|N20]] Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The [[N22 road|N22]] Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project – which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8 motorway]] links Cork with [[Dublin]].

From 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cork City Cycling Strategy |publisher=Cork City Council |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/services/roadstransportation/trafficdivision/cycling/filedownload,2419,en.htm |accessdate=28 July 2013 }}</ref> Subsequently, in 2014, a [[bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental scheme]] was launched.

===Rail===

====Railway and tramway heritage====
Cork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from [[Dublin Heuston]]. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at [[Blackpool, Cork|Blackpool]], the route now reaches the city centre [[terminal station|terminus]] of [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] via the Glanmire tunnel and [[Kilnap Viaduct]].<ref name=europeana>{{cite web| url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/15414/niah_search_jsp_type_record_county_CC_regno_20858005|title=Kilnap Viaduct| accessdate=24 June 2015 |publisher=Europeana}}</ref> Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns of [[Cobh]] and [[Midleton]] east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of [[Youghal]], until the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.eveningecho.ie/corknews/Bring-back-the-old-Youghal-railway--5be7b33b-59f2-4758-98bf-861259c24f54-ds | publisher = Evening Echo | title = Bring back the old Youghal railway | date = 19 May 2018 | accessdate = 24 October 2018 }}</ref>

[[File:Railway station in Cork NLI.jpg|thumb|left|Glanmire Road Station (now called Kent Station) c.1890s]]
Other rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the ''[[Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway]]'', a line to [[Macroom]], the [[Cork and Muskerry Light Railway]] to [[Blarney]], [[Coachford]] and [[Donoughmore]], as well as the [[Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway]] connecting [[Bantry]], [[Skibbereen]], [[Clonakilty]] and many other [[West Cork]] towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement).

Within the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American [[George Francis Train]] in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/transport/cork-tram/index.xml | publisher = askaboutireland.ie | accessdate = 24 October 2018 | title = Cork Tramway Company }}</ref>

In December 1898, the [[Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company]] began operating on the Blackpool–Douglas, Summerhill–Sunday's Well and [[Tivoli, Cork|Tivoli]]–Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.

The wider city area, including the city's suburbs, is served by three railway stations. These are [[Cork Kent railway station]], [[Little Island railway station]] and [[Glounthaune railway station]].

====Current routes====
Cork's [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] is the main railway station in the city. From here, [[Irish Rail]] services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to [[Dublin Heuston|Dublin]] has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork, and is linked from [[Limerick Junction]] with connections to [[Clonmel railway station|Clonmel]] and [[Waterford railway station|Waterford]]. InterCity services are also available to [[Killarney railway station|Killarney]] and [[Tralee railway station|Tralee]], and to [[Limerick railway station|Limerick]], [[Ennis railway station|Ennis]], [[Athenry railway station|Athenry]] and [[Galway railway station|Galway]] (via [[Limerick Junction]] and the Limerick to Galway railway line).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n=147|title=Timetables|work=Irish Rail|access-date=28 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825205834/http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n=147|archive-date=25 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Cork Suburban Rail]] system also departs from [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] and provides connections to parts of [[Metropolitan Cork]]. Stations include [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]], [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Midleton]], [[Fota Island|Fota]] and [[Cobh]]. In July 2009 the [[Glounthaune railway station|Glounthaune]] to [[Midleton railway station|Midleton]] line was reopened, with new stations at [[Carrigtwohill railway station|Carrigtwohill]] and [[Midleton railway station|Midleton]] (and additional stations proposed for [[Blarney]] and elsewhere).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0730/rail.html |title=RTÉ News: Service begins on Cork-Midleton line |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> [[Little Island railway station]] serves Cork's Eastern Suburbs.
