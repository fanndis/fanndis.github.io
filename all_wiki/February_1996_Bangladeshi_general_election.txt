'''General elections''' were held in [[Bangladesh]] on 15 February 1996. They were boycotted by most opposition parties, and saw voter turnout drop to just 21%.<ref name=":0">[[Dieter Nohlen]], Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I'', p525 {{ISBN|0-19-924958-X}}</ref> The result was a victory for the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP), which won 278 of the 300 elected seats.<ref name=":0" /> This administration was short lived however, only lasting 12 days<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812074443/http://www.parliament.gov.bd/index.php/en/about-parliament/tenure-of-parliament|title=Tenure of All Parliaments|date=2018-08-12|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> before the installation of [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] and [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|fresh elections]] held in June.

==Background==
In March 1994, controversy over a parliamentary by-election, which the [[Bangladesh Awami League]]-led opposition claimed the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] government had rigged, led to an indefinite [[boycott]] of Parliament by the entire opposition.<ref name="postershad">{{cite journal |last1=Islam |first1=Syed Serajul |date=2001 |title=Elections and politics in post-Ershad era in Bangladesh |url=https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/060412385_Islam.pdf |journal=Asian and African Studies |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=160–173 |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref> The opposition also began a program of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and that a caretaker government supervise a general election.<ref name="postershad" /> Efforts to mediate the dispute, under the auspices of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], failed. After another attempt at a negotiated settlement failed narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament. The opposition then continued a campaign of marches, demonstrations, and [[Strike action|strike]]s in an effort to force the government to resign.<ref name="postershad" /> The opposition, including the Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina]], [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] and [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]] pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996.

==Results==
Incumbent Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]]'s BNP was re-elected for the second term after a landslide victory, but in voting boycotted and denounced as unfair by the three main opposition parties. The voter turnout was the lowest in Bangladesh's parliamentary electoral history at only 21%.<ref name=":0" /> Following the election, the President invited Zia to form a government, but this administration was short lived, lasting only 12 days.<ref name=":1" />

==Aftermath==
An immediate series of [[Hartal|''hartals'' (strikes)]] were called by the other parties and an indefinite non-cooperation movement was conducted until demands for a new, free election was met.<ref name="postershad" /> In March 1996, following escalating political turmoil, the sitting Parliament enacted the thirteenth [[Amendments to the Constitution of Bangladesh|Constitutional amendment]] installing a neutral [[caretaker government]] to assume power and conduct new parliamentary elections; former Chief Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]] was named [[Chief Advisor of Bangladesh|Chief Advisor]] (a position equivalent to prime minister) in the interim government. Zia's administration lasted only 12 days.<ref name=":1" /> New parliamentary elections were scheduled for [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|June 1996]].
