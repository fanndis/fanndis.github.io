Subsequently, she was profiled in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. In the interview, Sawayama described the genesis of the idea and collaboration: "For a lot of women in Japan, these are the expectations people put on them, from anime culture, kawaii culture… that can really put women at a disadvantage, objectifying and infantilising them."<ref name="Vogue" /> Sawayama has worked with Nicola Formichetti for MAC x Nicopanda. Formichetti also directed the music video for Sawayama's track "Ordinary Superstar".

Maybe it's just hindsight, but I just feel like chart music back then was crazy diverse. There was obviously a huge thing of R&B that was going on. Then rock like No Doubt and then Limp Bizkit being number one for weeks in the UK. I remember that Evanescence was number one for weeks. Avril Lavigne, all these random people and then it was R&B and there was Justin Timberlake, Pharrell and Beyoncé and stuff. I just hope that people don't feel like it's being too referential. That's something I always want to try and stay away from. I always want to add something a bit new to the equation. Music from the 2000s was also the soundtrack to all this drama that I'm talking about the lyrics. I really wanted this record to sound like it was housed in the time when the things I'm talking about were happening. |archive-date=21 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200821041642/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/rina-sawayama-finds-her-chosen-family |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rising Star Rina Sawayama's Music & Style Make Major Waves |url=https://www.thecoolhour.com/2019/07/rising-star-rina-sawayama-music-fashion-culture/ |website=The Cool Hour |accessdate=22 April 2020 |date=2019 |quote=She admits to falling in love with turn-of-the-century sensations like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Avril Lavigne, and Pink, all who have had a positive influence on her own work |archive-date=12 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712174230/https://www.thecoolhour.com/2019/07/rising-star-rina-sawayama-music-fashion-culture/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2017, Sawayama was ranked in ''The Guardian''{{'}}s 18 for '18 list as well as ''[[Dazed]]''{{'}}s 100 list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/31/18-for-18-the-talent-and-trends-tipped-for-the-top-in-2018|title=18 for '18: the talent and trends tipped for the top in 2018|last1=Williams|first1=Holly|last2=Brinkhurst-Cuff|first2=Charlie|date=31 December 2017|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 July 2018|last3=Fox|first3=Killian|last4=Snapes|first4=Laura|last5=Joshi|first5=Tara|last6=Cumming|first6=Laura|last7=Hans|first7=Simran|last8=Empire|first8=Kitty|last9=Devlin|first9=Hannah|archive-date=13 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713202746/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/31/18-for-18-the-talent-and-trends-tipped-for-the-top-in-2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/dazed100/2017|title=100 people shaping culture in 2017|website=[[Dazed]]|access-date=13 July 2018|archive-date=12 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712025344/http://www.dazeddigital.com/dazed100/2017|url-status=live}}</ref> She has used [[Lady Gaga]]'s vocal training method, [[bel canto]], an Italian operatic exercise, to gain more treble and make her voice breathy.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Min|first=Lio|title=Rina Sawayama Breaks Through The Simulation|url=https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/rina-sawayama-on-sawayama-and-what-took-so-long|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Nylon|language=en|archive-date=11 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611204418/https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/rina-sawayama-on-sawayama-and-what-took-so-long|url-status=live}}</ref>
