'''Trap''' is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that originated in the [[Southern United States]] during the early 1990s. The genre gets its name from the [[Atlanta]] [[slang]] word "trap," which refers to a place in which [[Illegal drug trade in the United States|drugs are sold illegally]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/types-of-rap|title=Types Of Rap: A guide to the many styles of hip-hop|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2020|website=Redbull|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Trap music uses synthesized drums and is characterized by complicated [[Hi-hat|hi-hat]] patterns, tuned [[Bass drum|kick drums]] with a long [[Envelope (music)|decay]] (originally from the [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]]), atmospheric synths, and lyrical content that often focuses on drug use and urban violence.<ref name="jgenrechar">{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|title=Quit Screwing with Trap Music: An Interview with Houston-Born Producer Lōtic|date=June 11, 2012|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103061941/http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/6/11/quit-screwing-with-trap-music-an-interview-with-houston-born-producer-l%C5%8Dtic--2|archivedate=November 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/02/how-trap-music-came-to-rule-the-world|title=How Trap Music Came to Rule the World|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref name="cr">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|title=Who owns trap?|last=Raymer|first=Miles|publisher=[[Chicago Reader]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527094836/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trap-rap-edm-flosstradamus-uz-jeffrees-lex-luger/Content?oid=7975249|archivedate=May 27, 2013|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref name="topman">{{cite web|url=http://magazine.topman.com/category/ctrl-music/trap-music-the-definitive-guide/|title=Trap Music: The Definitive Guide|author=Joseph Patterson|date=January 19, 2013|publisher=Topman.

Originally, lyrical themes revolved around the general life and culture in the "trap" or in the actual southern "trap house" where narcotics are being sold. The term "trap" referred to places where drug deals take place. Other topics also include street life, acquiring wealth, violence, American vehicles, and life experiences that artists have faced in their southern American surroundings.

Trap music employs multilayered thin- or thick-textured [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[Drone (music)|drones]] with sometimes a melodic accompaniment expressed with [[synthesizers]]; crisp, grimy, and rhythmic snares, deep 808 kick drums, double-time, triple-time, and similarly divided [[hi-hat]]s, and a cinematic and symphonic use of string, brass, [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and keyboard instruments to create an energetic, hard-hitting, deep, and variant atmosphere.<ref name="cr" /><ref name="topman" /><ref>[http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/07/trap_music_11-part_history_dj_screw_gucci_mane_flosstradamus.php It's a Trap!

==History==
===1990s–2003: Origins===
Early producers creating trap music included [[Lil Jon]] from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where the term originated as a reference to places where drug deals are made, who along with [[Mannie Fresh]] from [[New Orleans]] and [[DJ Paul]] from [[Memphis, Tennessee]] worked with local acts in Atlanta including [[Dungeon Family]], [[Outkast]], [[Goodie Mob]], and [[Ghetto Mafia]].<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite book |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Melissa Ursula Dawn |title=Hip Hop around the World: An Encyclopedia [2 volumes] |date=2019 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=701 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mR2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA701 |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref> In 1992, one of the earliest records to release was [[UGK]]'s "Cocaine In The Back of the Ride" from their debut EP, "[[The Southern Way]]". Later in 1992, they released the popular "Pocket Full of Stones" from their major-label debut album ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]''. It was also featured in the 1993 film ''[[Menace II Society]]''. In 1996, Master P released his single "[[Mr. Ice Cream Man]]" from his fifth studio album ''[[Ice Cream Man (album)|Ice Cream Man]]''. Fans and critics started to refer to rappers whose primary lyrical topic was [[drug dealing]] as "trap rappers".<ref name="cr" /> David Drake of [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] wrote that "the trap in the early 2000s wasn't a genre, it was a real place", and the term was later adopted to describe the "music made about that place".<ref name=complex>{{cite web|last=Drake|first=David|title=The Commodification of Southern Rap's Drug-Fueled Subgenre|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/real-trap-sht-the-commodification-of-southern-raps-drug-fueled-subgenre/page/2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011194549/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/real-trap-sht-the-commodification-of-southern-raps-drug-fueled-subgenre/page/2|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 11, 2012|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref>

===2003–2015: Rise in mainstream popularity===
During the early- to mid-2000s, trap music began to emerge as a recognized genre after the mainstream success of a number of albums and singles with lyrics that covered life in "the trap", [[drug dealing]] and the struggle for success.<ref name="topman" /> Several Southern rappers with drug dealer personas such as [[T.I.]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[Boosie Badazz]], [[Yo Gotti]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[Rick Ross]] produced crossover hits and helped expand the popularity of the genre, with trap records beginning to appear more heavily on mixtapes and radio stations outside of the South.<ref name="dj-mag" /> Though trap artists were somewhat diverse in their production styles, the signature and quintessential trap sound (typically based around synth, orchestra, and string swells with tight, bass-heavy 808 kick drums) that would come to be associated with the genre developed in Atlanta during trap's mid-2000s breakthrough. Some of the notable trap producers during the mid to late 2000s include [[DJ Toomp]], [[Fatboi]], [[Drumma Boy]], Shawty Redd, D. Rich, and [[Zaytoven]]. The first wave of the trap sound was influenced by earlier Southern producers such as [[Lil Jon]], [[Mannie Fresh]], and [[DJ Paul]].

By the end of the decade, a second wave of trap artists gained momentum and frequently topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hip hop charts.<ref name="dj-mag" /> Trap producer [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]] gained huge popularity, and produced more than 200 songs in 2010 and 2011, including a number of singles for mainstream rap artists such as Rick Ross' "[[B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)]]". Since Luger's rise, his signature trap sound has been the heavy use of 808s, crisp snares, fast hihats, synth keys, and orchestration of brass, strings, woodwind, and keyboards.<ref name="lexluger" /> Many of his sounds have been adopted by other hip hop producers trying to replicate his success. As such, Luger is often credited with popularizing the modern trap sound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://massappeal.com/lex-luger-lex-luger-experience-the-tour/ |title=Lex Luger 'Lex Luger Experience: The Tour Vol. 1' |publisher=Mass Appeal |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=23 March 2016 |author=Johnson, James |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406001919/http://massappeal.com/lex-luger-lex-luger-experience-the-tour/ |archivedate=6 April 2016 }}</ref> Since the 2010s, an array of modern trap producers have gained industry popularity, most notably [[808 Mafia]]'s [[Southside (producer)|Southside]] and [[TM88]], [[Sonny Digital]], [[Young Chop]], [[DJ Spinz]], [[Tay Keith]] and [[Metro Boomin]]. Some producers expanded their range to other genres, such as [[contemporary R&B]] ([[Mike WiLL Made It]]) and [[electronic music]] ([[AraabMuzik]]).<ref name="jgenrechar" />

Throughout 2011 and 2012, trap music maintained a strong presence on the mainstream ''Billboard'' music charts with a number of records released by rappers such as Young Jeezy, [[Chief Keef]] and [[Future (rapper)|Future]].<ref name="dj-mag" /> Jeezy's single "[[Ballin' (Young Jeezy song)|Ballin]]" reached number 57 on the ''Billboard'' charts and was considered one of Jeezy's best tracks in some time.<ref name="MATTHEW SCHNIPPER">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/08/26/beat-construction-lil-lody |title=Beat Construction: Lil Lody |publisher=Fader |date=Aug 26, 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2015 |author=Matthew Schnipper |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823160748/http://www.thefader.com/2011/08/26/beat-construction-lil-lody/ |archivedate=23 August 2015}}</ref> Future's single, "[[Turn On the Lights (song)|Turn On the Lights]]", was certified gold and entered at number 50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Keef's "[[I Don't Like]]" and "[[Love Sosa]]" generated over 30&nbsp;million views on [[YouTube]], spawning a new subgenre within trap called [[Drill (music genre)|drill]].

Since maintaining a strong presence on the mainstream music charts, trap music has been influential to non-hip hop artists.
