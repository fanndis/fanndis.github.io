===Digitalization and Informations===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Digital Agenda}}
The Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, previously the Commissioner for Information Society and Media, is responsible media and information issues such as [[telecoms]] and [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]]. The commissioner from 2014 is [[Andrus Ansip]].

2004–2010 Commissioner, [[Viviane Reding]], found a relatively popular policy in seeking to lower [[roaming]] charges of mobile phones when travelling within the EU, stating: "For years, mobile roaming charges have remained unjustifiably high. We are therefore tackling one of the last borders within Europe's internal market".<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/index_en.htm Roaming Charges Portal] European Commission</ref> Her [[Regulation on roaming charges in the European Union|legislation to cap roaming charges]] was approved by the [[European Parliament|Parliament]] in April 2007<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080017/http://www.computerbusinessreview.com/article_news.asp?guid=9D3AEC6B-EC7C-4114-965C-880A63EEFCDD European parliament backs roaming price cuts] Computer Business Review Online</ref> On 7 April 2006 the Commission launched the new "[[.eu]]" [[Top-level domain|TLD]] for websites for EU companies and citizens wishing to have a non-national European internet address. This has proved popular with 2.5 being registered by April 2007. It is now the seventh most popular TLD worldwide, and third in Europe (after [[.de]] and [[.uk]])<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20070411/techbit-eu-internet-names `.eu' Domain Names Top 2.5M in Year One] ''Huffington Post''</ref>

In the previous Commission information society was linked with Enterprise (now linked with Industry).

===Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs}}
The Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs is responsible for the EU's economic affairs including the [[euro]]. In the [[Juncker Commission]], the post also acquired responsibility for [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud|taxation and anti-fraud protection]]. The current Commissioner is [[Pierre Moscovici]].

There have been calls for a strengthened economic portfolio with [[Ségolène Royal]] suggesting that there should be an economic government for the [[eurozone]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6357899.stm Royal v Sarkozy: The policies] BBC News</ref> and at the start of the first [[Barroso Commission]] Germany suggested an economic "[[super-commissioner]]"<ref name="euractiv.com">[http://www.euractiv.com/en/agenda2004/big-strike-deal-super-commissioner-french-vat-cuts-1-ceiling/article-114814 'Big three' strike deal on super commissioner, French VAT cuts, 1% ceiling] EurActiv.com</ref> - which could see a change in this position. That idea, however, was dropped but the Enterprise and Industry Commissioner was strengthened in response.<ref name="bmbrussels.be">[http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php The New Commission - Some Initial Thought] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923001700/http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php |date=23 September 2006 }} BM Brussels</ref>

===Education, Culture, Sport and Youth===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth}}
The Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, [[Tibor Navracsics]], is responsible for policies in education and [[training]], [[youth]], sport, [[civil society]], culture, [[translation]], [[interpreting|interpretation]] and relations with the [[Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]].

The post was enlarged since the [[Prodi Commission]] with the addition of ''training and multilingualism'' (The [[Directorate-General]] is still just [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Education and Culture]]). When Romania joined the EU in 2007, multilingualism was handed over to the new Romanian commissioner. In its place the portfolio included youth, sport and civil society. Multilingualism was reintroduced in 2010 under Barroso's second Commission.

The Commission has become increasingly active in education. The [[ERASMUS programme]], which was established in 1987, is a student exchange programme promoting mobility of students between European universities. The [[Bologna process]] aims to create a [[European Higher Education Area]] where academic qualifications can be recognised across Europe. The [[European Institute of Technology]] is a proposed research university.

<small>The previous portfolio to the current was Culture, merged with Audiovisual policy and [[European Parliament|EP]] relations.</small>

===Energy===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Energy}}
The current Commissioner is [[Miguel Arias Cañete]] and holds responsibility for the [[Energy policy of the European Union|European Union's energy policy]] as well as nuclear issues ([[Euratom]]). The [[Directorate-General]] for this portfolio is shared with the [[European Commissioner for Transport|Commissioner for Transport]] as the [[Directorate-General for Transport and Energy (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport]].

The EU is an active supporter of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which it signed alongside its member-states. In March 2007 the Union committed itself to cut CO2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6432829.stm] There is also a desire to reduce dependency on [[Russia]]n energy supplies following the disputes between Russia and [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. (''See also: [[Russia-Belarus energy dispute]], [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]].'') In April 2007 five southern European countries signed a deal to build an [[oil pipeline]] from the [[Black Sea]] to [[Italy]] which will help diversify energy sources.[http://www.euractiv.com/en/energy/black-sea-oil-pipeline-to-start-flowing-by-2012/article-162998?Ref=RSS]

===Enlargement, European Neighbourhood Policy and External Relations===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy}}
The Commissioner for Enlargement and the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] is concerned with foreign policy towards the EU's nearest neighbours. The [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] portfolio began to be created out of the regionalised foreign policy posts. In particular the [[Santer Commission]] post for relations with central and eastern Europe as those countries began applying to join. The Neighbourhood Policy element was created in 2004 as part of the External Relations portfolio. When that portfolio was absorbed by the High Representative in 2009, Neighbourhood Policy was transferred to Trade and then to Enlargement in 2010 under the Second Barroso Commission. The present Commissioner, as of 2014, is [[Johannes Hahn]].

===Environment===
{{Main|European Commissioner for the Environment}}
The Commissioner for the Environment, [[Karmenu Vella]], is responsible for protection of the [[European Union]]'s environment. Specific actions relating to [[climate change]] are under the responsibility of the Climate Action commissioner as of 2010.

The EU has made a number of environmental moves, partially in regards to climate change. Most notably it signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998, set up its [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]] in 2005 and is agreeing to unilaterally cut its emissions by 20% by 2020. (See: [[Energy policy of the European Union]]). Other policies include; the [[Natura 2000]] a widespread and successful network of nature conservation sites, the [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals]] (REACH) directive requiring safety testing on widely used chemicals and the [[Water Framework Directive]] ensuring water quality reaches higher standards.

For more, see [[European Climate Change Programme]], [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]], [[Renewable energy in the European Union]] and the [[Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission)|Directorate-General for the Environment]].

===Budget and Human Resources===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources}}
The Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources is [[Günther Oettinger]]. He took over this portfolio on 1 January 2017, following the resignation of [[Kristalina Georgieva]], with effect from 31 December 2016, to take up a new position as chief executive officer of the World Bank. He is primarily responsible for the management of the [[budget of the European Union]] and related financial issues except for ''budgetary discharge'' which falls under the Commissioner for administration commissioner. Previously simply for the budget, the position expanded under the [[Prodi Commission]] to include financial programming. The related DG is the [[Directorate-General for Budget]].

Under Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Commissioner's 121.6 billion euro 2008 budget proposed that for the first time funding for [[Sustainable development|sustainable growth]] (€57.2 billion) would be higher than that of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (€56.3 billion), traditionally the largest source of expenditure in the EU. There would be an increase in [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|cohesion funds]], [[Energy policy of the European Union|energy]] and [[European Commissioner for Transport|transport]] of 14%, [[European Commissioner for Science and Research|research]] by 11% and lifelong learning by 9%. There would also be an increase in the administrative budget, aid to Kosovo and [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]] institutions and funds towards the [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo project]].

===High Representative===
{{Main|High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy}}
The High Representative became a Commissioner on 1 December 2009, replacing the External Relations Commissioner (see historical below). Although other external relations posts continue to exist, such as trade, the High Representative is the most senior foreign affairs post in the EU. The position is held by [[Federica Mogherini]].

===Home Affairs===
The Commissioner for Home Affairs was created in 2010 by dividing the previous ''Justice, Freedom and Security'' portfolio into a security orientated post (DG HOME) and a post centred on justice, on individual and fundamental rights (DG JUST). Its DG is the [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs]] (DG HOME).

===Industry and Entrepreneurship===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship}}
The Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry is [[Elżbieta Bieńkowska]]. The post was enlarged from the ''Commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society'' portfolio in the [[Prodi Commission]] to include Industry. At the start of the first [[Barroso Commission]], Germany, backed by Britain and France suggested an economic "super-commissioner"<ref name="euractiv.com"/> to fight for [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]]. Although rejected, this idea though has been taken on by Verheugen, as the Enterprise and Industry portfolio was enlarged and was made a [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice President]].<ref name="bmbrussels.be"/>

As Commissioner, he indicates his aim to increase the competitiveness of Europe, there is a separate [[Commissioner for Competition]] dealing with competition between companies within Europe. However, with the numerous economic portfolios, there is a degree of overlap which has been a matter of concern for him along with the purported difficulty of firing [[Directorate-General|director-generals]]. This Commissioner also chairs the ''Competitiveness Council Commissioners Group'' and is the vice chair of the ''Group of Commissioners on the [[Lisbon Strategy]]''. He is expected to be the European chair of the new [[Transatlantic Economic Council]]. The relevant DG is [[Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry]].

===Internal Market===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services}}
The Commissioner for Internal Market and Services concerned the development of the 480-million-strong [[European Union|European]] [[single market]], promoting [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]]. The related DG is [[Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Internal Market and Services]] and it is also related to the [[Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market]].

Commissioner [[Frits Bolkestein]] (Netherlands) served in the [[Prodi Commission]] between 1999 and 2004. In addition to holding the Internal Market portfolio he also held [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union|Taxation and Customs Union]]. Bolkestein is most notable for the [[Directive on services in the internal market]], which is commonly called the "Bolkestein Directive". The directive aimed at enabling a company from a one [[List of European Union member states|member-state]] to recruit workers in another member-state under the law of the company's home state. It was to help the development of the [[internal market]] for services, the development of which has lagged behind that for goods. However, there was a great deal of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in [[Strasbourg]] by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the [[Barroso Commission]].

The portfolio was merged in 2014 with [[European Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship|the one for Industry and Entrepreneurship]].

===Trade===
{{Main|European Commissioner for Trade}}
The Commissioner for Trade is responsible for the EU's external trade policy. The portfolio is held by [[Valdis Dombrovskis]]. Due to the size of the [[Economy of the European Union|European economy]], being the world's largest market and having a huge slice of world trade, this position can be very important in dealing with other world economic powers such as China or the United States. Former Commissioner [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]] commented that “Frankly, it is more important than most [national] cabinet jobs”.<ref>[http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php The New Commission - Some initial thoughts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923001700/http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php |date=23 September 2006 }} BM Brussels</ref> The Commissioner leads Europe in organisations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Concluding WTO talks after the collapse of the [[Doha Development Round]] has been a contentious point, with the EU not willing to cut [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural subsidies]] without similar action by the United States. The related DG is [[Directorate-General for Trade (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Trade]].

==Historical portfolios==
Many portfolios have been combined and split under different president's, below is a few of the previous posts that have since been abolished.

===Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud===
The Commissioner for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud was in the first Barroso Commission and was responsible for the Commission's internal administration and anti-fraud efforts.

Its administrative duties included management of some of the Commission's [[Internal Services in the European Commission|Internal Services]]; in particular consolidation of administrative reform, [[Human resources|personnel]] and administration, [[European Schools]] and security. The Commissioner is also responsible for the following departments; the [[Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration]], the [[Office for the Administration and Payment of Individual Entitlement (European Commission)|Office for the Administration and Payment of Individual Entitlement]], the [[Directorate-General for Informatics (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Informatics]], the [[Office of Infrastructure and Logistics (European Commission)|Office of Infrastructure and Logistics]], and relations with the [[European Personnel Selection Office]].<ref name="ec.europa.eu" /> Its other responsibilities were for audit (budgetary discharge, internal [[audit]], counter fraud): in particular the [[Internal Audit Service (European Commission)|Internal Audit Service]] and the [[OLAF|European Anti-fraud Office]].

===Administrative Reform===
A position created for the [[Prodi Commission]] in the wake of the [[Santer Commission]] corruption scandal.

===Agriculture and Fisheries===
This position used deal with the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) and the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] (CFP). It existed when the CFP was created in the [[Jenkins Commission (EU)|Jenkins]] until the [[Thorn Commission]] when it was split into Agriculture and Rural Affairs and Fisheries and Maritime Affairs.

===Communication strategy===
The Communication strategy portfolio in the first [[Barroso Commission]] existed between 2004 and 2010 combined with Institutional Relations. Under the second Barroso Commission this was dropped as it had no powers and was open to allegations of propaganda.

===Consumer Protection===
The Commissioner for Consumer Protection was responsible for [[consumer protection|protecting the rights of consumers vs corporations]] between 2007 and 2010. The only Commissioner was [[Meglena Kuneva]] ([[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (European Parliament group)|ALDE]]).

This specific portfolio was created in 2007, separated from the Health portfolio. However, it first appeared in the [[Jenkins Commission (EU)|Jenkins Commission]] as "Consumer Affairs" though the Barroso Commission was the first time it has been an independent portfolio. The independent portfolio was created when Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007. It used to be part of the Health and Consumer Protection portfolio which was held by [[Markos Kyprianou]]. Unlike the [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism|Multilingualism portfolio]] that was created for [[Leonard Orban]], this post was welcomed due to the large size of the combined portfolio. The [[Directorate-General]] is [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection (European Commission)|still merged with that office]]. In 2010 it was recombined with Health in the second Barroso Commission.

===External Relations===
{{Main|European Commissioner for External Relations}}
The Commissioner for External Relations, known as the Commissioner for External Relations and the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] at its demise dealt with general foreign relations and representation of the Commission abroad. It occasionally took on related responsibilities such as enlargement or neighbourhood policy, though most of the time other separate external relations portfolios existed such as development or trade. Early on external relations were split according to geography between various Commissioners. On 1 December 2009 its responsibilities were merged into the [[High Representative]].

===Energy, Euratom Supply Agency, SMEs and Tourism===
An expanded version of the Energy portfolio in the [[Santer Commission]], including parts of Industry (SMEs) and Tourism which has only appeared under Santer.

===Health===
The Commissioner for Health existed between 2007 and 2010 when it was split off from Consumer Protection for the new Bulgarian Commissioner. It was recombined under the succeeding Commission in 2010.

===Justice, Freedom and Security===
The Justice, Freedom and Security portfolio was roughly on the former third [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar]]: [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. The position covers such matters as [[judicial]] matters, human rights, [[Equality before the law|equality]] laws, immigration control, policing and [[citizenship]] (see ''[[Area of freedom, security and justice]]''). The relevant DG was [[Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security]].

As a concession to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (European Parliament group)|liberals]], Barroso split the post in 2010 into the [[#Home Affairs|Commissioner for Home Affairs]] (the security aspect) and the [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship|Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship]] (the human rights aspect).

===Multilingualism===
The Commissioner for Multilingualism was responsible for [[languages of the European Union|language policy of the European Union]], i.e., promoting [[multilingualism]] for the citizens and the institutions of the EU. It was created on 1 January 2007 during the [[Barroso Commission]]. The only commissioner is [[Leonard Orban]] (2007–2010). The post was created on 1 January 2007, in the enlarged Barroso Commission after the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|accession of Bulgaria and Romania]] to the EU. Multilingualism had been a responsibility of the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism]] (held by [[Ján Figeľ]] between 2004 and 2007). Under the second Barroso Commission, the post was re-merged into the education and culture portfolio (held by [[Androulla Vassiliou]]).

The new portfolio was criticised for vagueness and ambiguity, it has been claimed that the post overlaps with responsibilities of other Commissioners. The [[Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament|Conference of Presidents]] of the [[European Parliament]] has asked the current president of the Commission [[José Manuel Barroso]] to clarify the mandate of Commissioner for Multilingualism<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/press/conf_presidents_en.pdf</ref> and of other members of the Commission with regards to the "intercultural dialogue".

European Parliament [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist Group]] (PES) leader [[Martin Schulz]] suggested a portfolio for the protection of [[ethnic minorities]] instead. His party suggested the introduction of the protection of the [[romani people|Roma]] minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/socialists-criticise-new-commissioner-portfolio/article-159715 |title=Socialists criticise new commissioner's portfolio |publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> Barroso turned down the PES proposal and defended the post. He stated that Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture Ján Figeľ "will remain responsible for the management of actions to directly promote the inter-cultural dialogue".<ref>http://euobserver.com/9/23046</ref>

Politically, the portfolio was mainly focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign languages learning]] as means for [[labour mobility|worker's mobility]] and business [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]] rather than emphasizing [[language rights]] of speakers of [[Regional language|regional]], [[Minority language|minority]], lesser-used and migrant languages. Commissioner for Multilingualism is also responsible, alongside the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]], [[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]], and the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture]], [[Ján Figeľ]] to work on "intercultural dialogue", including the 2008 [[European Year of Intercultural Dialogue]].

Administratively, Commissioner for Multilingualism was in charge of the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], the [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|DG for Interpretation]] and the [[Publications Office (European Union)|Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]], as well as for the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|DG for Education and Culture]], with 3,400 staff in total - about 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce- and with about 1 percent of the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]].
