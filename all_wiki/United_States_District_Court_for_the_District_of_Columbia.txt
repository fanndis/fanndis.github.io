The '''United States District Court for the District of Columbia''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''D.D.C.''') is a [[United States district court|federal district court]] in the District of Columbia. It also occasionally handles (jointly with the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]] and the [[High Court of American Samoa]]) federal issues that arise in the territory of [[American Samoa]], which has no local federal court or [[United States territorial court|territorial court]].<ref name="GAO_AS">https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-1124T GAO (U.S. Government Accountability Office. AMERICAN SAMOA: Issues Associated with Some Federal Court Options. September 18, 2008. Retrieved September 7, 2019.</ref> Appeals from the District are taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] (except for [[patent]] claims, and claims against the U.S. government under the [[Tucker Act]], which are appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]).

The current '''United States Attorney''' for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is [[Michael R. Sherwin]].

== History ==
[[File:E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, DC.jpg|thumb|left| [[US Courthouse-District of Columbia|E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse]] ]]

The court was established by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1863 as the '''Supreme Court of the District of Columbia''', replacing the abolished circuit and district courts of the District of Columbia that had been in place since 1801. The court consisted of four justices, including a [[chief justice]], and was granted the same powers and [[jurisdiction]] as the earlier circuit court. Any of the justices could convene a [[United States circuit court]] or a local criminal court. In 1936, Congress renamed the court the '''District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia'''. Its current name was adopted in 1948, and from then on justices were known as judges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-district-courts-district-columbia-and-district-potomac-legislative-history|title=U.S. District Courts for the District of Columbia and the District of Potomac: Legislative History - Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov}}</ref>

Originally housed in the former [[District of Columbia City Hall]], the court now sits in the [[E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse]] located at 333 [[Constitution Avenue]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]] The District has no local [[district attorney]] or equivalent, and so local prosecutorial matters also fall into the jurisdiction of the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]]. [[Assistant United States Attorney]]s (AUSAs) are tasked with prosecution of not only federal crimes but also crimes that would normally be left to the state prosecutor's discretion. Because of this the District has the largest U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation, with around 250 AUSAs.
