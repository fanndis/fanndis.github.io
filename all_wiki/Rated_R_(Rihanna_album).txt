'''''Rated R''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on November 20, 2009 by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and SRP Records. Recording sessions for the album began in March 2009 and took place at recording studios throughout United States and Europe. Rihanna, together with [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]] and [[Jay-Z|The Carter Administration]], was the executive producer of the album and worked with various record producers, including [[Chase & Status]], [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]], [[The-Dream]], [[Ne-Yo]], and [[Brian Kennedy (producer)|Brian Kennedy]]. The record featured several vocalists and instrumentalists, including [[Young Jeezy]], [[will.i.am]], [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], who played the guitars in "[[Rockstar 101]]".

Musically, the album represents a departure from her previous effort ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007), which contained [[up-tempo]] and [[Ballad (music)|ballad]]-oriented songs. Conceived after Rihanna's assault by her then-boyfriend, singer [[Chris Brown]], ''Rated R'' is primarily a [[pop music|pop]], [[hip-hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album; it features a foreboding and atmospheric tone in terms of musical and lyrical direction and it incorporates elements of [[rock music|rock]], and [[dubstep]]. It also explores other genres, such as [[dancehall]] in "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]" and [[Latin music|Latin]]-infusion in "[[Te Amo (Rihanna song)|Te Amo]]". ''Rated R'' received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended Rihanna's mature performance and called the album her most layered and heartfelt effort. The album debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold 181,000 copies in its first week. It also attained top ten positions in over twelve other countries.

The album produced six singles, "[[Russian Roulette (Rihanna song)|Russian Roulette]]", "[[Wait Your Turn]]", "[[Hard (Rihanna song)|Hard]]", "Rude Boy", "Rockstar 101", and "Te Amo". "Russian Roulette" was released as the album's [[lead single]] and managed to reach top-ten in over 25 countries. "Hard" became her thirteenth US top-ten single, while "Rude Boy" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for five consecutive weeks. "Te Amo" attained top-ten positions around Europe and reached number one in Brazil. To further promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her third worldwide concert tour [[Last Girl on Earth]] (2010–2011). ''Rated R'' is deemed as an important album in Rihanna's career and a groundwork inspiration for her follow-up releases.

== Artwork and fashion ==

The final image from the photoshoot for the album was made by German fashion photographer [[Ellen von Unwerth]]. Von Unwerth, who has also shot other album covers such as ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997) by [[Janet Jackson]], ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]'' (2006) by [[Christina Aguilera]], and ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) by [[Britney Spears]], said that Rihanna was "fantastic to work with — very giving, very creative, very involved in every aspect of the shoot and ready to push the boundaries."<ref name=albumcover>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1624888/rihanna-gets-serious-on-rated-r-album-cover.jhtml|title=Rihanna Gets Serious On Rated R Album Cover|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=October 27, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

The brand and styling of ''Rated R'' was conceived by British artist and director [[Simon Henwood]]. "We spent a lot of time developing ideas, yes. We went to Paris for Fashion Week, met with designers, sat and made drawings/designs together for the photo shoot/costume pieces, etc," Henwood revealed in an interview with MuuMuse. "Everything comes from the music, and this is her most personal album to date—so everything draws from it in one way or another."<ref name="henwood">{{cite web | url=http://www.muumuse.com/2010/10/rated-r-and-beyond-interview-with-creative-director-simon-henwood.html/ | title=Rated R and Beyond: Interview with Creative Director Simon Henwood | publisher=MuuMuse.

The whole thing was a dark dream; a chance for her to express all these things without being specific/literal."<ref name="henwood" /> Henwood also conceived the look and feel of the album's artwork, videos and TV spots, and also contributed to Rihanna's [[Last Girl on Earth Tour]], including the show's stage design, costumes, and background visuals.<ref name="henwood" />

''Rated R'' is deemed a pivotal record in Rihanna's career as it was released nine months after the domestic violence case with Brown. Inspired by the altercation, it was also her first album to feature a [[Parental Advisory|parental advisory label]] as a result of the new "much more hard-edged persona" she embraced.<ref name="dailynebraskan">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/culture/ten-years-later-rated-r-remains-a-high-point-of/article_8c521b1e-10af-11ea-83b1-43622fffa825.html|title=Ten years later, 'Rated R' remains a high point of Rihanna's discography|work=[[The Daily Nebraskan]]|last=Price|first=Jack|date=November 27, 2019|accessdate=May 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127210520/http://www.dailynebraskan.com/culture/ten-years-later-rated-r-remains-a-high-point-of/article_8c521b1e-10af-11ea-83b1-43622fffa825.html|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, ten years after the album release, Chuck Arnold of ''Billboard'' described the record as a "coming-of-age manifesto" and also Rihanna's version of Jackson's ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986). According to him, ''Rated R'' is "her declaration of independence from Brown and her taking charge of a narrative that had turned her into a victim."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8544529/rihanna-rated-r-album|title=Rihanna's 'Rated R' at 10: How It Changed Her Career|work=Billboard|last=Arnold|first=Chuck|date=November 23, 2019|accessdate=May 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128003905/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8544529/rihanna-rated-r-album|archive-date=November 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, [[Blavity]]'s Jordan Simon compared it to Jackson's ''The Velvet Rope'', and described it as a "a dark portrait of a Black woman's journey to self-healing".<ref name="blavity">{{cite web|url=https://blavity.com/blavity-original/ten-years-later-rihannas-rated-r-album-remains-a-mini-movie-magnum-opus-and-masterclass-in-misogynoir|title=Ten Years Later, Rihanna's Rated R Album Remains a Mini Movie, Magnum Opus and Masterclass in Misogynoir|publisher=[[Blavity]]|date=November 20, 2019|access-date=May 26, 2020|last=Simon|first=Jordan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191122170451/https://blavity.com/blavity-original/ten-years-later-rihannas-rated-r-album-remains-a-mini-movie-magnum-opus-and-masterclass-in-misogynoir|archive-date=November 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Jack Price of ''[[The Daily Nebraskan]]'' wrote that the album is a testament of evolution and being strong, "to getting knocked down, getting up and coming back harder than ever".<ref name="dailynebraskan"/>

Despite the lukewarm response towards the album at the time of release, according to Price, ''Rated R'' set the groundwork for "the emotional songs, powerful vocals and ability to float right from catchy pop singles to bass-heavy rap flows" featured on her follow-up albums ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010) and ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'' (2016).<ref name="dailynebraskan"/> Concluding his anniversary review, Simon, wrote, "Ten years later, the album's eclectic mix of dubstep, hip-hop, rock, pop, and R&B still sounds as fresh and new age as it did when it was first released."<ref name="blavity"/>
