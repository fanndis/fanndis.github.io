The '''Association for Women in Communications''' ('''AWC''') is an American [[professional organization]] for women in the [[communications]] industry.<ref name="Burt-2000" /><ref name="Kopecki-1996" /><ref name="Sterling-2003" />

==History==
===Theta Sigma Phi===
The Association for Women in Communications began in 1909 as '''Theta Sigma Phi''' ('''ΘΣΦ'''), an honorary society at the [[University of Washington]].<ref name="Burt-2000" /><ref name="Sterling-2003" /><ref name="kansas feature">{{cite news |title=Journalism Sorority has a large program |url=https://basic.newspapers.com/clip/63868837/ |access-date=November 23, 2020 |work=University Daily Kansan |date=14 May 1920 |location=Lawrence, Kansas |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  It was founded by seven female students at the University of Washington in Seattle who had entered the college's new journalism program, the second of its kind in the country. By 1915, there were Theta Sigma Phi chapters at the universities of Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon and [[Ohio State University]]. Officers from the Washington Chapter still doubled as national officers, and the organization began publishing '''''The Matrix'', a Magazine for Women Journalists'''.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history.asp |title=AWC is One of the Originals |publisher=Association for Women in Communications |accessdate=March 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209214956/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history.asp| archivedate  =February 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1918, Theta Sigma Phi held its first convention at the [[University of Kansas]]. A year later, women in Kansas City founded the first alumnae chapter (now known as professional chapters), followed by women in Des Moines and Indianapolis.

[[World War I]] brought more women into newspaper jobs as their male colleagues went to battle. Theta Sigma Phi member [[Alice Rohe]] was a [[United Press]] reporter in Rome; [[Bessie Beatty]] of the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'' and [[Sigrid Schultz]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported from Germany as the war ended. But in the postwar economic slump, hostility against "women in men's jobs" ran high. Many editors relegated women to society pages instead of "hard news."

Although women gained the right to vote in 1920, support lagged for other reforms. Ruby Black, who was national president, editor of ''The Matrix'' and the first manager of an employment bureau for members, noted in 1931 that female journalists couldn't get reporting jobs at the same pay as similarly qualified men.

Theta Sigma Phi strengthened as a national network during the 1930s. The association hired a professional director and founded a national office in 1934. It inaugurated the Headliner Awards in 1939 to honor members who had made outstanding contributions to the field. The group gave [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] honorary membership for her efforts to aid female communicators. The First Lady's most notable action was to close her news conferences to male reporters. Mrs. Roosevelt contributed several articles to ''The Matrix''.<ref name="history"/>

By 1940, Theta Sigma Phi had 39 chapters, and [[World War II]] was expanding opportunities for women. But inequality persisted, and women were regarded as temporary or less-serious workers. At the Theta Sigma Phi convention in 1946, delegates required all chapters to eliminate any race restrictions from their bylaws.

By 1950, the group had grown to 47 campus chapters and 29 alumnae groups as more women began to work.

In 1964, Theta Sigma Phi established its headquarters in [[Austin, Texas]]. Jo Caldwell Meyer retired after serving as executive secretary for 24 years, leaving a legacy of leadership and personal attention to members' needs.<ref name="history"/>

===Women in Communications===
In 1972, Theta Sigma Phi was renamed to '''Women in Communications, Inc.''' (WICI).<ref name="Burt-2000" /><ref name="Sterling-2003" /> That year, the organization also voted to admit men into membership.<ref name="Marzolf-1977" /><ref name="Nadler-1987" />

In 1973, Women in Communications created an awards program (later named the '''Clarion Awards''') to recognize excellence in communications. A new monthly, National Newsletter joined ''The Matrix'' in recording the group's news. WICI joined the national ERA coalition to fight the mounting opposition to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

In 1979, WICI united with 11 communications organizations to found the First Amendment Congress, which works to preserve [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history70.asp |title=The 1970s: New name, new strengths |publisher=The Association for Women in Communications |accessdate=March 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131204153732/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history70.asp| archivedate= December 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

WICI increasingly defended the freedoms of speech and the press. Leaders protested the news blackout during the invasion of Grenada and spoke out to Congress against proposed changes to the Freedom of Information Act. More than 100 chapters organized congressional letter-writing campaigns. WICI joined the National Committee on Pay Equity and awarded Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio an honorary membership because of her leadership on the issue.

In early 1988, the WICI Board of Directors moved the group's headquarters to Arlington, Va., just outside Washington, DC, to be closer to the seat of government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history80.asp|title=The '80s: A Decade of Growth, Change and Leadership|publisher=Association for Women in Communications | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004334/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history80.asp| archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Membership peaked in the mid-1980s at around 13,000, and by 1995 the organization had around 8,000 members and significant debt.<ref name="Drale-2003" />

WICI leaders instituted the Rising Star Award in 1990 for outstanding student members. Laura Glad, of [[California State University at Fullerton]], was the first recipient.  WICI delegates voiced support for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|Civil Rights Act]], which [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] signed in 1991, and the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], which [[President Clinton]] signed in 1993. The end of the year saw a new partnership emerge between WICI and [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]] on its "Stop Sexual Harassment" campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history90.asp |title=The 1990s: Embracing the Future |publisher=The Association for Women in Communications |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423003424/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history90.asp |archivedate=2014-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Association for Women in Communications===
In 1996 WICI was dissolved, and the organization was renamed to the ''Association for Women in Communications''.<ref name="Burt-2000" /><ref name="Kopecki-1996" /><ref name="Sterling-2003" /><ref name="whw-2009" /><ref name="Bulkeley-2004" /> At that time, management of the organization was handed to a management firm, and finances stabilized under the new board and organization. The current firm is ASCENT Management in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The nonprofit AWC Matrix Foundation was established in 1998 as their educational affiliate.

The mission of the AWC Matrix Foundation, founded in 1997, is to promote the advancement of women in the communications profession by providing funds for education, research and publications. It carries out its educational and charitable goals in cooperation with the Association for Women in Communications.

Three Matrix Foundation initiatives are:
*Professional Certification Program recognizes excellence in all areas of communications; provides an opportunity to demonstrate communication and management skills and enhance employment/client potential.
*Edith Wortman First Amendment Award honors professional communicators for their efforts relating to First Amendment issues.
*Barbara Erickson Scholarship Fund gives college students an opportunity to meet and mingle with professional communicators by funding attendance at the AWC National Professional Conference.
