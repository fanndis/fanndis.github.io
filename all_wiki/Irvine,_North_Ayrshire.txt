The 2011 Census recorded the town's population at 33,698 inhabitants, making it the largest settlement in North Ayrshire.<ref name="Scotland's Census 2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ods-web/area.html |title=Irvine Area Profile – 2011 Census|publisher=Scotland's Census|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> 
Irvine was the site of Scotland's 12th century military capital and former headquarters of the [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]], [[Hugh de Morville, Constable of Scotland|Hugh de Morville]].<ref>Morton, pp. 2–4</ref> It also served as the capital of [[Cunninghame]] and was, at the time of [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], one of the earliest capitals of Scotland.<ref>Morton, pp. 2–10</ref>

The town was once a haunt of [[Robert Burns]], after whom two streets in the town are named: Burns Street and Burns Crescent. He is known to have worked in a flax mill on the Glasgow Vennel. Despite being classed as a new town, Irvine has had a long history stretching back many centuries and was classed as a [[Royal Burgh]]. There are also conflicting rumours that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] stayed briefly at [[Seagate Castle]]. There is still a yearly festival, called Marymass, held in the town. Marymass refers to the religious [[Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] celebrated on 15 August, and was therefore Mary's Mass hence Marymass.

Irvine is the birthplace of the present [[First Minister of Scotland]] and leader of the [[Scottish National Party]], [[Nicola Sturgeon]] as well as the former [[First Minister of Scotland]], [[Jack McConnell]]. The current Scottish [[Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Europe and External Affairs]], [[Fiona Hyslop]] was also born in Irvine.

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Eglinton Castle by J Fleming.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Eglinton Castle]], home of the Earls of Eglinton, c. 1830s.]]
Part of modern Irvine contains the oldest continually inhabited village in Europe.<ref name="Morton, p. 8">Morton, p. 8</ref> [[Dreghorn]], a separate village on the outskirts of Irvine, appears to contain archaeological remains dating back to the first incursions of humanity into Scotland ([[Mesolithic]]).<ref name="Morton, p. 8"/> Numerous ancient sites pepper the region. [[Iron Age]] Hill forts are abundant.

The [[Grannie stone]] (or Granny Stane) is described as "one of Irvine's prehistoric puzzles", this boulder is either left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle – others were removed, by blasting, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone. The Grannie Stane is visible when the water is low.

===Middle Ages===

The medieval parish of Irvine was one of the most important regions in Scotland. Originally the site of the Military Headquarters of the [[Lord High Constable of Scotland]] and one of the earliest Scottish Capitals, it served as an HQ to no fewer than three kings.<ref>Morton, p. 3-6</ref> King [[John I of Scotland]] inherited the lordship of Irvine sometime in the mid-13th century.<ref>Morton, p. 2</ref> [[Robert the Bruce]], in an attempt to seize John's lands, made sure that he secured the town.<ref name="Morton, p. 8"/> From Bruce it passed to his grandson [[Robert the Steward]], future King [[Robert II of Scotland]].<ref>Morton, p. 9</ref>

Irvine is the site of an incident in 1296 during the Scottish Wars of Independence when an English army marched to Irvine to engage the Scottish army that was encamped at Knadgerhill, only to find that dissension amongst the Scots leaders was so great that armed conflict did not occur and many of the leaders changed sides and joined [[King Edward I]].<ref>Simpson, p. 2</ref> [[Bourtreehill House]], the only major Estate in the parish, was periodically possessed by all three kings and possibly the Constables of Scotland before them.<ref>Morton, p. 3</ref>

In December 2010, the writer [[A. J. Morton]] stated that Irvine was a "Lost Medieval Capital" and a likely candidate in the debate about the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] and its location before it was moved to Scone. Citing [[Hector Boece]], who said the Stone was kept at [[Evonium]] a legendary city and home to the early Scottish crown, Morton said that Irvine's early high status position in the 12th century supported the theory that Irvine is Evonium. {{Dubious |Evonium and Irvine? |reason=Evonium unlikely to have been located at Irvine |date=October 2013}} Morton write:
{{quote|text=We can't be certain that Evonium actually existed, so we can't properly identify the Stone's western home, or say with any certainty that Irvine is most definitely Evonium. What is certain is that the Irvine district was enormously important in the middle ages. The most intriguing evidence concerns Irvine’s links with early monarchs and officers of post-Norman Scotland.<ref name=stone>{{cite web |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/news/Stone-of-Destiny-39from-Ayrshire.6665396.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Stone of Destiny 'from Ayrshire, not Perthshire' |date=19 December 2010 |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |author=Cowing, Emma}}</ref>}}

In 1618 John Stewart, said to be a vagabond or juggler, and Margaret Barclay, wife of Archibald Dean a burgess of Irvine, were tried for witchcraft. They were accused of sinking a ship called ''The Gift of God of Irvine'' belonging to John Dean, Barclay's brother-in-law. Margaret Barclay was alleged to have wished the crew would be eaten by crabs at the bottom the sea. Stewart hung himself, and Barclay was tortured, found guilty by her confession, and executed along with Isobel Scherer who was accused of the same acts.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 367, 401: [[Walter Scott]], ''Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft'' (New York, 1836), pp. 269–8.</ref>

====Trindlemoss Loch====
[[Trindlemoss Loch]], Scotts Loch or the Loch of Irvine was situated in a low-lying area running from Ravenspark to near Stanecastle and down to Lockwards, now represented only by the playing fields off Bank Street. The loch was natural, sitting in a hollow created by glaciation. The loch waters were progressively drained and in 1691 this was finally achieved. The loch and its adjacent land was purchased by the Reverend Patrick Warner (minister in Irvine 1688–1702),who had sought refuge in the Netherlands after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. It has been suggested that it was during this exile that he learned the skill of land reclamation.<ref>Thomson, Peter G. (1989) ''The Good Cause'', p. 34. Cunninghame District Council, Irvine.</ref>

====Etymology====
One interpretation of the placename is that it means 'green river' as in the Welsh river named [[Afon Irfon|Irfon]]. It has had many variants, such as Irwyn (1322), Ervin (1259) Irewin (1429–30), Irrvin (1528), and Irwin (1537).<ref>Simpson, p. 1</ref> Another author lists Yrewin, c.1140; Irvin, c.1230; Orewin, c.1295, with a meaning of 'west flowing river.'<ref>Johnston, p. 167</ref> "Eriwine" and "Erwinne" are also old English first names. A parish in Annandale in Dumfriesshire has the name Irving. In the 12th century a Gilchrist, son of Eruini, witnessed a charter in Galloway and this is the earliest use of the name so far discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/clans/blclanirvine.htm|title=History of the Irvine/Irving/Irwin Family|website=Rampantscotland.com|accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> However, the Tironesian Monks of Kilwinning dedicated their Abbey to St Finnian, and the Latinised version of this name is Vinninius from where we get Irvine (and indeed Southannan in Fairlie).

====Harbour====
{{main|Irvine Harbour}}
[[File:Irvine19c.jpg|thumb|left|Irvine 'Old Town' High Street, early 19th century]]
The harbour for Irvine has a long history and once was one of the most prominent ports in Scotland after [[Glasgow]]. Across from the main harbour itself there was a terminal for the [[ICI Nobel|ICI-Nobel]] Explosives plant on the [[River Garnock]]. Much of the harbour went into decline in the 19th century when Glasgow, [[Greenock]] and [[Port Glasgow]] achieved higher prominence as sea ports. Despite this, there was still commercial sea traffic, though the harbour went into further decline in the 20th century. The main shipping in the 20th century was light coastal traffic and vessels destined for the Nobel Explosives facility. This facility had its own quay, which, although now disused, is still visible from Irvine Harbour. A [[shipyard]] on the [[River Irvine]], the Ayrshire Dockyard Company, remained active until after [[World War II]], though its last ship was built just prior to the war. Afterwards it was involved in refitting ships and also in the manufacture of fittings for other vessels including the [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] liner [[Queen Elizabeth 2]]. Irvine Harbour is now officially closed as a commercial [[port]] and houses a small number of privately owned pleasure craft. It is also home to part of the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]] with numerous vessels on display, including the 'Spartan', one of the last surviving [[Clyde puffer]]s.

Irvine Harbour is home to a unique and distinctive building which marked the [[tide]] level. It was built in 1906 and devised by Martin Boyd, the [[harbourmaster]] at that time. The [[Boyd's Automatic tide signalling apparatus|Automatic tide signalling apparatus]] indicated the tide's state in two ways depending on the time of day. During daylight, the level was marked with a ball and [[pulley]] system attached to the mast. At night, a number of lamps marked the tidal level. Unfortunately the building fell into some disrepair and the mast partially dismantled. In 2013 an initiative by Coastwatch Scotland, a Voluntary Coastal Monitoring and Safety organisation, got underway in an attempt to turn the building into a watch tower for the benefit of the people of Irvine and visitors.  In November 2016 the first stage was completed with an overall roof installed, new windows, a new door, the building re-painted and a radio aerial installed.

The harbour and surrounding area became an area heavily blighted by industrial waste even long after some of the industries were gone. There was a waste bing known by the locals as 'The Blue Billy' due to the colour of the waste there. During [[World War II]] a [[Royal Observer Corps]] watchtower was sited here giving a wide overall view of the [[Firth of Clyde]]. It is also credited with the first visual sighting of [[Rudolf Hess]]'s [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] in 1941.

===Present day===
====The Big Idea====
{{main|The Big Idea (museum)}}
[[File:Bigideairvine.JPG|thumb|right|The old 'Big Idea' building and the footbridge.]]
As part of the Millennium celebrations, an exhibition known as ''The Big Idea'' opened in 2000. It was constructed on the north side of the [[River Irvine]] near the former Nobel quay. A footbridge from the harbour area was constructed, although it had to be able to open and close to still allow the small pleasure craft to pass. ''The Big Idea'' closed in 2003, due to low visitor numbers.

====Sports====
Irvine is home to two football teams: Irvine Victoria and Irvine Meadow.

====Harbour Arts Centre====
{{main| Harbour Arts Centre}}
North Ayrshire's theatre and arts centre was built here in 1966, and plays hosts to touring drama, live music and exhibitions.

====The City of Adelaide====
The [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] of the historic clipper ship, [[City of Adelaide (1864)|City of Adelaide]], was moved to a dry dock near the inner harbour in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/content/view/46/90/|title=Clipper Ship 'City of Adelaide' – Timeline<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Cityofadelaide.org.au|accessdate=11 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007181803/http://cityofadelaide.org.au/content/view/46/90/|archivedate=7 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There were various proposals for preserving the ship, and in March 2012 preparations were under way to move the ship to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], for conservation and display.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Briggs | first =  Billy | title = Clipper ship City of Adelaide finds berth in Australia | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/18/clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-australia | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 18 March 2012 | accessdate = 23 March 2012 }}</ref> On 18 September 2013, the [[City of Adelaide (1864)|City of Adelaide]] started its final journey to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]<ref>{{cite news | title = Weather delays City of Adelaide journey to Australia | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24143823 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 18 September 2013 | accessdate =  16 December 2013 }}</ref>

====New town====
[[File:Irvine churches.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Irvine churches and the Rivergate Centre.]]
Unlike most new towns which were either completely newly built or based around small villages, Irvine was already a sizeable town which had been a [[Royal Burgh]] since 1372.
A [[quango]], the Irvine Development Corporation (IDC), was set up in the 1960s to oversee the development of Irvine as Scotland's fifth new town.  The Corporation subsumed the planning powers of the Royal Burgh of Irvine Town Council, Kilwinning Town Council and the Irvine Landward District Council.  This involved massive and sometimes controversial development of the old parts of the town.  Irvine was officially designated, in 1966, the fifth and last new town to be developed in Scotland and the only one to be located on the coast. The other Scottish 'new towns' were [[East Kilbride]], [[Glenrothes]], [[Cumbernauld]] and [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]].

IDC was widely criticised for some of their actions including the demolition of large swathes of the [[Fullarton]] part of the town, the bridge{{Which|date=July 2016}} and most of Bridgegate in 1972 and 1973.  One positive development of IDC's was the Irvine Beach Park from 1975 and the Magnum Leisure Centre opened in 1976.  This area, behind the harbour had been largely industrial wasteland for many years and was regarded as an eyesore.  The area was developed with vast amounts of greenery making it a pleasant place to walk.  IDC and the Urban Regeneration Company have plans to redevelop much of the waterfront area.{{Contradict-inline|reason=IDC wound up in 1996|date=July 2016}}  Surrounding towns and villages along the coastline are included in a number of the regeneration proposals.

The provisions of The New Town (Irvine) Winding Up Order 1993 officially ended the New Town Designation on 31 December 1996.  This marked the end of the Irvine Development Corporation and the return of full planning control of the area back to the local authority.

====Irvine Bay Regeneration====
The Irvine Bay Regeneration Company was set up in 2006, one of the second generation of Scottish URCs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irvinebay.co.uk/vision/who-are-we|title=Irvine Bay|website=Irvinebay.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217025051/http://www.irvinebay.co.uk/vision/who-are-we|archivedate=17 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Irvine is one of the five towns in the area, along with [[Ardrossan]], [[Saltcoats]], [[Stevenston]] and [[Kilwinning]]. Major development projects in the Irvine area include the redevelopment of Irvine Harbour, creating a residential area with the atmosphere of a Scottish village. Planning for a new golf course with a hotel and holiday resort is also well under way in the Marine Drive area, and the Riverside Business Park will be revitalised to attract new business into the area. The Bridgegate renovation project was completed in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irvinetimes.com/news/kilwinning/articles/2013/12/06/481263-irvines-bridgegate-finally-opens/|title=Irvine's Bridgegate finally opens|website=Irvine Times|accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:Cunninghame House, Irvine.jpg|thumb|right|Cunningham House, the seat of North Ayrshire Council, located in the centre of Irvine]]
Irvine was granted its first Burgh Charter around 1249. This entitled the town to organise its own affairs under a [[Town Council]]. In circa 1372 a dispute arose between Irvine and [[Ayr]] as to which of the two burghs had rights to control trade in the Barony of Cunninghame and Barony of Largs. The [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]]es of Irvine were able to produce Royal Charters showing that the town had the right to control trade in the Baronies of Cunninghame and Largs. The dispute was resolved by [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]]'s [[Royal Charter]] of 8 April 1372 conferring Royal Burgh status.

Originally [[Fullarton]] remained outwith the Royal Burgh of Irvine as a distinct village and latterly burgh in its own right in the [[Parish]] of [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]] until the Irvine Burgh Act 1881 extended the town's boundaries.

Irvine continued to administer itself with the usual [[Royal Burgh]] administrative arrangements of [[Provost (civil)|Provost]], [[Bailie]]s and [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]]es. Responsibility for public health, schools and strategic services such as roads passed to [[Ayrshire|Ayr County Council]] in 1930 when the town was re-classified as a Small Burgh. On 16 May 1975 the Royal Burgh of Irvine Town Council was abolished and its functions were transferred to the now defunct [[Cunninghame]] District Council. One of the last acts of the old town council was to present the bulk of the Royal Burgh records and the Provost's regalia to the Irvine Burns Club Museum on Eglinton Street.

There is a [[Community council]] in Irvine. However, unlike counterparts elsewhere in Scotland, it opts not to use 'Royal Burgh of' in its title. The motto used on the coat of arms of the Royal Burgh is 'Tandem Bona Causa Triumphat.' This means "The Good Cause Triumphs in the end". The [[Central Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster Constituency of Central Ayrshire]] is currently held by the [[Scottish National Party]]. The [[Member of Parliament]] is [[Philippa Whitford]]. The [[Cunninghame South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Scottish Parliament Constituency of Cunninghame South]] is also held by the Scottish National Party. The [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] is [[Margaret Burgess]].

At the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] Irvine went against the national trend where 28 out of 32 council areas voted against the proposal for Scotland to become an [[Scottish independence|independent]] state on a margin of 55.3% No to 44.7% Yes. In the Irvine West electoral ward 6,543 votes were cast in favour of independence compared with 6,397 votes cast against the proposal, with a vote share of 50.56% "Yes" to 49.44% "No". In Irvine East there were 7,111 "Yes" votes and 6,811 "No" votes, on a vote share of 51.08% Yes to 48.92% No. For Irvine as a whole there were 13,654 "Yes" votes and 13,208 "No" votes, breaking down to 50.83% Yes to 49.17% No.

==Geography and climate==
Irvine is situated in low lying Ayrshire overlooking [[Irvine Bay]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]. It is a coastal town and lies approximately {{convert|25|mi}} southwest of Glasgow. Most of the land in and around Irvine is very flat. Two rivers flow through the area, one being the [[River Irvine]] and the other being the [[Annick Water]]. The Annick Water is very popular for fishing. The area experiences relatively cool, wet summers and cold, wet winters, although snow in the area is not uncommon. Part of the reason why this part of Scotland is particularly mild is the influence from the sea air, with summer temperatures lower than their continental counterparts and only slightly warmer than their continental counterparts during the winter. Generally rainfall is plentiful throughout the year due to Atlantic weather systems sweeping in from the west. Snow is not rare in this part of Scotland and in many cases brings the area to a halt, like in 1995 and winter 2009/10.

==Transport==
[[File:Irvine Station - geograph.org.uk - 1625076.jpg|thumb|right|A train approaching [[Irvine railway station]]]]
Irvine is well served with numerous transport links. A [[Irvine railway station|railway station]], originally built by the [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] Company, is situated at the west end of the town which is on the main line between [[Stranraer]] and [[Glasgow]]. The railway company responsible for local routes is [[Abellio ScotRail]] who operate Saltire liveried Diesel and Electric [[Multiple units]] of the former [[Strathclyde Passenger Transport]] Executive. A comprehensive local bus network, coupled with frequent services to [[Ardrossan]], [[Greenock]], [[Kilmarnock]], [[Ayr]], [[Troon]] and Glasgow, is provided by [[Stagecoach West Scotland]].

There are two primary road crossings over the River Irvine, the more southerly of which has been criticised for some years. It is situated on the site of the former Irvine to Kilmarnock railway link which has long since been closed. The bridge over the river there has long been unsuitable for heavy traffic –  being of a [[Bailey bridge]] design – which was constantly repaired over the years it existed. [[North Ayrshire Council]] announced plans to renew the bridge in a £2m investment which started in 2007, and was completed in 2010.

Irvine is also well served by several arterial roads, namely the A78 (Greenock to [[Prestwick]]), A71 (Irvine to Kilmarnock and beyond to Edinburgh), A737 (through the [[Garnock Valley]] to [[Glasgow]] via the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]]) and the A736 to [[Glasgow]]

==Irvine New Town Trail==
{{main|Irvine New Town Trail}}

The Irvine New Town Trail passes through a lot of the surrounding areas of Irvine; it forms part of the British National Cycle Network with routes 7 and 73 forming part of the route. The route forms a ring around the town and passes through [[Kilwinning]], [[Bourtreehill]], Girdle Toll and [[Dreghorn]] and passes through the town centre of Irvine.

The [[Irvine Burns Club]], originally formed in the Milne's Inn (now The Crown Inn) is now based in Wellwood House, Eglinton Street, and has an unbroken history dating back to 2 June 1826. The club had twelve founding members of whom five were known to Robert Burns, and two were once his close friends. The original minute of the meeting reads:

''"The subscribers agree hereby to form, and do now form ourselves into a Committee for the purpose of establishing a Club, or Society for Commemorating the birth of Robert Burns the Ayrshire Poet – and we agree to meet at an early day to get the preliminaries of the Club properly arranged."''

The document is signed by John Mackenzie, M.D.; David Sillar, Bailie; William Gillies, Grain Dealer; John Peebles, Convener of Trades; James Johnston, Town Clerk; Robert Wyllie, Harbour Master; John Orr, Merchant; James Allan, Merchant (grocer); Maxwell Dick, Bookseller; William Shields, Senior, Merchant; John Fletcher, Surgeon; and Patrick Blair, Writer.

[[John MacKenzie (Doctor)|Dr John Mackenzie]], was the first club president. He had been a doctor in Mauchline, attended Burns' dying father at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea]] in 1784 and married one of the "Mauchline Belles" before moving to Irvine in the capacity of personal physician to the [[Earl of Eglinton]] and his family. David Sillar, the first vice-president, had been a friend of Burns since his teenage years, was a member of the Tarbolton Bachelors Club, became a grocer, and finally an Irvine Council Bailie.<ref>[http://www.irvineburnsclub.org/ourhistory.htm Irvine Burns club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183836/http://www.irvineburnsclub.org/ourhistory.htm |date=17 March 2012 }} Retrieved : 2011-12-16</ref>

The Irvine Burns Club is one of the oldest continually existing Burns Clubs in the World and has an excellent collection of Burns artifacts, including the Kilmarnock Edition and Edinburgh editions of ''"Poems chiefly in the Scottish dialect"'', by Robert Burns.
The club has six of the original manuscripts which Burns sent to John Wilson, printer, Kilmarnock, for his famous Kilmarnock Edition, published on 31 July 1786, namely – ''The Twa Dogs'', ''The Author's Earnest Cry and Prayer'', ''The Address to the Deil'', ''Scotch Drink'' and ''The Cottar's Saturday Night''.

The Irvine Burns Club has the oldest continuous record of any Burns club in the World.<ref>[http://www.irvineburnsclub.org/honpages/hon1987etseq.htm Irvine Burns Club Honorary Members 1987–1996] Retrieved : 2011-12-16</ref>
