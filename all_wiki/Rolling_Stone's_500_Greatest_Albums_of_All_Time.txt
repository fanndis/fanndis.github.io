"'''The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time'''" is a recurring music ranking of the finest [[album]]s in history as compiled by the American magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. It is based on weighted votes from selected musicians, critics, and industry figures. The first list was published in a special issue of the magazine in 2003 and a related book in 2005.<ref name="RS500">{{cite book| editor-last=Levy| editor-first=Joe| editor2-last=Van Zandt| editor2-first=Steven| editor2-link=Steven Van Zandt|title=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|origyear=2005|edition=3rd|year=2006|publisher=Turnaround|location=London|isbn=1-932958-61-4|oclc=70672814|ref=RS500}}

In 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' published a revised edition, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums released up until the early 2000s. As in the original list, [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) remained at the top.<ref name="cos2020" />

Another updated edition of the list was published in 2020, with 154 new entries not in either of the two previous editions. It was based on a new survey and does not factor in the surveys that were conducted for the previous lists. This time, the list favored black and female artists, with [[Marvin Gaye]]'s ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971) listed at the number one spot.<ref name="cos2020" />

The first version of the list, published as a magazine in November 2003, was based on the votes of 273 rock musicians, critics, and industry figures, each of whom submitted a weighted list of 50 albums. The accounting firm [[Ernst & Young]] devised a point system to weigh votes for 1,600 submitted titles.<ref name="cite-2"/> [[The Beatles]]' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' topped the list, with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors describing it as "the most important rock 'n' roll album ever made".<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Sawyers|editor1-first=June Skinner|title=Read the Beatles: Classic and New Writings on the Beatles, Their Legacy, and Why They Still Matter|year=2006|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=EIgR8wbhPDoC}} |isbn=978-0-14-303732-3|p=97}}</ref> [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) was ranked second in recognition of its influence on ''Sgt.

An amended list was released as a book in 2005, with an introduction by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Some compilation albums were removed, and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s ''[[The Complete Recordings (Robert Johnson album)|The Complete Recordings]]'' was substituted for both of his ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'' volumes, making room for a total of eight new entries on the list.{{full citation needed|date=September 2020}}{{refn|group=nb|''The Complete Recordings'' would be reinstated to the list in the 2012 edition.{{cn|date=September 2020}}}}

On May 31, 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' published a revised list, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums up until the early 2000s.<ref name="rs500list">{{cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531|date=May 31, 2012|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> It was made available in "bookazine" format on newsstands in the US from April 27 to July 25. The new list contained 38 albums not present in the previous one, 16 of them released after 2003. The top listings remained unchanged.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

[[File:Marvin Gaye (1973).png|thumb|[[Marvin Gaye]] (1973)]]

Most of the albums on the initial lists were by white male rock musicians. Among the top 50 rankings, only 12 entries were by artists of non-white ethnicity, none of whom were female, and only three albums by white women figured in the top 50.<ref name="cos2020"/> On September 22, 2020, another revision of the list was published. It drew upon a new survey conducted with "more than 300 artists, producers, critics, and music-industry figures", including:<ref name="2012list">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|date=September 22, 2020|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 22, 2020}}</ref>

==Reception==
The original ''Rolling Stone'' 500 was criticized for being male-dominated, outmoded and almost entirely Anglo-American in focus.<ref>Biron, Dean. 2011. Towards a Popular Music Criticism of Replenishment. ''Popular Music & Society'', 34/5: 661–682.</ref><ref>Schmutz, Vaughan. 2005. Retrospective Critical Consecration in Popular Music: Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time. ''American Behavioral Scientist'', 48/11: 1510–1523.</ref> Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'' newspaper, [[Edna Gundersen]] described the list as predictable and "weighted toward testosterone-fueled vintage rock".{{full citation|date=September 2020}} Following the publicity surrounding the list, rock critic [[Jim DeRogatis]], a former ''Rolling Stone'' editor, published ''Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics'' in 2004. The book featured a number of critics arguing against the high evaluation of various "great" albums, many of which had been included in the list.<ref>({{ISBN|1-56980-276-9}})</ref>

Jonny Sharp, a contributor to [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''NME''{{'}}s own 500 greatest albums list]], described the 2012 ''Rolling Stone'' list as a "soulless, canon-centric [list] of the same tired old titles," noting: "looking at their 500, when the only album in their top 10 less than 40 years old is ''[[London Calling]]'', I think I prefer the ''NME'''s less critically-correct approach."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Johnny |title=Mission Impossible: My 'NME 500 Greatest Albums' Voting Hell |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/13683-nme-greatest-albums-list-johnny-sharp-cigarettes |website=The Quietus |accessdate=January 1, 2020 |date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

Responding to the 2020 revision, ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''{{'}}s Alex Young wrote that the lesser representation of white male rock musicians was "the biggest takeaway".<ref name="cos2020"/> According to [[CNN]]'s Leah Asmelash, "The change represents a massive shift for the magazine, moving to recognize more contemporary albums and a wider range of tastes."<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Leah Asmelash|title=Rolling Stone places Marvin Gaye at the top of its new, less rock heavy list of the best albums ever|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/us/rolling-stone-best-500-albums-trnd/index.html|access-date=2020-09-28|website=CNN}}</ref>

''InsideHook''{{'}}s Bonnie Stiernberg questioned whether the editors had made adjustments to the numbered rankings instead of presenting the true results, citing her own experience of helping to compile such lists.<ref name="IH"/> She reported that the list "sparked plenty of debate, angering rockist Boomers and causing cynics to question whether certain albums made the cut because they’re really that great or because they happen to be made by someone who isn’t a white man".<ref name="IH">{{cite web|first=Bonnie|last=Stiernberg|url=https://www.insidehook.com/article/music/rolling-stone-greatest-albums-of-all-time-list-the-answer-is-pointless|title=Does the World Really Need Another 'Greatest Albums of All Time' List?|website=InsideHook|date=September 23, 2020|accessdate=September 28, 2020}}</ref>
