==Career==

Between 1996 and 2000, he was the appointed representative of the UN Secretary General, [[Kofi Annan]], for [[human rights in Cambodia]]. He also participated in the work of the Refugee Working Group of the multilateral Middle East Peace Process.

As Commissioner, Hammarberg regularly conducted visits to promote the respect of human rights in all Council of Europe member states, in accordance with his mandate.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Activities/mandate_en.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709223350/http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Activities/mandate_en.asp |date=July 9, 2010 }}</ref>

==Roma rights==
Thomas Hammarberg is dedicated to strengthening Sinto and Roma rights<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/activities/themes/Roma/RomaRights_en.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117223556/http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/activities/themes/Roma/RomaRights_en.asp |date=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> in Europe, which he believes are “shamefully flawed”. In a number of speeches and statements, Hammarberg actively seeks to improve living conditions for the largest minority in Europe and criticises the alarming levels of [[racism]] directed at these people. Hammarberg paints a clear picture of the situation; for example, in his latest report on Italy he heavily criticises the Italian authorities over their treatment of Sinti and Roma people.

In 2010, Hammarberg published a comprehensive position paper on the human rights situation of [[Sinti]] and Roma, in which he stressed the need for a unified and comprehensive programme aimed at improving the situation, warning that “today's rhetoric against the Roma is alarmingly similar to that used by the Nazis before the mass killings started”.

On 27 February 2012, he published a comprehensive report on the situation of Roma and [[Romani people|travellers]] in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/source/prems/prems79611_GBR_CouvHumanRightsOfRoma_WEB.pdf|format=PDF|title=Human rights of Roma and Travellers in Europe|publisher=Coe.int|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> stressing that in many European countries they are still denied basic human rights and suffer blatant racism.

In a published letter to the German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] dating back to 2009, Hammarberg calls for a halt on deportations to [[Kosovo]] in particular, saying that those deported there are exposed to political persecution and are forced to live in camps. He repeated this “urgent recommendation” one year later in a letter to the then German Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Mazière. A special committee organised by Hammarberg described a Roma camp in Kosovo as “a humanitarian catastrophe”. The Human Rights Commissioner also heavily criticised France’s mass deportation of Roma in 2010.

For his resilience and passion in the question of Roma rights, Thomas Hammarberg has been honoured by the Documentation and Cultural Centre and the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and the Manfred Lautenschlaeger Foundation with the [[European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma]] in Berlin on 3 April 2012.

==Publications==
Hammarberg has published widely on various human rights issues, and particularly on the [[children's rights|rights of the child]], [[right of asylum|refugee policy]], [[minority rights|minority issues]], [[xenophobia]], [[islamophobia]], [[Romani people|Roma]] rights, [[LGBT rights in Europe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/Commissioner/Source/LGBT/LGBTStudy2011_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation  and gender identity in Europe|publisher=Coe.int|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> as well as [[international relations|international affairs]] and [[international security|security]]. He is also well known for his presentations and lectures on human rights at various intergovernmental and academic institutions.
