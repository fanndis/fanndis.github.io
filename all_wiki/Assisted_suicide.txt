'''Assisted suicide''', also known as '''assisted dying''', is [[suicide]] undertaken with the aid of another person.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/15/euthanasia-and-assisted-dying-rates-are-soaring-but-where-are-they-legal|title=Euthanasia and assisted dying rates are soaring. But where are they legal?|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=15 July 2019|work=The Guardian|url-status=live|access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> The term usually refers to '''physician-assisted suicide''' ('''PAS'''), which is suicide that is assisted by a [[physician]] or other healthcare provider. Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a [[Drug prescription|prescription]] for a lethal dose of drugs.

In many jurisdictions, helping a person die by suicide is a [[crime]].<ref name="Assisted Suicide State Laws">{{cite web |url=http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/ |title=Assisted Suicide Laws in the United States |author=Patients Rights Council |date=6 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911025119/http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/ |archivedate=11 September 2017 |accessdate=18 November 2017 }}</ref> People who support legalizing physician-assisted suicide want the people who assist in a voluntary death to be exempt from criminal prosecution for [[manslaughter]] or similar crimes. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including [[Assisted suicide in Canada|Canada]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Colombia]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Assisted suicide in the United States|parts of the United States]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Australia (Victoria)]].<ref name="Attitudes2016"/> In most of those states or countries, to qualify for legal assistance, individuals who seek a physician-assisted suicide must meet certain criteria, including having a [[terminal illness]], proving they are of [[sound mind]], [[informed consent|voluntarily]] and repeatedly expressing their wish to die, and taking a specified, lethal dose of drugs themselves.

==Terminology ==
[[File:Secobarbital DOJ.jpg|thumb|[[Secobarbital]] is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for physician assisted suicide in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hedberg, M.D., MPH.|first1=Katrina |title=Five Years of Legal Physician-Assisted Suicide in Oregon |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=6 March 2003 |volume=348 |issue=10 |pages=961–964 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200303063481022 |pmid=12621146 }}</ref>]]

''[[Suicide]]'' is the act of killing oneself. ''Assisted suicide'' is when another person materially helps an individual person die by suicide, such as providing tools or equipment, while ''Physician-assisted suicide'' involves a physician (doctor) "knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge or means or both required to commit suicide, including counseling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses or supplying the drugs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://policybase.cma.ca/dbtw-wpd/Policypdf/PD07-01.pdf|title=EUTHANASIA AND ASSISTED SUICIDE (UPDATE 2007)|year=2007|publisher=Canadian Medical Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230512/http://policybase.cma.ca/dbtw-wpd/Policypdf/PD07-01.pdf|archivedate=19 December 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Assisted suicide is contrasted to ''[[Euthanasia]]'', sometimes referred to as ''mercy killing'', where the person dying does not directly bring about their own death, but is killed in order to stop the person from experiencing further suffering. Euthanasia can occur with or without [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]], and can be classified as voluntary, non-voluntary or involuntary. Killing a person who is suffering and who consents is called ''[[voluntary euthanasia]]''. This is currently [[Legality of euthanasia|legal in some regions]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What are euthanasia and assisted suicide? |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/182951 |website=Medical News Today |publisher=Medical News Today |accessdate=12 May 2020}}</ref> If the person is unable to provide consent it is referred to as ''[[non-voluntary euthanasia]]''. Killing a person who does not want to die, or who is capable of giving consent and whose consent has not been solicited, is the crime of ''[[involuntary euthanasia]]'', and is regarded as murder.

''[[Right to die]]'' is the belief that people have a right to die, either through various forms of suicide, euthanasia, or refusing life-saving medical treatment.

=== Assisted dying vs assisted suicide ===
Some advocates for assisted suicide strongly oppose the use of "assisted suicide" and "suicide" when referring to physician-assisted suicide, and prefer the phrase "assisted dying". The motivation for this is to distance the debate from the suicides commonly performed by those not terminally ill and not eligible for assistance where it is legal. They feel those cases have negatively impacted the word "suicide" to the point that it bears no relation to the situation where someone who is suffering irremediably seeks a peaceful death.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASSISTED DYING NOT ASSISTED SUICIDE |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/blog-post/assisted-dying-not-assisted-suicide/ |website=Dignity in Dying |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Why medically assisted dying is not suicide |url=https://www.dyingwithdignity.ca/assisted_dying_is_not_suicide |website=Dying with Dignity Canada |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>

===Support===
====Arguments for====
Arguments in support of assisted death include respect for patient autonomy, equal treatment of terminally ill patients on and off life support, compassion, personal liberty, and transparency.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Starks, PhD., MPH. |first1=Helene |title=Physician Aid-in-Dying |url=https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pad.html |website=Physician Aid-in-Dying: Ethics in Medicine |publisher=University of Washington School of Medicine |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> When death is imminent (half a year or less) patients can choose to have assisted death as a medical option to shorten what the person perceives to be an unbearable dying process.

=====Oregon statistics=====
A study of hospice nurses and social workers in Oregon reported that symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety, extreme air hunger and fear of the process of dying were more pronounced among hospice patients who did not request a lethal prescription for barbiturates, the drug used for physician assisted death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ganzini |first1=Linda |last2=Harvath |first2=Theresa A. |last3=Jackson |first3=Ann |last4=Goy |first4=Elizabeth R. |last5=Miller |first5=Lois L. |last6=Delorit |first6=Molly A. |title=Experiences of Oregon Nurses and Social Workers with Hospice Patients Who Requested Assistance with Suicide |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=22 August 2002 |volume=347 |issue=8 |pages=582–588 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa020562 |pmid=12192019 }}</ref>

A Journal of Palliative Medicine report on patterns of hospice use noted that Oregon was in both the highest quartile of hospice use and the lowest quartile of potentially concerning patterns of hospice use. A similar trend was found in Vermont, where aid-in-dying (AiD) was authorized in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shi-Yi |last2=Aldridge |first2=Melissa D. |last3=Gross |first3=Cary P. |last4=Canavan |first4=Maureen |last5=Cherlin |first5=Emily |last6=Johnson-Hurzeler |first6=Rosemary |last7=Bradley |first7=Elizabeth |title=Geographic Variation of Hospice Use Patterns at the End of Life |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine |date=September 2015 |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=771–780 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2014.0425 |pmid=26172615 |pmc=4696438 }}</ref>

In February 2016, Oregon released a report on their 2015 numbers. During 2015, there were 218 people in the state who were approved and received the lethal drugs to end their own life. Of that 218, 132 terminally ill patients ultimately made the decision to ingest drugs, resulting in their death. According to the state of Oregon Public Health Division's survey, the majority of the participants, 78%, were 65 years of age or older and predominately Caucasian, 93.1%. 72% of the terminally ill patients who opted for ending their own lives had been diagnosed with some form of cancer. In the state of Oregon's 2015 survey, they asked the terminally ill who were participating in medical aid in dying, what their biggest end-of-life concerns were: 96.2% of those people mentioned the loss of the ability to participate in activities that once made them enjoy life, 92.4% mentioned the loss of autonomy, or their independence of their own thoughts or actions, and 75.4% stated loss of their dignity.<ref>{{cite web |title=OREGON DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT: 2015 DATA SUMMARY |url=https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year18.pdf |website=State of Oregon |publisher=Oregon Public Health Division |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>

=====Washington State statistics=====
An increasing trend in deaths caused from ingesting lethal doses of medications prescribed by physicians was also noted in Washington: from 64 deaths in 2009 to 202 deaths in 2015.<ref name="ReferenceA">Washington State Department of Health</ref> Among the deceased, 72% had terminal cancer and 8% had neurodegenerative diseases (including ALS).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>


=====U.S. polls=====
Polls conducted by Gallup dating back to 1947 positing the question, "When a person has a disease that cannot be cured, do you think doctors should be allowed to end the patient's life by some painless means if the patient and his family request it?" show support for the practice increasing from 37% in 1947 to a plateau of approximately 75% lasting from approximately 1990 to 2005. When the polling question was modified as such so the question posits "severe pain" as opposed to an incurable disease, "legalization" as opposed to generally allowing doctors, and "patient suicide" rather than physician-administered voluntary euthanasia, public support was substantially lower, by approximately 10% to 15%.<ref name="Attitudes2016"/>

A poll conducted by National Journal and Regence Foundation found that both Oregonians and Washingtonians were more familiar with the terminology "end-of-life care" than the rest of the country and residents of both states are slightly more aware of the terms palliative and hospice care.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Living Well at the End of Life Poll|journal=The National Journal|date=February 2010|url=http://syndication.nationaljournal.com/communications/NationalJournalRegenceSeattleToplines.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2016}}</ref>

A survey from the Journal of Palliative Medicine found that family caregivers of patients who chose assisted death were more likely to find positive meaning in caring for a patient and were more prepared for accepting a patient's death than the family caregivers of patients who didn't request assisted death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ganzini |first1=Linda |last2=Goy |first2=Elizabeth R. |last3=Dobscha |first3=Steven K. |last4=Prigerson |first4=Holly |title=Mental Health Outcomes of Family Members of Oregonians Who Request Physician Aid in Dying |journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management |date=December 2009 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=807–815 |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.04.026 |pmid=19783401 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

====Safeguards====
Many current assisted death laws contain provisions that are intended to provide oversight and investigative processes to prevent abuse. This includes eligibility and qualification processes, mandatory state reporting by the medical team, and medical board oversight. In Oregon and other states, two doctors and two witnesses must assert that a person's request for a lethal prescription wasn't coerced or under undue influence.

These safeguards include proving one's residency and eligibility. The patient must meet with two physicians and they must confirm the diagnoses before one can continue; in some cases, they do include a psychiatric evaluation as well to determine whether or not the patient is making this decision on their own. The next steps are two oral requests, a waiting period of a minimum of 15 days before making the next request. A written request which must be witnessed by two different people, one of which cannot be a family member, and then another waiting period by the patient's doctor in which they say whether they are eligible for the drugs or not ("Death with Dignity").

The debate about whether these safeguards work is debated between opponents and proponents.

====Religious stances====

=====Unitarian Universalism=====
According to a 1988 General Resolution, "[[Unitarian Universalist]]s advocate the right to self-determination in dying, and the release from civil or criminal penalties of those who, under proper safeguards, act to honor the right of terminally ill patients to select the time of their own deaths".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Right to Die with Dignity: 1988 General Resolution|url=http://www.uua.org/statements/right-die-dignity|website=Unitarian Universalist Association|accessdate=4 October 2016|date=24 August 2011}}</ref>

====Medical ethics====
===== Code of Ethics =====
The most current version of the [[American Medical Association]]'s Code of Ethics states that physician-assisted suicide is prohibited. It prohibits physician-assisted suicide because it is "fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer" and because it would be "difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks".&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lagay |first1=F |title=Physician-Assisted Suicide: The Law and Professional Ethics |journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |date=1 January 2003 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2003.5.1.pfor1-0301 |pmid=23267685 }}</ref>

=====Declaration of Geneva=====
The [[Declaration of Geneva]] is a revision of the Hippocratic Oath, first drafted in 1948 by the [[World Medical Association]] in response to forced (involuntary) euthanasia, eugenics and other medical crimes performed in [[Nazi Germany]].

====Concerns of expansion to people with chronic disorders====
{{main|Euthanasia and the slippery slope}}
A concern present among health care professionals who are opposed to PAS, are the detrimental effects that the procedure can have with regard to vulnerable populations. This argument is known as the "[[slippery slope]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/opinion/07douthat.html|title=A More Perfect Death|author=Ross Douthat|date=6 September 2009|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This argument encompasses the apprehension that once PAS is initiated for the terminally ill it will progress to other vulnerable communities, namely the disabled, and may begin to be used by those who feel less worthy based on their demographic or socioeconomic status. In addition, vulnerable populations are more at risk of untimely deaths because, "patients might be subjected to PAS without their genuine consent".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mayo |first1=David J. |last2=Gunderson |first2=Martin |title=Vitalism Revitalized: Vulnerable Populations, Prejudice, and Physician-Assisted Death |journal=The Hastings Center Report |date=July 2002 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2307/3528084 |pmid=12362519 |jstor=3528084 }}</ref>

====Religious stances====
=====Catholicism=====
The Roman Catholic Church acknowledges the fact that moral decisions regarding a person's life must be made according to one's own conscience and faith.<ref name=pmid11655313>{{cite journal |last1=Donovan |first1=G. Kevin |title=Decisions at the End of Life: Catholic Tradition |journal=Christian Bioethics |date=1 December 1997 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=188–203 |doi=10.1093/cb/3.3.188 |pmid=11655313 }}</ref> Catholic tradition has said that one's concern for the suffering of another is not a sufficient reason to decide whether it is appropriate to act upon voluntary euthanasia. According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], "God is the creator and author of all life." In this belief system God created human life, therefore God is the judge when to end life.<ref name=pmid11655313/> From the Roman Catholic Church's perspective, deliberately ending one's life or the life of another is morally wrong and defies the Catholic doctrine. Furthermore, ending one's life deprives that person and his or her loved ones of the time left in life and causes enormous grief and sorrow for those left behind.<ref name=Harvey2016>{{cite journal |last1=Harvey |first1=Kathryn |title=Mercy and Physician-Assisted Suicide |journal=Ethics & Medics |year=2016 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1–2 |url=https://www.ncbcenter.org/files/6714/6315/1150/NCBC_EthicsMedics_June2016.pdf }}</ref>

[[Pope Francis]]<ref>{{Cite we|url=http://www.biography.com/people/pope-francis-21152349|title=Pope Francis Biography}}</ref> is the current dominant figure of the Catholic Church. He affirms that death is a glorious event and should not be decided for by anyone other than God. Pope Francis insinuates that defending life means defending its sacredness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cherry |first1=Mark J. |title=Pope Francis, Weak Theology, and the Subtle Transformation of Roman Catholic Bioethics |journal=Christian Bioethics |date=6 February 2015 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=84–88 |doi=10.1093/cb/cbu045 }}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church teaches its followers that the act of euthanasia is unacceptable because it is perceived as a sin, as it goes against the Ten Commandments, [[Ten Commandments in Catholic theology|"Thou shalt not kill. (You shall not kill)"]] As implied by the fifth commandment, the act of assisted suicide contradicts the dignity of human life as well as the respect one has for God.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-Catholicism|title=Roman Catholicism|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref>

As an alternative to the physician-assisted suicide and in order to alleviate pain, the Catholic Church proposes that terminally ill patients focus on religion and making peace with the Creator while receiving the love and mercy of their families and caregivers.<ref name=Harvey2016/> Additionally, the Roman Catholic Church recommends that terminally ill patients should receive palliative care, which deals with physical pain while treating psychological and spiritual suffering as well, instead of physician-assisted suicide.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yao |first1=Teresa |title=Can We Limit a Right to Physician-Assisted Suicide? |journal=The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly |date=2016 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=385–392 |doi=10.5840/ncbq201616336 }}</ref>

=====Judaism=====
While preservation of life is one of the greatest values in [[Judaism]], there are instances of suicide and assisted suicide appearing in the [[Bible]] and [[Rabbinic literature]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Samuel 1:31:4–5, Daat Zekeinim Baalei Hatosfot Genesis 9:5}}</ref> The medieval authorities debate the legitimacy of those measures and in what limited circumstances they might apply. The conclusion of the majority of later rabbinic authorities, and accepted normative practice within Judaism, is that suicide and assisted suicide can not be sanctioned even for a terminal patient in intractable pain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Dr. Abraham|title=Encyclopedia Hilchatit Refuit|date=1988|publisher=Shaarei Zedek Hospital|location=Jerusalem|page=Vol. 1 Pg. 15}}</ref>

=====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints=====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is against euthanasia. Anyone who takes part in euthanasia, including "assisted suicide", is regarded as having violated the commandments of God.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies-and-guidelines/selected-church-policies|title=Handbook 2: Administering the Church – 21.3 Medical and Health Policies|publisher= Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref> However the church recognizes that when a person is in the final stages of terminal illness there may be difficult decisions to be taken. The church states that 'When dying becomes inevitable, death should be looked upon as a blessing and a purposeful part of an eternal existence. Members should not feel obligated to extend mortal life by means that are unreasonable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/official-statement/euthanasia-and-prolonging-life|title=Euthanasia and Prolonging Life|work=LDS News}}</ref>

===Neutrality===
There have been calls for organisations representing medical professionals to take a neutral stance on assisted dying, rather than a position of opposition. The reasoning is that this would better reflect the views of medical professionals and that of wider society, and prevent those bodies from exerting undue influence over the debate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Godlee |first1=Fiona |title=Assisted dying: it's time to poll UK doctors |journal=BMJ |date=8 February 2018 |pages=k593 |doi=10.1136/bmj.k593 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='Neutrality' on assisted suicide is a step forward |url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/archive/neutrality-on-assisted-suicide-is-a-step-forward-31-07-2009/ |website=Nursing Times |accessdate=30 December 2018|date=31 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The case for neutrality on assisted dying — a personal view |journal=The British Journal of General Practice |volume=62 |issue=605 |pages=650 |pmc=3505400 |year=2012 |last1=Gerada |first1=C. |pmid=23211247 |doi=10.3399/bjgp12X659376 }}</ref>

The UK [[Royal College of Nursing]] voted in July 2009 to move to a neutral position on assisted dying.<ref>{{cite web |title=RCN Position statement on assisted dying |url=https://www.rcn.org.uk/-/media/royal-college-of-nursing/documents/policies-and-briefings/uk-wide/policies/2014/2314.pdf |website=Royal College of Nursing}}</ref>

The [[California Medical Association]] dropped its long-standing opposition in 2015 during the debate over whether an assisted dying bill should be introduced there, prompted in part by cancer sufferer [[Brittany Maynard]].<ref>{{cite news |title=California Medical Association drops opposition to doctor-assisted suicide |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-assistedsuicide-california-idUSKBN0O52TI20150520 |accessdate=21 December 2018|newspaper=Reuters |date=20 May 2015 }}</ref> The [[California End of Life Option Act]] was signed into law later that year.

In December 2017, the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] (MMS) voted to repeal their opposition to physician-assisted suicide and adopt a position of neutrality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Medical Society adopts several organizational policies at Interim Meeting |url=http://www.massmed.org/News-and-Publications/MMS-News-Releases/Massachusetts-Medical-Society-adopts-several-organizational-policies-at-Interim-Meeting/#.W8ccpWhKiUk |website=Massachusetts Medical Society |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>

In October 2018, the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP) voted to adopt a position of neutrality from one of opposition.

In January 2019 the British [[Royal College of Physicians]] announced it would adopt a position of neutrality until two-thirds of its members thinks it should either support or oppose the legalisation of assisted dying.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doctors to be asked if they would help terminally ill patients die |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/health/doctors-asked-would-help-terminally-15670817 |accessdate=14 January 2019 |publisher=Chronicle Live}}</ref>

===Attitudes of healthcare professionals===
It is widely acknowledged that physicians must play some role in the process of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia (as evident in the name "physician-assisted suicide"), often putting them at the forefront of the issue. Decades of opinion research shows that physicians in the US and several European countries are less supportive of legalization of PAS than the general public.<ref name="seale" /> In the US, although "about two-thirds of the American public since the 1970s" have supported legalization, surveys of physicians "rarely show as much as half supporting a move".<ref name="seale" /> However, physician and other healthcare professional opinions vary widely on the issue of physician-assisted suicide, as shown in the following tables.

Attitudes toward PAS vary by health profession as well; an extensive survey of 3733 medical physicians was sponsored by the National Council for Palliative Care, Age Concern, Help the Hospices, Macmillan Cancer Support, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the MS Society and Sue Ryder Care showed that opposition to voluntary euthanasia and PAS was highest among Palliative Care and Care of the Elderly specialists, with more than 90% of palliative care specialists against a change in the law.<ref name=seale>{{cite journal | author = Seale C | title = Legalisation of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide: survey of doctors' attitudes | journal = Palliat Med | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–12 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19318460 | doi = 10.1177/0269216308102041 | s2cid = 43547476 }}</ref>

In a 1997 study by Glasgow University's Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine found pharmacists (72%) and anaesthetists (56%) to be generally in favor of legalizing PAS.

Laws regarding assisted suicide in [[Australia]] are a matter for [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]], and in the case of the territories, the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. Physician-assisted suicide is currently legal in the state of Victoria<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.sbs.com.au/news/voluntary-euthanasia-is-now-legal-in-victoria |title = Voluntary euthanasia is now legal in Victoria }}</ref> and Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-10/voluntary-euthanasia-becomes-law-in-wa-in-emotional-scenes/11784828|title=Voluntary euthanasia becomes law in WA in emotional scenes at Parliament|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=7 November 2020|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> In all other states and territories it remains illegal.

Under Victorian law, patients can ask medical practitioners regarding voluntary assisted dying, and doctors, including conscientious objectors, should refer to appropriately trained colleagues who do not conscientiously object.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/hospitals-and-health-services/patient-care/end-of-life-care/voluntary-assisted-dying/health-practitioner-information |title = Health practitioner information on voluntary assisted dying }}</ref> Health practitioners are restricted from initiating conversation or suggesting voluntary assisted dying to a patient unprompted.

Voluntary euthanasia was legal in the [[Northern Territory]] for a short time under the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]], until this law was overturned by the Federal Government who also removed the ability for territories to pass legislation relating to assisted dying. The highly controversial 'Euthanasia Machine', the first invented voluntary assisted dying machine of its kind, created by [[Philip Nitschke]], utilised during this period is presently held at [[London]]'s [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/search?q=%22euthanasia%20machine%22 |title = Euthanasia machine, Australia, 1995-1996 }}</ref>

In May 2011, Zhong Yichun, a farmer, was sentenced two years' imprisonment by the People's Court of Longnan County, in China's Jiangxi Province for assisting Zeng Qianxiang to commit suicide. Zeng suffered from mental illness and repeatedly asked Zhong to help him commit suicide. In October 2010, Zeng took excessive sleeping pills and lay in a cave. As planned, Zhong called him 15 minutes later to confirm that he was dead and buried him. However, according to the autopsy report, the cause of death was from suffocation, not an overdose. Zhong was convicted of criminal negligence. In August 2011, Zhong appealed the court sentence, but it was rejected.<ref name="glm" />

In 1992, a physician was accused of murdering a patient with advanced cancer by lethal injection. He was eventually acquitted.<ref name="glm" />

===Colombia===
In May 1997 the Colombian Constitutional Court allowed for the voluntary euthanasia of sick patients who requested to end their lives, by passing Article 326 of the 1980 Penal Code.<ref name="McDougall 2008">{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008}}</ref> This ruling owes its success to the efforts of a group that strongly opposed voluntary euthanasia. When one of its members brought a lawsuit to the Colombian Supreme Court against it, the court issued a 6 to 3 decision that "spelled out the rights of a terminally ill person to engage in voluntary euthanasia".<ref>{{cite book | last = Whiting | first = Raymond | title = A Natural Right to Die: Twenty-Three Centuries of Debate | year = 2002 | location = Westport, Connecticut | pages = [https://archive.org/details/naturalrighttodi00whit/page/n51 41] | url =https://archive.org/details/naturalrighttodi00whit| url-access = limited }}</ref>

In February 2015, the Supreme Court gave the government 30 days to create a comprehensive set of guidelines for doctors, to assist them in avoiding breaches of the law, as although technically legal, many physicians face lawsuits where they must prove that all legal requirements were met prior to the procedure. This fear of legal action has led many doctors to refuse to perform the procedure, in spite of its legality.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Sabrina|title=Colombia to Finalize Euthanasia Law in March|url=http://panampost.com/sabrina-martin/2015/02/19/colombia-to-finalize-euthanasia-law-in-march/|website=PanAm Post|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=19 February 2015}}</ref>

===Denmark===
Assisted suicide is illegal in Denmark. Passive euthanasia, or the refusal to accept treatment, is not illegal. One survey found that 71% of Denmark's population was in favor of legalizing voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nielsen |first1=Morten Ebbe Juul |last2=Andersen |first2=Martin Marchman |title=Bioethics in Denmark |journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |date=27 May 2014 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=326–333 |doi=10.1017/S0963180113000935 |pmid=24867435 |url=https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/137621427/bioethicsindenmarkprepub.pdf }}</ref>

===France===
Assisted suicide is not legal in France. The controversy over legalising voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is not as big as in the United States because of the country's "well developed [[hospice]] care programme".<ref name="McDougall 2008 84">{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=84}}</ref> However, in 2000 the controversy over the topic was ignited with Vincent Humbert. After a car crash that left him "unable to 'walk, see, speak, smell or taste'", he used the movement of his right thumb to write a book, ''I Ask the Right to Die (Je vous demande le droit de mourir)'' in which he voiced his desire to "die legally".<ref name="McDougall 2008 84"/> After his appeal was denied, his mother assisted in killing him by injecting him with an overdose of barbiturates that put him into a [[coma]], killing him two days later. Though his mother was arrested for aiding in her son's death and later acquitted, the case did jump-start new [[legislation]] which states that when medicine serves "no other purpose than the artificial support of life" it can be "suspended or not undertaken".<ref>{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=86}}</ref>

===Germany===
Killing somebody in accordance with their demands is always illegal under the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German criminal code]] (Paragraph 216, "Killing at the request of the victim; mercy killing").<ref>{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P216
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Assisting suicide is generally legal. Since suicide itself is legal, assistance or encouragement is not punishable by the usual legal mechanisms dealing with complicity and incitement (German criminal law follows the idea of "accessories of complicity" which states that "the motives of a person who incites another person to commit suicide, or who assists in its commission, are irrelevant").<ref name=Wolfslast2008>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6496-8_8 |chapter=Physician-Assisted Suicide and the German Criminal Law |title=Giving Death a Helping Hand |series=International Library of Ethics, Law, and the New Medicine |year=2008 |last1=Wolfslast |first1=Gabriele |volume=38 |pages=87–95 |isbn=978-1-4020-6495-1 }}</ref> Nor is assisting with suicide explicitly outlawed by the criminal code. There can however be legal repercussions under certain conditions for a number of reasons. Aside from laws regulating firearms, the trade and handling of controlled substances and the like (e.g. when acquiring poison for the suicidal person), this concerns three points:

====Free vs. manipulated will====
If the suicidal person is not acting out of his own free will, then assistance is punishable by any of a number of homicide offences that the criminal code provides for, as having "acted through another person" (§25, section 1 of the German criminal code,<ref>{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P25
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> usually called "mittelbare Täterschaft"). Action out of free will is not ruled out by the decision to end one's life in itself; it can be assumed as long as a suicidal person "decides on his own fate up to the end [...] and is in control of the situation".<ref name=Wolfslast2008/>

Free will cannot be assumed, however, if someone is manipulated or deceived. A classic textbook example for this, in German law, is the so-called ''Sirius'' case on which the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] ruled in 1983: The accused had convinced an acquaintance that she would be reincarnated into a better life if she killed herself. She unsuccessfully attempted suicide, leading the accused to be charged with, and eventually convicted of attempted murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejura-examensexpress.de/online-kurs/entsch_show_neu.php?Alp=1&dok_id=2885|title=BGH Urteil vom 05.07.1983 (1 StR 168/83)|work=ejura-examensexpress.de|access-date=22 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224071215/http://www.ejura-examensexpress.de/online-kurs/entsch_show_neu.php?Alp=1|archive-date=24 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> (The accused had also convinced the acquaintance that he hailed from the star [[Sirius]], hence the name of the case).

Apart from manipulation, the criminal code states three conditions under which a person is not acting under his own free will:

# if the person is under 14
# if the person has "one of the mental diseases listed in §20 of the German Criminal Code"<ref name=Wolfslast2008/>
# a person that is acting under a state of emergency.

Under these circumstances, even if colloquially speaking one might say a person is acting of his own free will, a conviction of murder is possible.

====Neglected duty to rescue====
German criminal law obliges everybody to come to the rescue of others in an emergency, within certain limits (§323c of the German criminal code, "Omission to effect an easy rescue").<ref>{{cite web
| title = German Criminal Code
| publisher = German Federal Ministry of Justice
| url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGB_000P323c
|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> This is also known as a [[duty to rescue]] in English. Under this rule, the party assisting in the suicide can be convicted if, in finding the suicidal person in a state of [[unconsciousness]], they do not do everything in their power to revive the subject.<ref name=Wolfslast2008/> In other words, if someone assists a person in committing suicide, leaves, but comes back and finds the person unconscious, they must try to revive them.<ref name=Wolfslast2008/>

This reasoning is disputed by legal scholars, citing that a life-threatening condition that is part, so to speak, of a suicide underway, is not an emergency. For those who would rely on that defence, the Federal Court of Justice has considered it an emergency in the past.

====Homicide by omission====
German law puts certain people in the position of a warrantor (Garantenstellung) for the well-being of another, e.g. parents, spouses, doctors and police officers. Such people might find themselves legally bound to do what they can to prevent a suicide; if they do not, they are guilty of homicide by omission.

====Travel to Switzerland====
Between 1998 and 2018 around 1250 German citizens (almost three times the number of any other nationality) travelled to [[Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)|Dignitas]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] for an assisted suicide, where this has been legal since 1918.<ref name=Statistiken>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32&Itemid=72&lang=de |title = Statistiken}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref name=pmid12560284>{{cite journal |last1=Hurst |first1=Samia A |last2=Mauron |first2=Alex |title=Assisted suicide and euthanasia in Switzerland: allowing a role for non-physicians |journal=BMJ |date=1 February 2003 |volume=326 |issue=7383 |pages=271–273 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7383.271 |pmid=12560284 |pmc=1125125 }}</ref> Switzerland being one of the few countries that permits assisted suicide for non-resident foreigners.<ref name="assistedsuicide.org">{{Cite web | url=http://www.assistedsuicide.org/suicide_laws.html | title=Assisted Suicide Laws Around the World - Assisted Suicide}}</ref>

The Netherlands allows people over the age of 12 to pursue an assisted suicide when deemed necessary.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Euthanasia in New Zealand}}

Assisted suicide was decriminalised after a binding referendum on New Zealand's [[End of Life Choices Act 2019]]. However, the legislation provides a year long delay before it takes effect on 6 November 2021.  Under Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961, it is illegal to 'aid and abet suicide' and this will remain the case outside the framework established under the End of Life Choices Act. 

===South Africa===
South Africa is struggling with the debate over legalizing voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Owing to the underdeveloped health care system that pervades the majority of the country, Willem Landman, "a member of the South African Law Commission, at a symposium on euthanasia at the World Congress of Family Doctors" stated that many South African doctors would be willing to perform acts of voluntary euthanasia when it became legalized in the country.<ref name="McDougall 2008 80">{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=80}}</ref> He feels that because of the lack of doctors in the country, "[legalizing] euthanasia in South Africa would be premature and difficult to put into practice [...]".<ref name="McDougall 2008 80" />

On 30 April 2015 the High Court in [[Pretoria]] granted Advocate Robin Stransham-Ford an order that would allow a doctor to assist him in taking his own life without the threat of prosecution. On 6 December 2016 the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the High Court ruling.<ref name="News24">{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sca-overturns-right-to-die-ruling-20161206 |title= SCA overturns right-to-die ruling |publisher=News24 |date=6 December 2015 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>

Though it is illegal to assist a patient in dying in some circumstances, there are others where there is no offence committed.<ref name="UZ">{{cite journal| last=Schwarzenegger| first=Christian| author2=Summers, Sarah J.| date=3 February 2005| title=Hearing with the Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill| journal=House of Lords Hearings| publisher=[[University of Zürich]] Faculty of Law| location=Zürich| url=http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf| access-date=1 July 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004544/http://www.rwi.uzh.ch/lehreforschung/alphabetisch/schwarzenegger/publikationen/assisted-suicide-Switzerland.pdf| archive-date=7 July 2011| url-status=dead}} (PDF)</ref> The relevant provision of the Swiss Criminal Code<ref name="SC">{{cite journal |date=23 June 1989| title=Inciting and assisting someone to commit suicide (Verleitung und Beihilfe zum Selbstmord) |journal=Swiss Criminal Code| pages=Article 115 |publisher=Süisse| language=German |location=Zürich}}</ref> refers to "a person who, for selfish reasons, incites someone to commit suicide or who assists that person in doing so will, if the suicide was carried out or attempted, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (''Zuchthaus'') of up to 5 years or a term of imprisonment (''Gefängnis'')."

A person brought to court on a charge could presumably avoid conviction by proving that they were "motivated by the good intentions of bringing about a requested death for the purposes of relieving "[[suffering]]" rather than for "selfish" reasons.<ref>{{cite book | last = Whiting | first = Raymond | title = A Natural Right to Die: Twenty-Three Centuries of Debate | year = 2002 | location = Westport, Connecticut | pages = [https://archive.org/details/naturalrighttodi00whit/page/n56 46] | url =https://archive.org/details/naturalrighttodi00whit| url-access = limited }}</ref> In order to avoid conviction, the person has to prove that the deceased knew what he or she was doing, had capacity to make the decision, and had made an "earnest" request, meaning they asked for death several times. The person helping also has to avoid actually doing the act that leads to death, lest they be convicted under Article 114: Killing on request (Tötung auf Verlangen) -
A person who, for decent reasons, especially compassion, kills a person on the basis of his or her serious and insistent request, will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment (Gefängnis).

Switzerland is one of only a handful of countries in the world which permits assisted suicide for non-resident foreigners,<ref name="assistedsuicide.org"/> causing what some critics have described as [[suicide tourism]]. Between 1998 and 2018 around 1'250 German citizens (almost three times the number of any other nationality) travelled to [[Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)|Dignitas]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] for an assisted suicide. During the same period over 400 British citizens also opted to end their life at the same clinic.<ref name=Statistiken/><ref name=pmid12560284/>

In May 2011, [[Zurich]] held a referendum that asked voters whether (i) assisted suicide should be prohibited outright; and (ii) whether Dignitas and other assisted suicide providers should not admit overseas users. Zurich voters heavily rejected both bans, despite anti-euthanasia lobbying from two Swiss [[social conservative]] political parties, the [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland]] and [[Federal Democratic Union]]. The outright ban proposal was rejected by 84% of voters, while 78% voted to keep services open should overseas users require them.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swiss vote backs assisted suicide |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13405376 |work=BBC News |date=15 May 2011 }}</ref>

In Switzerland non-physician-assisted suicide is legal, the assistance mostly being provided by volunteers, whereas in Belgium and the Netherlands, a physician must be present. In Switzerland, the doctors are primarily there to assess the patient's decision capacity and prescribe the lethal drugs. Additionally, unlike cases in the United States, a person is not required to have a terminal illness but only the capacity to make decisions. About 25% of people in Switzerland who take advantage of assisted suicide do not have a terminal illness but are simply old or "tired of life".<ref name="Andorno 246–253">{{cite journal |last1=Andorno |first1=Roberto |title=Nonphysician-Assisted Suicide in Switzerland |journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |date=30 April 2013 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=246–253 |doi=10.1017/S0963180113000054 |pmid=23632255 |url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/92579/1/Andorno_Cambridge_Quarterly_3_2013.pdf }}</ref>

====Publicized cases====
In January 2006 British doctor Anne Turner took her own life in a Zurich clinic having developed an incurable degenerative disease. Her story was reported by the BBC and later, in 2009, made into a TV film ''[[A Short Stay in Switzerland]]'' starring [[Julie Walters]].

In July 2009, British conductor Sir [[Edward Downes]] and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich "under circumstances of their own choosing". Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.<ref name="CB1">{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887 |title=YOUthanasia |last=Lundin |first=Leigh |date=2 August 2009 |publisher=Criminal Brief |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

In March 2010, the PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|FRONTLINE]] TV program in the United States showed a documentary called "The Suicide Tourist" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]], and their decision to commit assisted suicide using [[Pentobarbital|sodium pentobarbital]] in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (Lou Gehrig's disease).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/|title=The Suicide Tourist - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org}}</ref>

In June 2011, The BBC televised the assisted suicide of Peter Smedley, a canning factory owner, who was suffering from motor neurone disease. The programme – ''Sir Terry Pratchett's Choosing To Die'' – told the story of Peter's journey to the end where he used The Dignitas Clinic, a voluntary euthanasia clinic in Switzerland, to assist him in carrying out the taking of his own life.
The programme shows Peter eating chocolates to counter the unpalatable taste of the liquid he drinks to end his own life. Moments after drinking the liquid, Peter begged for water, gasped for breath and became red, he then fell into a deep sleep where he snored heavily while holding his wife's hand. Minutes later, Peter stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating.

Assisted suicide, while criminal, does not appear to have caused any convictions, as article 37 of the Penal Code (effective 1934) states: "The judges are authorized to forego punishment of a person whose previous life has been honorable where he commits a homicide motivated by compassion, induced by repeated requests of the victim."<ref>{{cite web|last1=del Uruguay|first1=Republica Oriental|title=Penal Code of Uruguay|url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm|website=Parliament of Uruguay|accessdate=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730062858/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm|archive-date=30 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2014 [[Lord Falconer]] of Thoroton tabled an Assisted Dying Bill in the House of Lords which passed its Second Reading but ran out of time before the General Election. During its passage peers voted down two amendments which were proposed by opponents of the Bill. In 2015 Labour MP [[Rob Marris]] introduced another Bill, based on the Falconer proposals, in the House of Commons. The Second Reading was the first time the House was able to vote on the issue since 1997. A Populus poll had found that 82% of the British public agreed with the proposals of Lord Falconer's Assisted Dying Bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Dignity-in-Dying-Poll-March-2015-WEBSITE-DATATABLES.pdf|title=Dignity in Dying Poll|date=2015|work=Populus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617124821/http://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Dignity-in-Dying-Poll-March-2015-WEBSITE-DATATABLES.pdf|archivedate= 17 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, in a free vote on 11 September 2015, only 118 MPs were in favour and 330 against, thus defeating the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34208624|title=Assisted Dying Bill: MPs reject 'right to die' law|authors=James Gallagher & Philippa Roxby|date=11 September 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>

====Scotland====
Unlike the other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom, suicide was not illegal in Scotland before 1961 (and still is not) thus no associated offences were created in imitation. Depending on the actual nature of any assistance given to a suicide, the offences of [[murder]] or [[culpable homicide]] might be committed or there might be no offence at all; the nearest modern prosecutions bearing comparison might be those where a culpable homicide conviction has been obtained when drug addicts have died unintentionally after being given "hands on" non-medical assistance with an injection. Modern law regarding the assistance of someone who intends to die has a lack of certainty as well as a lack of relevant case law; this has led to attempts to introduce statutes providing more certainty.

Independent MSP Margo MacDonald's "End of Life Assistance Bill" was brought before the Scottish Parliament to permit physician-assisted suicide in January 2010. The [[Catholic]] Church and the [[Church of Scotland]], the largest denomination in Scotland, opposed the bill. The bill was rejected by a vote of 85–16 (with 2 abstentions) in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/38-EndLifeAssist/index.htm |title=End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill (SP Bill 38) |date=21 January 2010 |publisher=The Scottish Parliament |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11876821 |title=Margo MacDonald's End of Life Assistance Bill rejected |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |date=1 December 2010}}</ref>

{{anchor|ASSB}} The Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 13 November 2013 by the late [[Margo MacDonald]] MSP and was taken up by [[Patrick Harvie]] MSP on Ms MacDonald's death. The Bill entered the main committee scrutiny stage in January 2015 and reached a vote in Parliament several months later; however the bill was again rejected.

====Northern Ireland====
Health is a [[devolved matter]] in the United Kingdom and as such it would be for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to legislate for assisted dying as it sees fit. As of 2018, there has been no such bill tabled in the Assembly.

====Assisted Dying Coalition====
A coalition of assisted dying organizations working in favour of legal recognition of the right to die was formed in early 2019.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://assisteddying.org.uk/about/ |title = About Us – Assisted Dying Coalition}}</ref>

In [[Montana]], the Montana Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'' (2009) that it found no law or public policy reason that would prohibit physician-assisted dying.<ref name="2009 MT 449"/> Oregon and Washington specify some restrictions. It was briefly legal in [[New Mexico]] from 2014, but this verdict was overturned in 2015. [[Maine]] is the most recent state that has legalized physician-assisted suicide, with a bill passed by the state assembly in June and approved by the Governor on 12 June 2019. The law went into legal effect on 1 January 2020.

Oregon requires a physician to prescribe drugs and they must be self-administered. In order to be eligible, the patient must be diagnosed by an attending physician as well as by a consulting physician, with a terminal illness that will cause the death of the individual within six months. The law states that, in order to participate, a patient must be: 1) 18 years of age or older, 2) a resident of Oregon, 3) capable of making and communicating health care decisions for him/herself, and 4) diagnosed with a terminal illness that will lead to death within six months. It is up to the attending physician to determine whether these criteria have been met.<ref name="FAQ DWDA"/> It is required the patient orally request the medication at least twice and contribute at least one (1) written request. The physician must notify the patient of alternatives; such as palliative care, hospice and pain management. Lastly the physician is to request but not require the patient to notify their next of kin that they are requesting a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Assuming all guidelines are met and the patient is deemed competent and completely sure they wish to end their life, the physician will prescribe the drugs.<ref name="euthanasia.procon.org">{{cite web|url=http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000132|title=State-by-State Guide to Physician-Assisted Suicide - Euthanasia - ProCon.org|work=procon.org}}</ref>

The law was passed in 1997. As of 2013, a total of 1,173 people had DWDA prescriptions written and 752 patients had died from ingesting drugs prescribed under the DWDA.<ref name=DWDA2013>{{cite web|title=Oregon Public Health Division – 2013 DWDA Report|url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year16.pdf|publisher=Oregon Health Authority|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> In 2013, there were approximately 22 assisted deaths per 10,000 total deaths in Oregon.<ref name=DWDA2013/>

Washington's rules and restrictions are similar, if not exactly the same, as Oregon's. Not only does the patient have to meet the above criteria, they also have to be examined by not one, but two doctors licensed in their state of residence. Both doctors must come to the same conclusion about the patient's prognosis. If one doctor does not see the patient fit for the prescription, then the patient must undergo psychological inspection to tell whether or not the patient is in fact capable and mentally fit to make the decision of assisted death or not.<ref name="euthanasia.procon.org"/>

In May 2013, Vermont became the fourth state in the union to legalize medical aid-in-dying. Vermont's House of Representatives voted 75–65 to approve the bill, Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act. This bill states that the qualifying patient must be at least 18, a Vermont resident and suffering from an incurable and irreversible disease, with less than six months to live. Also, two physicians, including the prescribing doctor must make the medical determination.<ref>Sullivan, Nora. "Vermont Legislature Passes Assisted Suicide Bill." Charlotte Lozier Institute RSS. Charlotte Lozier Institute, 15 May 2013. Web. 4 December 2013.</ref>

However, this was overturned on 11 August 2015 by the New Mexico Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling, that overturned the Bernalillo County District Court Ruling. The Court gave the verdict: "We conclude that aid in dying is not a fundamental liberty interest under the New Mexico Constitution".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Valerie|title=New Mexico court strikes down ruling that allowed assisted suicide|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/11/assisted-suicide-new-mexico-ruling-struck-higher-c/|website=Washington Times|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>

In November 2016, the citizens of [[Colorado]] approved Proposition 106, the Colorado End of Life Options Act, with 65% in favor. This made it the third state to legalize medical aid-in-dying by a vote of the people, raising the total to six states.

The punishment for participating in physician-assisted death (PAD) varies throughout many states. The state of Wyoming does not "recognize common law crimes and does not have a statute specifically prohibiting physician-assisted suicide". In Florida, "every person deliberately assisting another in the commission of self-murder shall be guilty of manslaughter, a felony of the second degree".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patientsrightscouncil.org/site/assisted-suicide-state-laws/|title=Assisted Suicide Laws in the United States {{!}} Patients Rights Council|website=www.patientsrightscouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=17 October 2017}}</ref>

==== Brittany Maynard ====
A highly publicized case in the United States was the death of [[Brittany Maynard]] in 2014. After being diagnosed with terminal [[brain cancer]], Maynard decided that instead of suffering with the side effects the cancer would bring, she wanted to choose when she would die. She was residing in California when she was diagnosed, where assisted death was not legal. She and her husband moved to Oregon where assisted death was legal, so she could take advantage of the program. Before her death, she started the Brittany Maynard fund, which works to legalize the choice of ending one's life in cases of a terminal illness. Her public advocacy motivated her family to continue to try and get assisted death laws passed in all 50 states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebrittanyfund.org/about/|title=The Brittany Fund {{!}} About|website=thebrittanyfund.org|access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

=== Television ===
In the American television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', physician-assisted suicide is mentioned multiple times. In "[[Known Unknowns]]", [[James Wilson (House)|Dr. Wilson]], an oncologist, reveals he indirectly provided a patient dying from cancer the code to increase his morphine level to a lethal amount leading to the patient's death. In "[[The Dig (House)|The Dig]]", [[Thirteen (House)|Thirteen]] reveals she assisted her brother in his suicide who was suffering from advanced symptoms of [[Huntington's disease]] and that was she was sent to prison for overprescribing. In the same episode, [[Gregory House|House]] promises to assist her in killing herself once her own Huntington's symptoms get too bad.

In an episode of [[Emmerdale]] there is a case of assisted suicide. One of the characters of the series, [[Jackson Walsh]], remains quadriplegic because of an accident and he has been told he will never walk again. He has expressed his desire to die, and his mate [[Aaron Dingle]] reluctantly helps him committing suicide. 

[[Star Trek]] mentions at least three times a case of assisted suicide. In a movie, [[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]], it is revealed that [[Leonard McCoy]] helped his father commit suicide because of a terminal illness. It has been revealed that, some time later, there had been found a cure, and this caused McCoy a psychological pain he will have for many decades. In an episode of [[Star Trek: Voyager]], "Death Wish", there was a member of the Q Continuum who wanted to commit suicide because of the sufferance he'd experienced from his state of immortality. Q, inspired by this person's courage and coherence, later helped him commit suicide.
