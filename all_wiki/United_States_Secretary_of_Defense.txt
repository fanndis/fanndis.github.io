The '''secretary of defense''' ('''SecDef''') is the leader and [[chief executive officer]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]], the [[Executive Department|executive department]] of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] of the U.S.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}}.</ref><ref name="5100.1">[[#5100.1|DoDD 5100.1]]: Enclosure 2: a</ref><ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|5|101}}.</ref> The secretary of defense's position of command and authority over the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] is second only to that of the [[President of the United States|president]].

The secretary of defense is a [[United States federal law|statutory office]], and the general provision in {{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}} provides that "subject to the direction of the President", its occupant has "authority, direction and control over the Department of Defense". The same statute further designates the secretary as "the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense".<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}}</ref> To ensure [[civilian control of the military]], no one may be appointed as the secretary of defense within seven years of serving as a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] of a regular (i.e., non-[[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve]]) component of an [[Military of the United States|armed force]].<ref>The [[National Security Act of 1947]] originally required an interval of ten years after relief from active duty, which was reduced to seven years by Sec. 903(a) of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008|2008 National Defense Authorization Act]]. In 1950 Congress passed special legislation (Pub. Law 81-788) to allow [[George C. Marshall]] to serve as Secretary of Defense while remaining a commissioned officer on the active list of the Army (Army regulations kept all [[General of the Army (United States)|five-star generals]] on active duty for life), but warned:

<blockquote>It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense in the future. It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of Secretary of Defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.</blockquote>

Subject only to the orders of the president, the secretary of defense is in the [[chain of command]] and exercises [[command and control]], for both operational and administrative purposes, over all Department of Defense forces – the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Space Force|Space Force]] – as well as the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] when its command and control is transferred to the Department of Defense.<ref name="UnitedStatesCode|10|162">{{UnitedStatesCode|10|162}}</ref><ref name="JP1:II9-11">[[#JP1|Joint Publication 1]]: II-9, II-10 & II-11.</ref><ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|3011}}</ref><ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|5011}}</ref><ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|8011}}</ref> Only the secretary of defense (or the president or Congress) can authorize the transfer of operational control of forces between the three military departments (the departments of the [[United States Department of the Army|Army]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]], and [[United States Department of the Air Force|Air Force]]) and the 10 [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]] ([[United States Africa Command|Africa Command]], [[United States Central Command|Central Command]], [[United States European Command|European Command]], [[United States Indo-Pacific Command|Indo-Pacific Command]], [[United States Northern Command|Northern Command]], [[United States Southern Command|Southern Command]], [[United States Cyber Command|Cyber Command]], [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]], [[United States Strategic Command|Strategic Command]], [[United States Transportation Command|Transportation Command]]).<ref name="UnitedStatesCode|10|162"/> Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers that exceed those of any [[commissioned officer]], and is second only to the president in the military hierarchy, its incumbent has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a ''[[de facto]]'' "deputy [[commander-in-chief]]".<ref name="DoD50:11-52">[[#DoD50|Trask & Goldberg]]: pp.11 & 52</ref><ref name="SupCom:231">[[#SupCom|Cohen]]: p.231.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2006/10/31/2215/rumsfelds-management-failures/|title=Rumsfeld's Management Failures|last1=Korb|first1=Lawrence J.|last2=Ogden|first2=Pete|date=2006-10-31|website=Center for American Progress|language=en-US|access-date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> The [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] is the principal military adviser to the secretary of defense and the president; while the chairman may assist the secretary and president in their command functions, the chairman is not in the chain of command.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|10|152}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:National Military Establishment seal 1947-1949.png|thumb|Seal of the [[National Military Establishment]] (1947–1949), which was reorganized into the Department of Defense.]]
An Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were established in 1775, in concurrence with the [[American Revolution]]. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]], headed by the [[United States Secretary of War|secretary of war]], was created by [[Act of Congress]] in 1789 and was responsible for both the Army and Navy until the founding of a separate [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] in 1798.

Based on the experiences of [[World War II]], proposals were soon made on how to more effectively manage the large combined military establishment. The Army generally favored centralization while the Navy had institutional preferences for decentralization and the status quo. The resulting [[National Security Act of 1947]] was largely a compromise between these divergent viewpoints. It renamed the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] the [[Department of the Army]], and added both it and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] to a newly established [[National Military Establishment]] (NME). The Act also separated the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] from the Army to become its own branch of service, the [[United States Air Force]].

A new title was coined by the Act for the head of the NME: Secretary of Defense. At first, each of the service secretaries maintained cabinet status. The first secretary of defense, [[James Forrestal]], who in his previous capacity as the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|secretary of the Navy]] had opposed creation of the new position, found it difficult to exercise authority over the other branches with the limited powers his office had at the time. To address this and other problems, the National Security Act was amended in 1949 to further consolidate the national defense structure in order to reduce [[interservice rivalry]], directly subordinate the [[United States Secretary of the Army|secretaries of the Army]], the Navy and the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force]] to the secretary of defense in the chain of command, and rename the National Military Establishment as the Department of Defense, making it one [[Executive Department]]. The position of the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy secretary of defense]], the number two position in the department, was also created at this time.

The general trend since 1949 has been to further centralize management in the Department of Defense, elevating the status and authorities of civilian [[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]] appointees and defense-wide organizations at the expense of the military departments and the services within them. The last major revision of the statutory framework concerning the position was done in the [[Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]]. In particular, it elevated the status of joint service for commissioned officers, making it in practice a requirement before appointments to general officer and flag officer grades could be made.

==Powers and functions==
{{Main|Organizational structure of the United States Department of Defense}}

[[File:DoD Organization December 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Department of Defense organizational chart (December 2013)]]

The secretary of defense, appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]] with the advice and consent of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], is by federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|113}}) the head of the Department of Defense, "the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to Department of Defense", and has "authority, direction and control over the Department of Defense". Because the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] vests all military authority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the president, the statutory authority of the secretary of defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the secretary of defense, and the secretary's subordinate officials generally exercise military authority.

As the head of DoD, all officials, employees and service members are "under" the secretary of defense. Some of those high-ranking officials, civil and military (outside of OSD and the Joint Staff) are: the [[United States Secretary of the Army|secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|secretary of the Navy]], and [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|secretary of the Air Force]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army chief of staff]], [[commandant of the Marine Corps]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|chief of naval operations]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force chief of staff]], [[chief of space operations]], and [[chief of the National Guard Bureau]] and the combatant commanders of the [[Combatant Command]]s. All of these high-ranking positions, civil and military, require Senate confirmation.

The Department of Defense is composed of the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD), the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) and the [[Joint Staff]] (JS), [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Office of the Inspector General]] (DODIG), the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], the Military Departments ([[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] (DA), [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DON) & [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] (DAF)), the [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense Agencies and DoD Field Activities]], the [[National Guard Bureau]] (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the secretary of defense.

Department of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the Department, and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the Department. The latest version, signed by former secretary of defense [[Robert Gates]] in December 2010, is the first major re-write since 1987.<ref name="DOMP">[[#DOMP|Department of Defense Directive 5100.01 Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components]]</ref><ref name="5100.1:1">[[#5100.1|DoDD 5100.1]]: p.1.</ref>

===Office of the Secretary of Defense===
{{main|Office of the Secretary of Defense}}
The secretary's principally civilian staff element is called the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD) and is composed of the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy secretary of defense]] (DEPSECDEF) and five under secretaries of defense in the fields of [[Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics|acquisition, technology & logistics]], [[Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)|comptroller/chief financial officer]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence|intelligence]], [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|personnel & readiness]], and [[Under Secretary of Defense for Policy|policy]]; several [[Assistant Secretary of Defense|assistant secretaries of defense]]; other directors and the staffs under them.

The name of the principally military staff organization, organized under the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is the [[Joint Staff]] (JS).

===Awards and decorations===
The [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]] (DDSM), the [[Defense Superior Service Medal]] (DSSM), the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]] (DMSM), the [[Joint Service Commendation Medal]] (JSCM) and the [[Joint Service Achievement Medal]] (JSAM) are awarded, to military personnel for service in joint duty assignments, in the name of the secretary of defense. In addition, there is the [[Joint Meritorious Unit Award]] (JMUA), which is the only ribbon (as in non-medal) and unit award issued to joint DoD activities, also issued in the name of the secretary of defense.

The DDSM is analogous to the distinguished services medals issued by the military departments (i.e. [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]], [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] & [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]]), the DSSM corresponds to the [[Legion of Merit]], the DMSM to the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]], the JSCM to the service commendation medals, and the JSAM to the achievement medals issued by the services. While the approval authority for DSSM, DMSM, JSCM, JSAM and JMUA is delegated to inferior DoD officials: the DDSM can only be awarded by the secretary of defense.

Recommendations for the [[Medal of Honor]] (MOH), formally endorsed in writing by the secretary of the military department concerned and the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], are processed through the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness]], and such recommendations be must approved by the secretary of defense before it can be handed over to the president, who is the final approval authority for the MOH, although it is awarded in the name of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

The secretary of defense, with the concurrence of the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], is the approval authority for the acceptance and wear of [[NATO]] medals issued by the [[Secretary General of NATO|secretary general of NATO]] and offered to the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO|U.S. permanent representative to NATO]] in recognition of U.S. servicemembers who meet the eligibility criteria specified by NATO.<ref name="1348.33, V3:39">[[#13483, V3|DoDM 1348.33, Vol 3]]: p.39 (Enclosure 3)</ref>

===Congressional committees===
As the head of the department, the secretary of defense is the chief witness for the congressional committees with oversight responsibilities over the Department of Defense. The most important committees, with respect to the entire department, are the two authorizing committees, the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] (SASC) and the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC), and the two appropriations committees, the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]].

For the DoD intelligence programs the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] and the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] have the principal oversight role.

===National Security Council===
The secretary of defense is a statutory member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|50|402}}</ref> As one of the principals, the secretary along with the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], secretary of state and the [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs|assistant to the president for national security affairs]] participates in biweekly Principals Committee (PC) meetings, preparing and coordinating issues before they are brought before full NSC sessions chaired by the president.

===Role in the military justice system===
The secretary is one of only five or six civilians—the others being the president, the three "service secretaries" (the [[secretary of the Army]], [[secretary of the Navy]], and [[secretary of the Air Force]]), and the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of homeland security]] (when the [[United States Coast Guard]] is under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and has not been transferred to the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] under the Department of Defense)—authorized to act as [[convening authority]] in the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|military justice system]] for [[Courts-martial in the United States|General Courts-Martial]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|822}}: article 22, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]]), Special Courts-Martial ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|823}}: article 23, UCMJ), and Summary Courts-Martial ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|824}}: article 24 UCMJ).

==Amenities==

===Salary===
Secretary of Defense is a [[Executive Schedule|Level I position of the Executive Schedule]],<ref name="UnitedStatesCode|5|5312"/> and thus earns a salary of $210,700 per year as of January 2018.

==List of secretaries of defense==
The longest-serving secretary of defense is [[Robert McNamara]], who served for a total of 7 years, 39 days. Combining his two non-sequential services as the secretary of defense, the second-longest serving is [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who served just ten days fewer than McNamara. The second-longest unbroken tenure was Caspar Weinberger's, at 6 years, 306 days.

The shortest-serving secretary of defense is [[Elliot Richardson]], who served 114 days and then was appointed [[US Attorney General|U.S. attorney general]] amid the [[Richard Kleindienst|resignations]] of the [[Watergate Scandal]]. (This is not counting [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy secretaries of defense]] [[William P. Clements]] and [[William Howard Taft IV]], who each served a few weeks as temporary/acting secretary of defense).
