[[Ukraine]]'s system of trunk [[natural gas]] [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and underground natural gas depots is operated by Ukrtransgaz, a subsidiary of Naftogaz.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/52859/ Natural gas transit through Ukraine down 24.8% year on year], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 16, 2009)</ref> As of 2009, the company had 38,200&nbsp;km of high pressure gas transit pipelines and more than 30 billion cubic meters of gas storage capacity. This major gas infrastructure located between Russia and the European Union has led the company to feature prominently in regional politics. Another subsidiary of Naftogaz, Gas of Ukraine, is responsible for domestic gas distribution to the local [[district heating]] companies.<ref name="domestic">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/50656/ Gaz Ukrainy demands urgent payment of debts of heat supply companies], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 14, 2009)</ref>

Naftogaz is a major Ukrainian employer with 68,386 employees (as of 2018). The former [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|pwc]] management consultant [[Andriy Kobolyev]] took over as CEO after the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] tasked with reducing the country's dependence on Russian gas and reforming the company's business practices.

==History==

===1991–1998: Ukrgasprom===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, oil and gas industry of Ukraine governed by Derzhnaftogasprom went through number of changes.<ref name=nubehep/> The [[National Commission for State Regulation of Energy]] (NKRE) was giving out certification for gas trading to anyone without order ignoring the Derzhnaftogasprom.<ref name=nubehep/> Guided by decisions of the First Vice-Prime Minister (on Fuel and Energy Complex) [[Pavlo Lazarenko]], licenses were given to such companies like [[United Energy Systems of Ukraine]] (EESU), Intergas, Olgas,<ref>[https://cripo.com.ua/persons/p-2175/ The piranha of murky business – 2 (ПИРАНЬЯ МУТНОГО БИЗНЕСА — 2)].

In the early 1990s, there was privatization of gas distribution regional network known as "oblgaz" belonging to "Ukrgas".<ref name=nubehep/> The process took place unnoticed and when Naftogas was constituted, not all privately owned distributors wanted to transfer their own stocks to the statutory fund of the National Joint Stock Company.<ref name=nubehep/> Along with the gas distribution network in the same way there were privatized enterprises of petroleum products provision including filling station and fuel repositories that belonged to "Ukrnaftoprodukt".<ref name=nubehep/> The whole petroleum products retail network had to be created by Naftogaz from zero.<ref name=nubehep/>

The predecessor of Naftogas is "Ukrgasprom".<ref>[https://ria.ru/20120229/580849002.html The London court confirmed the Naftogas penalty of $25 million (Лондонский суд подтвердил взыскание с Нафтогаза $25 млн)]. [[RIA Novosti]]. 29 February 2012</ref><ref name=nubehep/>

On 28 January 1995 after discussion with government the condition of agreements realization in provision for Ukraine gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan, the head of "Ukrgasprom" [[Bohdan Kliuk]] was dismissed from his post on decision of the Cabinet of Ministers.<ref name="mirror950203">Ivan Gonta.

===1998–2014===

The company was founded in 1998 after previously being named Ukrgazprom.<ref name="Founded" /> The main initiators who created the company were Ihor Didenko and [[Ihor Bakai]] (better known as Igor Bakai).<ref name="nubehep">Yeromenko, A.

At the end of 1990s, Ukraine was consuming a record of 75 billion m<sup>3</sup> per year which was the fourth indicator in the world and seemed strange to say the least considering that the country was not part of the top 20 in GDP volume.<ref name=ogsp2g/> Eighteen billion m<sup>3</sup> were mined inside Ukraine by Naftogas along with some joint enterprises such as "Poltavska Naftogasova Kompania", Plast, Ukrnaftogastekhnologia and others.<ref name=ogsp2g/> All the gas that was mined by Naftogas and received through transit in obligatory order was being sold to population and state organizations.<ref name=ogsp2g/> The remaining volume of [[natural gas]], Ukraine was receiving from Russia as part of payment for transit or was buying from [[Turkmenistan]].<ref name=ogsp2g/> That gas was sold to industrial enterprises or was being re-exported.<ref name=ogsp2g/>

Also, instead of investing more funds in geological exploration for the Ukrgasprom, its money was used to patch budget and foreign debts holes, which led to decrease in mining of hydrocarbons and decline of industry.<ref name=nubehep/> Most of oil refineries were sold out to Russian companies.<ref name=nubehep/> The only refinery that belongs to Naftogas is Shebelynsky Gas Refinery which Naftogas controls through [[UkrGasVydobuvannya|Ukrgasvydobuvannia]].<ref name=nubehep/> Ukraine never had enough mined oil resources capable to provide for oil refining capacity that Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union.<ref name=nubehep/> Most successful in oil mining is Ukrnafta, however recently Chornomornaftogas had more and more plans to develop newly found deposits.<ref name=nubehep/>

Before 2001 Ukraine had two state enterprises in transportation of oil "[[Druzhba pipeline|Main oil pipeline "Druzhba]]" and "Cisdnieper main oil pipeline".<ref name=nubehep/> The pipelines were often used by Russian companies, but after Ukraine built connecting pipeline [[Odessa–Brody pipeline|Odessa &ndash; Brody]] (Black Sea coast &ndash; West Ukraine) Russian companies installed an alternative pipe route Sukhodolnaya&ndash;Rodionovskaya.<ref name=nubehep/>

In 2001 several Ukrainian parliamentarians made inquiry to the Prosecutor's General Office, Tax Agency, and Security Service requesting to open a criminal case against the head of Presidential Administration [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]], the former chairman of Naftogaz [[Ihor Bakai]], the administration chairmen of joint-stock company "Ukrgasprom" Bohdan Kliuk, the director of state enterprise "Ukrgasprom" Illia Fik, and others.<ref>Andrei Kapustin.

In August 2014, Ukrtransgaz, the operator of the Ukrainian gas transport system, along with its Slovakian counterpart "Eustream", launched natural gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine after signing a Memo of mutual understanding in April.<ref>[http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/747723 en.itar-tass.com/economy/747723]</ref> This initiative was driven by Russia's decision in June to cease gas supplies to Ukraine in retaliation for the country seeking closer ties with the European Union. By launching reverse flows, Ukraine claims it is seeking no concessions – only implementation of existing EU law on EU territory. The [[Third Energy Package]] was proposed by the European Commission in 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. This legislation clearly allows for gas to be traded like other commodities, thus creating a more efficient market which is less vulnerable to political pressure. In October 2014 the EU further committed to better connecting its energy grids, saying countries should be able to export 15% of their generation capacity by 2030.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/490885ec-5b14-11e4-8625-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS  www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/490885ec-5b14-11e4-8625-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS]</ref> The consultancy firm Strategy& (formerly Booz & Co) believes the EU could save €40bn a year by 2030 if it integrates its energy grids.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b8727392-592b-11e4-a722-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS  www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b8727392-592b-11e4-a722-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS]</ref>

Slovakia can provide more gas than Ukraine needs. In 2013, Ukraine imported 25.8bcm. Slovakia could provide Ukraine with 30bcm. Ukraine is asking that the EU fully support west-to-east exports to Ukraine, which would eliminate the scope for Russia to use gas as a weapon to achieve its political aims in Ukraine.<ref>[http://rt.com/business/168408-ukraine-begs-reverse-gas-eu/  rt.com/business/168408-ukraine-begs-reverse-gas-eu]</ref> Norway's energy giant [[Statoil]] began transiting gas eastwards from Slovakia in 2014,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reuters Editorial |date=3 October 2014 |title=Norway's Statoil sells gas to Ukraine's Naftogaz |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/ukraine-crisis-statoil-idUSL6N0RY2UC20141003 |access-date=2 May 2016 |website=Reuters}}</ref> and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] began in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=REFILE-UPDATE 2-Shell starts gas supplies to Ukraine |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5N0XC22020150415 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref>

In response to the reverse flows initiative, Russia has cut supplies to central and eastern European countries, seeking to prevent exports to Ukraine.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/poland-russia-gas-supply-cut-gazprom-tensions-ukraine  www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/poland-russia-gas-supply-cut-gazprom-tensions-ukraine]</ref> In September, Hungary stopped supplying gas to Ukraine, days after a meeting between Hungarian Prime Minister Orban and Gazprom's CEO.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/hungary-suspends-gas-supplies-ukraine-pressure-moscow  www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/hungary-suspends-gas-supplies-ukraine-pressure-moscow]</ref> Gazprom charges widely different prices to different European countries, which many believe is based on Russia's political goals in the region.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html  www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom-russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html]</ref>

Ukraine is seeking arbitration from the "Stockholm Chamber of Commerce" to fairly assess past debts between the two countries and to establish a fair basis of future operations.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/ukraine-crisis-naftogaz-court-idUSL5N0OX21G20140616  www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/ukraine-crisis-naftogaz-court-idUSL5N0OX21G20140616]</ref>

Since April 2014, Ukraine is the only non-EU country to voluntarily publish its volume in storage facilities on the EU transparency platform of Gas Storage Europe (GIE).{{citation_needed|date=March 2019}} The company also publishes data on the amount of gas entering and leaving the country.

In November 2014, Ukrtransgaz, the operator of Ukraine's gas transportation system, began posting daily statistics on the information platform of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). Also, the same year Naftogaz launched a new website in order to showcase its transparency initiatives.{{citation_needed|date=March 2019}} In March 2018, "Naftogaz" won a trial against Russian [[Gazprom]] for shortened gas supplies before the [[Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce]], and was set to receive net amount of [[USD|$]]2.56 billion.<ref name="trial2018">{{Cite news |last=Ash |first=Timothy |date=1 March 2018 |title=Ukraine Scores Major Win over Russia and Gazprom |work=atlanticcouncil.org |url=https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-scores-major-win-over-russia-and-gazprom |access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref>

==International activities==
Ukraine now plays a vital role in both the storage and transit of gas in Europe and in improving EU energy security. Ukraine has the largest storage capacity in Europe, which enables the country and its European partners to accumulate over 30 bcm of gas during summer periods when prices are lowest. Ukraine is also strategically placed to play the role of a transit hub. Its interconnectors have the ability to transfer gas from central Europe to South-Eastern Europe, which is the most exposed region to Russia's gas monopoly. Naftogaz asserts that ensuring gas flows freely will significantly improve the liquidity and the stability of the EU market, making it more resilient to political pressure.

The company drills for oil in the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]] in [[Egypt]]. On December 13, 2006, Naftogaz and the [[Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation]] had signed an agreement on the exploration and development of oil and gas deposits on the eastern territory of Alam El Shawish East in the Western Egyptian desert.<ref name="Egypt">[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/182528.html Naftogaz Ukrainy Starts Production Of Oil From Extension Well In Egypt]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (February 24, 2009)</ref> In 2014 Naftogaz began natural gas extraction in Egypt.

==Criticism==
Naftogaz has been seen as one of the biggest sources of [[corruption]] in Ukraine for years with many of the country's billionaires having acquired much of their wealth through gas [[arbitrage]] based on differences between the prices of Russian gas imports, gas exports to the EU and government energy subsidies to homes and businesses.<ref name="bloom13" /><ref name="gs14">{{Cite news |last=Soros |first=George |date=October 23, 2014 |title=Wake Up, Europe |work=The New York Review |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/nov/20/wake-up-europe/ |access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Stack |first=Graham |title=Massive corruption at Ukraine's Naftogaz funnelled through western banks |work=[[Eurasian Development Bank]] |location=Istanbul |url=http://www.bne.eu/content/story/massive-corruption-ukraines-naftogaz-funnelled-through-western-banks |access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Daly |first=John |date=21 October 2012 |title=Ukraine's Corruption Plagued Naftogaz Loses Monopoly |work=OilPrice.com |url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Ukraines-Corruption-Plagued-Naftogaz-Loses-Monopoly.html |access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref>

In October 2019, Naftogaz got caught up in the impeachment proceedings against [[President Donald Trump]] in the US, when news broke that a group of businessmen with allegedly close ties to the President and his personal lawyer, [[Rudy Giuliani]], intervened in an attempt to change the management of Naftogaz.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How a Ukrainian Gas Company Wound Up in the Middle of Trump's Impeachment Drama |url=https://time.com/5694469/ukraine-gas-trump-impeachment-naftogaz/ |access-date=2019-11-04 |website=Time |language=en}}</ref> An [[Associated Press]] report reveals how businessmen [[Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman|Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman]] and [[Harry Sargeant III]] allegedly attempted to replace Naftogaz CEO, [[Andriy Kobolyev]], and sought to broker a deal to sell their own natural gas to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-07 |title=Profit, not politics: Trump allies sought Ukraine gas deal |url=https://apnews.com/d7440cffba4940f5b85cd3dfa3500fb2 |access-date=2019-11-04 |website=AP NEWS}}</ref>
