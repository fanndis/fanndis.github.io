== Legislature ==
{{Main|Parliament of India}}
[[File:New Delhi government block 03-2016 img3.jpg|thumb|left|Building of the [[Parliament of India]]]]
The powers of the legislature in India are exercised by [[Parliament of India|the Parliament]], a bicameral legislature consisting of the [[Rajya Sabha]] and the [[Lok Sabha]]. Of the two houses of parliament, the Rajya Sabha is considered to be the [[upper house]] or the Council of States and consists of members appointed by the president and [[Indirect election|elected]] by the [[States and union territories of India|state and territorial legislatures]]. The Lok Sabha is considered the [[lower house]] or the House of the people.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cultural Perspectives on Youth Justice: Connecting Theory, Policy and International Practise |isbn=978-1-137-43397-8 |page=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1137433973|accessdate=10 May 2017|last1=Arnull |first1=Elaine |last2=Fox |first2=Darrell |date=29 June 2016 }}</ref>

== Executive ==
The [[executive branch|executive]] of government is the one that has sole authority and responsibility for the daily administration of the state bureaucracy. The division of power into separate branches of government is central to the republican idea of the [[separation of powers]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rn2QDAAAQBAJ&q=The+Executive+Branch+of+government+of+India+is+the+one+that+has+sole+authority+and+responsibility+for+the+daily+administration+of+the+state+bureaucracy.+The+division+of+power+into+separate+branches+of+government+is+central+to+the+republican+idea+of+the+separation+of+powers.+President&pg=PA186|title=Cultural Perspectives on Youth Justice: Connecting Theory, Policy and International Practice|last1=Arnull|first1=Elaine|last2=Fox|first2=Darrell|date=29 June 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-43397-8|language=en}}</ref>

=== President ===
{{Main|President of India}}
The executive power is vested mainly in the [[President of India]], as per Article 53(1) of the constitution. The president has all [[Constitution of India|constitutional]] powers and exercises them directly or through subordinate officers as per the aforesaid Article 53(1). The president is to act in accordance with aid and advice tendered by the [[Prime Minister of India]], who leads the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India]] as described in [[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74 of the Constitution of India]].

The council of ministers remains in power during the 'pleasure' of the president. However, in practice, the council of ministers must retain the support of the Lok Sabha. If a president were to dismiss the council of ministers on his or her own initiative, it might trigger a constitutional crisis. Thus, in practice, the [[Council of Ministers]] cannot be dismissed as long as it holds the support of a majority in the [[Lok Sabha]].

The President is responsible for appointing many high officials in India. These high officials include the [[Governors of states of India|governors]] of the 29 [[States and territories of India|states]]; the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]]; other judges of the [[Supreme Court of India|supreme court]] and [[List of high courts in India|high courts]] on the advice of other judges; the [[Attorney General of India|attorney general]]; the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|comptroller and auditor general]]; the [[Chief Election Commissioner of India|chief election commissioner]] and other [[Election Commissioner of India|election commissioners]]; the chairman and members of the [[Union Public Service Commission]]; the officers of the [[All India Services]] ([[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]], [[Indian Forest Service|IFoS]] and [[Indian Police Service|IPS]]) and [[Central Civil Services]] in group 'A'; and the [[ambassador]]s and [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioners]] to other countries on the recommendations of the cabinet.<ref name="Darpan2007">{{cite book|author=Pratiyogita Darpan|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ugDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT60|date=March 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Constitution of India|last=Bakshi|first=Parvinrai Mulwantrai|publisher=Universal Law Pub.

The President, as the [[head of state]], also receives the credentials of [[ambassador]]s from other countries, whilst the [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]], as [[head of government]], receives credentials of [[High commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioners]] from other [[Commonwealth of Nations|members of the Commonwealth]], in line with historical tradition.

The President is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Indian Armed Forces]].<ref name="Oldenburg2010">{{cite book|last=Oldenburg|first=Philip|title=India, Pakistan, and Democracy: Solving the Puzzle of Divergent Paths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6nras7L790C&pg=PA71|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-78018-6|page=71}}</ref>

The [[President of India]] can grant a pardon to or reduce the sentence of a convicted person for one time, particularly in cases involving punishment of death. The decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most other cases, however, the president exercises his or her executive powers on the advice of the [[Prime minister of India|prime minister]].<ref name="Kumar">Kumar; Rajesh. [https://books.google.com/books?id=an78gq3JwzYC&pg=PA72 Universal's Guide to the Constitution of India] Pg no. 72.</ref> Presently, the President of India is [[Ram Nath Kovind]].

=== Vice president ===
{{Main|Vice President of India}}
The vice president is the second highest constitutional position in India after the president. The vice president represents the nation in the absence of the [[President of India|president]] and takes charge as acting president in the incident of resignation impeachment or removal of the president. The vice president also has the legislative function of acting as the chairman of the [[Rajya Sabha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.importantindia.com/2059/functions-of-the-vice-president-of-india/|title=Important India functions of vicepresident}}</ref> The vice president is elected indirectly by members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both the houses of the parliament in accordance with the system of [[proportional representation]] by means of the [[single transferable vote]] and the voting is by secret ballot conducted by the [[Election Commission of India|election commission]].

=== Civil services ===
{{Main|Civil Services of India}}
The Civil Services of India are the civil services and the permanent [[bureaucracy]] of India. The [[Executive (government)|executive]] decisions are implemented by the Indian civil servants.

In the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. The ministers are indirectly responsible to the people themselves. But the handful of ministers are not expected to deal personally with the various problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants to enforce it.

== Judiciary ==
{{Main|Judiciary of India}}
India's independent union judicial system began under the British, and its concepts and procedures resemble those of [[Anglo-Saxon countries]]. The [[Supreme Court of India]] consists of the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]] and 30 associate justices, all appointed by the president on the advice of the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The jury trials were abolished in India in the early 1960s, after the famous case ''[[KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra|KM Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra]]'', for reasons of being vulnerable to media and public pressure, as well as to being misled.

Unlike its United States counterpart, the Indian justice system consists of a unitary system at both state and union level. The judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India]], [[High Courts of India|high courts]] at the state level, and [[District Courts of India|district courts]] and [[Sessions Court]]s at the [[List of districts in India|district]] level.

=== Supreme court ===
{{Main|Supreme Court of India}}
[[File:Supreme Court of India - 200705.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Supreme Court of India]].|alt=Building of the Supreme Court of India.]]
The [[Supreme Court of India]] is situated in [[New Delhi]], the capital region of [[India]].

The supreme court is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal under the [[Constitution of India]], the highest constitutional court, with the power of [[constitutional review]]. Consisting of the [[Chief Justice of India]] and 30 sanctioned other judges, it has extensive powers in the form of [[Original jurisdiction|original]], [[Appellate jurisdiction|appellate]] and [[advisory jurisdictions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#|title=Rule of law index 2016|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>

As the [[Appellate court|final court of appeal]] of the country, it takes up appeals primarily against verdicts of the [[List of high courts in India|high courts]] of various states of the Union and other courts and tribunals. It safeguards [[fundamental rights]] of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] by the president. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or 'suo moto'), without anyone drawing its attention to them. The law declared by the supreme court becomes binding on all courts within India and also by the union and state governments.<ref name="History PDF">{{cite web|url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supct/scm/m2.pdf|title=History of Supreme Court of India|publisher=Supreme Court of India|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222100038/http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supct/scm/m2.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref> Per [[wikisource: Constitution of India/Part V|Article 142]], it is the duty of the [[President of India|president]] to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.

In addition, Article 32 of the constitution gives an extensive original jurisdiction to the supreme court in regard to enforcing fundamental rights. It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including [[writ]]s in the nature of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[prohibition]]'', ''[[quo warranto]]'' and ''[[certiorari]]'' to enforce them. The supreme court has been conferred with power to direct transfer of any civil or criminal case from one state high court to another state high court, or from a court subordinate to another state high court and the supreme court. Although the proceedings in the supreme court arise out of the judgment or orders made by the subordinate courts, of late the supreme court has started entertaining matters in which interest of the public at large is involved. This may be done by any individual or group of persons either by filing a ''[[writ]] petition'' at the filing counter of the court, or by addressing a letter to the [[Chief Justice of India]], highlighting the question of public importance for redress. These are known as [[Public interest litigation in India|public interest litigations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l273-Public-Interest-Litigation.html|title=PIL|website=LegalServicesIndia|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>

== Elections and voting ==

{{Main|Elections in India|Politics of India}}{{See also|Election Commission of India}}
India has a [[Federalism|quasi-federal]] form of government, called "union" or "central" government,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416084719/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf |archivedate=16 April 2016  }}</ref> with elected officials at the union, state and local levels.

More than a quarter of the union government's tax revenues is shared with the state governments.<ref name="sharing">Tax revenue was 88% of total union government revenue in 1950–51 and has come down to 73% in 2003–04, as a result of increase in non-tax revenue. Tax revenues were 70% of total state government revenues in 2002 to 2003. Indirect taxes were 84% of the union governments total tax revenue and have come down to 62% in 2003–04, mostly because of cuts in import duties and rationalisation. The states share in union government's tax revenue is 28.0% for the period 2000 to 2005 as per the recommendations of the eleventh finance commission. In addition, states that do not levy sales tax on sugar, textiles and tobacco, are entitled to 1.5% of the proceeds.{{cite book|author1=Datt, Ruddar |author2=Sundharam, K.P.M.|title=Indian Economy|publisher=S.Chand|year=2005|isbn=81-219-0298-3|pages=938, 942, 946}}</ref>

The tax reforms, initiated in 1991, have sought to rationalise the tax structure and increase compliance by taking steps in the following directions:
*Reducing the rates of individual and corporate income taxes, excises, customs and making it more progressive
*Reducing exemptions and concessions
*Simplification of laws and procedures
*Introduction of [[permanent account number]] (PAN) to track monetary transactions
*21 of the 29 states introduced [[value added tax]] (VAT) on 1 April 2005 to replace the complex and multiple sales tax system<ref name="angela" /><ref name="VAT">{{cite news|title=Indif_real_GDP_per_capitaa says 21 of 29 states to launch new tax |date=25 March 2005 |work=Daily Times |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_25-3-2005_pg5_13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116065316/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_25-3-2005_pg5_13 |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref>

=== Union budget ===
{{Main|Union budget of India}}
The Finance minister of India usually presents the annual [[Union budget of India|union budget]] in the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] on the last [[working day]] of February. However, for the F.Y. 2017–18, this tradition had been changed. Now budget will be presented on the 1st day of February. The budget has to be passed by the [[Lok Sabha]] before it can come into effect on 1 April, the start of India's [[fiscal year]]. The Union budget is preceded by an [[Economic survey of India|economic survey]] which outlines the broad direction of the budget and the economic performance of the country for the outgoing financial year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibef.org/economy/union-budget-2017-18|title=Union Budget 2017–18|website=ibef.org|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

India's non-development revenue expenditure had increased nearly five-fold in 2003–04 since 1990–91 and more than tenfold since 1985–1986. Interest payments are the single largest item of expenditure and accounted for more than 40% of the total non-development expenditure in the 2003–04 budget. Defense expenditure increased fourfold during the same period and has been increasing because of India's desire to project its military prowess beyond South Asia. In 2007, India's defence spending stood at US$26.5&nbsp;billion.
