'''USA Network''' (on-air simply as '''USA''', stylized as '''usa''' since 2005) is an [[United States|American]] [[basic cable]] channel owned by the [[NBCUniversal Television and Streaming]] division of [[NBCUniversal]], a subsidiary of [[Comcast]]. It was originally launched in 1977 as '''Madison Square Garden Sports Network''', one of the first national sports cable television channels, before being relaunched as USA Network in 1980. Once a minor player in basic-tier pay television, USA has steadily gained popularity due to its original programming; it is one of four major subscription-television networks (with [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]) that also broadcasts syndicated reruns of current and former [[television network|network television]] series and theatrically-released [[feature film]]s, as well as limited sports programming and [[WWE]].

As of September 2018, USA Network is available to about 90.4 million households (98% of households with pay television) in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html |title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN |last=Bucholtz |first=Andrew |date=10 September 2018 |website=AwfulAnnouncing.com |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Paramount and Universal ownership (1977–1994)===
USA Network originally launched on September 22, 1977 as the '''Madison Square Garden Sports Network'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koplovitz.com/the-usa-story/ |title=The USA Story |last=Koplovitz |first=Kay |date=January 5, 2015 |website=Koplovitz.com |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> (not to be confused with the [[New York City]]-area [[regional sports network]] [[MSG (TV network)|of the same name]] now simply known as the MSG Network). The network was founded by cable provider [[UA-Columbia Cablevision]] and [[Kay Koplovitz]]. The channel was one of the first national cable television channels, utilizing [[Communications satellite|satellite]] delivery as opposed to the then-industry standard [[microwave relay]] to distribute its programming to cable systems. Initially, the network ran a mix of college and less well-known professional sports, similar to those found during the early years of [[ESPN]]. The channel began its broadcast day after 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on weekdays and 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekends.

On April 9, 1980, the channel changed its name to '''USA Network''' after the ownership structure was reorganized under a joint operating agreement by UA-Columbia and the then-[[MCA Inc.]]/[[Universal Studios|Universal City Studios]]. That fall, USA began signing on at noon Eastern Time on weekdays; it also added some [[talk show]]s and a children's program called ''[[Calliope (TV series)|Calliope]]'' to its schedule. Sports programming began airing at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time weekdays, and aired all day on weekends. In the fall of 1981, USA began its daily programming at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, with talk shows and children's programs running until noon, sports airing from noon onward during weekends and until 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, talk shows from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, and sports airing again after 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.

Later, in 1982, [[Time Inc.]] and [[Gulf+Western]]'s [[Paramount Pictures]] unit (now part of [[ViacomCBS]]) would buy stakes in the venture. The three partners had a [[non-compete clause]] that would prevent them from owning other basic cable networks independently from the USA joint venture, but the said clause would cause Time Inc. to drop out of the venture in 1987, as the company attempted (but failed) to buy [[CNN]] from [[Ted Turner]] and run it independently from USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/kay-koplovitz# |title=Kay Koplovitz: Network Creator/Executive |first=Jane |last=Altschuler |date=May 3, 2006 |website=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> MCA and Paramount subsequently became the sole owners of the channel (with each company owning a 50% interest).

In the fall of 1982, USA began operating on a 24-hour-a-day schedule, running a mix of talk shows, children's shows, and a low-budget movie from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. The channel began running a mix of 1960s and 1970s [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons each weekday evening from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. as part of the ''[[USA Cartoon Express]]'' block, with sports programming airing after 7:00&nbsp;p.m., which were rebroadcast during the overnight hours. Weekends featured a mix of movies, some older drama series and talk shows during the morning hours, and sports during the afternoons and evenings. Overnights consisted of old low-budget films and film shorts, and music as part of a show called ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]].''

Between 1984 and 1986, USA's programming focus began shifting away from sports,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Assael |first1=Shaun |last2=Mooneyham |first2=Mike |title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhNgjI3pSPkC&q=NHL+on+USA+Network&pg=PA36 |date=3 November 2010 |publisher=Crown/Archetype |isbn=978-0-307-75813-2 |page=36}}</ref> and shifted towards general entertainment programs not found on broadcast stations, including some less common network drama series and cartoons.

For the 1985-1986 season, the channel had 4 hours of original and exclusive shows. One original series from the 1985-1986 season was the comedy ''[[Check It Out! (Canadian TV series)|Check It Out!]]''. USA, wanting to become the flagship cable channel and compete directly with the broadcast networks, committed to 26 half-hours of part exclusive off-broadcast network and part original programming for the 1986-1987 season at an increase of $30 million. In one case, the channel picked up ''[[Airwolf]]'' for 58 off-network episodes, while commissioning 24 new episodes without the original cast.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Radio-Age/Issues/80s/1986/1986-08-04-RTVA.pdf |title=USA's ambitious season |date=August 4, 1986 |magazine=[[Television/Radio Age (magazine)|Television/Radio Age]] |volume=XXXIV |issue=1 |page=48 |publisher=Television Editorial Corp. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141127203506/http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Radio-Age/Issues/80s/1986/1986-08-04-RTVA.pdf |archive-date=November 27, 2014 }}</ref>

One tradition on USA was an afternoon lineup of [[game show]] reruns mixed in with several original low-budget productions that aired over the years. It began in October 1984 with reruns of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' and ''[[Make Me Laugh]].'' In September 1985, the network began airing its first original game show, a revival of the mid-1970s game show ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot]];'' two more original game shows, ''[[Love Me, Love Me Not (game show)|Love Me, Love Me Not]],'' and a revival of the short-lived 1980 series ''[[Chain Reaction (game show)|Chain Reaction]],'' were added in September 1986. More shows were progressively added soon afterward such as ''[[The Joker's Wild]],'' ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]],'' ''[[Press Your Luck]],'' ''[[High Rollers]],'' and ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' (with [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] as its "Square-Master", or host), along with ''[[Wipeout (1988 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]],'' ''[[Face the Music (American game show)|Face the Music]],'' and ''[[Name That Tune]].'' In June 1987, the channel debuted another original game show, ''[[Bumper Stumpers]].'' (All four USA original game shows in this era were taped in Canada.) When it began, the game-show block ran for an hour, but it expanded significantly the following year. By 1989, the network ran game shows Monday through Fridays from 12:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.

In January 1989, USA debuted ''[[USA Up All Night]],'' a showcase of low-budget feature films that aired as part of its weekend overnight schedule. ''Up All Night'' became a cult favorite among viewers for the comedic wraparound segments that were usually shown during breaks leading into (and sometimes, out of) commercials and between films that were hosted by comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and model/actress [[Rhonda Shear]], the latter of whom had replaced original co-host Caroline Schlitt in 1991. Though this program was discontinued on March 7, 1998, late-night movie telecasts on USA continued to be branded under the "Up All Night" banner until 2002.

Short news updates, branded as ''USA Updates,'' were shown from as early as 1989 until 2000. These segments were first produced out of [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], owing to the fact that the station had already produced a number of syndicated news services (including the [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] Newsfeed) and Steve Bell, the former newsreader on ''[[Good Morning America]],'' was employed as a primary anchor at the station. However, when KYW's news operations were heavily revamped in response to falling ratings in 1991, production of USA Updates was then taken over by the "[[All News Channel]]" (operated as a joint venture of [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s and [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s CONUS Communications). The ANC-produced updates continued through 2000 (ANC was suffering heavily around this time due to competition with other cable news channels such as [[CNN]] and the then-similarly formatted [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]], and ended up shutting down in 2002); USA Network has not carried any news programming since the news updates were discontinued.

USA was the first basic cable channel to pre-empt the syndicated TV market by purchasing a package of 26 films from the [[Touchstone Pictures]] library in October 1989. To obtain the package, it spent an estimated $50 million to $60 million, with films including such box office hits as ''[[Dead Poets Society]],'' ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]],'' and ''[[Three Men and a Baby]].''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-07/news/tv-2689_1_prime-time-programming |title=New Shows on the Block: KCOP Builds Prime-Time Programming in Move Against the Networks |last1=Cerone |first1=Daniel |date=October 7, 1990 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>

The tradition of game-show reruns continued into the 1990s with the ''[[Pyramid (game show)|$25,000 and $100,000 Pyramids]],'' the early 1990s revivals of ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' and ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]],'' and other well-known shows such as ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]],'' ''[[Sale of the Century (American game show)|Sale of the Century]],'' ''[[Talk About (game show)|Talk About]],'' and ''[[Caesars Challenge]].'' Additionally, two more original game shows were added in June 1994; these were ''[[Free 4 All]]'' and ''[[Quicksilver (American game show)|Quicksilver]].'' In September 1991, the block was reduced to three hours, from 2:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern. However, an additional hour was added in March 1993. In November 1994, the game-show block was cut back to only two hours, from 2:00 to 4:00&nbsp;p.m. On September 24, 1992, USA launched a sister network, the Sci-Fi Channel (now [[Syfy]]), focusing on [[science fiction]] series and films. In January 1993, the channel began showing ''[[WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', which was the first major professional wrestling program to show storylines playing out in front of an audience. In September 1993, USA adopted a new on-air look centering on the slogan "The Remote Stops Here," with flat graphics suggesting a television camera's in-lens symbols and music consisting of electric guitar and synthesized noises, though the movie presentation openers were retained from the previous design.

===USA Networks ownership (1994–2001)===
In 1994, Paramount Pictures parent Paramount Communications was sold to [[Viacom (1952–2006)|the original iteration of Viacom]]; the following year, MCA was acquired by [[Seagram]]. In April 1996, Viacom, which also owned [[MTV Networks]], launched a new classic television network called [[TV Land]]. MCA subsequently sued Viacom for [[breach of contract]], claiming that it had violated the non-compete clause in its joint venture agreement with MCA.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Media Business; MCA Sues Viacom, Saying New Channel Violates Their USA Network Partnership |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/business/media-business-mca-sues-viacom-saying-new-channel-violates-their-usa-network.html |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 30, 1996 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> A judge presiding over the case sided with MCA,<ref>{{cite news |title=Seagram Wins Small Victory Over Viacom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/business/seagram-wins-small-victory-over-viacom.html |first=Mark |last=Landler |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1997 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> and Viacom subsequently sold its stake in USA and the Sci-Fi Channel to Seagram for $1.7 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seagram to Buy USA Networks for $1.7 Billion |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/23/news/mn-35268 |first=Sallie |last=Hofmeister |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 23, 1997 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> In turn, Seagram sold a [[controlling interest]] in the networks to [[Barry Diller]] in February 1998, which led to the creation of '''USA Networks, Inc.''';<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/11/24/234345/index.htm |title=Once Again, It's Diller Time |last=Gunther |first=Marc |date=November 24, 1997 |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |via=CNN |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Barry Diller, Media Titan, Wants a Shot at the Small Time |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/business/barry-diller-media-titan-wants-a-shot-at-the-small-time.html |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 1998 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> the company also merged the cable channels with Diller's existing television properties including the [[Home Shopping Network]] and its broadcasting unit Silver King Broadcasting (which was restructured as [[USA Broadcasting]], and eventually sold its stations to [[Univision Communications]] in 2001 to form the nucleus of [[UniMás|Telefutura/UniMás]]).

In October 1995, the network dropped the entire game show block; it was replaced with a block called ''USA Live'', which carried reruns of ''[[Love Connection]]'' and ''[[The People's Court]]'', with live hosted wraparound segments between shows; that block was dropped by 1997 (some of the game shows that USA had aired can still be seen on [[Game Show Network|GSN]] and [[Buzzr]]). In 1994, USA began simulcasting the upstart business news channel [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg Information TV]] each weekday morning from 5:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (and later, from 5:00 to 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific on Saturdays); in 2004, the Bloomberg simulcast moved to [[E!]], where it ran until 2007 (USA was actually the second television network to simulcast Bloomberg's programming, the now-defunct [[American Independent Network]] also carried a simulcast of the channel during the mid-1990s).

On June 17, 1996, the network unveiled a new on-air appearance, which included the introduction of a new logo (incorporating a star ridged into the "U" of the now-serifed "USA" logotype, replacing the Futura-typeface logo that had been in use since the network's start under the USA Network name in 1980), and a three-note jingle. Network IDs, feature presentation intros for movies and promo graphics were based around a behind-the-scenes look at the fictional "USA Studios"; some of the IDs showed people in the control room, while a studio that was being set-up by a crew was the backdrop for the "Tonight" menu that displayed the evening's schedule. Opening sequences leading into movie telecasts showed people running through the "USA Studios Film Vault". The new look coincided with a shift in focus, more towards off-network reruns and original programming; game shows and court shows were dropped from the schedule, while cartoons were phased out. USA Studios also became the branding for USA-produced programming at this point. This logo was replaced in July 1999 in favor of a 'USA flag'-styled logo (whose design was slightly modified in 2002).

In September 1996, USA replaced the ''USA Cartoon Express'' with the action-oriented children's block, ''[[USA Action Extreme Team]]''; the channel discontinued its animation block outright in September 1998 (other than airing the first-run teen sitcom ''[[USA High]]'' and reruns of ''[[Saved by the Bell: The New Class]]'' from 1997 to 2001, USA has replaced USA Action Extreme Team to [[USA Kids|Gingo at USA Network]]), and replaced it with a block called "USAM", which advertised itself as "Primetime Comedy in the Morning". The block mainly featured sitcoms originally aired on network television that were cancelled before making it to [[100 episodes]] (such as ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', ''[[Hearts Afire]]'' and ''[[Something So Right (TV series)|Something So Right]]''); however, for a time, the block also included the 1989–1994 episodes of the [[Bob Saget]] run of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''. "USAM" was discontinued in 2002; by that point, the only sitcoms airing on USA were daytime and late night reruns of ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' and overnight airings of ''[[Living Single]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'', with drama series and movies populating much of the channel's daytime and primetime schedule.

In 2000, USA Networks bought Canadian media company North American Television, Inc. (a joint partnership between the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Power Corporation of Canada]]), owner of cable television channels [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]] and [[Newsworld International]] (the CBC continued to handle programming responsibilities for NWI until 2005, when eventual USA owner [[Vivendi]] sold the channel to a group led by [[Al Gore]], who relaunched it as [[Current TV]]). One major shock happened when USA lost the broadcasting rights of the WWF to Viacom in June 2000; ''Raw'' (which had been retitled ''Raw is War'') was moved to [[The New TNN|TNN]] in September of that year.

===Vivendi ownership (2001–2003)===
In 2001, USA Networks sold its non-shopping television and film assets (including USA Network, the Sci-Fi Channel, Trio, USA Films (which was rechristened as [[Focus Features]] and [[Studios USA]]) to [[Vivendi|Vivendi Universal]]. USA and the other channels were folded into Vivendi's Universal Television Group.
In October 6, 2001, Gingo on USA Network changed its name to USA Kids

In July 2002, the channel debuted ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', which became one of USA Network's first breakout hit series. It is the comedy-drama [[police procedural]] that starred [[Tony Shalhoub]] as [[Adrian Monk]], a former [[San Francisco]] police inspector-turned-consultant who suffers from various obsessive-compulsive behaviors that include the ability to pay attention to detail when solving crimes. It ran for eight seasons until it ended on December 4, 2009.

===NBC Universal/Comcast ownership (2003–present)===
In 2003, [[General Electric]] agreed to merge [[NBC]] and its sibling companies with Vivendi Universal's North American-based filmed entertainment assets, including Universal Pictures and Universal Television Group in a multibillion-dollar purchase, renaming the merged company [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]]. GE retained an 80% ownership stake in the new company, while Vivendi retained a 20% stake. NBC Universal officially took over as owner of USA and its sibling cable channels (except for Newsworld International) in 2004. That year, USA premiered the sci-fi series ''[[The 4400]]''.
In December 30, 2004, [[USA Kids]] is closed and at [[UPN]] is a child programming block called ´´[[UPN Afternoon Toonz]]`` first opened in September 1, 2003 

===="Characters Welcome", the "blue sky" era (2005–2016)====
In 2005, USA Network introduced a new logo and associated marketing campaign, "Characters Welcome". The slogan was designed to help emphasize the wide range of programming the network offered, and to help USA Network establish itself more prominently as a brand. The launch of the campaign featured promos themed around the daily lives of characters from the network's programs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/mr-robot-usa-network-brand-tagline-refresh-1201752745/ |title=USA Network Revamps Brand Image, Tagline for 'Mr. Robot' Era |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |date=2016-04-14 |work=Variety |access-date=2017-10-03 |language=en-US}}</ref> To contrast itself from the "grittier" offerings of other mainstream cable networks, USA Network's original programming during this era was marked by a focus on comedic and "optimistic" action and [[Comedy-drama|drama]] series, referred to as a "blue sky" approach. Notable examples of this programming strategy included ''[[Psych]]'' (2006) (which ran for eight seasons, becoming the network's longest-running series),<ref>{{Cite web|title='Psych' Series Finale: Everyone Gets Their Happy Ending|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/psych-finale-shawn-juliet-engaged-gus-moves-san-francisco-691230|access-date=2020-06-28|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Burn Notice (TV series)|Burn Notice]]'' (2007), and ''[[Royal Pains]]'' (2009).<ref name="wp-endofblue">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/07/07/farewell-royal-pains-and-hello-mr-robot-usas-era-of-blue-sky-shows-is-over/ |title=Farewell 'Royal Pains' and hello 'Mr. Robot': USA's era of 'blue-sky shows' is over |first=Emily |last=Yahr |date=July 7, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2009/11/13/usa-networks-secrets-success-0 |title=USA Network's secrets for success |first=Dan |last=Snierson |date=November 13, 2009 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref> In October 2005, ''Raw'' returned to USA after Viacom did not renew its broadcasting agreement with the WWE.

On May 13, 2007 (in advance of NBC's 2007–08 fall upfronts presentation), NBC Universal announced that new episodes of ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' would be moved to USA beginning with the drama's seventh season in the fall of 2007; episodes would then be re-aired later in the season on NBC, most likely to shore up any programming holes created by the cancellation of a failed new series. Although this is not the first time a broadcast series has moved to cable (USA had acquired first-run rights to the revival of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' from NBC in [[1987 in television|1987]], while ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' had moved beforehand from [[CBS]] to [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] in 1983), it marked the first time that a series which moved its first-run episodes from broadcast to cable television would continue to air episodes on a broadcast network while it was still a first-run program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20070513000000-allthree034law.html |title=All Three 'Law & Order'- Branded Series Will Continue On The Networks of NBC Universal |date=2007-05-13 |website=[[NBCUniversal]]}}{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> On December 7, 2007, it was announced that USA Network would continue broadcasting first-run episodes of ''Raw'' through at least 2010.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6510611.html?rssid=193 |title=USA Extends WWE Monday Night Raw Deal |last=Weprin |first=Alex |date=December 7, 2007 |magazine=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |access-date=2 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402085638/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6510611.html?rssid=193 |archive-date=April 2, 2008}}</ref>

===="We the Bold" (2016–2020)====
In April 2016, USA Network unveiled a new branding campaign and slogan, "We the Bold". The campaign was designed to reflect the channel's current focus on "rich, captivating stories about unlikely heroes who defy the status quo, push boundaries and are willing to risk everything for what they believe in".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/usa-network-tagline-brand-we-the-bold-mr-robot-1201737705/ |title=USA Network Unveils Revamped Brand Image, Tagline |first=Denise |last=Petski |date=April 14, 2016 |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> USA had quietly discontinued the "Characters Welcome" tagline in the lead-up to the rebranding, whose associated programming shift was led by the premieres of ''[[Mr. Robot]]'' and [[Colony (TV series)|''Colony'']]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the new programming strategy was designed to appeal to themes of "authenticity, resiliency, bravery and innovation".<ref name=":0" /> The ''Washington Post'' felt that the re-branding symbolically marked the end of USA's "blue sky" era, as the channel had been increasingly producing more "intense" series with darker themes.<ref name="lat-serialized" /><ref name="wp-endofblue" /> NBCUniversal marketing executive Alexandra Shapiro explained that the "Characters Welcome" campaign and associated programming was reflective of the "weirdly optimistic" mood of the network's key demographic at the time.<ref name=":0" />

In August 2016, NBCUniversal acquired the television rights to the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film franchise]] from 2018 through 2025, including the main film series and their spin-offs (with the first, ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', to have its cable premiere in 2019), and other content. On cable, the films are to primarily be aired by USA Network and Syfy, and the deal also includes the ability for Universal Parks & Resorts to offer "exclusive content and events" related to the franchise (Universal Parks had already been involved in ''[[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]]'' attractions). The deal succeeded one with [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported the deal was valued around $250 million over the length of the agreement, making it one of the highest-valued film franchise deals.<ref name="deadline-nbchp">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/08/comcast-nbcuniversal-deal-warner-bros-jk-rowling-wizarding-world-1201800057/ |title=NBCU Conjures Deal With Warner Bros For J.K.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by USA Network}}
USA Network has achieved a viewership foothold with its original programming; this began in the 1990s with initial hits such as ''[[Silk Stalkings]]'' and ''[[La Femme Nikita]]'', which were gradually followed in the following two decades by series such as ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[Shooter (TV series)|Shooter]]'', ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', ''[[Covert Affairs]]'', ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]'', ''[[Burn Notice]]'' and ''[[Royal Pains]]''. Most of its original series are scripted dramas, some of which incorporate [[dramedy|comedic elements]].

In addition to its original productions, the network airs syndicated reruns of current and former network series such as ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' (which spent the final four seasons of its run as a first-run program on USA) and ''NCIS''. The network also broadcasts a variety of films from the [[Universal Pictures]] library and select films from other movie studios (such as [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]]), airing primarily as part of its overnight and weekend schedule, and occasionally during primetime on nights when original programming or marathons of its acquired programs are not scheduled.

From 1984 to 2016, the network was the longtime home of the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]]. USA is also the home of [[WWE]]'s flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''; the series originally aired on the channel from its debut in January 1993 (when the promotion was known as the World Wrestling Federation; ''Raw'' itself replaced longtime Monday night standby ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]'') until the series moved to [[Paramount Network#The National Network, the New TNN, and WWE (2000–2003)|TNN]] in September 2000, before returning to the channel in October 2005. On January 7, 2016, WWE's second flagship program ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' moved to USA Network from [[Syfy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/04/07/usa-network-wwe-smackdown/|title='WWE SmackDown' moves to USA Network|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> In 2018, USA renewed its rights to ''Raw'' for five additional years, but lost the rights for ''SmackDown'' to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] beginning October 2019. In August 2019, WWE announced that its tertiary weekly program ''[[WWE NXT]]'' would return to USA Network on September 18, 2019, airing on Wednesday nights in a two-hour live format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/wwe-nxt-usa-network-deal-1203307413/|title=WWE's 'NXT' Moves to USA Network as Wrestling Competition Heats Up|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2019-08-20|website=Variety|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/26/wwe-smackdown-moving-fox-2019-monday-night-raw-renewed-usa/|title=WWE SmackDown Officially Moving to Fox as USA Renews Monday Night Raw|last=Swift|first=Andy|date=2018-06-26|website=TVLine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>

===Sports programming===
{{main|USA Sports}}

USA Network has a longstanding history with sports, dating back to its existence as the [[Madison Square Garden Network]]. The network carried [[Major League Baseball]] games on [[USA Thursday Game of the Week|Thursday nights]] from 1979 to 1983, and the ''[[NHL on USA]]'' ran from 1979 to 1985. ''[[College Football on USA]]'' ran from 1980 to 1986, and its telecast of the [[1981 Liberty Bowl]] was the first college [[bowl game]] to be exclusively broadcast on cable television. The ''[[NBA on USA]]'' also aired from 1979 to 1984, the first time that the NBA had a cable television partner. Professional wrestling company [[WWE]] has had a longstanding relationship with the network; ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]'' broadcast on USA from 1985-1993 until it was superseded by ''[[WWE Raw]]'' from 1993-2000, and again since 2005. ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' aired on the network from January 2016 until October 2019, when it moved to FOX.

For 17 years from 1981 to 1998, USA aired a weekly [[boxing]] show, ''[[USA Tuesday Night Fights]]'', which showcased bouts featuring up-and-coming boxers. ''[[Tennis on USA]]'' aired professional tournaments in the United States from 1984 to 2008, and was the longtime cable home of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] before its cable television rights moved to [[ESPN2]] and the [[Tennis Channel]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=US Open's cable TV deal leaves USA Network for ESPN |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/open-cable-tv-deal-leaves-usa-network-espn-article-1.332294 |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084601/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/open-cable-tv-deal-leaves-usa-network-espn-article-1.332294 |archive-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Closing Time for USA Network |url=http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/closing-time-for-usa-network/?_php=true&_type=blogs |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Kathleen |last=McElroy |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> The ''[[PGA Tour on USA]]'' covered the opening two rounds of the [[Masters Tournament]] from 1982 to 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsmediawatch.blogspot.com/2010/04/masters-numbers-game.html |title=Ratings For Each Round of The Masters Since '82 (First/Second Rounds Since '99) |date=April 8, 2010 |website=SportsMediaWatch |accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://classicsportsmedia.blogspot.com/2013/04/history-of-masters-golf-tournament-on.html |title=History of the Masters golf tournament on TV (1956-present) |last1=Haggar |first1=Jeff |date=9 April 2013 |work=Classic Sports TV and Media |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref><ref name="ESPN">{{cite web |title=ESPN will show first two rounds of 2008 Masters tournament |website=[[ESPN]] |date=2007-10-10 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=3056747 |accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> [[Ryder Cup]] matches from 1989 to 2010, and various other events.

The USA Network aired most games of the [[NFL Europe|World League of American Football]] (later NFL Europe) in its first two seasons of operation in 1991 and 1992; one innovation introduced for the network's WLAF telecasts was the in-helmet camera.

Upon the 2004 purchase of Vivendi Universal by NBC, USA's sports division was immediately merged into [[NBC Sports]]. Since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the network has broadcast select events from the [[Olympic Games]], as part of an expansion of NBCUniversal's broadcast rights to the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] that allowed several of the company's cable channels rights to telecast Olympic events live (some of which are later re-aired on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] on NBC as part of the network's primetime and late night Olympic coverage). USA Network also carried games from the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] in 2006 and 2010.

During the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], USA aired [[Premier League|English Premier League]] [[association football|soccer]] matches in lieu of sister channel [[NBCSN]], due to that channel's full devotion to carrying coverage of Olympic events. After ratings success with those matches, USA began to air mid-afternoon Saturday games weekly during the 2015–16 season. USA also participates in NBC Sports' broader effort of carrying all ten [[Survival Sunday]] matches across its numerous channels the second week of May each year. Starting in 2015, USA Network became used as an overflow feed for coverage of NHL playoff games that cannot be aired by either NBCSN or [[CNBC]]. In 2016, USA aired three [[NASCAR]] races (the [[Sprint Cup Series]] race at [[Watkins Glen International]] and two [[Xfinity Series]] races at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]] and [[Bristol Motor Speedway]]) due to NBC broadcasting the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/olympics-will-force-some-nascar-coverage-off-nbc-nbc-sports-669882/ |title=Olympics will force some NASCAR coverage off NBC/NBC Sports |last=Spencer |first=Lee |date=January 26, 2016 |website=[[Motorsport.com]] |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130175050/http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/olympics-will-force-some-nascar-coverage-off-nbc-nbc-sports-669882/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==High definition==
USA Network operates a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of the channel, that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format, and is available on nearly all pay-TV providers.

==International==

===Canada===
In February 2007, [[Shaw Communications]] submitted an application to the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), to carry the USA Network in [[Canada]] as a foreign service that would be eligible for carriage by domestic cable and satellite providers (and to automatically allow all English-language general interest cable networks from the United States into Canada). However, because of programming rights issues with other Canadian [[specialty service|specialty channels]], certain programs would be subjected to [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] restrictions, including ''[[WWE Raw]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1744.html |title=USA Network Could Be Coming To Canada |date=2007-02-02 |website=Channel Canada |accessdate=2013-06-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223063454/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1744.html |archive-date=2012-02-23 }}</ref>

In September 2007, the CRTC refused Shaw's request to carry USA Network in Canada on the basis that the channel carried too much programming that overlapped with the English language [[digital cable]] [[specialty channel]] [[Crime & Investigation (Canada)|Mystery TV]] (which is then owned by [[Canwest]] – later [[Shaw Media]] – and formerly, [[TVA (Canada)|Groupe TVA]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhome.ca/content/view/2000/206/ |title=CRTC refuses to allow USA Network in Canada |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=20 September 2007 |website=Digital Home Canada |access-date=2 November 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017174847/http://www.digitalhome.ca/content/view/2000/206/ |archive-date=October 17, 2007}}</ref> However, on September 20, the CRTC stated that it would reconsider their denial of the eligible foreign carriage proposal for USA Network at a later date, when Shaw instead offered to carry the channel on the digital cable tiers of its Shaw Cable systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/pb2007-104.htm |title=Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2007-104: Request to add USA Network to the lists of eligible satellite services for distribution on a digital basis |date=20 September 2007 |website=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> In spite of this, the CRTC has since rejected the restructured proposal on the basis that USA's programming would be competitive with Mystery TV.

Many of USA's original programs currently air on either [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] or [[CTV Drama Channel]]. [[WWE]] programming that airs on USA also airs on [[Rogers Media]]-owned [[Sportsnet 360]].

===South America===
Regional versions of USA Network previously operated in certain [[South America]]n countries (such as [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]); in September 2004, most of these services were renamed under the [[Universal Channel]] banner to take advantage of the more well-known brand, and to reduce the awkwardness of a channel branded with the initials of another nation.
