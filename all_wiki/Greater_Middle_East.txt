The '''Greater Middle East''', also known as '''[[MENA]]''' ([[Middle East|'''M'''iddle '''E'''ast]] and [[North Africa|'''N'''orth '''A'''frica]]) or '''MENAP''' ('''M'''iddle '''E'''ast, '''N'''orth Africa, [[Afghanistan|'''A'''fghanistan]], and [[Pakistan|'''P'''akistan]]), is a [[Political geography|political]] term, introduced in the early 2000s, denoting a set of contiguously connected countries stretching from the [[Maghreb]] region in the west all the way to [[Afghanistan]] in [[Central Asia]], [[Greece]] in [[Southern Europe]] and [[Pakistan]] in [[South Asia]].<ref>Ottaway, Marina & Carothers, Thomas (2004-03-29), [http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1480 The Greater Middle East Initiative: Off to a  False Start] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708030632/http://carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1480 |date=8 July 2018 }}, Policy Brief, ''Carnegie Endowment for International Peace'', 29, Pages 1–7</ref> Various countries of Central Asia and [[Transcaucasia]] are sometimes also grouped together with countries from [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. According to [[Andrew Bacevich]] in his book ''America's War for the Greater Middle East'' (2016), the career soldier and Professor Emeritus at [[Boston University]] states that this region is the [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] for a series of conflicts dating back to 1980, which heralded the start of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Since then, the U.S. has been involved in balancing conflicts amongst these culturally interconnected nations in order to further its interests in the region. The Greater Middle East is sometimes referred to as the "New Middle East"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-08-30|title=Silence, Please!

This term was more clearly defined to denote a specific region in the U.S. administration's preparatory work for the [[G8]] summit of 2004<ref name=Perthes>Perthes, V., 2004, [http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol11/0409_perthes.asp America's "Greater Middle East" and Europe: Key Issues for Dialogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115112943/http://www.mepc.org//journal_vol11/0409_perthes.asp |date=15 November 2008 }}, ''[[Middle East Policy]]'', Volume XI, No.3, Pages 85–97.</ref> as part of a proposal for sweeping change in the way [[Western world|the West]] deals with the [[Middle East]].

Former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] stated that a "political awakening" is taking place in this region which may be an indicator of the [[Polarity (international relations)|multi-polar]] world that is now developing. He alluded to the Greater Middle East as the "Global [[Balkans]]", and as a control lever on an area he refers to as [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], "The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo-strategic Imperatives" {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Cited in (Nazemroaya, 2006).</ref>
