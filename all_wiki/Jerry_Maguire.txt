==Plot==
Jerry Maguire ([[Tom Cruise]]) is a glossy 35-year-old [[sports agent]] working for Sports Management International (SMI). After experiencing a life-altering epiphany about his role as a sports agent, he writes a [[mission statement]] about perceived dishonesty in the sports management business and his desire to work with fewer clients to produce a better personal relationship with them. In turn, SMI management decides to send Bob Sugar ([[Jay Mohr]]), Jerry's protégé, to fire him. Consequently, Jerry and Sugar each call all of Jerry's clients to try and convince them not to hire the services of the other. Jerry speaks to [[Arizona Cardinals]] wide receiver Rod Tidwell ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]), one of his clients who is disgruntled with his contract. He needs a $10 million contract for his family to live on. Jerry informs him if he gets injured for the season, he will get no money from the Cardinals. Rod tests Jerry's resolve through a very long telephone conversation, while Sugar is able to persuade the rest of Jerry's clients to stick with SMI instead.

Leaving the office, Jerry announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone is willing to join him, to which only 26-year-old [[Single parent|single mother]] Dorothy Boyd ([[Renée Zellweger]]) agrees. Meanwhile, Frank "Cush" Cushman ([[Jerry O'Connell]]), a superstar [[quarterback]] prospect who expects to be the number one pick in the [[National Football League Draft|NFL Draft]], initially also stays with Jerry after he makes a visit to the Cushman home. However, Sugar is able to persuade Cushman and his father to sign with SMI over Jerry the night before the draft. Cushman's father implies they decided to sign with Sugar over Jerry due to Tidwell's race, stating they signed while Jerry was "in the lobby with the black fella".

After an argument, Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fiancée Avery ([[Kelly Preston]]). He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray ([[Jonathan Lipnicki]]), and eventually starts a relationship with her. Dorothy contemplates moving to San Diego as she has a secure job offer there; however, she and Jerry agree to get married. Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only client, who turns out to be very difficult to satisfy ("Show me the money"). Over the next several months, the two direct harsh criticism towards each other with Rod claiming that Jerry is not trying hard enough to get him a contract while Jerry claims that Rod is not proving himself worthy of the money for which he asks; one point of contention is that Rod is not very likable and comes across as aloof to the fans. Rod takes Jerry's advice to prove he is worthy of his contract. Rod is playing well and his team is winning. Meanwhile, Jerry's marriage with Dorothy gradually deteriorates and they eventually separate. 

During a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the Cardinals and the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Rod plays well but appears to receive a serious [[injury]] when catching a winning touchdown, securing a spot for the Cardinals in the playoffs. He recovers, however, and dances for the wildly cheering crowd. Afterwards, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of other athletes and sports agents and show how their relationship has progressed from a strictly business one to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement. He then flies back home to meet Dorothy, telling her that he loves her and wants her in his life, which she accepts, uttering "You had me at hello." Rod later appears on [[Roy Firestone]]'s sports show. Unbeknownst to him, Jerry has secured him an $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals allowing him to finish his pro football career in [[Arizona]]. The visibly emotional Rod proceeds to thank everyone and extends warm gratitude to Jerry. Jerry speaks with several other pro athletes, some of whom have read his earlier mission statement and respect his work with Rod. 

The movie ends with Ray throwing a baseball up in the air, surprising Jerry, who then discusses Ray's possible future career in the sports industry with Dorothy.

That commercial, which showcases the company in a positive light, ended up on the cutting room floor, while an angry tirade that included broadsides against Reebok was kept in. Reebok took the case to court and got an undisclosed amount of money in an out-of-court settlement. When the film aired on TV, the commercial was back in.}}</ref>  When the film aired on television, the Reebok commercial had been embedded into the film as originally agreed upon.<ref name="reeboknpr"/> The "Special Edition" DVD release of the film, which has the film's theatrical edit, includes the commercial as bonus content.

Former [[Green Bay Packers]] vice president Andrew Brandt stated that the film "accurately portrayed the cutthroat nature of the agent business, especially the lengths to which agents will go to retain or pilfer clients.

The film was later released onto [[Blu-ray]] on September 9, 2008, with the same special features found on the second disc of the DVD "Special Edition."<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Ben|title=Jerry Maguire Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Jerry-Maguire-Blu-ray/350/#Review|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=September 18, 2012|date=September 9, 2012}}</ref> in 2008, The film was triple packed with ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' and ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|''Born on the Fourth of July'']]'' by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]/[[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] in United Kingdom only.

==Legacy==
''Jerry Maguire'' spawned several popular quotations, including "Show me the Money!" (shouted repeatedly in a phone exchange between Rod Tidwell and Jerry Maguire), "You complete me," "Help me help you," "The key to this business is personal relationships" and "You had me at 'hello'" (said by [[Renée Zellweger]]'s Dorothy Boyd after a lengthy romantic plea by Jerry Maguire), and "Kwan," a word used by Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Tidwell meaning love, respect, community, and money (also spelled "quan" and "quawn") to illustrate the difference between himself and other football players: "Other football players may have the coin, but they won't have the 'Kwan'." These lines are largely attributed to [[Cameron Crowe]], director and screenwriter of the film. Zellweger said of filming the famous "hello" line, "Cameron had me say it a few different ways. It's so funny, because when I read it, I didn't get it — I thought it was a typo somehow. I kept looking at it. It was the one thing in the script that I was looking at going, 'Is that right? Can that be right? How is that right?' I thought, 'Is there a better way to say that? Am I not getting it? I just don't know how to do it.'"<ref name="newsday">[[Frank Lovece|Lovece, Frank]].

In June 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named ''Jerry Maguire'' one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list!|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012|author=Adam B.

In 2017, the [[NFL]], to commemorate the film's 20th anniversary edition, produced two "[[A Football Life]]" [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], detailing the careers of Rod Tidwell and Frank Cushman after the events of the film.  [[Beau Bridges]], [[Jay Mohr]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], and [[Aries Spears]] reprised their roles from the film, along with [[Roy Firestone]] and several real-life sports figures, including [[Shaquille O'Neal]].  According to the fictional history, Cushman retired after only four years due to a severe case of [[athlete's foot]], and devoted himself to charity work with children with the same affliction; Tidwell was offered an even more lucrative contract, but declined, declaring that the "quan" was not there, and he preferred to devote more time to his family.  The Tidwell mockumentary also features an adult Ray Boyd, inspired by Jerry and Rod to own his own boxing gym.
