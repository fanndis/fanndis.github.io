'''Gun politics''' is an area of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] defined by two primary opposing ideologies about civilian gun ownership. People who advocate for [[gun control]] support increasing regulations related to gun ownership; people who advocate for [[gun rights]] support decreasing regulations related to gun ownership. These groups often disagree on the interpretation of laws and court cases related to firearms as well as about the effects of firearms regulation on crime and public safety.<ref name=PGC2012Ch1>{{cite book |last=Spitzer |first=Robert J. |year=2012 |chapter=Policy Definition and Gun Control |title=The Politics of Gun Control |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSOquAAACAAJ |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Paradigm |isbn=9781594519871 |oclc=714715262 }}</ref>{{rp|7}} It is estimated that [[American gun ownership|U.S. civilians own 393 million firearms]],<ref>http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf Estimating Global CivilianHELD Firearms Numbers.

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment|title=Second Amendment|last=Strasser|first=Mr. Ryan|date=2008-07-01|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>

Debates regarding firearm availability and gun violence in the United States have been characterized by concerns about the right to bear arms, such as found in the [[Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], and the responsibility of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to serve the needs of its citizens and to prevent [[Gun violence in the United States|crime and deaths]].

Gun legislation, or non-legislation, in the United States, is augmented by judicial interpretations of the Constitution. In 1791, the United States adopted the Second Amendment, and in 1868 adopted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The effect of those two amendments on gun politics was the subject of landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions in 2008 (In ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), the Supreme Court affirmed for the first time that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms independent of service in a state militia and to use firearms for traditionally lawful purposes, including self-defense within the home. In so doing, it endorsed the so-called “individual-right” theory of the Second Amendment's meaning and rejected a rival interpretation, the “collective-right” theory, according to which the amendment protects a collective right of states to maintain militias or an individual right to keep and bear arms in connection with service in a militia.

==History==
[[File: Calamity jane.jpeg|upright|thumb|[[Calamity Jane]], notable pioneer frontierswoman and scout, at age 43. Photo by [[H.R. Locke]].]]
The American hunting tradition comes from a time when the United States was an agrarian, subsistence nation where hunting was a profession for some, an auxiliary source of food for some settlers, and also a deterrence to animal predators. A connection between shooting skills and survival among rural American men was in many cases a necessity and a '[[rite of passage]]' for those entering manhood.<ref name=PGC2012Ch1/>{{rp|9}} Today, hunting survives as a central sentimental component of gun culture as a way to control animal populations across the country, regardless of modern trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living.<ref name=PGC1995Ch1/>

Prior to the [[American Revolution]], there was neither budget nor manpower nor government desire to maintain a full-time army. Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried responsibility. Service in militia, including providing one's own ammunition and weapons, was mandatory for all men. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the mandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a [[regular army]]. Throughout the 19th century the institution of the organized civilian militia began to decline.<ref name=PGC2012Ch1/>{{rp|10}} The unorganized civilian militia, however, still remains even in current U.S. law, consisting of essentially everyone from age 17 to 45, while also including former military officers up to age 64, as codified in {{UnitedStatesCode|10|246}}.

Closely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition, with the need for self-protection pursuant to westward expansion and the extension of the [[American frontier]].<ref name=PGC2012Ch1/>{{rp|10–11}} Though it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century, "generations of Americans continued to embrace and glorify it as a living inheritance—as a permanent ingredient of this nation's style and culture".<ref name=Anderson1984>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Jervis |year=1984 |title=Guns in American Life |url=https://archive.org/details/gunsinamericanli00ande |url-access=registration |quote=ingredient. |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780394535982}}</ref>{{rp|21}}

===Colonial era through the Civil War===
[[File: Minute Man Statue Lexington Massachusetts cropped.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Gun politics date to Colonial America. (''Lexington Minuteman'', representing [[John Parker (Captain)|John Parker]], by [[Henry Hudson Kitson]] stands at the town green of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].)]] In the years prior to the [[American Revolution]], the British, in response to the colonists' unhappiness over increasingly direct control and taxation of the colonies, imposed a gunpowder embargo on the colonies in an attempt to lessen the ability of the colonists to resist British encroachments into what the colonies regarded as local matters. Two direct attempts to disarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering resentment of British interference into the fires of war.<ref name="Revwar75.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.revwar75.com/battles/primarydocs/williamsburg.htm |title=Primary Documents Relating to the Seizure of Powder at Williamsburg, VA, April 21, 1775 |last1=Reynolds |first1=Bart |date=September 6, 2006 |website= revwar75.com |location=Horseshoe Bay, Texas |publisher=John Robertson |type=transcription, amateur? |access-date=November 21, 2010}}</ref>

These two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Concord and Lexington militias, leading to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] of April 19, 1775, and the attempt, on April 20, to confiscate militia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg, Virginia, which led to the [[Gunpowder Incident]] and a face-off between [[Patrick Henry]] and hundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, and British seamen on the other. The Gunpowder Incident was eventually settled by paying the colonists for the powder.<ref name="Revwar75.com"/>

According to historian [[Saul Cornell]], states passed some of the first gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky's law to "curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in 1813." There was opposition and, as a result, the [[Individual and group rights|individual right]] interpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws, in keeping with this new "pervasive spirit of individualism." As noted by Cornell, "Ironically, the first gun control movement helped give birth to the first self-conscious gun rights ideology built around a constitutional right of individual self-defense."<ref name=Cornell2006>{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Saul |year=2006 |title=A Well-Regulated Militia: The Founding Fathers and the Origins of Gun Control in America |url=https://archive.org/details/wellregulatedmil00corn_0 |url-access=registration |location=New York City |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514786-5 |oclc=62741396}}</ref>{{rp|140–141}}

The individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose in ''[[Firearm case law in the United States#Bliss|Bliss v. Commonwealth]]'' (1822),<ref name="bliss v commonwealth">{{cite court |litigants=Bliss v. Commonwealth |vol=2 |reporter=Littell |opinion=90 |date=KY 1822 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wbardwel/public/nfalist/bliss_v_commonwealth.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211212146/https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wbardwel/public/nfalist/bliss_v_commonwealth.txt |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}</ref> which evaluated the right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section 28 of the Second Constitution of [[Kentucky]] (1799). The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state was interpreted as an individual right, for the case of a concealed sword cane. This case has been described as about "a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons [that] was violative of the Second Amendment".<ref name = "1967hearing">

The United States. Anti-Crime Program. Hearings Before Ninetieth Congress, First Session. Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1967, p. 246.</ref>

The first state court decision relevant to the "right to bear arms" issue was ''Bliss v. Commonwealth''. The Kentucky court held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire,..."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pierce |first=Darell R. |year=1982 |title=Second Amendment Survey |url=https://chaselaw.nku.edu/content/dam/chaselaw/docs/academics/lawreview/v10/nklr_v10n1.pdf |journal=Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=155–162 |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820035837/https://chaselaw.nku.edu/content/dam/chaselaw/docs/academics/lawreview/v10/nklr_v10n1.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{rp|161}}<ref>Two states, [[Alaska]] and [[Vermont]], do not require a permit or license for carrying a concealed weapon to this day, following Kentucky's original position.</ref>

Also during the Jacksonian Era, the first [[Individual and group rights|collective right]] (or group right) interpretation of the Second Amendment arose. In ''[[Firearm case law in the United States#Buzzard|State v. Buzzard]]'' (1842), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political right, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense",<ref name="state v buzzard">{{cite court |litigants=State v. Buzzard |vol=4 |reporter=Ark. (2 Pike) |opinion=18 |year=1842 |url=http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndcourt/state/191st.htm}}</ref> while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.

The Arkansas high court declared "That the words 'a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State', and the words 'common defense' clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Arkansas and the U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms." [[Joel Prentiss Bishop]]'s influential ''Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes'' (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine," as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.<ref name="state v buzzard"/><ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Bishop">{{cite book |author=Cornell, Saul |title=A Well-Regulated Militia – The Founding Fathers and the Origins of Gun Control in America |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York City |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wellregulatedmil00corn_0/page/188 188] |isbn=978-0-19-514786-5 |quote="Dillon endorsed Bishop's view that ''Buzzard's'' "Arkansas doctrine," not the libertarian views exhibited in ''Bliss, captured the dominant strain of American legal thinking on this question." |url=https://archive.org/details/wellregulatedmil00corn_0/page/188 }}</ref>

The two early state court cases, ''Bliss'' and ''Buzzard'', set the fundamental dichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment, i.e., whether it secured an individual right versus a collective right.{{citation needed|reason=Many state cases with opposing views, why are we calling out these two?|date=April 2014}}

===Post Civil War===
[[File:JABingham.jpg|thumb |upright |Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio, principal framer of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]]]
[[File:Opperguncontrol.jpg|thumb |Political cartoon by [[Frederick Burr Opper]] published in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine shortly after the [[assassination of James A. Garfield]]]]
In the years immediately following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the question of the rights of freed slaves to carry arms and to belong to the militia came to the attention of the federal courts. In response to the problems freed slaves faced in the Southern states, the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted.

When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was drafted, Representative [[John Bingham|John A. Bingham]] of [[Ohio]] used the Court's own phrase "privileges and immunities of citizens" to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of Rights under its protection and guard these rights against state legislation.<ref name="Kerrigan">{{cite journal |author=Kerrigan, Robert |title=The Second Amendment and related Fourteenth Amendment |date=June 2006 |format=PDF |url=http://secondamendment.and.fourteenth.googlepages.com}}</ref>

The debate in Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War also concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves. One particular concern was the disarming of former slaves.

The Second Amendment attracted serious judicial attention with the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era case of ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' which ruled that the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment did not cause the Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, to limit the powers of the State governments, stating that the Second Amendment "has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government."

Akhil Reed Amar notes in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which would include the Second Amendment, "following [[John Randolph Tucker (1823–1897)|John Randolph Tucker]]'s famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist [[Haymarket Riot]] case, ''[[August Spies|Spies]] v. Illinois''":

===20th century===
====First half of 20th century====
Since the late 19th century, with three key cases from the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|pre-incorporation era]], the U.S. Supreme Court consistently ruled that the Second Amendment (and the Bill of Rights) restricted only Congress, and not the States, in the regulation of guns.<ref>See [[U.S. v. Cruikshank]] 92 U.S. 542 (1876), [[Presser v. Illinois]] 116 U.S. 252 (1886), Miller v.

=====National Firearms Act=====
{{Main|National Firearms Act}}
The first major federal firearms law passed in the 20th century was the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934. It was passed after [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era gangsterism peaked with the [[Saint Valentine's Day massacre]] of 1929. The era was famous for criminal use of firearms such as the [[Thompson submachine gun]] (Tommy gun) and [[sawed-off shotgun]]. Under the NFA, machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and other weapons fall under the regulation and jurisdiction of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF) as described by [[Title II weapons|Title II]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Boston T.

The federal government then appealed directly to the Supreme Court. On appeal the federal government did not object to Miller's release since he had died by then, seeking only to have the trial judge's ruling on the unconstitutionality of the federal law overturned. Under these circumstances, neither Miller nor his attorney appeared before the Court to argue the case. The Court only heard argument from the federal prosecutor. In its ruling, the Court overturned the trial court and upheld the NFA.<ref>"[https://ssrn.com/abstract=960812 Telling Miller's Tale]", [[Glenn Reynolds|Reynolds, Glenn Harlan]] and Denning, Brannon P.</ref>

[[File: President Johnson signs Gun Control Act of 1968.jpg|thumb|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the Gun Control Act of 1968 into law.]]
The [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA) was passed after the assassinations of President [[John F. Kennedy]], Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]], and African-American activists [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the 1960s.<ref name=PGC2012Ch1/> The GCA focuses on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers. It also prohibits selling firearms to certain categories of individuals defined as "prohibited persons."

In 1986, Congress passed the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/99/s49 S. 49 (99th): Firearms Owners' Protection Act]. GovTrack.us.</ref> It was supported by the National Rifle Association and individual gun rights advocates because it reversed many of the provisions of the GCA and protected gun owners' rights.

The [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 led to enactment of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] (Brady Law) in 1993 which established the national background check system to prevent certain restricted individuals from owning, purchasing, or transporting firearms.<ref name="evidence from crime gun tracing">{{cite journal| author=Brian Knight|title=State Gun Policy and Cross-State Externalities: Evidence from Crime Gun Tracing| journal= Providence RI|date=September 2011}}</ref> In an article supporting passage of such a law, retired chief justice [[Warren E.

<blockquote>Americans also have a right to defend their homes, and we need not challenge that. Nor does anyone seriously question that the Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishing{{spaced ndash}}or to own automobiles. To 'keep and bear arms' for hunting today is essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of survival, as it was 200 years ago.

According to journalist [[Chip Berlet]], concerns about gun control laws along with outrage over two high-profile incidents involving the ATF ([[Ruby Ridge]] in 1992 and the [[Waco siege]] in 1993) mobilized the [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia movement]] of citizens who feared that the federal government would begin to confiscate firearms.<ref name=Berlet040901>{{cite journal |last=Berlet |first=Chip |date=September 1, 2004 |title=Militias in the Frame |journal=Contemporary Sociologists |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=514–521 |doi=10.1177/009430610403300506 |s2cid=144973852 |quote=All four books being reviewed discuss how mobilization of the militia movement involved fears of gun control legislation coupled with anger over the deadly government mishandling of confrontations with the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho and the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas.}}</ref><ref>More ''militia movement'' sources:

According to the authors of ''The Changing Politics of Gun Control'' (1998), in the late 1970s, the NRA changed its activities to incorporate political advocacy.<ref name=changingpolitics>{{cite book|title=The Changing Politics of Gun Control|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847686155|page=[https://archive.org/details/changingpolitics0000unse/page/159 159]|author1=Bruce, John M.|author2=Wilcox, Clyde|date=1998|url=https://archive.org/details/changingpolitics0000unse/page/159}}</ref> Despite the impact on the volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and the NRA-Political Victory Fund ranked as "one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections" as of 1998.<ref name=changingpolitics/> According to the authors of ''The Gun Debate'' (2014), the NRA taking the lead on politics serves the gun industry's profitability.

The [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] began in 1974 as Handgun Control Inc. (HCI). Soon after, it formed a partnership with another fledgling group called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH) – later known as the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]] (CSGV). The partnership did not last, as NCBH generally took a tougher stand on gun regulation than HCI.<ref name=Bruce-Wilcox1998Ch10>{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=Diana |year=1998 |chapter=Trying to Stop the Craziness of This Business: Gun Control Groups |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C&pg=PA172|editor1-last=Bruce |editor1-first=John M. |editor2-last=Wilcox |editor2-first=Clyde |title=The Changing Politics of Gun Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-8615-5 |oclc=833118449}}</ref>{{rp|186}} In the wake of the 1980 [[murder of John Lennon]], HCI saw an increase of interest and fundraising and contributed $75,000 to congressional campaigns. Following the Reagan assassination attempt and the resultant injury of [[James Brady]], [[Sarah Brady]] joined the board of HCI in 1985. HCI was renamed in 2001 to [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].<ref name="spitzerCh4">Spitzer, Robert J.: ''The Politics of Gun Control''. Chatham House Publishers, Inc., 1995</ref>

=====Centers for Disease Control (CDC) restriction=====
In 1996, Congress added language to the relevant appropriations bill which required "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] may be used to advocate or promote gun control."<ref>''Making omnibus consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes'' [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ208/pdf/PLAW-104publ208.pdf PUBLIC LAW 104–208—SEPT. 30, 1996 110 STAT. 3009–244 (PDF)]</ref> This language was added to prevent the funding of research by the CDC that gun rights supporters considered politically motivated and intended to bring about further gun control legislation. In particular, the NRA and other gun rights proponents objected to work supported by the [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control]], then run by [[Mark L.

Efforts by gun control advocates to renew the ban failed, as did attempts to replace it after it became defunct.

The NRA opposed bans on handguns in Chicago, Washington D.C., and San Francisco while supporting the [[NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007]] (also known as the School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act), which strengthened requirements for background checks for firearm purchases.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Schulte |first2=Brigid |date=December 20, 2007 |title=Congress Passes Bill to Stop Mentally Ill From Getting Guns |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/19/AR2007121902279.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=Congress yesterday approved legislation that would help states more quickly and accurately identify potential firearms buyers with mental health problems that disqualify them from gun ownership under federal law....

Besides the GOA, other national gun rights groups continue to take a stronger stance than the NRA. These groups include the Second Amendment Sisters, Second Amendment Foundation, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, and the [[Pink Pistols]]. New groups have also arisen, such as the [[Students for Concealed Carry]], which grew largely out of safety-issues resulting from the creation of [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990|gun-free zones]] that were legislatively mandated amidst a response to widely publicized [[school shootings]].

In 2001, in ''[[United States v. Emerson]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] became the first [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals court]] to recognize an individual's right to own guns. In 2007, in ''[[Parker v. District of Columbia]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C.

====Smart guns====
[[Smart gun]]s only fire when in the hands of the owner, a feature gun control advocates say eliminates accidental firings by children, and the risk of hostile persons (such as prisoners, criminal suspects, an opponent in a fight, or an enemy soldier) grabbing the gun and using it against the owner. Gun rights advocates fear mandatory smart gun technology will make it more difficult to fire a gun when needed.

[[Smith & Wesson]] reached a settlement in 2000 with the administration of President Bill Clinton, which included a provision for the company to develop a [[smart gun]]. A consumer boycott organized by the NRA and NSSF nearly drove the company out of business and forced it to drop its smart gun plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/smith-and-wesson-took-the-lead-on-safety-2012-12|title=A Major Gun Company Became An Industry Pariah After It Made Its Guns Safer|website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=462027559|title=Will Obama's Action Create A Market For 'Smart' Guns?|website=Npr.org|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

====''District of Columbia v. Heller''====
{{Main|District of Columbia v. Heller}}
In June 2008, in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'', the Supreme Court upheld by a 5–4 vote the ''Parker'' decision striking down the D.C. gun law. ''Heller'' ruled that Americans have an individual right to possess firearms, irrespective of membership in a militia, "for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."<ref name=DCvHeller>{{cite web |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0578.htm |title=OLR Research Report: Summary of DC v. Heller |last=Rose |first=Veronica |date=October 17, 2008 |website=cga.ct.gov |access-date=April 2, 2014}}</ref> However, in delivering the majority opinion, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] Writing for the majority, Antonin Scalia argued that the operative clause of the amendment, “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,” codifies an individual right derived from English common law and codified in the English Bill of Rights (1689). The majority held that the Second Amendment's preamble, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,” is consistent with this interpretation when understood in light of the framers’ belief that the most effective way to destroy a citizens’ militia was to disarm the citizens. The majority also found that United States v. Miller supported an individual-right rather than a collective-right view, contrary to the dominant 20th-century interpretation of that decision. (In Miller, the Supreme Court unanimously held that a federal law requiring the registration of sawed-off shotguns did not violate the Second Amendment because such weapons did not have a “reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.”) Finally, the court held that, because the framers understood the right of self-defense to be “the central component” of the right to keep and bear arms, the Second Amendment implicitly protects the right “to use arms in defense of hearth and home.”

<blockquote>has been the one area where I feel that I've been most frustrated and most stymied, it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings. And you know, if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it's less than 100. If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it's in the tens of thousands. And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing. But it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months.<ref name="bbc2015int">{{cite web

On September 25, 2013, [[Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] signed the ATT on behalf of the [[Obama administration]]. This was a reversal of the position of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] which had chosen not to participate in the treaty negotiations. Then in October a bipartisan group of 50 [[United States Senate|senators]] and 181 [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]] released concurrent letters to President [[Barack Obama]] pledging their opposition to ratification of the ATT. The group was led by Senator [[Jerry Moran]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Kansas]]) and Representatives [[Mike Kelly (Pennsylvania)|Mike Kelly]] (R-[[Pennsylvania]]) and [[Collin Peterson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Minnesota]]). Following these two letters, four Democratic senators sent a separate letter to the President stating that "because of unaddressed concerns that this Treaty's obligations could undermine our nation's sovereignty and the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans [they] would oppose the Treaty if it were to come before the U.S. Senate." The four Senators are [[Jon Tester]] (D-[[Montana]]), [[Max Baucus]] (D-Montana), [[Heidi Heitkamp]] (D-North Dakota), and [[Joe Donnelly]] (D-Indiana).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=U.S. Senate and House send letter rejecting UN Arms Trade Treaty|journal=American Rifleman|date=January 2014|volume=162|issue=1|page=101}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Democratic Senators Oppose U.N.

Supporters of the treaty claim that the treaty is needed to help protect millions around the globe in danger of human rights abuses. [[Frank Jannuzi]] of [[Amnesty International USA]] states, "This treaty says that nations must not export arms and ammunition where there is an 'overriding risk' that they will be used to commit serious human rights violations. It will help keep arms out of the hands of the wrong people: those responsible for upwards of 1,500 deaths worldwide every day."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkie|first=Christina|title=Arms Trade Treaty, Signed By John Kerry, Opens New Front In Senate Battle Over Gun Control|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/25/arms-trade-treaty-gun-control_n_3989999.html|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=December 24, 2013|date=September 25, 2013}}</ref> Secretary Kerry was quoted as saying that his signature would "help deter the transfer of conventional weapons used to carry out the world's worst crimes."<ref>{{cite web|last=UPI staff|title=Support grows for U.N. arms treaty|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/10/15/Support-grows-for-UN-arms-treaty/UPI-98811381850844/|agency=United Press International|access-date=December 24, 2013}}</ref> As of December 2013, the U.S. has not ratified or acceded to the treaty.

==== Proposals made by the Trump Administration ====
Following the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas shooting]] in October 2017 and the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in February 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] and the DoJ sought ways to ban [[bump fire|bump stocks]], devices that can be used to make semi-automatic weapons fire as fully automatic ones as used in both shootings.

In a 2015 study conducted by the [[Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence]], state gun laws were examined based on various policy approaches, and were scored on grade-based and ranked scales.<ref>"Law Center To Prevent Gun Violence | Because Smart Gun Laws Save Lives". Smartgunlaws.org. N.p., 2017. Web. 16 May 2017.</ref> States were rated positively for having passed stricter measures and stronger gun laws. Positive points were also given for states that required background checks on all sales of firearms and that limited bulk firearms purchases, and that prohibited sales of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and that carried out stricter evaluations of applications for handgun concealed-carry licenses, especially in the context of prohibited domestic-violence offenders. Meanwhile, points were deducted from states with laws that expanded access to guns, or that allowed concealed carry in public areas (particularly schools and bars) without a permit, or that passed "Stand Your Ground Laws" — which remove the duty to retreat and instead allow people to shoot potential assailants. Eventually, states were graded indicating the overall strengths or weakness of their gun laws. The ten states with the strongest gun laws ranked from strongest starting with California, then New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, Illinois, Rhode Island and finally Michigan. The states with weakest gun laws were ranked as follows: South Dakota, Arizona, Mississippi, Vermont, Louisiana, Montana, Wyoming, Kentucky, Kansas, and Oklahoma. A comparable study of state laws was also conducted in 2016.<ref name=" LCPGV">{{cite web|title=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence - Annual Gun Law State Scorecard 2016|url=http://gunlawscorecard.org/|website=gunlawscorecard.org|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> Based on these findings, The Law Center concluded that comprehensive gun laws reduce gun violence deaths, whereas weaker guns laws increase gun-related deaths. Furthermore, among different kinds of legislation, universal background checks were the most effective at reducing gun-related deaths.<ref>"It's Getting Harder To Argue That Strong Gun Laws Don't Have An Effect On Gun Violence".

==Political arguments==
===Rights-based arguments===
Rights-based arguments involve the most fundamental question about gun control: to what degree the government has the authority to regulate guns.

====Fundamental right====
[[File:World map of civilian gun ownership - 2nd color scheme.svg|thumb|280px|Map of civilian guns per 100 people by country from the ''Small Arms Survey 2017.''<ref name=SmallArmsSurvey2017/>]]
The primary author of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], [[James Madison]], considered them — including a right to keep and bear arms — to be fundamental. In 1788, he wrote: "The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion."<ref>Williams, Tony. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YHVwmVKjhaoC&pg=PA174 America's Beginnings: The Dramatic Events that Shaped a Nation's Character]'', p. 174 (Rowman & Littlefield, 2010).</ref><ref>Roth, Timothy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3xalbLlTmWAC&pg=PA16 Morality, Political Economy and American Constitutionalism]'', p. 16 (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007).</ref>

The view that gun ownership is a [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]] was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008). The Court stated: "By the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects."<ref name=Utter>Utter, Glenn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XTRMSb83AbwC&pg=PA145 Culture Wars in America: A Documentary and Reference Guide], p. 145 (ABC-CLIO, November 12, 2009).</ref> The Court observed that the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] had listed a right to arms as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.

When the Court interpreted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in ''[[McDonald v. City of Chicago]]'' (2010), it looked to the year 1868, when the amendment was ratified and said that most states had provisions in their constitutions explicitly protecting this right. The Court concluded: "It is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/28/AR2010062802134.html|title=Supreme Court affirms fundamental right to bear arms|first=Robert Barnes and Dan|last=Eggen|date=June 29, 2010|access-date=October 4, 2017|website=Washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>Carper, Donald and McKinsey, John.

====Second Amendment rights====
The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted on December 15, 1791, states:

<blockquote>A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment|title=Second Amendment|first=LII|last=Staff|date=February 5, 2010|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Prior to ''District of Columbia v. Heller'', in the absence of a clear court ruling, there was a debate about whether or not the Second Amendment included an [[Individual and group rights|individual right]].<ref name=CornellWex2A>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment |title=Legal Information Institute (LII): Second Amendment |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 26, 2014 |website=law.cornell.edu |publisher=Cornell University Law School |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref> In ''Heller'', the Court concluded that there is indeed such a right, but not an unlimited one.<ref name=CornellWex2A /> Although the decision was not unanimous, all justices endorsed an individual right viewpoint but differed on the scope of that right.<ref name=HLR>See [http://harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/case_comment_intro122.pdf "District of Columbia v.

Before ''Heller'' gun rights advocates argued that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns. They stated that the phrase "the people" in that amendment applies to individuals rather than an organized collective and that the phrase "the people" means the same thing in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th Amendments.<ref name=halbrook1987>{{cite book |last=Halbrook |first=Stephen P. |title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right |year=1987 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=978-0-945999-28-7}}</ref>{{rp|55–87}}<ref name="Story, Joseph 1986 p.319-320">Story, Joseph, A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States(1986) Regnery Gateway, Chicago, Illinois, p.319-320, {{ISBN|0-89526-796-9}}</ref><ref name="Hardy, David T 1986 pp.64-93">Hardy, David T.

[[Political scientist]] [[Robert Spitzer (political scientist)|Robert Spitzer]] and Supreme Court law clerk [[Gregory P.

After the ''Heller'' decision there was an increased amount of attention on whether or not the Second Amendment applies to the states. In 2010 in the case of ''[[McDonald v. City of Chicago|McDonald v. City Chicago]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment's provisions do apply to the states as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment.

====Defense of self and state====
[[File:Gun owners as a percentage of each state's population in 2007.svg|thumb|Gun owners as a percentage of each [[U.S. state]]'s population in 2007]]
The eighteenth-century English jurist [[William Blackstone]] (b. 1723), whose writings influenced the drafters of the U.S. Constitution,<ref>Bartholomees, J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eL_qtPlNHaYC&pg=PA267 The U.S. Army War College Guide to National Security Issues: National security policy and strategy]'', p. 267 (Strategic Studies Institute, 2010).</ref> called [[self-defense]] "the primary law of nature" which (he said) man-made law cannot take away.<ref>Dizard, Jan et al. ''Guns in America: A Reader'', p. 177 (NYU Press, 1999).</ref> Following Blackstone, the American jurist [[St. George Tucker]] (b. 1752) wrote that "the right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments, it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible."<ref name=Vile>Vile, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U6uJ-oWsZFYC&pg=PA766 Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia]'', Volume 1, p. 766 (ABC-CLIO, 2003).</ref>

In both ''Heller'' (2008) and ''McDonald'' (2010) the Supreme Court deemed that the right of self-defense is at least partly protected by the United States Constitution. The court left details of that protection to be worked out in future court cases.<ref>Epstein, Lee and Walk, Thomas. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmPKNI2z5-AC&pg=PA396 Constitutional Law: Rights, Liberties and Justice]'', 8th Edition, p. 396 (SAGE 2012).</ref>

The two primary interest groups regarding this issue are the Brady Campaign and the National Rifle Association.<ref name=Wilson>Wilson, Harry.

Heller Means for the Future of Gun Laws (PDF)]", A White Paper by the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence (October 20, 2008. Retrieved February 1, 2014):

<blockquote>After Heller, the issue is: What reasonable gun laws should be passed that will make our families and communities safer, without infringing on the right of law-abiding persons to possess guns for self-defense? This framing of the issue will move the debate from the extremes to the middle and, as such, is highly favorable to progress toward a new, sensible, national gun policy.</blockquote>

====Security against tyranny====
Another fundamental political argument associated with the right to keep and bear arms is that banning or even regulating gun ownership makes government [[tyranny]] more likely.<ref>Cook, Philip and Goss, Kristin.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. 1957</ref><ref>Spitzer, Robert. ''[https://archive.org/details/righttobeararmsr0000spit/page/61 Right to Bear Arms: Rights and Liberties Under the Law]'', p. 61 (ABC-CLIO, 2001).</ref> He stated, "A legal right of the citizen to wage war on the government is something that cannot be admitted. ... In the urban industrial society of today, a general right to bear efficient arms so as to be enabled to resist oppression by the government would mean that gangs could exercise an extra-legal rule which would defeat the whole Bill of Rights."

===Public policy arguments===
Public policy arguments are based on the idea that the central purpose of government is to establish and maintain order. This is done through public policy, which Blackstone defined as "the due regulation and domestic order of the kingdom, whereby the inhabitants of the State, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighborhood, and good manners, and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective stations."<ref name=PGC2012Ch1/>{{rp|2–3}}

====Gun violence debate====

{{Main|Gun violence in the United States}}
The public policy debates about gun violence include discussions about firearms deaths – including homicide, suicide, and unintentional deaths – as well as the impact of gun ownership, criminal and legal, on gun violence outcomes. After the tragedy of [[Sandy Hook]], the majority of people, including gun owners and non-gun owners, wanted the government to spend more money in order to improve mental health screening and treatment, to deter gun violence in America. In the United States in 2009 there were 3.0 recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants. The U.S. ranks 28 in the world for gun homicides per capita.<ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list |title=Gun homicides and gun ownership listed by country |work=The Guardian |date=July 22, 2012 |access-date=April 28, 2013 |location=London}}</ref> A U.S. male aged 15–24 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia).<ref name=" Forbes"/> In 2013, there were 33,636 [https://gun-control.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=006094 gun-related deaths], in the United States.

Within the gun politics debate, gun control and gun rights advocates disagree over the role that guns play in [[crime]].

Gun Control has limited the availability of firearms to many individuals. Some of the limitations include any persons who have been dishonorably discharged from the military, any person that has renounced their United States citizenship, has been declared mentally ill or committed to a mental institution, is a fugitive, is a user or addicted to a controlled substance, and anyone illegally in the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Public Law 99-308|last=99th Congress|publisher=U.S. Government|date=May 19, 1986}}</ref> Still, in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control, there were 19,362 homicides in the United States.

====Criminal violence====
{{See also|Crime in the United States|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}
There is an open debate regarding a [[Causal reasoning|causal connection]] (or the [[Causal inference|lack of one]]) between gun control and its effect on gun violence and other crimes. The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership are debated by criminologists. Research difficulties include the difficulty of accounting accurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired and jurisdictional differences in the definition of "crime." Furthermore,

Such research is also subject to a more fundamental difficulty affecting all research in this field: the effectiveness of the [[Criminal Law]] in preventing crime in general or in specific cases is inherently and notoriously difficult to prove and measure, and thus issues in establishing a causal link between gun control or particular gun control policies and violent crime must be understood to be an aspect of a more general empirical difficulty, which pervades the fields of [[Criminology]] and [[Law]] at large. It is not simple, for example, to prove a causal connection between the laws against murder and the prevailing murder rates, either. Consequently, this general background must be appreciated when discussing the causal and empirical issues here. [[File: Alexis Navy Yard 012 1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg|thumb|Photo from a security camera from the [[Washington Navy Yard shooting]].]]

A study published in ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' in 1997 concluded that the amount of gun-related crime and deaths is affected more by the state of the area in terms of unemployment, alcohol problems and drug problems instead of the laws and regulations.<ref>G. Kwon, Ik-Whan, Scott, Bradley, Safranski, Scott R. and Bae, Muen, 'The Effectiveness of Gun Control Laws: Multivariate Statistical Analysis' in The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Vol. 56, No. 1 (1997), pp. 41–50.</ref> This study analyzed statistics gathered on the amount of gun crime in states with strict and lenient gun policies and determined that the amount of gun crime is related to how to run down economically an area is.

A 2003 CDC study determined "The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes."<ref name=CDC2003/> They go on to state "a finding of insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness but rather as an indicator that additional research is needed before an intervention can be evaluated for its effectiveness."

In 2009, the [[Public Health Law Research]] program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthlawresearch.org|title=Home - Public Health Law Research|website=Publichealthlawresearch.org|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> an independent organization, published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health, that concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun safety. Among their findings:
* There is not enough evidence to establish the effectiveness of "shall issue" laws, as distinct from "may issue" laws, as a public health intervention to reduce violent crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publichealthlawresearch.org/product/%E2%80%9Cshall-issue%E2%80%9D-concealed-weapons-laws/%22shall-issue%22-concealed-weapons-law|title="Shall Issue" Concealed Weapons Laws, Public Health Law Research 2009|website=Publichealthlawresearch.org|access-date=October 4, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Gary Kleck]], a criminologist at [[Florida State University]], and his colleague [[Marc Gertz]], published a study in 1995 estimating that approximately 2.5 million American adults used their gun in self-defense annually. The incidents that Kleck extrapolated based on his questionnaire results generally did not involve the firing of the gun, and he estimates that as many as 1.9 million of those instances involved a handgun.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gary |first1=Kleck |last2=Marc |first2=Gertz |date=1995 |title=Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol86/iss1/8/ |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |language=en |volume=86 |issue=1}}</ref>{{rp|164}} These studies have been subject to criticism on a number of methodological and logical grounds.<ref name=" Kleck">{{cite web|url=http://www.guncite.com/kleckjama01.html|title=Risks and Benefits of Keeping a Gun in the Home...[Fulltext, Aug 5 JAMA. 1998;280:473–475] (c) AMA 1998|website=Guncite.com|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

Another study from the same period, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), estimated 65,000 DGUs ([[Defensive gun use]]) annually. The NCVS survey differed from Kleck's study in that it only interviewed those who reported a threatened, attempted, or completed victimization for one of six crimes: rape, robbery, assault, burglary, non-business larceny, and motor vehicle theft. A National Research Council report said that Kleck's estimates appeared to be exaggerated and that it was almost certain that "some of what respondents designate[d] as their own self-defense would be construed as aggression by others".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTlSNjuFvioC |title=Understanding and Preventing Violence |last1=Council |first1=National Research |last2=Education |first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and |last3=Education |first3=Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and |last4=Behavior |first4=Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent |date=1993-02-01 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=9780309054768 |pages=266 |language=en}}</ref>

Research based on the NCVS data set largely confirms Hemenway's earlier results, showing approximately 55,000 uses of a firearm in self-defense from a violent crime in the United States for the 3-year period of 2013–2015.<ref name="vpc.org"/>

In a review of his own research, Kleck determined that of 41 studies half of them found a connection between gun ownership and homicide but these were usually the least rigorous studies. Only six studies controlled at least six statistically significant confound variables, and none of them showed a significant positive effect. Eleven macro-level studies showed that crime rates increase gun levels (not vice versa). The reason that there is no opposite effect may be that most owners are noncriminals and that they may use guns to prevent violence.<ref name=jocj15>[https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/82971996/216887532/name/Kleck_Journal+of+Criminal+Justice_2015.pdf The Impact of Gun Ownership Rates on Crime Rates: A Methodological Review of the Evidence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809082758/https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/82971996/216887532/name/Kleck_Journal+of+Criminal+Justice_2015.pdf |date=2016-08-09 }}, Gary Kleck, Journal of Criminal Justice 43 (2015) 40–48.</ref>

Commenting on the external validity of Kleck's report, [[David Hemenway]], director of the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard Injury Control Research Center]], said: "Given the number of victims allegedly being saved with guns, it would seem natural to conclude that owning a gun substantially reduces your chances of being murdered.

One study found that homicide rates as a whole, especially those as a result of firearms use, are not always significantly lower in many other developed countries.

===State laws and constitutions===
{{Main|Gun laws in the United States by state}}
In addition to federal gun laws, all U.S. states and some local jurisdictions have imposed their own firearms restrictions. Each of the fifty states has its own laws regarding guns.

Provisions in State constitutions vary.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm |title=State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions |website=www2.law.ucla.edu |access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> For example, Hawaii's constitution simply copies the text of the Second Amendment verbatim,<ref name="hicon">{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/lrb/con/conart1.html|title=Hawaii State Constitution Article 1, § 17|website=Hawaii.gov|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> while North Carolina and South Carolina begin with the same but continue with an injunction against maintaining standing armies.<ref name="nccon">{{cite web|url=http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/preamble.HTM#I|title=North Carolina State Constitution Article 1, § 30|website=Statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us|access-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218165709/http://statelibrary.dcr.state.nc.us/nc/stgovt/preamble.HTM#I|archive-date=February 18, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="sccon">{{cite web |url=http://www.scstatehouse.net/scconstitution/a01.htm |title=2010 South Carolina Constitution (Unannotated) |access-date=2014-01-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125195156/http://www.scstatehouse.net/scconstitution/a01.htm |archive-date=November 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Alaska also begins with the full text of the Second Amendment, but adds that the right "shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State".<ref name="akcon">{{cite web|url=http://ltgov.state.ak.us/constitution.php?section=1|title=Alaska State Constitution Article 1, § 19|website=Ltgov.state.ak.us|access-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130130656/http://ltgov.state.ak.us/constitution.php?section=1|archive-date=November 30, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rhode Island subtracts the first half of the Second Amendment, leaving only, "[t]he right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed".<ref name="ricon">{{cite web|url=http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/RiConstitution/C01.html|title=Rhode Island State Constitution Article 1, § 22|website=Rilin.state.ri.us|access-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208075349/http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/RiConstitution/C01.html|archive-date=February 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The majority of the remaining states' constitutions differ from the text of the U.S. Constitution primarily in their clarification of exactly to whom the right belongs or by the inclusion of additional, specific protections or restrictions.
