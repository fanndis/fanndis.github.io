'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by American pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] slated to take place at the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], in [[London]], between July 13, 2009 and March 6, 2010. However, the concerts never took place, as Jackson [[Death of Michael Jackson|died]] on June 25, 2009.

Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the O2 Arena, and said it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that used an entire commercial break when aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], setting a record for that network. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million.

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

This will be the final curtain call."<ref name="independent1" /> Immediately after the conference, a statement confirmed that Jackson would play 10 shows at the London [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], "performing in London for the last time". The statement promised "an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts".<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4944927/Michael-Jackson-announces-comeback-gigs.html|title=Michael Jackson announces comeback gigs|last=Khan|first=Urmee|date=March 6, 2009|accessdate=March 6, 2009|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}</ref>

Jackson had not toured since the 1997 [[HIStory Tour|HIStory tour]].<ref name=":0" /> In 2005, he was acquitted of [[Trial of Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse charges]], and kept out of the public eye in the years following.

Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire [[commercial break]] period on [[ITV London]] during ''[[Dancing on Ice (Series 4)|Dancing on Ice]]'', the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.<ref>

On May 20, it was announced that the first concert would be pushed back five days to July 13 and three other July dates would be reslated for March 2010.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 Arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}</ref> The case was in limbo as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.
