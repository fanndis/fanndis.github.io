'''In vitro fertilisation''' ('''IVF''') is a process of [[fertilisation]] where an [[ovum|egg]] is combined with [[spermatozoon|sperm]] outside the body, [[in vitro]] ("in glass"). The process involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's [[Ovulation cycle|ovulatory process]], removing an ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's [[ovary|ovaries]] and letting sperm fertilise them in a liquid in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg ([[zygote]]) undergoes [[embryo culture]] for 2–6 days, it is implanted in the same or another woman's [[uterus]], with the intention of establishing a successful [[pregnancy]].

IVF is a type of [[assisted reproductive technology]] used for [[infertility]] treatment and [[gestational surrogacy]]. A fertilised egg may be implanted into a surrogate's uterus, and the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate. Some countries have banned or otherwise regulate the availability of IVF treatment, giving rise to [[fertility tourism]]. Restrictions on the availability of IVF include costs and age, in order for a woman to carry a healthy pregnancy to term. IVF is generally not used until less invasive or expensive options have failed or been determined unlikely to work.

In July 1978, [[Louise Brown]] was the first child successfully born after her mother received IVF treatment. Brown was born as a result of natural-cycle IVF, where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in [[Royton]], Oldham, England. [[Robert G. Edwards]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2010. The physiologist co-developed the treatment together with [[Patrick Steptoe]] and embryologist [[Jean Purdy]] but the latter two were not eligible for consideration as they had died and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.<ref name="Moreton">{{cite news | title = World's first test-tube baby Louise Brown has a child of her own | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/worlds-first-testtube-baby-louise-brown-has-a-child-of-her-own-432080.html | newspaper = Independent | access-date = 21 May 2010 | quote = The 28-year-old, whose pioneering conception by in-vitro fertilisation made her famous around the world.

==Terminology==
The Latin term [[in vitro]], meaning "in glass", is used because early biological experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living organism were carried out in glass containers, such as beakers, test tubes, or Petri dishes. Today, the scientific term "in vitro" is used to refer to any biological procedure that is performed outside the organism in which it would normally have occurred, to distinguish it from an [[in vivo]] procedure (such as [[insemination|in vivo fertilisation]]), where the tissue remains inside the living organism in which it is normally found.

A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, "test tube babies", refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called [[test tube]]s, that are commonly used in chemistry and biology labs. However, IVF is usually performed in [[Petri dish]]es, which are both wider and shallower and often used to cultivate cultures.

In a broader sense, IVF is a form of [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART).

==Medical uses==

===Indications===
{{see|Infertility}}

IVF may be used to overcome [[female infertility]] when it is due to problems with the [[fallopian tube]]s, making in vivo fertilisation difficult. It can also assist in [[male infertility]], in those cases where there is a defect in [[sperm quality]]; in such situations [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) may be used, where a sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm has difficulty penetrating the egg. In these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated, the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF.

According to UK's {{abbrlink|NICE|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence}} guidelines, IVF treatment is appropriate in cases of unexplained infertility for women who have not conceived after 2 years of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.<ref name=NICE2013>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]];– Issued: February 2013</ref>

In women with [[anovulation]], it may be an alternative after 7–12 attempted cycles of [[ovulation induction]], since the latter is expensive and more easy to control.<ref name="WeissBraam2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss NS, Braam S, König TE, Hendriks ML, Hamilton CJ, Smeenk JM, Koks CA, Kaaijk EM, Hompes PG, Lambalk CB, van der Veen F, Mol BW, van Wely M | display-authors = 6 | title = How long should we continue clomiphene citrate in anovulatory women? | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 29 | issue = 11 | pages = 2482–6 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25164024 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deu215 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Success rates===
IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures that result in a favourable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the [[pregnancy rate]], or the number of live births, called the [[live birth rate]]. The success rate depends on variable factors such as maternal age, cause of infertility, embryo status, reproductive history, and lifestyle factors.

Maternal age: Younger candidates of IVF are more likely to get pregnant. Women older than 41 are more likely to get pregnant with a donor egg.<ref name="mayoclinic.org">{{Cite web|title = In vitro fertilization (IVF) Results – Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/basics/results/prc-20018905|website = www.mayoclinic.org|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref>

Reproductive history: Women who have been previously pregnant are in many cases more successful with IVF treatments than those who have never been pregnant.<ref name="mayoclinic.org"/>

Due to advances in reproductive technology, live birth rates by cycle five of IVF have increased from 76% in 2005 to 80% in 2010 despite a reduction in the number of embryos being transferred (which decreased the multiple birth rate from 25% to 8%).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wade JJ, MacLachlan V, Kovacs G | title = The success rate of IVF has significantly improved over the last decade | journal = The Australian & New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 473–6 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26174052 | doi = 10.1111/ajo.12356 | s2cid = 22535393 }}</ref>

====Live birth rate====
The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]];  multiple-order births, such as twins and triplets, are counted as one pregnancy. A 2017 summary compiled by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data:<ref name="2012 Clinic Summary Report">{{cite web|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|title=2017 Clinic Summary Report|work=Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204120048/https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|archive-date=4 February 2020|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>

|}

In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.<ref name=canadians/> Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.<ref name=r1>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/art/ART2006/section1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331150713/http://www.cdc.gov/art/ART2006/section1.htm|archive-date=31 March 2009|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|title=2006 Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Report: Section 2|access-date=25 March 2009}}</ref> Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, since it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples.

The live birth rates using donor eggs are also given by the SART and include all age groups using either fresh or thawed eggs:<ref name="2012 Clinic Summary Report" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Fresh donor egg embryos !! Thawed donor egg embryos
|-
| Live birth rate (%) || 40.3 || 36.3
|}

Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The SART summarised 2008–9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age.

IVF attempts in multiple cycles result in increased cumulative live birth rates. Depending on the demographic group, one study reported 45% to 53% for three attempts, and 51% to 71% to 80% for six attempts.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99654924 Study: Sixth Time May Be Charm For In Vitro] by Patti Neighmond.

====Pregnancy rate====
Pregnancy rate may be defined in various ways. In the United States, the pregnancy rate used by the SART and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (and appearing in the table in the Success Rates section above) are based on fetal heart motion observed in ultrasound examinations.

In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.<ref name=canadians>Branswell, Helen (15 December 2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090318062752/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215/BNStory/National/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20081215.wivf1215 Success rate climbs for in vitro fertilization]. The Canadian Press.</ref> A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the centre and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to [[adoption]] (46%) or [[spontaneous pregnancy]] (42%).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de La Rochebrochard E, Quelen C, Peikrishvili R, Guibert J, Bouyer J | title = Long-term outcome of parenthood project during in vitro fertilization and after discontinuation of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 149–56 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 18706550 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.05.067 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02263336/file/La%20Rochebrochard%202009%2C%20Fertil%20Steril.pdf }}</ref>

According to a study done by the [[Mayo Clinic]] miscarriage rates for IVF are somewhere between 15–25%.<ref name=mayoclinic>mayoclinic.org [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716#].</ref>

====Predictors of success====
The main potential factors that influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in IVF have been suggested to be [[maternal age]], duration of infertility or subfertility, [[basal FSH|bFSH]] and number of oocytes, all reflecting [[Ovary#Function|ovarian function]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Loendersloot LL, van Wely M, Limpens J, Bossuyt PM, Repping S, van der Veen F | title = Predictive factors in in vitro fertilization (IVF): a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 577–89 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20581128 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq015 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Optimal woman's age is 23–39 years at time of treatment.<ref name=nice/>

A [[Cochrane review]] came to the result that endometrial injury performed in the month prior to ovarian induction appeared to increase both the live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate in IVF compared with no endometrial injury. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in miscarriage, multiple pregnancy or bleeding rates. Evidence suggested that endometrial injury on the day of oocyte retrieval was associated with a lower live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate.<ref name=":0" />

For women, intake of [[antioxidant]]s (such as [[N-acetyl-cysteine]], [[melatonin]], [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]], [[folic acid]], [[myo-inositol]], [[zinc]] or [[selenium]]) has not been associated with a significantly increased [[live birth rate]] or clinical [[pregnancy rate]] in IVF according to [[Cochrane review]]s.<ref name=":0" /> The review found that oral antioxidants given to  men in couples with male factor or unexplained subfertility may improve live birth rates, but more evidence is needed.<ref name=":0" />

A [[Cochrane review]] in 2015 came to the result that there is no evidence identified regarding the effect of preconception lifestyle advice on the chance of a live birth outcome.<ref name=":0" />

== Complications ==

===Multiple births===
The major complication of IVF is the risk of [[multiple birth]]s. This is directly related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, [[obstetrical complications]], [[preterm birth|prematurity]], and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins. A double blind, randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins had a birth weight of less than {{convert|2500|g|lb}}.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olivennes F, Mannaerts B, Struijs M, Bonduelle M, Devroey P | title = Perinatal outcome of pregnancy after GnRH antagonist (ganirelix) treatment during ovarian stimulation for conventional IVF or ICSI: a preliminary report | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1588–91 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11473947 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/16.8.1588 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Sex ratio distortions===

Certain kinds of IVF, in particular [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] (first applied in 1991) and [[blastocyst transfer]] (first applied in 1984) have been shown to lead to distortions in the [[sex ratio]] at birth. ICSI leads to slightly more female births (51.3% female) while blastocyst transfer leads to significantly more boys (56.1% male) being born. Standard IVF done at the second or third day leads to a normal sex ratio.

Epigenetic modifications caused by extended culture leading to the death of more female embryos has been theorised as the reason why blastocyst transfer leads to a higher male sex ratio, however adding retinoic acid to the culture can bring this ratio back to normal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan K, An L, Miao K, Ren L, Hou Z, Tao L, Zhang Z, Wang X, Xia W, Liu J, Wang Z, Xi G, Gao S, Sui L, Zhu DS, Wang S, Wu Z, Bach I, Chen DB, Tian J | title = Impaired imprinted X chromosome inactivation is responsible for the skewed sex ratio following in vitro fertilization | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 12 | pages = 3197–202 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26951653 | pmc = 4812732 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1523538113 | bibcode = 2016PNAS..113.3197T }}</ref>

===Spread of infectious disease===
By [[sperm washing]], the risk that a chronic disease in the male providing the sperm would infect the female or offspring can be brought to negligible levels.

In males with [[hepatitis B]], The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing is not necessary in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Hepatitis and reproduction | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = S226–35 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19007636 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.08.040 | author1 = Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine }}</ref><ref name=Lutgens2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutgens SP, Nelissen EC, van Loo IH, Koek GH, Derhaag JG, Dunselman GA | title = To do or not to do: IVF and ICSI in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 24 | issue = 11 | pages = 2676–8 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19625309 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dep258 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In females with hepatitis B, the risk of [[vertical transmission]] during IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception.<ref name=Lutgens2009/> However, there is not enough evidence to say that [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring.<ref name=Lutgens2009/>

Regarding potential spread of [[HIV/AIDS]], Japan's government prohibited the use of IVF procedures for couples in which both partners are infected with HIV. Despite the fact that the ethics committees previously allowed the [[Ogikubo, Tokyo]] Hospital, located in Tokyo, to use IVF for couples with HIV, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] of Japan decided to block the practice. Hideji Hanabusa, the vice president of the Ogikubo Hospital, states that together with his colleagues, he managed to develop a method through which scientists are able to remove HIV from sperm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/japan-bans-in-vitro-fertilization-for-hiv-couples.html |title=Japan Bans in Vitro Fertilisation for HIV Couples |publisher=Infoniac.com |date=21 July 2008}}</ref>

===Other risks to the egg provider/retriever===
A risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]], particularly if hCG is used for [[Final maturation (IVF)|inducing final oocyte maturation]]. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.

During egg retrieval, there exists a small chance of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures such as bowel and bladder (transvaginal ultrasound aspiration) as well as difficulty in breathing, chest infection, allergic reactions to medication, or nerve damage (laparoscopy).

[[Ectopic pregnancy]] may also occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of the fetus.

===Birth defects===
A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a [[relative risk]] of birth defects of 1.32 (95% [[confidence interval]] 1.24–1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.<ref name="pmid23449641">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen M, Kurinczuk JJ, Milne E, de Klerk N, Bower C | title = Assisted reproductive technology and birth defects: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 330–53 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23449641 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt006 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably [[septal heart defect]]s, [[cleft lip]] with or without [[cleft palate]], [[esophageal atresia]], and [[anorectal atresia]]; the mechanism of causality is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reefhuis J, Honein MA, Schieve LA, Correa A, Hobbs CA, Rasmussen SA | title = Assisted reproductive technology and major structural birth defects in the United States | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 360–6 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19010807 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/den387 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6,163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: "The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors." <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Davies MJ, Moore VM, Willson KJ, Van Essen P, Priest K, Scott H, Haan EA, Chan A | title = Reproductive technologies and the risk of birth defects | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 19 | pages = 1803–13 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559061 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1008095 | s2cid = 12552533 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bdc4699fee3dd228cd6dd2f38969046be14129d8 }}</ref> Parental factors included known independent risks for birth defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI (corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying male infertility factors (which would be associated with the use of ICSI) may contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu JL, Basso O, Obel C, Bille C, Olsen J | title = Infertility, infertility treatment, and congenital malformations: Danish national birth cohort | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7570 | pages = 679 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16893903 | pmc = 1584372 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38919.495718.AE }}</ref> and "implicates patient factors in this increased risk."

==Method==
[[File:IVF.jpg|thumb|412x412px|A depiction of the procedure of in-vitro fertilisation.]]
{{refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
Theoretically, IVF could be performed by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with [[sperm]], and reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] to generate multiple eggs, ultrasound-guided [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] directly from the ovaries, co-incubation of eggs and sperm, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before [[embryo transfer]] into a uterus.

===Ovarian hyperstimulation===
{{Main|Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation}}
Ovarian hyperstimulation is the stimulation to induce development of multiple follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age, [[antral follicle count]] and level of [[anti-Müllerian hormone]].<ref name=LaMarca2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = La Marca A, Sunkara SK | title = Individualization of controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF using ovarian reserve markers: from theory to practice | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 124–40 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24077980 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt037 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The resulting prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to ovarian hyperstimulation determines the protocol and dosage for ovarian hyperstimulation.<ref name=LaMarca2013/>

Ovarian hyperstimulation also includes suppression of spontaneous ovulation, for which two main methods are available: Using a (usually longer) [[GnRH agonist]] protocol or a (usually shorter) [[GnRH antagonist]] protocol.<ref name=LaMarca2013/> In a standard long GnRH agonist protocol the day when hyperstimulation treatment is started and the expected day of later oocyte retrieval can be chosen to conform to personal choice, while in a GnRH antagonist protocol it must be adapted to the spontaneous onset of the previous menstruation. On the other hand, the GnRH antagonist protocol has a lower risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS), which is a life-threatening complication.<ref name=LaMarca2013/>

For the ovarian hyperstimulation in itself, injectable [[gonadotropin]]s (usually [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] analogues) are generally used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the [[estradiol]] level and, by means of [[gynecologic ultrasonography]], follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary.

===Natural IVF===
{{Main|Natural cycle in vitro fertilisation}}

IVF using no drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation was the method for the conception of [[Louise Brown]]. This method can be successfully used when women want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-effects.

This method appears to be an advance in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment combined with [[single embryo transfer]]) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a [[GnRH agonist]] long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment.<ref name="pmid17336650">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heijnen EM, Eijkemans MJ, De Klerk C, Polinder S, Beckers NG, Klinkert ER, Broekmans FJ, Passchier J, Te Velde ER, Macklon NS, Fauser BC | title = A mild treatment strategy for in-vitro fertilisation: a randomised non-inferiority trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9563 | pages = 743–749 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17336650 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60360-2 | s2cid = 25591825 }}</ref> Mild IVF can be cheaper than conventional IVF and with a significantly reduced risk of [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]] and [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome|OHSS]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fauser BC, Nargund G, Andersen AN, Norman R, Tarlatzis B, Boivin J, Ledger W | title = Mild ovarian stimulation for IVF: 10 years later | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 2678–84 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20858698 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deq247 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Final maturation induction===
{{Further|Final maturation induction}}
When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, [[Final maturation induction|induction of final oocyte maturation]] is performed, generally by an injection of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the "trigger shot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infertility.about.com/od/infertilitytreatments/ss/ivf_treatment_5.htm |title=IVF Treatment Step Four: Final Oocyte|publisher=Infertility.about.com |access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref> hCG acts as an analogue of [[luteinising hormone]], and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 HCG Injection After Ovulation Induction With Clomiphene Citrate] at Medscape. By Peter Kovacs. Posted: 23 April 2004</ref> but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]]. Using a [[GnRH agonist]] instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh.<ref name=Humaidan2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Humaidan P, Kol S, Papanikolaou EG | title = GnRH agonist for triggering of final oocyte maturation: time for a change of practice? | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 510–24 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21450755 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr008 | author4 = Copenhagen GnRH Agonist Triggering Workshop Group | doi-access = free }}</ref>  For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.

===Egg retrieval===
{{Further|Transvaginal oocyte retrieval}}
The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique called [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]], involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval procedure usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the number of mature follicles, and is usually done under [[conscious sedation]] or [[general anaesthesia]].{{cn|date=July 2020}}

===Egg and sperm preparation===
In the laboratory, for ICSI treatments, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells (also known as [[cumulus cell]]s) and prepared for [[fertilisation]]. An [[oocyte selection]] may be performed prior to fertilisation to select eggs that can be fertilized, as it is required they are in metaphase II. There are cases in which if oocytes are in the metaphase I stage, they can be kept being cultured so as to undergo a posterior sperm injection. In the meantime, [[semen]] is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells and seminal fluid in a process called [[sperm washing]]. If semen is being provided by a [[sperm donor]], it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

===Co-incubation===
[[File:Ivf.png|thumb|317x317px|Demonstration of IVF]]
The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a [[culture media]] in order for the actual [[Human fertilization|fertilisation]] to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher [[pregnancy rate]]s than 16 to 24 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang XD, Liu JX, Liu WW, Gao Y, Han W, Xiong S, Wu LH, Huang GN | title = Time of insemination culture and outcomes of in vitro fertilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 685–95 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23912477 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt036 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two [[pronuclei]]. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells.

In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]], eggs are removed from the woman and placed in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation is actually an in vivo fertilisation, not in vitro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Åbyholm|first1=Thomas|last2=Tanbo|first2=Tom|last3=Dale|first3=Per Olav|last4=Magnus|first4=Øystein|date=1992-02-01|title=In vivo fertilization procedures in infertile women with patent fallopian tubes: A comparison of gamete intrafallopian transfer, combined intrauterine and intraperitoneal insemination, and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation alone|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.1007/BF01204109|pmid=1617244|s2cid=25057205|issn=1573-7330}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wetscher|first1=F.|last2=Havlicek|first2=V.|last3=Huber|first3=T.|last4=Gilles|first4=M.|last5=Tesfaye|first5=D.|last6=Griese|first6=J.|last7=Wimmers|first7=K.|last8=Schellander|first8=K.|last9=Müller|first9=M.|last10=Brem|first10=G.|last11=Besenfelder|first11=U.|date=2005-07-01|title=Intrafallopian transfer of gametes and early stage embryos for in vivo culture in cattle|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64|issue=1|pages=30–40|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2004.11.018|issn=0093-691X|pmid=15935840}}</ref>

===Embryo culture===
{{Main|Embryo culture}}
The main durations of embryo culture are until [[human embryogenesis|cleavage stage]] (day two to four after [[co-incubation]]) or the [[blastocyst]] stage (day five or six after [[co-incubation]]).<ref name="DarLazer2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dar S, Lazer T, Shah PS, Librach CL | title = Neonatal outcomes among singleton births after blastocyst versus cleavage stage embryo transfer: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–48 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24480786 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu001 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Embryo culture until the blastocyst stage confers a significant increase in [[live birth rate]] per [[embryo transfer]], but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and [[embryo cryopreservation]], so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer.<ref name=":0" /> Transfer day two instead of day three after fertilisation has no differences in [[live birth rate]].<ref name=":0" /> There are significantly higher odds of [[preterm birth]] ([[odds ratio]] 1.3) and [[congenital anomalies]] ([[odds ratio]] 1.3) among births having from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.<ref name="DarLazer2014"/>

===Embryo selection===
{{Further|Embryo quality}}
Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge ovocyte and [[embryo]] quality.

===Embryo transfer===
{{Main|Embryo transfer}}
The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to [[HFEA]] regulations, a woman over 40 may have up to three embryos transferred, whereas in the US, there is no legal limit on the number of embryos which may be transferred, although medical associations have provided practice guidelines. Most clinics and country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, as it is not uncommon for multiple embryos to implant if multiple embryos are transferred. Embryos are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin, plastic [[catheter]], which goes through her [[vagina]] and cervix. Several embryos may be passed into the uterus to improve chances of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Timeva|first1=Tanya|last2=Shterev|first2=Atanas|last3=Kyurkchiev|first3=Stanimir|date=2014|title=Recurrent Implantation Failure: The Role of the Endometrium|journal=Journal of Reproduction & Infertility|volume=15|issue=4|pages=173–183|issn=2228-5482|pmc=4227974|pmid=25473625}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=In vitro fertilization (IVF) - Mayo Clinic|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716|access-date=2020-08-31|website=www.mayoclinic.org}}</ref>

===Luteal support===
{{main|Luteal support}}
[[Luteal support]] is the administration of medication, generally [[progesterone]], [[progestin]]s, hCG, or [[GnRH agonist]]s, and often accompanied by estradiol, to increase the success rate of [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] and early [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], thereby complementing and/or supporting the function of the [[corpus luteum]]. A Cochrane review found that hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be associated with higher rates of [[Live birth rate|live birth]] or ongoing pregnancy, but that the evidence is not conclusive.<ref name="van-der-Linden2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Linden M, Buckingham K, Farquhar C, Kremer JA, Metwally M | title = Luteal phase support for assisted reproduction cycles | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 7 | pages = CD009154 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26148507 | pmc = 6461197 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009154.pub3 | hdl = 2066/98072 }}</ref> Co-treatment with [[GnRH agonist]]s appears to improve outcomes,<ref name=van-der-Linden2011/> by a live birth rate [[risk difference|RD]] of +16% (95% [[confidence interval]] +10 to +22%).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyrou D, Kolibianakis EM, Fatemi HM, Tarlatzi TB, Devroey P, Tarlatzis BC | title = Increased live birth rates with GnRH agonist addition for luteal support in ICSI/IVF cycles: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 734–40 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21733980 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr029 | doi-access = free }}</ref> On the other hand, [[growth hormone]] or [[aspirin]] as adjunctive medication in IVF have no evidence of overall benefit.<ref name=":0" />

==Expansions==
There are various expansions or additional techniques that can be applied in IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF.

===Preimplantation genetic screening or diagnosis===
{{Main|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
[[Preimplantation genetic screening]] (PGS) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been suggested to be able to be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing [[randomised controlled trial]]s came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by [[live birth rate]].<ref name=Mastenbroek2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mastenbroek S, Twisk M, van der Veen F, Repping S | title = Preimplantation genetic screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 454–66 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21531751 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> On the contrary, for women of [[advanced maternal age]], PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/> Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]] are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.<ref name=Mastenbroek2011/>

Still, as an expansion of IVF, patients who can benefit from PGS/PGD include:
* Couples who have a family history of inherited disease
* Couples who want [[prenatal sex discernment]]. This can be used to diagnose [[monogenic disorders]] with [[sex linkage]]. It can potentially be used for [[sex selection]], wherein a fetus is aborted if having an undesired sex.
* Couples who already have a child with an incurable disease and need compatible cells from a second healthy child to cure the first, resulting in a "[[saviour sibling]]" that matches the sick child in [[HLA type]].<ref>Britten, Nick (2011) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8499394/Saviour-sibling-cures-sick-older-brother.html Saviour Sibling Cures Sick Older Brother] The Daily Telegraph, Health News, 7 May 2011. Retrieved 8 May 2011</ref>

PGS screens for numeral chromosomal abnormalities while PGD diagnosis the specific molecular defect of the inherited disease. In both PGS and PGD, individual cells from a pre-embryo, or preferably trophectoderm cells biopsied from a [[blastocyst]], are analysed during the IVF process. Before the transfer of a pre-embryo back to a woman's uterus, one or two cells are removed from the pre-embryos (8-cell stage), or preferably from a [[blastocyst]]. These cells are then evaluated for normality. Typically within one to two days, following completion of the evaluation, only the normal pre-embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus.  Alternatively, a blastocyst can be cryopreserved via vitrification and transferred at a later date to the uterus.  In addition, PGS can significantly reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies because fewer embryos, ideally just one, are needed for implantation.

===Cryopreservation===
{{Main|Oocyte cryopreservation|Embryo cryopreservation}}
[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilisation, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilisation.

The Rand Consulting Group has estimated there to be 400,000 frozen embryos in the United States in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2006/07/souls_on_ice.html |title=Souls On Ice: America's Embryo Glut and the Wasted Promise of Stem Cell Research|publisher=Motherjones.com |date=July–August 2006|author=Mundy, Liza }}</ref> The advantage is that patients who fail to conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another pregnancy.  Spare oocytes or embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be used for [[oocyte donation]] or [[embryo donation]] to another woman or couple, and embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and donation by using donor eggs and sperm. Also, oocyte cryopreservation can be used for women who are likely to lose their ovarian reserve due to undergoing [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Porcu E, Fabbri R, Damiano G, Fratto R, Giunchi S, Venturoli S | title = Oocyte cryopreservation in oncological patients | journal = European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology | volume = 113 Suppl 1 | pages = S14–6 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15041124 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.11.004 }}</ref>

By 2017, many centers have adopted embryo cryopreservation as their primary IVF therapy, and perform few or no fresh embryo transfers.  The two main reasons for this have been better endometrial receptivity when embryos are transferred in cycles without exposure to ovarian stimulation and also the ability to store the embryos while awaiting the results of pre-implantation genetic testing.

The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521111033/http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm |archive-date=21 May 2009 |title=Genetics & IVF Institute |publisher=Givf.com |url-status=dead |access-date=2 November 2016}}</ref>

===Other expansions===
* [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) is where a single [[spermatozoon|sperm]] is injected directly into an [[ovum|egg]]. Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with [[sperm donation]]. It can be used in [[teratozoospermia]], since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence [[blastocyst]] development or blastocyst morphology.<ref name=french>{{cite journal | vauthors = French DB, Sabanegh ES, Goldfarb J, Desai N | title = Does severe teratozoospermia affect blastocyst formation, live birth rate, and other clinical outcome parameters in ICSI cycles? | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–103 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19200957 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.051 }}</ref>
* Additional methods of [[embryo profiling]]. For example, methods are emerging in making comprehensive analyses of up to entire [[genome]]s, [[transcriptome]]s, [[proteome]]s and [[metabolome]]s which may be used to score embryos by comparing the patterns with ones that have previously been found among embryos in successful versus unsuccessful pregnancies.<ref name=Fauser2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fauser BC, Diedrich K, Bouchard P, Domínguez F, Matzuk M, Franks S, Hamamah S, Simón C, Devroey P, Ezcurra D, Howles CM | title = Contemporary genetic technologies and female reproduction | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–47 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21896560 | pmc = 3191938 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmr033 }}</ref>
* [[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) can be performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
* In [[egg donation]] and [[embryo donation]], the resultant embryo after fertilisation is inserted in another woman than the one providing the eggs. These are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilised in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
* In [[oocyte selection]], the oocytes with optimal chances of [[live birth rate|live birth]] can be chosen. It can also be used as a means of [[preimplantation genetic screening]].
* [[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT | title = Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 423–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19217091 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 }}</ref>
*[[Cytoplasmic transfer]] is where the [[cytoplasm]] from a donor egg is injected into an egg with compromised [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. The resulting egg is then [[Fertilisation|fertilised]] with [[sperm]] and [[Implant (medicine)|implanted]] in a [[Uterus|womb]], usually that of the woman who provided the recipient egg and [[nuclear DNA]]. Cytoplasmic transfer was created to aid women who experience infertility due to deficient or damaged [[mitochondria]], contained within an egg's [[cytoplasm]].

==Leftover embryos or eggs==
{{Further|Embryo donation|Egg donor}}
There may be leftover embryos or eggs from IVF procedures if the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term. With the woman's or couple's permission, these may be donated to help other women or couples as a means of [[third party reproduction]].

In [[embryo donation]], these extra embryos are given to other couples or women for [[Embryo transfer|transfer]] with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with [[egg donor|egg donation]] or [[sperm donation]].

Typically, genetic parents donate the eggs to a [[fertility clinic]] or where they are preserved by [[oocyte cryopreservation]] or [[embryo cryopreservation]] until a carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents.<ref>[http://familybuilding.resolve.org/site/PageServer?pagename=lrn_wamo_pd&JServSessionId_form=login&printer_friendly=1 Donor Embryo: Online Guide for Potential Donors&nbsp;– RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association].

In the United States, women seeking to be an embryo recipient undergo infectious disease screening required by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and reproductive tests to determine the best placement location and cycle timing before the actual Embryo Transfer occurs. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process.

==History==
{{Main|History of in vitro fertilisation}}
The first successful birth of a child after IVF treatment, [[Louise Brown]], occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in [[Royton]], Oldham, England. [[Robert G. Edwards]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2010, the physiologist who co-developed the treatment together with [[Patrick Steptoe]] and embryologist [[Jean Purdy]]; Steptoe and Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.<ref name="Moreton"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The second successful birth of a test tube baby occurred in [[India]] just 67 days after Louise Brown was born.<ref>[http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2011/01/the-award-of-th.html Is an "Indian Crab Syndrome" Impeding Indian Science?] ''sciencemag.org''. Retrieved 20 August 2013</ref> The girl, named Durga conceived in vitro using a method developed independently by Dr. [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subhash Mukhopadhyay]], a physician and researcher from [[Kolkata]], India.

With [[egg donation]] and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached [[menopause]] can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and a donor egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment some couples are able to get pregnant without any fertility treatments.<ref name="reuters.com"/> In 2018 it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.<ref name="ESHRE 2018"/> {{TOC limit|3}}

==Ethics==

===Mix-ups===
In some cases, laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to legal action against the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son.<ref>{{Cite journal| author=Ayers C | title=Mother wins $1m for IVF mix-up but may lose son| journal = Timesonline | year=2004 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article465773.ece }}</ref> This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups.  The [[HFEA]], for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system,  the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered [[RFID]] tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the US,<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive Clinic Uses RFID to Guarantee Parental Identity|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?3683|author=Swedberg, Claire |date=15 October 2007|work=RFID Journal}}</ref> it is still not widely adopted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vertauschte Keimzellen und Embryonen - Analyse reproduktionsmedizinischer Zwischenfälle: Normkontext, Rechtsfolgen, Regelungsbedarf|url=http://www.mohrsiebeck.com/en/book/vertauschte-keimzellen-und-embryonen-9783161591822?no_cache=1|author=Jäschke, Moritz L. |work=Mohr Siebeck 2020|series = Studien zum Medizin- und Gesundheitsrecht|year = 2020|volume = 2|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|isbn = 9783161591822}}</ref>

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis or screening ===
While PGD was originally designed to screen for embryos carrying hereditary genetic diseases, the method has been applied to select features that are unrelated to diseases, thus raising ethical questions. Examples of such cases include the selection of embryos based on [[histocompatibility]] (HLA) for the donation of tissues to a sick family member, the diagnosis of genetic susceptibility to disease, and [[sex selection]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Damian BB, Bonetti TC, Horovitz DD | title = Practices and ethical concerns regarding preimplantation diagnosis. Who regulates preimplantation genetic diagnosis in Brazil? | journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research = Revista Brasileira de Pesquisas Medicas e Biologicas | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25493379 | pmc = 4288489 | doi = 10.1590/1414-431X20144083 }}</ref>

These examples raise ethical issues because of the morality of [[eugenics]]. It becomes frowned upon because of the advantage of being able to eliminate unwanted traits and selecting desired traits. By  using PGD,  individuals are given the opportunity to create a human life unethically and rely on science and not by [[natural selection]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Bob | name-list-style = vanc |date=January 2005|title=Ethics and Moral Philosophy in the Initiation of IVF, Preimplantation Diagnosis, and Stem Cells|journal= Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=10|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/S1472-6483(10)62195-5|pmid=15819997 }}</ref>

For example, a deaf British couple, Tom and Paula Lichy, have petitioned to create a deaf baby using IVF.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lawson|first=Dominic| name-list-style = vanc |title=Of course a deaf couple want a deaf child|work=The Independent |date=11 March 2008|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-of-course-a-deaf-couple-want-a-deaf-child-794001.html|access-date=12 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Some [[bioethics|medical ethicists]] have been very critical of this approach. [[Jacob M. Appel]] wrote that "intentionally culling out blind or deaf embryos might prevent considerable future suffering, while a policy that allowed deaf or blind parents to select ''for'' such traits intentionally would be far more troublesome."<ref>Appel, Jacob (12 March 2009). More 'designer' options. ''The Winnipeg Sun''</ref>

===Profit desire of the industry===
In 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets ([[Suleman octuplets]]). This led to accusations that a doctor is willing to endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry "corrupt" and "greedy" stating that "one of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry," and that "what has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation: "The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/may/31/medicineandhealth.health | location= London | work = The Guardian  | first=Alok | last=Jha | name-list-style = vanc | title=Winston: IVF clinics corrupt and greedy | date= 31 May 2007}}</ref> The IVF industry has been described as a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dumit, Joseph.|title=Drugs for life : how pharmaceutical companies define our health|date=2012|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4860-3|location=Durham, NC|oclc=782252371}}</ref>

In the US, the [[Copyright Clause]] provides innovators with a temporary monopoly over their respective work. As a result, IVF is prohibitively expensive for patients as providers have to also cover the costs of patents. For example, [[23andMe]] has patented a process used to calculate the probability of gene inheritance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DeFrancesco |first1=Laura |title=23andMe's designer baby patent |journal=Nature Biotechnology |date=1 January 2014 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=8 |doi=10.1038/nbt0114-8 |pmid=24406913 |s2cid=11576157 }}</ref><!-- implication on others? -->

The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only ''can'' be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them.<ref>Dietrich, H (May 1986). "IVF: what can we do?" Paper presented to the Liberation or Loss? conference, Canberra.</ref><ref name="pmid11649236">{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren MA | title = IVF and women's interests: an analysis of feminist concerns | journal = Bioethics | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–57 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 11649236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.1988.tb00034.x }}</ref> Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort.  Now it's a first resort. I think that it can harm women in the long run."<ref>{{cite news| date = 12 August 2009 | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/12/earlyshow/health/main5236035.shtml | work=CBS News | title= Is In Vitro Fertilization Being Overused?}}</ref> IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to 'sell' corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the 'healthy' or 'normal' body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring.

=== IVF over age 40 ===
All pregnancies can be risky, but there are greater risk for women who are older and are over the age of 40. The older the women the riskier the pregnancy. As women get older, they are more likely to suffer from conditions such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. If older women do conceive over the age of 40, their offspring may be of lower birth weight, and more likely to requires intensive care. Because of this, the increased risk is a sufficient cause for concern. The high incidence of caesarean in older mothers is commonly regarded as a risk.

Though there are some risk with older women pregnancies, there are some benefits associated with caesareans. A study has shown that births over 40 have a lower rate of birth trauma due to increased delivery by caesarean. Though caesarean is seen to benefit mothers over 40, there are still many risk factors to consider. Caesarean section may be a risk in the same way that gestational diabetes is.

Women conceiving at 40 have a greater risk of gestational hypertension and premature birth. The offspring is at risk when being born from older mothers, and the risks associated with being conceived through IVF.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smajdor|first=Anna| name-list-style = vanc |date=May 2011|title=The ethics of IVF over 40|journal=Maturitas|volume=69|issue=1|pages=37–40|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.02.012|pmid=21435805}}</ref>

===Pregnancy after menopause ===
Although menopause is a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uteruses have been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the child, they have a physical link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after menopause the uterus is fully capable of carrying out a pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parks JA | title = A closer look at reproductive technology and postmenopausal motherhood | journal = CMAJ | volume = 154 | issue = 8 | pages = 1189–91 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8612255 | pmc = 1487687 }}</ref>

===Same-sex couples, single and unmarried parents===
{{See also|Donor conceived person}}
A 2009 statement from the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine|ASRM]] found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation.<ref name=asrm2009>{{cite journal |author=The Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine |title=Access to fertility treatment by gays, lesbians, and unmarried persons |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=1190–3 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19732884 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.977 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Ethical concerns include reproductive rights, the welfare of offspring, nondiscrimination against unmarried individuals, homosexual, and professional autonomy.<ref name=asrm2009/>

A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had "religious-based objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive children by artificial insemination," and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Appel JM | title = May doctors refuse infertility treatments to gay patients? | journal = The Hastings Center Report | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 20–1 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16898357 | doi = 10.1353/hcr.2006.0053 | s2cid = 39694945 }}</ref><ref>Dolan, M.

IVF is increasingly being used to allow lesbian and other LGBT couples to share in the reproductive process through a technique called [[reciprocal IVF]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a17851346/how-lesbian-couples-have-babies/|title=Shared motherhood: The amazing way lesbian couples are having babies|date=2018-02-14|work=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref> The eggs of one partner are used to create embryos which the other partner carries through pregnancy.

[[Nadya Suleman]] came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his licence. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical licence be revoked effective 1 July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/10/25/license_hearing_for_octomom_doctor_resumes_in_la/|author=Mohajer, Shaya Tayefe |title=License hearing for Octomom doctor resumes in LA |agency=Associated Press|date=25 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Breuer |first=Howard | name-list-style = vanc |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20436389,00.html |title=Octomom's Doctor Tearfully Apologizes, Admits Mistake |work=People |date=22 October 2010 |access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref>

===Unwanted embryos ===

During the [[Embryo selection|selection]] and transfer phases, many embryos may be discarded in favour of others. This selection may be based on criteria such as genetic disorders or the sex.<ref>[http://www.lifenews.com/2011/09/06/pro-life-concerns-about-ivf-include-abortion-exploitation/ Pro-Life Concerns About IVF Include Abortion, Exploitation].

For those who believe that this is at the moment of conception, IVF becomes a moral question when multiple eggs are fertilised, begin development, and only a few are chosen for implantation. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

If IVF were to involve the fertilisation of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then this would not be an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time.  As a result, the couple must decide what to do with these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo's humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research.<ref name="cnn.com"/> Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in [[stem cell]] research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.

===Religious response===
{{main|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}

The [[Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of [[assisted reproductive technology]] and artificial [[contraception]], on the grounds that they separate the procreative goal of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church#Matrimony|marital sex]] from the goal of uniting married couples.
The Catholic Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and contraceptive methods such as [[natural family planning]], which involves charting ovulation times, and allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility lubricant. Pope Benedict XVI had publicly re-emphasised the Catholic Church's opposition to in vitro fertilisation, saying that it replaces love between a husband and wife.<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=Medical news today |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php |title=Pope Benedict XVI Declares Embryos Developed For In Vitro Fertilization Have Right To Life |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229164506/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38686.php |archive-date=29 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

Within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Regarding [[Judaism and sexuality|laws of sexuality]], religious challenges include [[masturbation]] (which may be regarded as "seed wasting"<ref name=medill/>), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation ([[niddah]]) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father's identity is determined by a legal presumption ([[chazakah]]) of legitimacy: ''rov bi'ot achar ha'baal'' – a woman's [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]] (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father.<ref>Tzitz Eliezer 9 p. 247</ref> [[Reform Judaism]] has generally approved IVF.<ref name="medill"/>

===Society and culture===

Many people of sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their children to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women to have their own children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Drah B | title = Orphans in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Crisis, the Interventions, and the Anthropologist | journal = Africa Today | volume = 59 | issue = 2 (Winter2012 2012) | pages = 3–21 | doi=10.2979/africatoday.59.2.3| year = 2012 | s2cid = 144808526 }}</ref>

In the US, the [[pineapple]] has emerged as a symbol of IVF users, possibly because some people thought, without scientific evidence, that eating pineapple might slightly increase the success rate for the procedure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/style/pineapple-in-vitro-fertilization-pregnancy.html|title=How the Pineapple Became the Icon of I.V.F.|last=Lorenz|first=Taylor|date=2019-10-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Emotional involvement with children==
Studies have indicated that IVF mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception. Similarly, studies have indicated that IVF father's express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by adoption and natural conception and enjoy fatherhood more. Some IVF parents become overly involved with their children.<ref name="IlioiGolombok2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilioi EC, Golombok S | title = Psychological adjustment in adolescents conceived by assisted reproduction techniques: a systematic review | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–96 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25281685 | pmc = 4255607 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu051 }}</ref>

==Men and IVF==
Research has shown that men largely view themselves as "passive contributors"<ref>Throsby, K, Gill, R 2004, '"it's different for men": masculinity and IVF', LSE Research Online, Men and Masculinities, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 340.</ref> since they have "less physical involvement"<ref>Whittaker A 2009, 'Global technologies and transnational reproduction in Thailand', Asian Studies Review, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 324</ref> in IVF treatment.

Fertility was found to be a significant factor in a man's perception of his masculinity, driving many to keep the treatment a secret.<ref name="Throsby, K 2004, pp. 344" /> In cases where the men did share that he and his partner were undergoing IVF, they reported to have been teased, mainly by other men, although some viewed this as an affirmation of support and friendship.

== Cost of IVF ==
Costs of IVF can be broken down into direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include the medical treatments themselves, including doctor consultations, medications, ultrasound scanning, laboratory tests, the actual IVF procedure, and any associated hospital charges and administrative costs. Indirect costs includes the cost of addressing any complications with treatments, patients' travel costs and lost hours of productivity.<ref>Health Research Board. 2017. [https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/af2460-health-research-board-report-assisted-reproductive-technologies-inte/?referrer=/blog/publications/health-research-board-report-assisted-reproductive-technologies-international-approaches-to-public-funding-mechanisms-and-criteria-an-evidence-review/ Assisted reproductive technologies: International approaches to public funding mechanisms and criteria]. Accessed November 30, 2019.   </ref> These costs can be exaggerated by the increasing age of the woman undergoing IVF treatment (particularly those over the age of 40), and the increase costs associated with multiple births. For instance, a pregnancy with twins can cost up to three times that of a singleton pregnancy.<ref>Chambers GM, Adamson GD and Eijkemans MJ. (2013b) Acceptable cost for the patient and society. Fertility & Sterility, 100(2): 319–327.   </ref>

==Availability and utilisation==

High costs keep IVF out of reach for many developing countries, but research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claim to have found a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment.<ref>Gallagher, James.

Eligible patients for IVF treatment must be Ontario residents under the age of 43 and have a valid [[Ontario Health Insurance Plan]] card and have not already undergone any IVF cycles. Coverage is extensive, but not universal. Coverage extends to certain blood and urine tests, physician/nurse counselling and consultations, certain ultrasounds, up to two cycle monitorings, embryo thawing, freezing and culture, fertilisation and embryology services, single transfers of all embryos, and one surgical sperm retrieval using certain techniques only if necessary. Drugs and medications are not covered under this Program, along with psychologist or social worker counselling, storage and shipping of eggs, sperm or embryos, and the purchase of donor sperm or eggs.<ref>TRIO Fertility. 2016.

=== India ===
The penetration of the IVF market in India is quite low at present with only 2,800 cycles/million infertile women in the reproductive age group (20–44 years) as compared to China which has 6,500 cycles. The key challenges are lack of awareness, affordability and accessibility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://businessworld.in/article/IVF-Fertile-Ground/08-08-2016-104172/|title=IVF: Fertile Ground|last=Chatterjee|first=Paramita| name-list-style = vanc |work=BW Businessworld|access-date=8 July 2017}}</ref> India in 2018 becomes the destination for Fertility Tourism because of most affordable IVF treatment cost.

===Israel===
Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed per million people per year. Couples without children can receive funding for IVF for up to two children. The same funding is available for women without children who will raise up to 2 children in a [[single parent]] home.

===United Kingdom===

Availability of IVF in England is determined by [[Clinical commissioning group]]s. The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends up to 3 cycles of treatment for women under 40 years old with minimal success conceiving after 2 years of unprotected sex.  Cycles will not be continued for women who are older than 40 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg156/chapter/Recommendations#access-criteria-for-ivf|title=Fertility problems: assessment and treatment }}</ref> CCGs in [[Healthcare in Essex|Essex]], [[Healthcare in Bedfordshire|Bedfordshire]] and [[Healthcare in Somerset|Somerset]] have reduced funding to one cycle, or none, and it is expected that reductions will become more widespread.

The [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] said in September 2018 that parents who are limited to one cycle of IVF, or have to fund it themselves, are more likely choose to implant multiple embryos in the hope it increases the chances of pregnancy.  This significantly increases the chance of multiple births and the associated poor outcomes, which would increase NHS costs.  The president of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] said that funding 3 cycles was  "the most important factor in maintaining low rates of multiple pregnancies and reduce(s) associated complications".<ref>{{cite news |title=Regulator says IVF cuts put mothers and babies at risk |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/commissioning/exclusive-regulator-says-ivf-cuts-put-mothers-and-babies-at-risk/7023274.article |access-date=8 October 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=4 September 2018}}</ref>

==Alternatives==
{{Further|Assisted reproductive technology}}
[[File:Blausen 0058 ArtificialInsemination.png|thumb|Schematic illustration of artificial insemination.]]
Alternatives to IVF are mainly:
*'''[[Artificial insemination]]''', including [[Artificial insemination#Intracervical insemination|intracervical insemination]] and [[Artificial insemination#Intrauterine insemination|intrauterine insemination]] of semen. It requires that a woman [[ovulation|ovulates]], but is a relatively simple procedure, and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance.<ref name="Seattle Sperm Bank">[https://www.seattlespermbank.com/demystifying-iui-ici-ivi-and-ivf/ Seattle Sperm Bank]</ref> The beneficiaries of artificial insemination are women who desire to give birth to their own child who may be single, women who are in a [[lesbian]] relationship or women who are in a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationship but with a male partner who is [[male infertility|infertile]] or who has a physical impairment which prevents full intercourse from taking place.
*'''[[Ovulation induction]]''' (in the sense of medical treatment aiming for the development of one or two ovulatory follicles) is an alternative for women with [[anovulation]] or [[oligoovulation]], since it is less expensive and more easy to control.<ref name="WeissBraam2014"/> It generally involves [[antiestrogen]]s such as [[clomifene citrate]] or [[letrozole]], and is followed by [[natural insemination|natural]] or artificial insemination.
*'''[[Surrogacy]]''', where the surrogate mother agrees to bear a child for another person or persons, who will become the child's parent(s) after birth. People may seek a surrogacy arrangement when pregnancy is medically impossible, when [[pregnancy risks]] are too dangerous for the intended mother, or when a single man or a male couple wish to have a child.
*'''[[Adoption]]''' whereby a person assumes the [[parenting]] of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents.

==Laboratory Requirements==
IVF laboratories have to work in optimal conditions, with specialized people, quality management and clean rooms. Only with adequate, clean rooms the maximal results will be accomplished.
*'''[[Temperature]]'''. It has to be stable, in a range of 69,8-75,2 ºF (it is the ideal temperature for personal comfort). With more temperature, [[fungi ]] and [[bacteria]] growth is possible. Also, its stability has to be monitored, since it is the most important aspect of temperature in both apparatus (they must be kept switched on) and work rooms (with a control). [[Incubator (culture)|Incubator]]s have to be at around 98,6 ºF. When we open the door of incubators, their temperature fluctuates and it may endanger [[embryos]], so doing it needlessly should be avoided.
*'''[[Particles]]'''. Everything has to be carefully treated to achieve [[asepsis|aseptic]] and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] conditions. Filters and air direction are essential in order to avoid contamination with exogenous particles to enter our working space. Great amounts of money should be invested in control in filters. [[HEPA|HEPA filters]] (High Efficiency Particulate Air) are one of the best ones.
*'''[[Positive pressure]]'''. The [[air]] that enters the IVF laboratory is extremely clean due to HEPA filters, whereas the air in the surrounding rooms is of lower quality. To avoid the entry of VOCs into IVF laboratories, they are slightly pressurized (positive pressure inside). When you open a door the air escapes from the IVF laboratory so that the dirty air inlet is prevented. [[Volatile Organic Compound]]s (VOCs) are [[organic compounds]] which due to their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] could alter fertilization processes in IVF laboratories. Keeping them away is what makes the difference between good and excellent laboratories. Some examples of VOCs are [[oil]]s, [[solvent]]s (painting products, adhesives…), cleaning products, [[perfume]]s, [[deodorant]]s and many other organic species such as [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]], [[toluene]], [[xylene]], [[perchloroethylene]]. 
*'''[[Light]]'''. We can have [[natural light]]{{dn|date=December 2020}} but being very aware to avoid embryos being irradiated with direct light.
*'''[[Relative humidity]]''' must be around 50% (comfortable for us). In [[cell culture]] laboratories it is mandatory to reduce it to avoid [[fungi]] growth in the environment.

In India, the use of IVF as a means of sex selection ([[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]) is banned under the [[Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sharma|first=Neetu Chandra|date=5 January 2018|title=Health ministry receives complaints against web giants for sex determination violations|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/zigYIOwLa7gjBJmzqHjTSJ/Health-ministry-receives-complaints-against-web-giants-for-s.html|access-date=9 July 2020|website=liveMint}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/To-ensure-prized-baby-boy-Indians-flock-to-Bangkok/articleshow/7169495.cms|title=To ensure prized baby boy, Indians flock to Bangkok &#124; India News – Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Chandigarh-IVF-expert-helps-police-arrest-Delhi-resident-seeking-sex-selection/articleshow/52926505.cms|title=Chandigarh IVF expert helps police arrest Delhi resident seeking sex selection &#124; Chandigarh News – Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref>

Sunni Muslim nations generally allow IVF between married couples when conducted with their own respective sperm and eggs, but not with donor eggs from other couples. But Iran, which is Shi'a Muslim, has a more complex scheme. Iran bans sperm donation but allows donation of both fertilised and unfertilised eggs. Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples, while unfertilised eggs are donated in the context of mut'ah or temporary marriage to the father.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Inhorn, Marcia C.  |url=http://berghahnbooksonline.com/journals/ame/pdfs/2006/1-1/AM010104.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224210/http://berghahnbooksonline.com/journals/ame/pdfs/2006/1-1/AM010104.pdf|archive-date=7 July 2011|title= Islam, IVF and Everyday Life in the Middle East|journal=AIME: Anthropology of the Middle East|volume= 1|issue=1|pages= 37–45}}</ref>

By 2012 [[Costa Rica]] was the only country in the world with a complete ban on IVF technology, it having been ruled unconstitutional by the nation's Supreme Court because it "violated life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivfcostworldwide.com/2009/02/ivf-prohibition-in-costa-rica_21.html |title=IVF Prohibition In Costa Rica |publisher=Ivfcostworldwide.com |access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref> Costa Rica had been the only country in the western hemisphere that forbade IVF.  A law project sent reluctantly by the government of President [[Laura Chinchilla]] was rejected by parliament. President Chinchilla has not publicly stated her position on the question of IVF. However, given the massive influence of the Catholic Church in her government any change in the status quo seems very unlikely.<ref>Murillo, Álvaro (12 July 2011) [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/Costa/Rica/catolica/atasca/fertilizacion/in/vitro/elpepuintlat/20110712elpepusoc_12/Tes La Costa Rica católica se atasca con la fertilización in vitro].

All major restrictions on single but infertile women using IVF were lifted in Australia in 2002 after a final appeal to the Australian High Court was rejected on procedural grounds in the Leesa Meldrum case. A [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] federal court had ruled in 2000 that the existing ban on all single women and lesbians using IVF constituted sex discrimination.<ref>[http://wwrn.org/articles/11389/?&place=australia&section=health-medical Australian court OKs fertility treatment for single women, lesbians] by Peter O'Connor (AP, 18 April 2002)</ref> Victoria's government announced changes to its IVF law in 2007 eliminating remaining restrictions on fertile single women and lesbians, leaving South Australia as the only state maintaining them.<ref>Hoare, Daniel (15 December 2007) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/15/2119738.htm Lesbian community welcomes Vic IVF changes]. abc.net.au</ref>

Few American courts have addressed the issue of the "property" status of a frozen embryo.  This issue might arise in the context of a divorce case, in which a court would need to determine which spouse would be able to decide the disposition of the embryos.  It could also arise in the context of a dispute between a sperm donor and egg donor, even if they were unmarried.  In 2015, an Illinois court held that such disputes could be decided by reference to any contract between the parents-to-be.  In the absence of a contract, the court would weigh the relative interests of the parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rdklegal.com/frozen-embryos-and-divorce-in-illinois/ |title=Russell D.
