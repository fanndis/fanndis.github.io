==Pastoral career==
[[File:Mike Huckabee at Thomas Road Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|right|Huckabee playing bass guitar at [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]] in 2008]]
At age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]].<ref name="scottparks"/> Robison commented, "His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes."<ref name="scottparks"/> Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street First Baptist Church in [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], from 1986 to 1992.

Huckabee started 24-hour television stations in both Pine Bluff and Texarkana, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called ''Positive Alternatives''.<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s.<ref name="scottparks"/><ref name="Isikoff"/> Years later, he wrote about the insights he gained as a minister:

{{quote|My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt ...<ref>Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', p. 7</ref>}}

In 1989, Huckabee ran against [[Ronnie Floyd]] of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.<ref>Robert Marus for the Associated Baptist Press.

==Political career==

===Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, 1993–1996===

In Huckabee's first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator [[Dale Bumpers]], receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/us/the-1992-elections-state-by-state-south.html|title=The 1992 Elections: State by State; South|date=November 5, 1992|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first1=James | last1=Bennet | first2=John H. | last2=Cushman Jr | first3=James | last3=Dao | first4=Jason | last4=DeParle | first5=Clifford | last5=Krauss | first6=Stephen | last6=Labaton | first7=Neil A. | last7=Lewis | first8=David | last8=Margolick | first9=Maria | last9=Newman | first10=Martin | last10=Tolchin | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> In the same election, Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] was elected [[President of the United States|president]], making lieutenant governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman [[Asa Hutchinson]] urged Huckabee to run in the [[special election]] for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers's campaign manager the previous year,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |title=GOP wins one in Arkansas – Republican Party; Mike Huckabee &#124; Campaigns & Elections &#124; Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher=FindArticles |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080107151043/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}</ref> 51–49 percent.<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> Huckabee became the second Republican since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been [[Maurice Britt]] from 1967 to 1971.

In his autobiography ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: "The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier."<ref>Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', pp. 6–7</ref>

[[Dick Morris]], who had previously worked for [[Bill Clinton]], advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994, and 1998.<ref name = "RexNelson">{{cite news |last=Nelson|first=Rex|date=July 2, 1995|title=Clinton's Hired Gun Gives Huckabee Hand: Lieutenant Governor Shooting for Senate|newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]}}</ref> Huckabee commented that Morris was a "personal friend".<ref name = "RexNelson"/> A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: "Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'"<ref name = "RexNelson"/>

Morris elaborated, "So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans."<ref name = "RexNelson"/> Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and [[civil rights]] organizations such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, "I will not participate in any program that has [[racism|racist]] overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and [[anti-Semitism]]."<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhart |first=Bill |title=Huckabee Won't Appear With Racist |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Tribune]] |date=April 12, 1994 |url=http://www.ferris.edu/isar/institut/CCC/philly.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012016/http://www.ferris.edu/isar/institut/CCC/philly.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1994 Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3929|title=1994 AR Lt.

In October 1995, [[David Pryor]] announced that he was retiring from the [[United States Senate]]. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls,<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.<ref name="KevinSack" />

During his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |author2=Caldwell, Elizabeth |title=Observers Say Arkansans: Arkansas voters didn't like the idea of allowing 26 appointed legislators to serve as delegates to a proposed constitutional convention |newspaper=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=December 14, 1995 }}</ref> The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a [[special election]]. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the [[Republican National Committee]] and the [[Republican Party of Arkansas|Arkansas Republican Party]] against a highway referendum.

{{Main|Governorship of Mike Huckabee}}

In May 1996, Tucker was convicted "on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans" as part of the [[Whitewater controversy]]. The [[Arkansas Constitution]], like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. Tucker thus promised to resign by July 15.<ref name = "Barone 136–137"/> Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker.<ref name="KevinSack">{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EEDB1E39F932A05756C0A960958260 |title=Arkansan Quits Senate Race to Lead State |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Sack |first=Kevin |date=May 31, 1996}}</ref> However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,<ref name="Barone 44">{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |work=[[National Journal]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/44 44] |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/44 }}</ref> rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee and the legislature threatened to initiate [[impeachment]] proceedings against Tucker.<ref name="scottparks"/> Huckabee was then duly sworn in as governor.

In [[1998 Arkansas gubernatorial election|November 1998]], Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican governor since Reconstruction.
According to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African American vote in his 1998 election;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/01/could_mike_huckabee_be_america_1.asp |title=Could Mike Huckabee be America's Second Black President? |last=Faughnahan |first=Brian |date=January 15, 2008 |publisher=[[The Weekly Standard]] |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ahead of debate, Huckabee's claim of black support questioned|url=http://archives.arkansasnews.com/2007/09/26/ahead-of-debate-huckabees-claim-of-black-support-questioned/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194725/http://archives.arkansasnews.com/2007/09/26/ahead-of-debate-huckabees-claim-of-black-support-questioned/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 23, 2015|newspaper=[[Arkansas News]]|date=September 26, 2007}}</ref>

In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer [[Jimmie Lou Fisher]], garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Tim Hutchinson]].

Huckabee received widespread praise for his state's rapid response to Hurricane Katrina.

He said, "I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Nov19/0,4675,HuckabeeBook,00.html |title=Huckabee won't rule out 2012 run for President |last=Ohlemacher |first=Stephen |agency=Associated Press |date=November 19, 2008}}</ref>

Huckabee took stances opposed to the nature of the incumbent president, [[Barack Obama]].

Political commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016.

Following the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Huckabee met with [[president-elect of the United States]] [[Donald Trump]], whom he had supported for the Republican nomination after ending his own campaign in February.

He stated that he wants to "give citizens more control over their own health care choices".<ref>[http://www.mikehuckabee.com/?FuseAction=Issues.View&Issue_id=8 Mike Huckabee for President – Health Care] MikeHuckabee.com</ref>

===Free Trade===

In his book ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee expressed support for free trade, but only if it is "fair trade." He identified excess litigation, excess taxation, and excess regulation as three factors contributing to the loss of American jobs, and has proposed economic sanctions on China.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mike Huckabee on Free Trade |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Mike_Huckabee_Free_Trade.htm |publisher=[[On the Issues]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Race relations===

According to a [[CNN]] exit poll, Huckabee won 48% of African American votes in his successful 1998 gubernatorial race in Arkansas.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/1998/states/AR/G/exit.poll.html "Arkansas Governor: 844 respondents"], CNN (November 4, 1998).</ref> The 48% figure is often disputed due to the exit poll's small sample size.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/2016/8/1/12338538/gop-attract-black-voters "Can the GOP attrack black voters?"], Vox (August 1, 2016).</ref> Huckabee says that it is important for Republicans such as himself to reach out to black voters, and in 2015 he has ramped up efforts to win those votes.<ref name=Ashley>Killough, Ashley.

In 2015, Huckabee stated on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' that the confederate flag issue was for South Carolinians to decide, "not an issue for a person running for president", and days later he congratulated Gov. [[Nikki Haley]] on her decision supporting removal of the flag from the state capitol.<ref name=Ashley /> Huckabee gave a speech at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] that included this: "I say with sincerity that I have great respect for Senator Obama's historic achievement to become his party's nominee—not because of his color, but with indifference to it. Party or politics aside, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country."<ref>"Huckabee assails media coverage of GOP", [[NBC News]] (September 4, 2008).</ref>

===LGBT rights===

Huckabee believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he opposes both [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]]. In 2006, he outlawed same-sex marriage in Arkansas, but in 2007 he stated that Americans should "respect" gay couples. He says that adoptions should be child focused and opposes [[LGBT adoption|"gay adoptions"]].<ref name="issues">{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm |title=Mike Huckabee on the Issues |accessdate=July 29, 2007 |publisher=[[On the Issues]] }}</ref> Huckabee, expounding upon his view on homosexuality, said the following: 
{{Quote|quotetext=This [gay marriage] is not just a political issue. It is a [[biblical]] issue. And as a biblical issue—unless I get a new version of the scriptures, it's really not my place to say, OK, I'm just going to evolve[.] . . . It's like asking someone who's [[Jewish]] to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli. We don't want to do that—I mean, we're not going to do that.

In January 2015, he compared homosexuality to "drinking and swearing", insofar as it is "part of a lifestyle". Huckabee has stated he has gay friends, saying, "People can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyle. I don't shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view[.]"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/01/politics/huckabee-gay-marriage/|title=Huckabee compares gay marriage to drinking, swearing – CNNPolitics.com |author=Eric Bradner, CNN|date=February 1, 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

===Social norms===

In comments made March 4, 2011, on the ''[[Michael Medved Show]]'', Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress [[Natalie Portman]], saying "it's unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out of wedlock children."<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[AOL News]] |date=March 4, 2011 |title=Mike Huckabee Disses Natalie Portman; Over Out of Wedlock Pregnancy Why Not Bristol Palin? |first=Steven |last=Hoffer}}</ref>

In January 2014, in a luncheon speech at the [[Republican National Committee]]'s winter meeting, in response to a federal mandate on [[contraception]], Huckabee stated that "Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without [[wikt:Uncle Sugar|Uncle Sugar]] coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/mike-huckabees-war-for-women |title=Mike Huckabee's War for Women |last=Lapidos |first=Juliet |date=January 24, 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}<br />{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/23/mike-huckabee-s-controversial-remarks-at-rnc.html |title=Huckabee: Dems Tell Women They Can't Control Libido Without Government |last=Jacobs |first=Ben |date=January 23, 2014 |publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}<br />{{cite news |url=https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/huckabee-vs-huckabee |title=Huckabee vs. Huckabee |last1=Benen |first1=Steve |date=January 24, 2014 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Role of religion in public life===

Huckabee has voiced his support of [[intelligent design]] and he has stated that he does not accept the validity of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[natural selection|theory of evolution]]. He was quoted in July 2004 on ''Arkansans Ask'', his regular show on the Arkansas Educational Television Network: "I think that students also should be given exposure to the theories not only of evolution but to the basis of those who believe in creationism."<ref>{{cite web |date=2005 |last=Wiles |first=Jason |title=Is Evolution Arkansas's Hidden Curriculum? |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/25/1-2/is-evolution-arkansass-hidden-curriculum |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

In April 2011, Huckabee said, "I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message," in praise of the Christian revisionist historian [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]].<ref name="barton">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/mike-huckabee-americans-to-be-indoctrinated-at-gunpoint/|title=Mike Huckabee: Americans to be indoctrinated at gunpoint|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406124057/http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/mike-huckabee-americans-to-be-indoctrinated-at-gunpoint/|archivedate=April 6, 2011}}</ref>

Within hours of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], Huckabee made headlines in the U.S. and abroad for stating on [[Fox News]]: "We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools," and further asked, "Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?"<ref>{{cite news |date=December 14, 2012 |last=Collins |first=Gail |title=Looking For America |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/opinion/collins-looking-for-america.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

In September 2014, Huckabee said, "Fire the ones who refuse to hear not only our hearts, but God's heart" (for which he was criticized by [[Richard Dawkins]]).<ref>{{cite news |date=September 30, 2014 |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |last2=Blumner |first2=Robyn |authorlink2=Robyn Blumner|title=Atheists Aren't the Problem, Christian Intolerance Is the Problem |url=https://time.com/3450525/atheists-arent-the-problem-christian-intolerance-is-the-problem |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

In September 2015, speaking about his support on religious freedom grounds of Kentucky county clerk [[Kim Davis]] to radio host [[Michael Medved]], Huckabee said, "Michael, [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision of 1857]] still remains to this day the law of the land which says that black people aren't fully human. Does anybody still follow the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision?"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/253292-huckabee-says-dred-scott-still-law-of-land|title=Huckabee says Dred Scott still 'law of land'|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/11/mike-huckabee-dred-scott-decision-still-law-land/|title=Mike Huckabee: Dred Scott decision still 'the law of the land'|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]}}</ref> (The decision in ''Dred Scott v.

In June 2016, Huckabee, along with actor [[Pat Boone]] and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', sent a letter to California governor [[Jerry Brown]] opposing Senate Bill 1146, which "prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination" at California colleges. Other than religious schools—those that train pastors and theology teachers—schools "might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=June 30, 2016|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gods-not-dead-2-filmmakers-907838|title=''God's Not Dead 2'' Filmmakers Wade Into California Politics|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>

===Military===

In 2007, Huckabee argued for a larger military and an increase in defense spending, writing, "Right now, we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense, compared with about six percent in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan. We need to return to that six percent level."<ref name="foreignaffairs.org">{{cite web |date=2008 |last=Huckabee |first=Michael D. |title=America's Priorities in the War on Terror |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/63059/michael-d-huckabee/americas-priorities-in-the-war-on-terror |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Immigration===

During his bid for president, Huckabee released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. His plan included building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increased visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. He has previously stated he is opposed to using military resources for border patrol.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201237.html| title=Interview with Arkansas Gov.

===Gun control===

Huckabee has voiced his support for [[self-defense]] and the [[Castle Doctrine]], and has generally taken an anti-[[gun control]] stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed.<ref name="issues"/>

===Weight loss and health advocacy===
When elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was [[obesity|obese]]. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with [[type 2 diabetes]], and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135&nbsp;kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor [[Frank D. White]] (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50&nbsp;kg).<ref>

* ''God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy'' (2015) – In ''God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,'' Huckabee discusses the myriad differences he's seen between those who live in the blue, coastal "bubbles" and the "bubbas" of the red flyover states. Huckabee uses [[Jay Z]] and [[Beyoncé]] as examples of a "culture of crude". He describes Beyoncé's lyrics as "obnoxious and toxic mental poison".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blistein|first1=Jon|title=Watch Jon Stewart, Mike Huckabee Clash Over Culture, Beyoncé|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/jon-stewart-mike-huckabee-clash-over-culture-beyonce-20150120 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>
