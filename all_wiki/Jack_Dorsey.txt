In May 2016, Dorsey announced that Twitter would not count photos and links in the 140-character limit to free up more space for text. This was an attempt to entice new users, since the number of tweets per day had dropped to about 300 million in January 2016 from about 500 million in September 2013 and its peak of 661 million in August 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-changes-too-little-too-late-jack-dorsey-moral-authority-2016-5|title=Jack Dorsey is moving too slowly to save Twitter|website=Business Insider|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

On November 22, 2016, Dorsey was briefly suspended from his own Twitter account with 3.9 million followers. After restoring the account, Dorsey tweeted that the suspension was due to an "internal mistake".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-ceo-jack-dorseys-account-briefly-suspended-1479871858?mod=e2twd|title=Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly Suspended|first=Deepa|last=Seetherman|website=Wall Street Journal|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2017, Dorsey and Executive Chairman [[Omid Kordestani]] matched a $530,000 donation to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) raised by Twitter staffers.

In March 2018, Dorsey announced that an improved version of the [[identity verification service|verification system]] would be coming to Twitter. The purpose of redesigning verification was to let people verify more facts about themselves, emphasizing proof of identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/03/09/twitter-verification-all-users/|title=Twitter Wants to Open Verification to All Users|work=Fortune|access-date=March 9, 2018|language=en|first=Laignee|last=Barron|date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> The overhaul was not in place before the [[United States midterm election|U.S midterm election]] of [[2018 United States elections|2018]] to help in [[authentication|verifying the identities]] of the candidates.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/08/jack-dorsey-pledges-twitter-improve-blue-check-mark-verification-system/409310002/|title=Jack Dorsey pledges Twitter will improve blue check mark verification system|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018|language=en|first=Jessica|last=Guynn|date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2018, Dorsey testified before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] alongside [[Facebook]] [[Chief operating officer|COO]] [[Sheryl Sandberg]] about meddling in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

[[File:President Trump Meets with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey (40715975903).jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] with Dorsey in the Oval Office of the White House on April 23, 2019]]
Dorsey met privately with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] at the White House and discussed Trump's concerns that Twitter had [[shadow banning|limited or removed]] some of his Twitter followers, and those of conservatives. After the meeting, Dorsey tweeted that their discussion included making Twitter "healthier and more civil".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/trump-meets-with-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-white-house/ |title=Trump met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ‚Äì and complained about his follower count |date=April 23, 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Tony |last=Romm |access-date=April 27, 2019 }}</ref> A week earlier, Dorsey took part in a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] about the social media platform's spread of abuse and misinformation, which has brought him criticism.<ref>{{cite  news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-abuse-ted-2019-4 |title=Jack Dorsey says Twitter makes it 'super easy' to harass and abuse others, and addressing the problem is his biggest worry |date=April 17, 2019 |newspaper=BBusiness Insider |first=Aria |last=Bendix |access-date=April 27, 2019 }}</ref>

On October 23, 2019, Twitter's stock price fell by nearly 24 percent, from $38.83 to $30.75. The reason was an earnings miss off a third-quarter report, which Twitter blamed on ad targeting problems. Dorsey had been making a concerted effort to dampen the effect that Twitter had on political elections, which entailed banning all political ads. This was also seen as a large contributor to the drop. Dorsey announced that, as of November 22, 2019, Twitter would ban all political advertising. The policy applies globally to all marketing campaigns about political issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election|title=Twitter to ban all political advertising, raising pressure on Facebook|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|date=2019-10-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
