In the second half of the twentieth century, U.S. advocates for workplace equity popularized the term and concept of role models as part of a larger [[social capital]] lexicon—which also includes terms such as [[glass ceiling]], [[personal network|networking]], [[mentorship|mentoring]], and [[gatekeeper]]—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970 these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech.<ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker">{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Pamela Walker|title=Pull: Networking and Success since Benjamin Franklin|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780674025530}}</ref> Although the term ''role model'' has been criticized more recently as "outdated",<ref name="Whannel, Garry">{{cite book|last=Whannel|first=Garry|title=Media Sport Stars: Masculinities and Moralities|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781134698714}}</ref> the term and its associated responsibility remains prominent in the public consciousness as a commonly used phrase, and a "powerful presence" in the [[Show business|entertainment industry]] and media.<ref name="Tomlinson, Alan">{{cite book|last=Tomlinson|first=Alan|title=A Dictionary of Sports Studies|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199213818}}</ref>

Role models can also be national, for example, Chilean politicians and intellectuals had France as the prime role model during much of the 19th century until [[German influence in Chile|they shifted to Germany]] in the last decades of the century.<ref name=Carlos2011>{{cite book |last1=Sanhueza |first1=Carlos |language=es |date=2011 |chapter=El debate sobre "el embrujamiento alemán" y el papel de la ciencia alemana hacia fines del siglo XIX en Chile |chapter-url=http://publications.iai.spk-berlin.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/Document_derivate_00000510/BIA%20146%20Sanhueza.pdf |title=Ideas viajeras y sus objetos.

== Effect on career opportunity and choice ==

According to historian Pamela  Laird, a person's chosen role models may have a considerable impact on his or her career opportunities and choices. The suitability of a role model depends, in part, on the admirer’s perceived commonality with the model, who should provide an image of an ambitious yet realistic goal. For example, Laird suggests that, [[Benjamin Franklin]] served as the role model for countless nineteenth-century white businessmen, including notables such as [[Thomas Mellon]], [[Benjamin Goodrich|B.F. Goodrich]], and [[Friedrich Weyerhäuser|Frederick Weyerhäuser]]. Laird suggests that the lack of commonalities between potential role models and would-be admirers helped perpetuate barriers to American minorities and women as they tried to advance in a business world dominated by white men, thus spurring late twentieth-century efforts to develop suitable role models for these groups.<ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/>

Parent role models also significantly influence a person's "education and training aspirations, task self-efficacy, and expectancy for an entrepreneurial career".<ref>Robert F. Scherer, et al. "Role Model Performance Effects on Development of Entrepreneurial Career Preference." Entrepreneurship: Theory & Practice 13.3 (1989): 53-71.</ref>

== Celebrity role models==

The ever-widening reach of the media in popular culture has elevated certain celebrities to worldwide acclaim. This boom of media coverage and constant exposure to these individuals resulted in a change of mindset toward celebrities in both adults and youth alike. According to a survey of teachers in the United Kingdom conducted in 2008 by the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]], young people most frequently chose sports stars as role models, followed by pop stars. Many, however, simply aspired to be "[[famous for being famous]]", believing that fame and fortune could be easily accessed through [[reality television]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atl.org.uk/media-office/media-archive/celebrity-culture-increases.asp|title=The Beckhams are the celebrities most children aspire to be, as celebrity culture increases its influence, says ATL|date=14 March 2008|publisher=Association of Teachers and Lecturers|accessdate=February 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928165950/http://www.atl.org.uk/media-office/media-archive/celebrity-culture-increases.asp|archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

==Community role models==

{{citation needed span|date=March 2019|text=Community role models are often overlooked and scarce. Teachers and parents fill this gap and are considered a central influence to a child’s upbringing and future success.}} According to Rita Pierson, teachers, because of the large amount of time spent with children, have such a huge impact on children that they're being advised to be likeable in order to build strong emotional relationships with [[children]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pierson|first1=Rita|title=Every Kid Needs A Champion|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/rita_pierson_every_kid_needs_a_champion|website=www.ted.com|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>  {{citation needed span|date=March 2019|text=Some community role models like the ones in western communities are usually experts in a certain field. Whereas in other communities, like in [[Indigenous community|indigenous communities]], role models are often based on career choice (like [[teacher]]s, doctors, etc.) but by demonstrating to others how to do something for example in indigenous [[Mexico|Mexican]] communities parents take their children from newborns to work. Anybody from the community has the potential to become a role model.}}

==Athlete role models==
There is significant discussion as to whether athletes should be considered role models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/portfolio/2014/10/17/Storytelling-Can-a-sports-hero-be-a-role-model-Yes-thankfully/stories/201410170009|title=Storytelling: Can a sports hero be a role model? Yes, thankfully}}</ref> Some athletes have been asked to behave as if they were role models for their local communities,<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leighsteinberg/2013/01/20/why-do-we-make-athletes-role-models/|title=Why Do We Make Athletes Role Models?|first=Leigh|last=Steinberg}}</ref> and some such as [[Hank Greenberg]] have deliberately tried to set a good example<ref name="sol">[http://www.solitudecanyon.com/thoughts-from-the-canyon/should-athletes-be-role-models- SHOULD ATHLETES BE ROLE MODELS? HAMMERIN' HANK V CHARLES BARKLEY]</ref> but generally regarding athletes as role models has been criticised due to their appointment often being based solely on sporting ability rather than any morality<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/michael-dobie/athletes-are-not-automatic-role-models-michael-dobie-1.9357371|title=Dobie: Athletes aren't automatic role models}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewNewsArticle.aspx?TabId=0&itemid=6383&mid=14491|title=The New Sports Role Model}}</ref>&nbsp;– it has been suggested that the discipline and control shown continuously by sportspeople on the field leads to a belief from viewers that these same qualities are continuously shown off the field. These and other factors such as the elements of competition, excitement and success are what make people want to emulate them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/agencyspy/op-ed-winning-isnt-everything-the-tiger-woods-brand_b31379 |website=www.mediabistro.com |title=Op-Ed: Winning Isn't Everything – The Tiger Woods Brand |date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>
[[Charles Barkley]] has stated that he believes athletes are not the figures that children should be emulating and that it is the parent's responsibility to be role models,<ref name="forbes"/> that the role is deliberately applied by the media out of jealousy in order to make life more difficult for sportspeople, and that it sets up the sportspeople as an unattainable target for most.<ref name="sol"/>
