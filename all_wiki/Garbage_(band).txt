'''Garbage''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1993 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name="behindthemusic">{{cite episode | title = Garbage | series = Behind The Music | series-link = Behind The Music | credits = Jim Forbes (narrator) | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 31 March 2002}}</ref> The band's lineup—consisting of Scottish singer and musician [[Shirley Manson]] (vocals) and American musicians [[Duke Erikson]] (guitar, bass, keyboards), [[Steve Marker]] (guitar, keyboards), and [[Butch Vig]] (drums, production)—has remained unchanged since its inception. All four members are involved in songwriting and [[Record producer|production]].

The band's [[Garbage (album)|eponymous debut album]] was critically acclaimed upon its release, selling over four million copies and achieving [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] certification in the UK, US and Australia. It was accompanied by a string of increasingly successful [[single (music)|singles]] from 1995 to 1996, including "[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]" and "[[Only Happy When It Rains]]".<ref name="Version2.0PR">{{cite press release |title= Version 2.0 press release | publisher = [[Mushroom Records]] | date =30 March 1998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9810/26/garbage |title=Getting dirty with Garbage |author=Freydkin, Donna |publisher =CNN |accessdate= 24 June 2014}}</ref> Follow-up ''[[Version 2.0]]'', released in 1998 after a year in production, was equally successful, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]] and receiving two [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

==History==
[[File:Butch Vig.jpg|thumb|Butch Vig had built a reputation as a rock producer before deciding to form Garbage.]]

===Formation and early years (1993–1994)===
Duke Erikson and [[Butch Vig]] had been in several bands, including [[Spooner (band)|Spooner]] and [[Fire Town]] (with Steve Marker as a [[sound engineer]]). In 1983, Vig and Marker founded [[Smart Studios]] in Madison and Vig's production work brought him to the attention of [[Sub Pop]]. Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig and Marker's career as producers gained strength.<ref name="RecordCollector">"Welcome to Spooner Town", by Andy Davis, ''[[Record Collector]]'', issue No.&nbsp;209, January 1997</ref> In 1994, as Vig become "kind of burned out on doing really long records," he got together with Erikson and Marker, and they started doing remixes for acts such as [[U2]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[House of Pain]]. The remixes featured different instrumentation, and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. This experience inspired the three men to form a band, where they "wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup."<ref name=sos>{{cite web |url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html |title= BUTCH VIG: Nevermind The Garbage |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=March 1997 |author=Buskin, Richard |accessdate= 2012-01-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926103557/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html |archive-date= September 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

According to Vig, the team drew inspiration for its name from a hostile early comment, when a friend of the band heard recording material, probably for "[[Vow (song)|Vow]]" and groaned, "This shit sounds like garbage!"<ref name="behindthemusic" />  However, according to ''This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake'', an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, "without coming up with anything cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." The name derives from the last line of this entry: "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".<ref>{{Cite book |title=This is the noise that keeps me awake |author= Garbage (Musical group) |others=Cohen, Jason |isbn= 978-1617755507 |location= Brooklyn, NY |oclc= 959035520|year = 2017}}</ref>

Initial sessions with Vig on vocals, along with the members' past work with all-male groups, led to the band's desire for a woman on lead.<ref name="volume">{{cite journal |url= //www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |title=Garbage Interview |date=1 November 1994 |journal=Volume |issue=12 |accessdate= 24 February 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |archive-date= October 14, 1999 }}</ref> Vig declared that they wanted to find a female vocalist like "[[Debbie Harry]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Chrissie Hynde]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] – all really strong, unique personalities".<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Bosso|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/butch-vig-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|title=Butch Vig: The 10 Records That Changed My Life|publisher=Loudersound.com|date=8 October 2015 |accessdate= 27 February 2018}}</ref> Marker and Vig desired someone "who didn't have a high, chirpy, girly quality to her voice" and who could sing in an understated way, in contrast to "these alterna-rock singers [that] have a tendency to [[Screaming (music)|scream]]".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-17/entertainment/ca-15158_1_pop-music|title= POP MUSIC : Beyond the Pail : How to turn Garbage into gold|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 17, 1995 |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |accessdate= 2012-01-19}}</ref>  Marker was watching ''[[120 Minutes]]'' when he saw the music video for [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]]'s "Suffocate Me". He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager Shannon O'Shea tracked down the band's singer, Shirley Manson. When Manson was contacted, she did not know who Vig was and was urged to check the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] on ''[[Nevermind]]'', the popular [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] album which Vig produced.<ref name="behindthemusic" />

On 8 April 1994, Manson met Erikson, Marker, and Vig for the first time in London. Later that evening Vig was informed of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s [[Death of Kurt Cobain|suicide]].<ref name="behindthemusic" /> Garbage was put on hold until Angelfish was finished touring North America in support of [[Live (band)|Live]].<ref name="TFYUS">"''Thanks For Your, Uhh Support'', [[Absolute Garbage#Absolute Garbage DVD|Absolute Garbage DVD]]. Retrieved 2008-02-24</ref> Erikson, Marker, and Vig attended the [[Metro Chicago]] date, and Manson was invited to Madison to audition for the band.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Barrell |url= http://www.tonybarrell.com/shirley-bossy/ |title= Shirley Bossy |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date= 1998-05-17 |accessdate= 2014-09-27}}</ref> The audition did not go well, but Manson socialized with the men while there and they found they had a similar taste in music. Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour. Manson called O'Shea and asked to audition again, feeling that "it could work out".<ref name="behindthemusic" />

Manson described her first session with the band as "a disaster", as she had no experience as a [[session player]], and she and the band were "two parties totally uncomfortable with the situation", but the "mutual disdain" from that meeting managed to pull the band together. The first songs were skeletal versions of the songs "[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]", "[[Queer (song)|Queer]]" and "[[Vow (song)|Vow]]", which led to some ad-libbed lyrics by Manson.<ref name=Serendipitous>{{cite book |last= Borzillo |first=Carrie |title= Garbage's Serendipitous Success; Popularity Falls into Place for Almo Act |date=1996-03-23 |publisher= Billboard |location=Los Angeles |pages=9, 97 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA9}}</ref><ref name="makingmusic">"''Making Music'' June 1, 1996 issue".

Garbage relocated to [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on March 1, 1997 to write songs for their second album.

=== ''Beautiful Garbage'' (2001–2002) ===
[[File:Shirley Manson.jpg|thumb|upright|Shirley Manson performing live at Voodoo Festival 2002]]

Garbage regrouped on April 10, 2001. The group began work on their third record, and put aside plans for a [[B-sides]] album due to the sale of Almo Sounds to the [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]. Manson ran an online blog throughout the recording of the album named ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]''. During the recording of the album, Garbage invoked a provision of its contract to leave Almo, and sued UMG when it refused to terminate the contract. UMG threatened to use Manson's 1993 solo contract to tie Garbage to the label.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/garbage-sue-universal-20010131 Garbage Sue Universal], ''Rolling Stone''</ref> The suit was settled on July 29, 2001, and Garbage moved to [[Interscope]].
