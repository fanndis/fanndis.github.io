Huntington is part of the [[New York metropolitan area]]. As of the [[United States 2010 Census]], the town population was 203,264.

Huntington is the only township in the United States to ban self-service gas stations at the township level. Along with [[New Jersey]] and [[Oregon]], they are the only three places in the country where [[Filling station#United States and Canada|full-service gas stations]] are compulsory.<ref>{{cite news|title=The future of pumping gas and other make-work jobs|date=January 8, 2018|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-gaspump-oregon-make-work-jobs-0109-20180108-story.html|access-date=May 13, 2019|first=Noah|last=Smith}}</ref>

==History==
In 1653, three men from Oyster Bay, Richard Holbrook, Robert Williams and Daniel Whitehead, purchased a parcel of land from the [[Matinecock (tribe)|Matinecock tribe]]. This parcel has since come to be known as the "First Purchase" and included land bordered by [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]] on the west, [[Northport, New York|Northport Harbor]] on the east, what is now known as [[Old Country Road]] to the south and [[Long Island Sound]] to the north. The three men immediately turned the land over to the settlers who had already been living there.<ref name=HoH>

From that initial settlement, Huntington grew over subsequent years to include all of the land presently comprising the modern Towns of Huntington and [[Babylon (town), New York|Babylon]]. The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.<ref name=HoH/>

Because Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam. It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.<ref name=HoH/>

Following the [[Battle of Long Island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.<ref name=HoH/>

The arrival of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting. Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.<ref name=HoH/>

The end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region. Farms and resorts gave way to homes, and Huntington has transformed into a major [[bedroom community]] for nearby New York City.<ref name=HoH/>
