==Early life and education==
King was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], one of two kids of Jennie (Gitlitz), a garment worker who was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Vilna Governorate|Lithuania]], and Aaron Zeiger, a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker who was born in [[Kolomyia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=ss2/><ref name= fastfacts>[http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/us/larry-king-fast-facts/ ''Larry King Fast Facts''] CNN.

===Miami radio and television===
A [[CBS]] staff announcer, whom King met by chance, suggested he go to Florida which was a growing [[media market]] with openings for inexperienced broadcasters. King went to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and after initial setbacks, he gained his first job in radio.

King's Miami radio show brought him local attention. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted ''Miami Undercover'', airing Sunday nights at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now [[WPLG]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Bershad|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/from-the-mediaite-vault-larry-king-takes-on-gangsters-and-loses-in-1961/|title=From the Mediaite Vault: Larry King Takes on Gangsters (and Loses) in 1961| work = [[Mediaite]] (blog)|date= June 30, 2010|access-date=February 18, 2012}}</ref> On the show, he moderated debates on important local issues of the day.

King credits his success on local television to the assistance of comedian [[Jackie Gleason]], whose national television variety show was being taped in Miami Beach during this time. "That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami," King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. "He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/kin0int-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980201214239/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/kin0int-1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 1, 1998 |title=The Interview King |publisher=[[Academy of Achievement]] |date=June 29, 1996 |access-date=March 3, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2020, it was reported that King had unwittingly been duped into filming a purported interview that was in fact part of a Chinese propaganda campaign against [[Guo Wengui]], a Chinese dissident in [[New York City]] whom the Chinese government seeks to have deported{{Citation needed|date=November 2020|reason=No source is given for this claim, in fact it appears to be false}}. In 2019, King was asked by [[Jacobi Niv]], a friend who had in the past arranged for King to film various infomercials and promotional videos to film what King was told would be a conference video. Niv gave King a list of scripted questions to read. These were later edited into a video of comments by Russian journalist Anastasia Dolgova on the topic of Guo Wengui, whom Dolgova alleged had committed a number of crimes. The video was edited to give the appearance of King and Dolgova having a live conversation; however, the questions and answers were recorded separately and King, reading a script, was unaware of her responses, which repeated the line of the Chinese government on the issue. Once King's own production company saw the completed video, they refused to post it online and asked that it not be released. Niv disregarded their objections and released the video independently on [[YouTube]]. King's family insisted that it be removed but once Niv took it down he found that it had been duplicated and gone viral on Twitter due to the efforts of what [[ProPublica]] alleges are Chinese government–run social media accounts. As a result of the incident, King has severed his relationship with Niv, saying he believes Niv took advantage of their friendship.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Disinfomercial: How Larry King Got Duped Into Starring in Chinese Propaganda |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/the-disinfomercial-how-larry-king-got-duped-into-starring-in-chinese-propaganda |access-date=August 17, 2020 |work=ProPublica |date=July 30, 2020}}</ref>
