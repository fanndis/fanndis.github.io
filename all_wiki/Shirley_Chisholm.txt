In the [[1972 United States presidential election]], she became the first African-American candidate for a major party's nomination for [[President of the United States]], and the first woman to run for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s presidential nomination.

Born in [[Brooklyn]], Chisolm studied and worked in early childhood education, becoming involved in local Democratic party politics in the 1950s.  In 1964, overcoming some resistance because she was a woman, she was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]].  Four years later she was elected to Congress, where she led expansion of food and nutrition programs for the poor and rose to party leadership.  She retired from Congress in 1983 and taught at [[Mt Holyoke College]], while continuing her political organizing.  Although nominated for an ambassadorship in 1993, health issues caused her to withdraw.  In 2015, Chisholm was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

===Initial election===
In 1968 she ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 12th congressional district]], which as part of a court-mandated reapportionment plan had been significantly redrawn to focus on Bedford-Stuyvesant and was thus expected to result in Brooklyn's first Black member of Congress.<ref name="nyt022668">{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/02/26/77173325.pdf | title=3 Negroes Weigh House Race In New Brooklyn 12th District | first=Earl | last=Caldwell | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 26, 1968 | page=29}}</ref> ([[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]] had, in 1945, become the first Black member of Congress from New York City as a whole.)

Chisholm was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].

She later played a critical role in the creation of the [[WIC|Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)]] program. Chisholm would credit Schneerson for the fact that so many "poor babies [now] have milk and poor children have food".<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Telushkin|title=[[Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M.

Chisholm created controversy when she visited rival and ideological opposite [[George Wallace]] in the hospital soon after his shooting in May 1972, during the presidential primary campaign.

Throughout her tenure in Congress, Chisholm worked to improve opportunities for [[inner city|inner-city]] residents.

In the area of national security and foreign policy, Chisholm worked for the revocation of [[Internal Security Act of 1950]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/07/024249|title=Congress Honors Shirley Chisholm, the First African American Woman Representative|website=Democracy Now!|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115003506/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F04%2F07%2F024249|archive-date=2007-11-15}}</ref> She opposed the American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and the expansion of weapon developments.

Chisholm's first marriage ended in divorce in February 1977.<ref name="usa-obit"/> Later that year she married [[Arthur Hardwick, Jr.]], a former New York State Assemblyman whom Chisholm had known when they both served in that body and who was now a Buffalo liquor store owner.<ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="usa-obit"/> Chisholm had no children.<ref name="usa-obit"/>

Hardwick was subsequently injured in an automobile accident; desiring to take care of him, and also dissatisfied with the course of liberal politics in the wake of the [[Reagan Revolution]], she announced her retirement from Congress in 1982.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> Hardwick died in 1986.<ref name="usa-obit"/>

==1972 presidential campaign==
Chisholm began exploring her candidacy in July 1971, and formally announced her presidential bid on January 25, 1972,<ref name="Freeman"/> in a Baptist church in her district in Brooklyn.<ref name="fls-72"/> There she called for a "bloodless revolution" at the forthcoming Democratic nomination convention.<ref name="fls-72"/> Chisholm became the first Black major-party candidate to run for [[President of the United States]], in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 U.S. presidential election]], making her also the first woman ever to run for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1972|Democratic Party's presidential nomination]] (U.S. Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]] had previously run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1964).<ref name="Freeman"/>  In her presidential announcement, Chisholm described herself as representative of the people and offered a new articulation of American identity: "I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country, although I am a woman and equally proud of that. I am the candidate of the people and my presence before you symbolizes a new era in American political history."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/history/the-first-black-woman-presidential-candidate/|title=The First Black Woman Presidential Candidate {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2015-10-21|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>

Her campaign was underfunded, only spending $300,000 in total.<ref name="Freeman"/> She also struggled to be regarded as a serious candidate instead of as a symbolic political figure;<ref name="usa-obit"/> she was ignored by much of the Democratic political establishment and received little support from her Black male colleagues.<ref name="spi-2008"/> She later said, "When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men."<ref name="nyt-obit"/> In particular, she expressed frustration about the "black matriarch thing", saying, "They think I am trying to take power from them. The black man must step forward, but that doesn't mean the black woman must step back."<ref name="fls-72"/> Her husband, however, was fully supportive of her candidacy and said, "I have no hangups about a woman running for president."<ref name="ap-husband"/> Security was also a concern, as during the campaign three confirmed threats were made against her life; Conrad Chisholm served as her bodyguard until [[U.S. Secret Service]] protection was given to her in May 1972.<ref>Winslow, ''Shirley Chisholm'', p. 124.</ref>

Chisholm skipped the initial March 7 New Hampshire contest, instead focusing on the March 14 Florida primary, which she thought would be receptive due to its "blacks, youth, and a strong women's movement".<ref name="Freeman"/> But due to organizational difficulties and Congressional responsibilities, she only made two campaign trips there and ended with 3.5 percent of the vote for a seventh-place finish.<ref name="Freeman"/><ref name="cq-pres-elec"/> Chisholm had difficulties gaining ballot access, but campaigned or received votes in primaries in fourteen states.<ref name="Freeman"/> Her largest number of votes came in the June 6 California primary, where she received 157,435 votes for 4.4 percent and a fourth-place finish, while her best percentage in a competitive primary came in the May 6 North Carolina one, where she got 7.5 percent for a third-place finish.<ref name="cq-pres-elec"/> Overall, she won 28 delegates during the primaries process itself.<ref name="Freeman"/><ref>House resolution 97, Recognizing Contributions, Achievements, and Dedicated Work of Shirley Anita Chisholm, [Congressional Record: June 12, 2001 (House).

At the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], there were still efforts taking place by the campaign of former Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] to stop the nomination of Senator [[George McGovern]]. After that failed and McGovern's nomination was assured, as a symbolic gesture, Humphrey released his Black delegates to Chisholm.<ref>{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Delaney | title=Humphrey Blacks to Vote For Mrs. Chisholm First | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 11, 1972 | page=1 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/07/11/81897334.pdf}}</ref> This, combined with defections from disenchanted delegates from other candidates, as well as the delegates she had won in the primaries, gave her a total of 152 first-ballot votes for the nomination during the July 12 roll call.<ref name="Freeman"/> (Her precise total was 151.95.<ref name="cq-pres-elec"/>) Her largest support overall came from Ohio, with 23 delegates (slightly more than half of them White),<ref name="afro-petit"/> even though she had not been on the ballot in the May 2 primary there.<ref name="Freeman"/><ref name="cq-pres-elec"/> Her total gave her fourth place in the roll call tally, behind McGovern's winning total of 1,728 delegates.<ref name="cq-pres-elec"/> Chisholm said she ran for the office "in spite of hopeless odds ... to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo".<ref name="usa-obit"/>

It is sometimes stated that Chisholm won a primary in 1972, or won three states overall, with New Jersey, Louisiana, and Mississippi being so identified.
