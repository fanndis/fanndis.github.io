'''Western Ukraine''' or the '''Ukrainian West''' ({{lang-uk|Західна Україна}}, or {{lang-uk|Захід України}}) is a geographical and historical relative term used in reference to the western territories of [[Ukraine]]. The form Ukrainian West is used but not emphasized often. The territory includes several historical regions such as ''[[wikt:Transcarpathia|Transcarpathia]]'', ''[[Halychyna]]'' including [[Pokuttia]], most of ''[[Volhynia]]'', northern ''[[Bukovina]]'' as well as western ''[[Podolia]]''. The main historical areas that the territory covers are Volhynia and Russia, today more known as Galicia or, locally, Halychyna. Russia in the Ukrainian West has nothing to do with the country to the east from Ukraine. The control over the territory the Muscovite Russia obtained only in the 20th century, particularly, during [[World War II]] when it was known as the Soviet Union and along with the [[Nazi Germany]] participated in another [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning of Poland]]. Less often the Ukrainian West includes areas of eastern Volhynia, Podolia, and small portion of northern Bessarabia (eastern part of [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]). The city of [[Lviv]] is the main cultural center of the region and historical capital of kingdom and palatinatus of Russia. Other important cities are [[Buchach]], [[Chernivtsi]], [[Drohobych]], [[Halych]] (hence - Halychyna), [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Khotyn]], [[Lutsk]], [[Mukacheve]], [[Rivne]], [[Ternopil]], [[Uzhhorod]] and others. Strong association with the Rusyn or the Ruthenian nation in the region existed until the [[World War II]], including Galician Rusyns and Carpathian Rusyns. The Ukrainian West is not an administrative category within Ukraine.

It is used mainly in the context of European history pertaining to the 20th-century wars and the ensuing period of annexations. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)]] and the [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] were part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] before its collapse after World War I. At the onset of World War II the part of Polish territory was incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (УРСР),<ref name="P-U-P">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKtOr4EXOWwC&q=Western+Ukraine | title=Western Ukraine | publisher=Princeton University Press | work=Revolution from Abroad: The Soviet Conquest of Poland's Western Ukraine | year=2002 | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | author=Jan T.

[[File:Red ruthenia history.png|thumb|Table of history of Western Ukraine]]
{{see also|General Government of Galicia and Bukovina}}
Following the 14th century [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], most of the region was transferred to the [[Crown of Poland]] under [[Casimir the Great]], who received the lands legally by a downward agreement in 1340 after his nephew's death, [[Bolesław-Jerzy II]]. The territory of [[Bucovina]] was occupied by [[Moldavia]]n voivode [[Dragoș, Voivode of Moldavia|Dragoș]] who was departed by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The eastern [[Volhynia]] and most of [[Podolia]] was added to the territory of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Lubart]]. 

After the 18th century [[partitions of Poland]] ([[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) the territory was split between the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. The modern south-western part of Western Ukraine became the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], after 1804 crownland of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Its northern flank with the cities of [[Lutsk]] and [[Rivne]] was acquired in 1795 by Imperial Russia following the third and [[Third Partition of Poland|final partition of Poland]]. Throughout its existence [[Russian Partition|Russian Poland]] was marred with violence and intimidation, beginning with the [[Massacre of Praga|1794 massacres]], imperial land-theft and the deportations of the [[November Uprising|November]] and [[January Uprising]]s.<ref name="Davies-60">{{citation |author=Norman Davies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&pg=PA60 |title=Part 2.

===Interbellum and World War II===
{{See also|West Ukrainian People's Republic}}
Following the defeat of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1918) in the [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]] of 1921, Western Ukraine was partitioned by the [[Treaty of Riga]] between Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Soviet Russia acting on behalf of the Soviet Belarus and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] with capital in [[Kharkiv]]. The [[Soviet Union]] gained control over the entire territory of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic east of the border with Poland.<ref name=endSkoro>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmN95fFocsMC&pg=PA849&dq=Ukrainian+State+Hetman+Pavlo&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=b5iaUbfCBefA0QWUloGYDQ&ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20State%20Hetman%20Pavlo&f=false Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States: 1999], [[Routledge]], 1999, {{ISBN|1857430581}} (page 849)</ref> In the [[Interbellum]] most of the territory of today's Western Ukraine belonged to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Territories such as [[Bukovina]] and [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] belonged to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], respectively.

{{see also|Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, Volhynia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet invasion of Poland}}
At the onset of [[Operation Barbarossa]] by Nazi Germany, the region became occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941. The southern half of West Ukraine was incorporated into the [[Semi-colony|semi-colonial]] ''[[Distrikt Galizien]]'' (District of Galicia) created on August 1, 1941 (Document No. 1997-PS of July 17, 1941 by Adolf Hitler) with headquarters in [[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]], bordering district of [[General Government]] to the west. Its northern part ([[Volhynia]]) was assigned to the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'' formed in September 1941. Notably, the District of Galicia was a separate administrative unit from the actual ''Reichskommissariat Ukraine'' with capital in [[Rivne]]. They were not connected with each other politically for Nazi Germans.<ref name="Bewersdorf">{{cite web |url=http://www.beirat-fuer-geschichte.de/fileadmin/pdf/band_19/Demokratische_Geschichte_Band_19_Essay_5.pdf |title=Hans-Adolf Asbach.

Bukovina was controlled by the pro-Nazi Kingdom of Romania. After the defeat of Germany in World War II, in May 1945 the Soviet Union incorporated all territories of current Western Ukraine into the Ukrainian SSR.<ref name=endSkoro/>

Western Ukraine includes such lands as [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]] ([[Kárpátalja]]), [[Volyn]], [[Halychyna]] ([[Prykarpattia]], [[Pokuttia]]), [[Bukovyna]], [[Polissia]], and [[Podillia]]. Note that sometimes Khmelnytsky region is considered a part of the [[central Ukraine]] as it is mostly lies within the western [[Podillya]].

The history of Western Ukraine is closely associated with the history of the following lands:
* Easternmost [[Bukovina]], historical [[Historical regions of Central Europe|region of Central Europe]] in official use since 1775, controlled by [[Kingdom of Romania]] after World War I and mostly ceded to the USSR by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]].
* [[Eastern Galicia]] ({{lang-uk|Halychyna}}), once a small kingdom with Lodomeria (1914), province of the Austrian Empire until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. See also: crownland of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]
* [[Red Ruthenia]] since medieval times in the area known today as Eastern Galicia.
* [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] declared in late 1918 until early 1919 and claiming half of Galicia with mostly Polish city dwellers (historical sense).
* [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] region within Czechoslovakia (1939) under Hungarian control until the Nazi occupation of Hungary in 1944.
* [[General Government of Galicia and Bukovina]] captured from Austria-Hungary during World War I. 
* [[Ținutul Suceava]] ([[Kingdom of Romania]])
* [[Volhynia]], historic region straddling Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus to the north. The alternate name for the region today is Lodomeria after the city of Volodymyr-Volynsky. See also: Polish unofficial term [[Kresy]] (Borderlands, 1918–1939) that includes the [[West Belarus]] as well as Volhynia.
* [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]] or Carpathian Ruthenia presently in the Zakarpattia Oblast of western Ukraine.

[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the dominant language in the region. Back in the schools of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] learning [[Russian language|Russian]] was mandatory; currently, in modern Ukraine, in schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction, classes in Russian and in other minority languages are offered.<ref name="SerhyYUBoaMN">[[Serhy Yekelchyk]] ''Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-19-530546-3}}</ref><ref>[http://norric.org/files/education-systems/Ukraine2009 The Educational System of Ukraine], Nordic Recognition Network, April 2009.</ref>

In terms of religion, the majority of adherents share the [[Byzantine Rite]] of [[Christianity]] as in the rest of Ukraine, but due to the region escaping the 1920s and 1930s [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|Soviet persecution]], a notably greater church adherence and belief in religion's role in society is present. Due to the complex [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|post-independence religious confrontation]] of several church groups and their adherents, the historical influence played a key role in shaping the present loyalty of Western Ukraine's faithful. In Galician provinces, the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] has the strongest following in the country, and the largest share of property and faithful. In the remaining regions: Volhynia, Bukovina and Transcarpathia the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] is prevalent. Outside of Western Ukraine the greatest in terms of Church property, clergy, and according to some estimates, faithful, is the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]]. In the listed regions (and in particular among the Orthodox faithful in Galicia), this position is notably weaker, as the main rivals, the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate]] and the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], have a far greater influence.

Bukovina-Chernvisti's electoral politics are more mixed and tempered by the region's significant Romanian minority. Finally, Zakarpattia's electoral politics tend to more competitive, similar to a Central Ukrainian oblast. This is due to the region's distinct historical and cultural identity as well as the significant Hungarian and Romanian minorities. The politics in the region dominated by such Ukrainian parties as [[United Centre]], [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]], pro-Russian separatist movement Podkarpathian Rusyns led by the Russian Orthodox Church bishop [[Dimitry Sydor]] and pro-Hungarian Democratic Party.
