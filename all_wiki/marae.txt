[[Image:Marae, Raiatea 2.jpg|thumb|390px|{{lang|ty|[[Taputapuatea marae|Taputapuātea]]}}, an ancient marae constructed of stone on {{lang|ty|[[Raiatea|Ra'iātea]]}} in the [[Society Islands]] of [[French Polynesia]], restored in 1994.]]

A '''''{{lang|mi|marae}}''''' (in [[Māori language|New Zealand Māori]], [[Cook Islands Māori]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]), '''''{{lang|to|mala{{okina}}e}}''''' (in [[Tongan language|Tongan]]), '''''{{lang|mrq|me{{okina}}ae}}''''' (in [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]]) or '''''{{lang|sm|malae}}''''' (in [[Samoan language|Samoan]]) is a communal or sacred place that serves religious and social purposes in [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] societies. In all these languages, the term also means cleared, free of weeds, trees. {{Lang|mi|Marae|italic=no}} generally consist of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular (the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} itself), bordered with stones or wooden posts (called ''{{lang|ty|au}}'' in Tahitian and Cook Islands Māori) perhaps with ''{{lang|mi|paepae}}'' (terraces) which were traditionally used for ceremonial purposes; and in some cases, a central stone ''{{lang|rap|[[Easter Island#Stone platforms|ahu]]}}'' or ''a'u''. In the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] culture of [[Easter Island]], the term ''{{lang|rap|ahu}}'' has become a synonym for the whole marae complex.

In some modern Polynesian societies, notably that of the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand, the marae is still a vital part of everyday life. In tropical Polynesia, most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity in the 19th century, and some have become an attraction for tourists or archaeologists. Nevertheless, the place where these marae were built are still considered ''{{lang|mi|[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]}}'' (sacred) in most of these cultures.

==Etymology==
The word has been reconstructed by linguists to Eastern Oceanic ''*malaqe'' with the meaning "open, cleared space used as meeting-place or ceremonial place".<ref name="pollex">[http://pollex.org.nz/entry/malaqe/ Polynesian Lexicon Project Online]</ref>

[[Image:Taupiri.jpg|thumb|right|390px|A ''marae'' at Kaitotehe, near [[Mount Taupiri|Taupiri mountain]], Waikato district, 1844. It was associated with [[Pōtatau Te Wherowhero]], a chief who became the first [[Māori King Movement|Māori king]].]] In Māori society, the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} is a place where the culture can be celebrated, where the Māori language can be spoken, where intertribal obligations can be met, where customs can be explored and debated, where family occasions such as birthdays can be held, and where important ceremonies, such as welcoming visitors or farewelling the dead (''[[tangihanga]]''), can be performed. Like the related institutions of old Polynesia, the ''marae'' is a ''wāhi tapu'', a 'sacred place' which carries great cultural meaning.

In Māori usage, the {{Lang|mi|marae ātea}} (often shortened to {{Lang|mi|marae}}) is the open space in front of the {{Lang|mi|[[wharenui]]}} (meeting house; literally "large building"). Generally the term {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} is used to refer to the whole complex, including the buildings and the {{Lang|mi|ātea}}. This area is used for ''[[pōwhiri]]'' (welcome ceremonies) featuring oratory. Some {{Lang|mi|[[iwi]]}} (tribes) and {{Lang|mi|hapū}} (sub-tribes) do not allow women to perform oratory on their {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}}, though typically women perform a [[Karanga (Māori culture)|Karanga (call)]]. The wharenui is the locale for important meetings, sleepovers, and craft and other cultural activities.

The ''wharekai'' (dining hall) is used primarily for communal meals, but other activities may be carried out there.

Many of the words associated with {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} in tropical Polynesia are retained in the Māori context. For example, the word {{Lang|mi|paepae}} refers to the bench where the speakers sit; this means it retains its sacred and ceremonial associations. {{Lang|mi|Marae}} vary in size, with some {{Lang|mi|[[wharenui]]}} being a bit bigger than a double garage, and some being larger than a typical town hall.

===Legal status===
A {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} is a meeting place registered as a reserve under the [[Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993]] (The Māori Land Act). Each {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} has a group of trustees who are responsible for the operations of the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}}. The Act governs the regulation of {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} as reservations and sets out the responsibilities of the trustees in relation to the beneficiaries. Generally each {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} has a charter which the trustees have negotiated with the beneficiaries of the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}}. The charter details matters such as:

*the name of the ''{{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}}'', and a description of it;
*a list of the beneficiaries: usually {{Lang|mi|iwi}} (tribes/nations), {{Lang|mi|hapū}} (clans) or {{Lang|mi|[[whānau]]|italic=no}} (families); in some cases, the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} is dedicated to the common good of the people of New Zealand.
*the methods used to select trustees;
*general governing principles of the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}};
*the ways in which the trustees may be held accountable by the beneficiaries, and methods for conflict resolution;
*principles governing appointment and recognition of committees to administer the {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}};
*procedures for amending the charter, and for ensuring adherence to its principles.

The [[New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute]] Act 1963 was passed and the institute built to maintain the tradition of {{Lang|mi|[[whakairo]]}}. The Institute is responsible for the building and restoration of over 40 {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} around the country.

===Traditional, church, and educational uses===
[[Image:Tanenuiarangi.jpg|right|thumb|Waipapa {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}}, [[University of Auckland]], New Zealand. The grassed area in front of the meeting house is the {{Lang|mi|marae ātea}}.]]Most iwi, hapū, and even many small settlements have their own marae. An example of such a small settlement with its own marae is at Hongoeka Bay, [[Plimmerton]], the home of the renowned writer [[Patricia Grace]]. Since the second half of the 20th century, Māori in urban areas have been establishing intertribal ''marae'' such as Maraeroa in eastern [[Porirua]]. For many Māori, the ''marae'' is just as important to them as their own homes.

Some New Zealand churches also operate marae of their own, in which all of the functions of a traditional marae are carried out. Churches operating marae include the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Catholic churches. In recent years, it has become common for educational institutions, including primary and secondary schools, technical colleges, and universities, to build marae for the use of the students and for the teaching of Māori culture. These marae may also serve as a venue for the performance of official ceremonies relating to the school.

The {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} of the [[University of Auckland]], for instance, is used for graduation ceremonies of the Māori Department, as well as welcoming ceremonies for new staff of the university as a whole. Its primary function is to serve as a venue for the teaching of {{Lang|mi|whaikōrero}} (oratory), Māori language and culture, and important ceremonies for distinguished guests of the university. Two detailed secondary-school marae are located in the Waikato at [[Te Awamutu College]] and [[Fairfield College]]. The latter was designed by a Māori architect with a detailed knowledge of carving and weaving;{{Who|date=April 2019}} its {{Lang|mi|wharenui}} features an intricately carved revolving {{Lang|mi|pou}}{{Explain|date=October 2019}} as well as many other striking features. In addition to school activities, it is used for weddings.

==== Tangihanga (funeral rites) ====
As in pre-European times, {{Lang|mi|marae|italic=no}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.  The most important event located at marae is the {{Lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}}. {{Lang|mi|Tangihanga}} are the means by which the dead are farewelled and the surviving family members supported in Māori society. As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, "the importance of the tangihanga and its central place in marae custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the marae".<ref>Ka'ai, T.

==Cook Islands==
[[File:ARAI–TE-TONGA - RAROTONGA, COOK ISLANDS.jpg|thumb|Arai-te-Tonga marae, Rarotonga.]][[File:Taputapuatea.jpg|thumb|Taputapuātea marae in [[Avarua]]]]
In the [[Cook Islands]], there are many historic marae ([[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] or [[sacred place]]s) that were used for religious ceremonies on the islands. [[Rarotonga]] and [[Aitutaki]] have some particularly impressive marae. Although the carved figures on the marae were destroyed, burned, or taken away by zealous British missionaries, the stones of many of the ancient marae are still there. Some marae are in better shape than others, as vegetation grows fast on the islands. In Rarotonga, a few of the marae (Arai-te-Tonga, Vaerota, Taputapuātea) are still maintained, and are quickly tidied up before the investiture of a new [[ariki]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Errol Hunt|date=2003|title=Rarotonga & the Cook Islands|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=174059083X|pages=22, 44, 86, 87, 75}}</ref>

Rarotongan tradition holds that Taputapuātea marae at Rarotonga, which archaeologists have dated to the 13th century, was built by Tangi'ia who brought the central stone with him from the ancient [[Taputapuātea marae|marae of the same name]] at [[Ra'iātea]]. Indeed, it seems that it was quite usual in ancient times to take a stone from this marae. <blockquote>The son of Tetupaia and Teu had not only the right to a seat in the great Marae of Taputapuatea in Raiatea, but he could take his stone from Taputapuatea and set it up in his own district of Pare Arue (Tahiti), so founding a Marae Taputapuatea of his own to wear the Maro-'ura (red waist girdle of the ariki) in.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Adams|editor=Robert Ernest Spiller|date=1947|title=Memoirs of Arii Taimai e Marama of Eimeo, Teriirere of Tooarai, Terrinui of Tahiti, Tauraatua i Amo|publisher=New York : Scholars' Facsimiles and Reprints}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Mangaia]] had a marae named Taputapuatea and an ''ariori''{{Explain|date=October 2019}} house.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|407}}

==Rapa Nui/Easter Island==
{{See also|Ahu Tongariki|Ahu Akivi}}

In the remote southeastern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]] elements of the traditional [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] ''marae'' evolved into the [[Rapa Nui]]/Easter Island ''[[Easter Island#Stone platforms|Ahu]]'' and their iconic [[Moai]] (statues).

==Tahiti==
[[File:Marae Ti'i-rua, Mo'orea, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|Marae Ti'i-rua, [[Mo'orea]], French Polynesia]]
According to Salmond, marae are "portals between Po, the world of the gods and darkness, and the Ao, the everyday world of people and light, so that people could communicate with their ancestors."  Notable marae include Vai'otaha marae on [[Borabora]], Mata'ire'a marae on [[Huahine]], and Taputapuatea marae on Ra'itea.  [['Oro]] marae on Tahiti included Vai'otaha marae at [[Tautira]], the first, followed by Utu-'ai-mahurau at [[Paea]], Mahaiatea marae at [[Papara]], Taraho'i marae at [[Pirae|Pare]]-[[Arue, French Polynesia|'Arue]], and Hitia'a marae on [[Hitiaa O Te Ra]].<ref name="Anne">{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=[https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/24 24,26,34,38,53,67,96,149,266,273-274]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/24}}</ref>  

In [[Tahiti]], ''marae'' were dedicated to specific deities, and also connected with specific lineages said to have built them. During the 1994 restoration of [[Taputapuātea marae]] at [[Raiatea|Ra'iātea]] island by archaeologists from the Tahiti Museum, human bones were discovered under some of the structures. It is possible they were the remains of sacrifices to the Polynesian god [['Oro|{{Okina}}Oro]], revered in Tahiti.
