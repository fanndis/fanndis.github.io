Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of [[Microsoft Office]], [[Windows RT]] or the discontinued [[Microsoft Works|Microsoft Works suite]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Microsoft Word}}

===Origins===
In 1981, Microsoft hired [[Charles Simonyi]], the primary developer of [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], the first [[GUI]] [[word processor]], which was developed at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].<ref name="pcworld_word25">{{cite news | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/152585/microsoft_word_turns_25.html | title= Microsoft Word Turns 25 | last=Edwards | first=Benj | work=PC World | date=October 22, 2008 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Simonyi started work on a word processor called ''Multi-Tool Word'' and soon hired [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer.<ref name="pcworld_word25"/><ref>{{Cite book | title=Microsoft First Generation | first=Cheryl | last=Tsang | year=1999 | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | isbn=978-0-471-33206-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftfirstge00cher }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/05/19/135315.aspx | title=Anatomy of a Software Bug | first=Rick | last=Schaut | date=May 19, 2004 | work=MSDN Blogs | accessdate=December 2, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201040227/http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/05/19/135315.aspx | archive-date=February 1, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Microsoft announced Multi-Tool Word for [[Xenix]]<ref name="pcworld_word25"/> and MS-DOS in 1983.<ref name="infoworld_multi-tool_word">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4S8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 | title=Mouse and new WP program join Microsoft product lineup | last=Markoff | first=John | work=InfoWorld | date=May 30, 1983 | page=10 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Its name was soon simplified to ''Microsoft Word''.<ref name="PCHistory"/> Free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of ''[[PC World]]'', making it the first to be distributed on-disk with a [[magazine]].<ref name="PCHistory" /><ref name="NYTimes19930825">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/25/business/technologyandrew-pollack-computerizing-magazines.html | title=Computerizing Magazines | work=The New York Times | date=August 25, 1983 | accessdate=April 24, 2013 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew}}</ref> That year Microsoft demonstrated Word running on [[Windows]].<ref name="lemmons198312">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-12/1983_12_BYTE_08-12_Easy_Software#page/n49/mode/2up | title=Microsoft Windows | work=BYTE | date=December 1983 | accessdate=October 20, 2013 | author=Lemmons, Phil | pages=48}}</ref>

Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Microsoft Word was designed to be used with a mouse.<ref name="infoworld_multi-tool_word"/> Advertisements depicted the [[Microsoft Mouse]], and described Word as a [[WYSIWYG]], windowed word processor with the ability to [[undo]] and display bold, italic, and underlined text,<ref name="byte198312">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-12/1983_12_BYTE_08-12_Easy_Software#page/n89/mode/2up | title=Undo.

Finally. | work=BYTE | date=December 1983 | accessdate=October 20, 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=88–89}}</ref> although it could not render [[font]]s.<ref name="PCHistory"/> It was not initially popular, since its user interface was different from the leading word processor at the time, [[WordStar]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=W.E. Pete|title=Almost Perfect: How a Bunch of Regular Guys Built Wordperfect Corporation|year=1994|publisher=Prima Publishing|isbn=0-7881-9991-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Almost-Perfect-Regular-Wordperfect-Corporation/dp/0788199919/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1320973142&sr=8-2}}</ref> However, Microsoft steadily improved the product, releasing versions 2.0 through 5.0 over the next six years. In 1985, Microsoft [[Porting|ported]] Word to the [[classic Mac OS]] (known as Macintosh System Software at the time). This was made easier by Word for DOS having been designed for use with high-resolution displays and laser printers, even though none were yet available to the general public.<ref name="lowendmac_history">{{cite news | url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/microsoft-word-for-mac-faq/ | title= Microsoft Word for Mac History | last=Knight | first=Dan | work=Low End Mac | date=May 22, 2008 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> It was also notable for its very fast cut-and-paste function and unlimited number of undo operations, which are due to its usage of the [[piece table]] data structure.<ref>{{cite news | title="The Piece Table" | url=https://darrenburns.net/posts/piece-table/}}</ref>

Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Mac OS added true WYSIWYG features. It fulfilled a need for a word processor that was more capable than [[MacWrite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_for_1986_1985_Point_djvu.txt|title=Whole Earth Software Catalog|quote=For a year, I waited for a heavier-duty word processor than MACWRITE. I finally got it— WORD.}}</ref> After its release, Word for Mac OS's sales were higher than its MS-DOS counterpart for at least four years.<ref name="pcworld_word25"/>

The second release of Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to synchronize its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft's first attempt to synchronize version numbers across platforms. Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0.<ref name="lowendmac_history"/> After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use and feature set. Many users say it is the best version of Word for Mac OS ever created.<ref name="lowendmac_history"/><ref name="msdn_macword6">{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx | title=Mac Word 6.0 | work=Buggin' My Life Away | publisher=MSDN Blogs | last=Schaut | first=Rick | date=February 26, 2004 | accessdate=June 21, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040514091238/http://blogs.msdn.com/rick_schaut/archive/2004/02/26/80193.aspx | archive-date=May 14, 2004 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1986, an agreement between [[Atari]] and Microsoft brought Word to the [[Atari ST]]<ref name="Microsoft Write for Atari ST">{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue77/News_Products.php?tag= |title=Atari announces agreement with Microsoft |publisher=Atarimagazines.com |date=April 25, 2008 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref> under the name ''Microsoft Write''.

The first version of Word for Windows was released in 1989. With the release of [[Windows 3.0]] the following year, sales began to pick up and Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for IBM PC-compatible computers.<ref name="pcworld_word25"/> In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for Windows' increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface similar to a Windows application.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA151 | title=First Look: Microsoft Updates Look of And Adds Pull-Down Menus to Character-Based Word 5.5 | last=Miller | first=Michael J. | work=InfoWorld | date=November 12, 1990 | page=151 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108 | title=Microsoft Word 5.5: Should You Fight or Switch? | last=Needleman | first=Raphael | work=InfoWorld | date=November 19, 1990 | page=106 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> When Microsoft became aware of the [[Year 2000 problem]], it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for download free. {{As of|2018|July}}, it is still available for download from Microsoft's web site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/word97win/Wd55_be/97/WIN98/EN-US/Wd55_ben.exe | title=Microsoft Word 5.5 for MS-DOS (EXE format) | work=Microsoft Download Center | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>
In 1991, Microsoft embarked on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.<ref name="msdn_macword6"/>

With the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from ''InfoWorld''<ref name="infoworld_word6">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 | title=War of the Words | work=InfoWorld | date=February 7, 1994 | pages=66–79 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>), the Mac OS version was widely derided. Many accused it of being slow, clumsy and memory intensive, and its user interface differed significantly from Word 5.1.<ref name="msdn_macword6"/> In response to user requests, Microsoft offered Word 5 again, after it had been discontinued.<ref name="ugeek_97">{{cite web | url=http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/off98mac.htm | title=UGeek Software Review: Microsoft Office 98 Gold for Macintosh | last=Lockman | first=James T.W. | date=May 15, 1998 | accessdate=November 7, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203220342/http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/off98mac.htm | archive-date=December 3, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Subsequent versions of Word for macOS are no longer direct ports of Word for Windows, instead featuring a mixture of ported code and native code.

===Word for Windows===

Word for Windows is available stand-alone or as part of the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see [[Microsoft Word Viewer]]).

Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.danielsays.com/ss-gallery-winnt2k-ms-office-nt.html |title=Microsoft Office for Windows NT |website=DanielSays.com — Daniel's Legacy Computer Collections |first=Daniel|last=Rose |access-date=May 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127063342/http://www.danielsays.com/ss-gallery-winnt2k-ms-office-nt.html |archive-date=January 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as [[Microsoft Windows 95|Windows 95]]. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, releases of Word were named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9003994/Final_Review_The_Lowdown_on_Office_2007?taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=2 | title=Final Review: The Lowdown on Office 2007 | work=Computerworld | first= Richard | last=Ericson | date=October 11, 2006 | accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

Word 2019 added the Dictate function.

===Word for Mac===
{{see also|Microsoft Office#Mac versions|label 1 = Microsoft Office § Mac versions}}The Mac was introduced January 24, 1984, and Microsoft introduced Word 1.0 for Mac a year later, on January 18, 1985. The DOS, Mac, and Windows versions are quite different from each other. Only the Mac version was [[WYSIWYG]] and used a graphical user interface, far ahead of the other platforms. Each platform restarted its version numbering at "1.0" (https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-word/1x-mac). There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode.

Word 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the last Classic MacOS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features like document generation and renumbering or to access their old files.[[File:Microsoft Word for Mac 2011.png|thumb|Microsoft Word 2011 running on OS X]]
In 1997, Microsoft formed the [[Macintosh Business Unit]] as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS]]. Its first version of Word, Word 98, was released with Office 98 Macintosh Edition.

===Word for Mobile===
Word Mobile is a [[word processor]] that allows creating and editing documents. It supports basic formatting, such as bolding, changing font size, and changing colors (from red, yellow, or green). It can add comments, but can't edit documents with tracked changes. It can't open password protected documents, change the typeface, text alignment, or style (normal, heading 1); create bulleted lists; insert pictures; or undo.<ref name=TechHive>{{cite web|last1=Ralph|first1=Nate|title=Office for Windows Phone 8: Your handy starter guide|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2025977/office-for-windows-phone-8-your-handy-starter-guide.html|website=TechHive|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Engadget>{{cite web|last1=Wollman|first1=Dana|title=Microsoft Office Mobile for iPhone hands-on|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/14/microsoft-office-mobile-for-iphone-hands-on/|website=Engadget|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=David|title=Microsoft Adds Office for iPhone.

===Filename extensions===
Microsoft Word's native file formats are denoted either by a <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> [[filename extension]].

Although the [[Doc (computing)|<code>.doc</code>]] extension has been used in many different versions of Word, it actually encompasses four distinct file formats:
# Word for DOS
# Word for Windows 1 and 2; Word 3 and 4 for Mac OS
# Word 6 and Word 95 for Windows; Word 6 for Mac OS
# Word 97 and later for Windows; Word 98 and later for Mac OS

(The [[classic Mac OS]] of the era did not use filename extensions.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eclecticlight.co/2015/05/02/why-the-extensions-quirks-in-the-naming-of-files-and-folders/|title=.why .the .extensions?

The newer <code>.docx</code> extension signifies the [[Office Open XML]] [[international standard]] for Office documents and is used by Word 2007 and later for Windows, Word 2008 and later for macOS, as well as by a growing number of applications from other vendors, including [[OpenOffice.org Writer]], an [[open source software|open source]] word processing program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000397.shtml|title=DOCX Transitional (Office Open XML), ISO 29500:2008-2016, ECMA-376, Editions 1-5|date=2017-01-20|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0/#Microsoft_Office_2007_Import_Filters | title = OpenOffice.org 3.0 New Features&nbsp;— Microsoft Office 2007 Import Filters | accessdate = April 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Binary formats (Word 97–2007)===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the default Word document format ([[DOC (computing)|.DOC]]) became a ''[[de facto]]'' standard of [[document file format]]s for Microsoft Office users.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} There are different versions of "Word Document Format" used by default in Word 97–2007.<ref>{{cite book|title=[MS-DOC]: Word (.doc) Binary File Format|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|location=[[Redmond, WA]]|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|chapter=5 Appendix A: Product Behavior|chapter-url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd946767%28v=office.12%29.aspx|access-date=January 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110202652/http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Each binary word file is a [[Compound File Binary Format|Compound File]],<ref>{{cite book|title=[MS-DOC]: Word (.doc) Binary File Format|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|location=[[Redmond, WA]]|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|chapter=2.1 File Structure|chapter-url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd923543%28v=office.12%29.aspx|access-date=January 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110202652/http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> a hierarchical [[file system]] within a file.<ref name="spolsky-commentry">{{cite web | url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/02/19.html | title=Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated?

As with all OLE Compound Files, Word Binary Format consists of "storages", which are analogous to [[folder (computing)|computer folders]], and "streams", which are similar to [[computer file]]s. Each storage may contain streams or other storage. Each Word Binary File must contain a stream called "WordDocument" stream and this stream must start with a File Information Block (FIB).<ref>{{cite book|title=[MS-DOC]: Word (.doc) Binary File Format|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|location=[[Redmond, WA]]|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|chapter=2.1.1 WordDocument Stream|chapter-url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd926131%28v=office.12%29.aspx|access-date=January 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110202652/http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/4/8/24862317-78F0-4C4B-B355-C7B2C1D997DB/%5BMS-DOC%5D.pdf|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> FIB serves as the first point of reference for locating everything else, such as where the text in a Word document starts, ends, what version of Word created the document and other attributes.

Word 2007 and later continue to support the DOC file format, although it is no longer the default.

===XML Document (Word 2003)===
{{Main|Microsoft Office XML formats}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2013}}

The .docx ''XML '' format introduced in Word 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa223584(office.11).aspx |title=What You Can Do with Word XML [Word 2003 XML Reference] |publisher=MSDN |year=2004}}</ref> was a simple, [[XML]]-based format called WordprocessingML.

===Cross-version compatibility===
Opening a Word Document file in a version of Word other than the one with which it was created can cause an incorrect display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not so subtle ways (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version.<ref name="casson_ryan" /> [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.

===Third-party formats===
[[Plugin (computing)|Plugins]] permitting the Windows versions of Word to read and write formats it does not natively support, such as [[international standard]] [[OpenDocument]] format (ODF) (ISO/IEC 26300:2006), are available. Up until the release of [[Windows XP#Service packs|Service Pack 2]] (SP2) for Office 2007, Word did not natively support reading or writing ODF documents without a plugin, namely the SUN ODF Plugin or the OpenXML/ODF Translator. With SP2 installed, ODF format 1.1 documents can be read and saved like any other supported format in addition to those already available in Word 2007.<ref name="casson_ryan">{{cite book | last1=Casson | first1=Tony | last2=Ryan | first2=Patrick S. | ssrn=1656616 | chapter=Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the Public Sector, and Their Relationship to Microsoft's Market Dominance | title=Standards Edge: Unifier or Divider? | editor-last=Bolin | editor-first=Sherrie | date=May 1, 2006 | page=87 | publisher=Sheridan Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office, May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.aspx|work=News Center |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Next Office 2007 service pack will include ODF, PDF support options |date=May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Next_Office_2007_service_pack_will_include_ODF_PDF_support_options/1211343807 |work=Betanews |first=Scott M.

==Features and flaws==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2010}}
Among its features, Word includes a built-in spell checker, a thesaurus, a dictionary, and utilities for manipulating and editing text. The following are some aspects of its feature set.

=== Templates ===
Several later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, allowing them to define a file in which the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ from the standard Word templates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/school/microsoft-word-document-formatting-essentials/lesson5/|title=Word Formatting: Mastering Styles and Document Themes|last=Klein|first=Matt|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> Users can find how to do this under the Help section located near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).

For example, '''Normal.dot''' is the master [[Template (word processing)|template]] from which all Word documents are created. It determines the [[Margin (typography)|margin]] defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although normal.dot is already set with certain defaults, the user can change normal.dot to new defaults. This will change other documents which were created using the template, usually in unexpected ways.<ref>[http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=151 in-depth explanation of Normal.dot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620082713/http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=151 |date=June 20, 2005 }}</ref>

===Image formats===
Word can import and display images in common bitmap formats such as [[JPEG|JPG]] and [[GIF]]. It can also be used to create and display simple line-art. Microsoft Word added support<ref>{{cite web |title=Edit SVG images in Microsoft Office 365 |url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/edit-svg-images-in-microsoft-office-365-69f29d39-194a-4072-8c35-dbe5e7ea528c |website=Office Support |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref> for the common [[Scalable vector graphics|SVG]] vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality was also included in the Office 2019 release.

===WordArt===
{{Main|WordArt}}
[[File:WordArt.png|thumb|164x164px|An example image created with WordArt]]
WordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and colors and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects, and add text effects to paragraph styles.

===Macros===
A Macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated.
Like other [[Microsoft Office]] documents, Word files can include advanced [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and even embedded programs. The language was originally [[WordBasic]], but changed to [[Visual Basic for Applications]] as of Word 97.

This extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate [[Computer virus|viruses]] in documents. The tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, [[USB flash drive]]s, and [[floppy disk]]s made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the [[Melissa virus]], but countless others have existed.

These macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any [[macOS]] system up until the advent of [[Zlob trojan|video codec trojans]] in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.

Word's macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.

===Layout issues===
Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly handle [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] defined in [[OpenType]] fonts.<ref>[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/what-s-new-in-word-2010-HA010372687.aspx What's new in Word 2010]. Retrieved July 1, 2010.</ref> Those ligature glyphs with [[Unicode]] codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced [[typesetting]] features which can be enabled:<ref>[http://jeffhuang.com/better_word_papers.html Improving the look of papers written in Microsoft Word], Retrieved May 30, 2010.</ref> [[OpenType]] ligatures,<ref>[http://www.orzeszek.org/blog/2009/05/17/how-to-enable-opentype-ligatures-in-word-2010/ How to Enable OpenType Ligatures in Word 2010], Oreszek Blog, May 17, 2009.</ref> [[kerning]], and [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenation]] (previous versions already had the latter two features). Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.<ref>Such as {{cite web |url=http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/BlankPage.htm |title=How to delete a blank page in Word |publisher=Sbarnhill.mvps.org |accessdate=June 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505105925/http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/BlankPage.htm |archive-date=May 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In Word 2004 for Mac OS X, support of [[complex scripts]] was inferior even to Word 97,<ref>{{cite web|title=Unicode and Multilingual Editors and Word Processors for Mac OS X|url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/utilities_editors_macosx.html|author=Alan Wood}}</ref> and Word 2004 did not support [[Apple Advanced Typography]] features like ligatures or glyph variants.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neuburg |first=Matt |url=http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=07715 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708192529/http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=07715 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=TidBITS : Word Up! Word 2004, That Is |publisher=Db.tidbits.com |date=May 19, 2004 |accessdate=June 21, 2010 }}</ref>

===Bullets and numbering===
Microsoft Word supports [[bullet list]]s and [[numbered list]]s. It also features a numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to lists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGhie|first1=John|title=Word's numbering explained|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/WordsNumberingExplained.htm|website=word.mvps.org|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut the first item of the listed and paste it]] as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/ListRestartMethods.htm |title=Methods for restarting list numbering |website=Word.mvps.org |date=March 26, 2011 |first=Margaret |last=Aldis}}</ref>

Users can also create tables in ''Word''. Depending on the version, ''Word'' can perform simple calculations — along with support for formulas and equations as well.

===AutoSummarize===
Available in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an executive summary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.word-tips.com/auto-summarize/|title=How To Access Auto Summarize in Microsoft Word 2007|date=2011-12-14|website=Sue's Word Tips|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a percentage of the current amount of text.

According to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in the document (barring "a" and "the" and the like) and assigns a "score" to each word – the more frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it "averages" each sentence by adding the scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence – the higher the average, the higher the rank of the sentence. "It's like the ratio of wheat to chaff," explains Fein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gore |first=Karenna |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2419 |title=Cognito Auto Sum |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 9, 1997 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref>

AutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in Word for Mac 2008. AutoSummarize was removed from the Office 2010 release version (14) as well.<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179199 Changes in Word 2010 (for IT pros)]. Technet.microsoft.com (May 16, 2012). Retrieved on July 17, 2013.</ref>

=== Shortcut Keys ===
There are many shortcuts that can be used in Microsoft Word, however, there are a couple of mostly used shortcuts. To make letters bold: "Control+B", Make letters italic: "Control+I", Make letters underline: "Control+U", Copy text: "Control+C", and to Paste text: Control+V. There are many other shortcut keys that you can use in Microsoft Office as well.

==Word for the web==
{{Further|Microsoft Office#Office on the web}}
Word for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Word available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.

Word for the web lacks some Ribbon tabs, such as Design and Mailings. Mailings allows users to print envelopes and labels, and manage mail merge [[printing]] of Word documents.<ref name="pcworld.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2872072/office-online-vs-office-365-what-s-free-what-s-not-and-what-you-really-need.html |title=Office Online vs. Office 365: What’s free, what’s not, and what you really need |last=Bradley |first=Tony |date=February 2, 2015 |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724204611/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2872072/office-online-vs-office-365-what-s-free-what-s-not-and-what-you-really-need.html |archive-date=July 24, 2017 |df=dmy-all |access-date=July 16, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="pcworld.com3">{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3226384/microsoft-office-online-review-office-alternative.html |title=Microsoft Office Online review: Work with your favorite Office formats for free |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date= September 28, 2017 |last=Ansaldo |first=Michael |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Word for the web is not able to edit certain objects, such as equations, shapes, text boxes, or drawings, but a placeholder may be present in the document.

== Password protection ==
{{Main|Microsoft Office password protection}}

There are three password types that can be set in Microsoft Word:

* Password to open a document<ref name="office.com-password-prot">{{cite web |url= http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/password-protect-documents-workbooks-and-presentations-HA010148333.aspx | title=Password protect documents, workbooks, and presentations | publisher=Microsoft | work=[[Microsoft Office website]] | accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> 
* Password to modify a document<ref name="office.com-password-prot" />
* Password restricting formatting and editing<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.trickyways.com/2010/06/how-to-restrict-editing-in-word-2010-2007/ | title=How to Restrict Editing in Word 2010/2007 | work=Trickyways | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=April 24, 2010}}</ref>

The second and the third type of passwords were developed by Microsoft for convenient shared use of documents rather than for their protection. There is no [[encryption]] of documents that are protected by such passwords, and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a [[hash sum]] of a password in a document's header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized software.
''Password to open a document'' offers much tougher protection that had been steadily enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.

''Word 95'' and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a password to a 16-bit [[Encryption key|key]].

[[Key size|Key length]] in ''Word 97'' and ''2000'' was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly – a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of [[rainbow tables]] reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some [[password recovery]] software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using [[brute-force attack]] approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the [[password strength]].

Word's 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced users choosing a [[Cryptographic Service Provider]] was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oraxcel.com/projects/encoffice/help/How_safe_is_Word_encryption.html |title=How safe is Word encryption. Is it really secure? |publisher=Oraxcel.com |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed document decryption becomes unavailable, and therefore a password can't be removed from the document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by default, their use is limited to advanced users only.

Word 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a [[SHA-1]] hash function 50000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key in a reasonable amount of time exists), and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to several hundreds of passwords per second.

Word's 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 conversions up to 100000 times, and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two times more.

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}
''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1984 criticized the documentation for Word 1.1 and 2.0 for DOS, calling it "a complete farce". It called the software "clever, put together well, and performs some extraordinary feats", but concluded that "especially when operated with the mouse, has many more limitations than benefits ... extremely frustrating to learn and operate efficiently".<ref name="cameron1984pc">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-09/1984_09_BYTE_09-09_Guide_to_the_IBM_PCs#page/n171/mode/2up | title=Word Processing Revisited | work=BYTE | date=September 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Cameron, Janet | pages=171 | type=review}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'s}} review was very mixed, stating "I've run into weird word processors before, but this is the first time one's nearly knocked me down for the count" but acknowledging that Word's innovations were the first that caused the reviewer to consider abandoning [[WordStar]]. While the review cited an excellent [[WYSIWYG]] display, sophisticated print formatting, windows, and footnoting as merits, it criticized many small flaws, very slow performance, and "documentation apparently produced by Madame Sadie's Pain Palace". It concluded that Word was "two releases away from potential greatness".<ref name="manes19840221">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCIvSU6Y2GAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=The Unfinished Word | work=PC Magazine | date=February 21, 1984 | accessdate=October 24, 2013 | author=Manes, Stephen | pages=192}}</ref>

''Compute!'s Apple Applications'' in 1987 stated that "despite a certain awkwardness", Word 3.01 "will likely become the major Macintosh word processor" with "far too many features to list here". While criticizing the lack of true WYSIWYG, the magazine concluded that "''Word'' is marvelous. It's like a [[Mozart]] or [[Thomas Edison|Edison]], whose occasional gaucherie we excuse because of his great gifts".<ref name="mcneill198712">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Macintosh: The Word Explosion | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=September 14, 2016 | author=McNeill, Dan | pages=54–60}}</ref>

''[[Compute!]]'' in 1989 stated that Word 5.0's integration of text and graphics made it "a solid engine for basic desktop publishing". The magazine approved of improvements to text mode, described the $75 price for upgrading from an earlier version as "the deal of the decade", and concluded that "as a high-octane word processor, ''Word'' is definitely worth a look".<ref name="nimersheim198912">{{Cite magazine |last=Nimersheim |first=Jack |date=December 1989 |title=Compute!

Despite its commercial success, it has also been argued in the scientific community that ''Word'' might not be well-suited for large-scale projects with high typographical demands, due to issues such as file compatibility, poor typography, low image quality, and limited feature scalability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>
