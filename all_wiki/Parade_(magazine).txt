==Publishing history==
The magazine was founded by [[Marshall Field III]] in 1941 as a weekly magazine supplement for his own paper (the ''[[Chicago Sun]]'') and for others in the United States. By 1946, ''Parade'' had achieved a circulation of 3.5 million.

[[John Hay Whitney]], publisher of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', bought ''Parade'' in 1958. [[Booth Newspapers]] purchased it in 1973. Booth was purchased by [[Advance Publications]] in 1976, and ''Parade'' became a separate operating unit within Advance.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ping Shaw|title=Internationalization of the women's magazine industry in Taiwan context, process and influence|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=1999|volume=9|issue=2|pages=17–38|doi=10.1080/01292989909359623}}</ref>

Parade Digital Partners is a distribution network that includes the web site Parade.com and over 700 of the magazine's partner newspaper web sites.  Parade Digital Partners has a reach of more than 30 million monthly unique visitors (comScore Q1 2014).

Throughout 2016, [[Gannett Company]], which had produced ''[[USA Weekend]]'', the most direct competitor to ''Parade'' until its December 2014 discontinuation, added (or in most cases, re-added) ''Parade'' to many of its Sunday newspapers as a replacement.

Beginning on the weekend of December 28, 2019, ''Parade'' changed its publishing schedule to skip six weekends a year, planning to publish combined holiday issues. The first such combined publication was a [[Christmas]]-themed issue published the weekend of December 21, 2019.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.gwcommonwealth.com/news/article_fadcde0e-291c-11ea-b31f-6be0dd16d63e.html | title = Parade magazine takes break this week | newspaper = [[The Greenwood Commonwealth]] | date = December 28, 2019 | accessdate = January 14, 2020 | url-access = subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0NhH9GHq/parade-magazine-takes-break-this-week | title = Parade magazine takes break this week | website = News Break | publisher = Particle Media | date = December 28, 2019 | accessdate = January 14, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://article.wn.com/view/2019/12/28/Parade_magazine_takes_break_this_week/ | title = Parade magazine takes break this week | publisher = [[World News Network]] | date = December 28, 2019 | accessdate = January 14, 2020 }}</ref> The magazine published the weekend of April 4, 2020 also covered the weekend of April 11; [[Easter#Western Christianity|Easter]] was April 12.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/no-parade-insert-sunday/article_ce88a433-b7bc-505d-b9b7-21f0b0e2a0b6.html | title = No Parade insert Sunday | last = Carver | first = Desiree | newspaper = [[The Valdosta Daily Times]] | date = April 11, 2020 | accessdate = June 30, 2020 }}</ref> The magazine published the weekend of May 16 also covered the weekend of May 23; [[Memorial Day]] was May 25.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://epaper.daytondailynews.com/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=0d07abb3-c87e-4c0b-9be8-c26623f161e9 | title = No Parade magazine inside today's paper | newspaper = [[Dayton Daily News]] | date = May 24, 2020 | accessdate = June 30, 2020 | url-access = subscription }}</ref> The magazine published the weekend of June 27 also covered the weekend of July 4, [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://nonpareilonline.com/news/local/nonpareil-to-publish-joint-july-3-and-4-edition-no-parade-magazine-on-july-5/article_d3637669-19bc-569a-a34f-aa2dd3ca3492.html | title = Nonpareil to publish joint July 3 and 4 edition; no Parade magazine on July 5 | newspaper = [[The Daily Nonpareil]] | date = June 28, 2020 | accessdate = June 30, 2020 }}</ref> The magazine published the weekend of August 29 also covered the weekend of September 5; [[Labor Day]] was September 7.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/no-parade-today-resumes-sept-13/article_f4d10c56-084e-56de-a3f1-4fb872267e82.html | title = No Parade today; resumes Sept. 13 | newspaper = [[La Crosse Tribune]] | date = September 6, 2020 | accessdate = September 13, 2020 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200913233309/https://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/no-parade-today-resumes-sept-13/article_f4d10c56-084e-56de-a3f1-4fb872267e82.html | archive-date = September 13, 2020}}</ref>

The magazine has one main feature article, often a smaller feature article, and a number of regular columns. There is also advertising for consumer products, some with clippable coupons or tear-off business reply cards.

* ''Cartoon Parade'': Panel cartoons by various creators, including [[Dave Coverly]], Carla Ventresca, [[Dan Piraro]], and Gary McCoy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} By 2016, due to the expense and lack of interest, these had been dropped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/ask_sam/ask-sam-stink-bugs-re-emerge/article_a893ac54-effe-5dc5-9596-08b97f1d897f.html|title=SAM|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

* "'''Where America Lives'''" is an ongoing thematic feature
* "'''What America Eats'''" is presented seasonally throughout the year
* "'''The Giving Issue'''" is typically in the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend

== Publishing lag time ==
The magazine has a lag time to publication of about ten days, which has caused the magazine to print statements that were out-of-date by the time ''Parade'' was publicly available in a weekend newspaper.

The January 6, 2008 edition cover and main article asked whether [[Benazir Bhutto]] was "America's best hope against [[Al-Qaeda]]," after her December 27, 2007 [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination]].<ref>[http://www.parade.com/images/-v2/home/2008/0106/010608COV-big.jpg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908065644/http://www.parade.com/images/-v2/home/2008/0106/010608COV-big.jpg |date=September 8, 2012 }}</ref> In response to reader and media<ref>{{cite web|last=Leventis |first=Angie |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/jan/08/opinion/chi-oped0108mcnultyjan08 |title=Featured Articles From The Chicago Tribune |publisher=Archives.chicagotribune.com |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17887078 |title='Parade' Interview Fails to Note Bhutto's Death |publisher=NPR |date=2008-01-06 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}</ref> complaints (and besides individual newspapers noting the discrepancy to prevent reader confusion, as the magazine had an additional week of lag time due to the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]]), ''Parade'' stated on their website:

<blockquote>"Dear Parade Readers,

''Parade'' publishes more than 32 million copies of each issue and distributes them to 415 newspapers across the country. In order to meet our printing, distribution and insertion deadlines, we must send the issue to the printer three weeks before the cover date. Our Benazir Bhutto issue, for example, went to press on Dec. 19. By the time Ms. Bhutto was slain on Dec. 27, this issue of ''Parade'' was already printed and shipped to our partner newspapers. Recalling, reprinting and redistributing our January 6 issue was not an option."<ref>[http://www.parade.com/benazir_bhutto_interview.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110075205/http://www.parade.com/benazir_bhutto_interview.html |date=January 10, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

A similar incident occurred in the February 11, 2007 issue when Walter Scott's "Personality Parade" reported that [[Barbaro (horse)|Barbaro]], an American [[thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorse]] and winner of the 2006 [[Kentucky Derby]], was in a stable condition. Barbaro was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] thirteen days earlier, on January 29, 2007.<ref>[http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2007/edition_02-11-2007/Personality_Parade]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112031954/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2007/edition_02-11-2007/Personality_Parade |date=November 12, 2008 }}</ref>

On April 27, 2014, Walter Scott's "Personality Parade" reported that [[Joby Ogwyn]] would BASE jump in a wingsuit from the summit of Mount Everest live on the [[Discovery Channel]] in May 2014. However, before the edition appeared in print, the government of Nepal closed Mount Everest to climbers because of an avalanche on April 18, 2014 that killed 16 [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], including five Sherpas working for the Discovery Channel in advance of Ogwyn's planned jump, hastening the cancellation of the special.
