While internationally recognized as in Ukraine, the city is under the de facto administration of the unrecognized [[Donetsk People's Republic]], which claims it as its capital city. The population was estimated at {{Ua-pop-est2020|908,456}} in the city core, with over 2,000,000 in the [[metropolitan area]] (2011). According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]], Donetsk was the fifth-largest city in Ukraine.<ref name="ukrcensus1">{{cite web |title= Results / General results of the census / Number of cities |work= [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] |url= http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/city/ |accessdate = 28 August 2006 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060109012020/http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/city/ |archivedate= 9 January 2006}}</ref>

Administratively, Donetsk has been the centre of [[Donetsk Oblast]], while historically, it is the unofficial capital and largest city of the larger economic and cultural [[Donets Basin]] (''Donbass'') region. Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, [[Makiivka]], and along with other surrounding cities forms a major [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city's challenging ecological situation. In 2012 a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world's fastest depopulating cities.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-that-are-shrinking-2012-10?r=US&IR=T The 28 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In The World]</ref>

The original settlement in the south of the European part of the [[Russian Empire]] was first mentioned as '''Aleksandrovka''' in 1779, during the reign of the Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. In 1869 the Welsh businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] founded a steel plant and several [[coal mining|coal mines]] in the region, and the town was named '''Hughesovka''' or '''Yuzovka''' (Юзовка) in recognition of his role ("Yuz" being a Russian-language approximation of ''Hughes''). During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city's steel industry expanded. In 1924 Yuzovka was renamed '''Stalin'''. In 1929 Stalin was renamed '''Stalino''', and in 1932 the city became the centre of the Donetsk region. Renamed '''Donetsk''' in 1961, the city today remains a centre for [[coal mining]] and for the [[steel industry]].

Since April 2014 Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing [[War in Donbass|Donbass War]], as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of the city and surrounding areas. Throughout the war, the city of Donetsk has been administered by the pro-Russian separatist forces as the center of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR), with outlying territories of the Donetsk region divided between the two sides.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Weaver |first1= Matthew |last2= Luhn |first2= Alec |date= 13 February 2015 |title= Ukraine ceasefire deal agreed at Minsk talks |publisher= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-reports-emerge-of-agreement-in-minsk-talks |accessdate= 16 December 2016}}</ref> [[Donetsk International Airport]] became the epicenter of the war with almost a year-long battle leading to massive casualties among civilians and a total ruination of the northwestern neighborhoods of the city.

===Foundation===

[[File:1887. Новый свет. Базар.jpg|thumb|left|A market on the main street of ''Novyi Svet'' section of Yuzovka. (1887)]]
The city was founded in 1869 when the [[Wales|Welsh]] businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] built a steel plant and several coal mines at ''Aleksandrovka'', in the south of the European part of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. It was initially named ''Hughesovka'' ({{lang-ru|Юзовка}}).<ref>''Yuz'' is a Russian or Ukrainian approximation of Hughes</ref> In its early period, it received immigrants from Wales, especially from the town of [[Merthyr Tydfil]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Martin |date=June 11, 2012 |title=Euro 2012: Donetsk's roots have more in common with Merthyr Tydfil than Moscow |publisher=Telegraph  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9323465/Euro-2012-Donetsks-roots-have-more-in-common-with-Merthyr-Tydfil-than-Moscow.html |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> By the beginning of the 20th century, Yuzovka had approximately 50,000 inhabitants,<ref>The population included mostly migrants from neighbouring Russian territories</ref> and attained the status of a city in 1917.<ref name="lukianchenko">{{cite web |date=31 August 2004 |df=dmy |script-title=ru:Из истории города |language=Russian |trans-title=From the history of the city |work=Official site of the Head of Donetsk City |url=http://lukyanchenko.dn.ua/today/view.php?cat=7&subcat=7&type=1 |accessdate=7 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127190501/http://lukyanchenko.dn.ua/today/view.php?cat=7&subcat=7&type=1 |archivedate=27 January 2007}}</ref> The main district of "Hughezovka" is named English Colony, and the British origin of the city is reflected in its layout and architecture.

===Soviet Union===

After the [[Russian Civil War]] broke out, Yuzovka was part of the [[Donets-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic]] from its declaration of independence on 12 February 1918. The Republic was disbanded at the 2nd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets on 20 March 1918 when the independence of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic]] was declared. It failed to achieve recognition, either internationally or by the [[Russian SFSR]], and in accordance with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was abolished.

In 1924, under [[Soviet era|Soviet rule]], the city's name was changed to ''Stalin''. In that year, the city's population totaled 63,708, and in the next year, 80,085. In 1929–31 the city's name was changed to ''Stalino''.<ref name="alldonetsk.info">http://alldonetsk.info/en/history-city-donetsk The history of the city of Donetsk</ref> The city did not have a drinking water system until 1931, when a {{convert|55.3|km|1|abbr=on}} system was laid underground. In July 1933, the city became the administrative center of the [[Donetsian Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name="lukianchenko" /> In 1933, the first {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} sewer system was installed, and next year the first exploitation of gas was conducted within the city. In addition, some sources{{Which|date=March 2012}} state that the city was briefly called Trotsk—after [[Leon Trotsky]]—for a few months in late 1923.
[[File:Stadtplan Stalino LOC 2012593213.jpg|thumb|A German map of the city in 1943, note that all the streets have been given German names.]]
At the beginning of [[World War II]], the population of Stalino consisted of 507,000, and after the war, only 175,000. The [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] during World War II almost completely destroyed the city, which was mostly rebuilt on a large scale at the war's end. It was occupied by German and Italian forces as part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] between 16 October 1941 and 5 September 1943.

In 1945, young men and women aged 17 to 35, from the [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian ''(Schwowe)'']] communities of [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] (the [[Batschka]] and [[Banat]]), were forcibly sent to Russia as Allied "war reparations", being put to work as slave labour to rebuild Stalino and to work in its mines. The conditions were so poor that many died from disease and malnutrition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Das politische Bewusstsein |url=http://www.hog-kernei.de/PDF/Internierung%20und%20Vertreibung.pdf |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>

During [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s second wave of [[destalinization]] in November 1961, the city was renamed Donetsk, after the [[Seversky Donets]] River, a tributary of the [[Don (Russia)|Don]]<ref name="lukianchenko" /> in order to distance it from the former leader [[Joseph Stalin]].

In 1965, the Donetsk Academy of Sciences was established as part of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine|Academy of Science of the Ukrainian SSR]].

===Independent Ukraine===
After experiencing a tough time in the 1990s, when it was the center of gang wars for control over industrial enterprises, Donetsk modernised quickly, largely under the influence of big companies.

In 1994 a referendum took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and the [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian language]] gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the [[Russian language]] to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the [[Kyiv]] government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morin |first=Yevgenii |url=http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj-referendum-1994.html |script-title=ru:Донбасс: забытый референдум-1994 |trans-title=Donbass: the forgotten 1994 referendum |language=ru |newspaper=The Kiev Times |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/18807/ |script-title=ru:Киев уже 20 лет обманывает Донбасс: Донецкая и Луганская области еще в 1994 году проголосовали за федерализацию, русский язык и евразийскую интеграцию |trans-title=Kiev has been cheating Donbass for 20 years: in 1994 the Donetsk and Lugansk regions voted in favour of federalisation, the Russian language, and Eurasian integration |language=ru |publisher=Nakanune.ru |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=This is a Russian blog/forum, and is user generated per [[WP:SELFPUBLISH]]. |date=December 2016}}

In the 1990s and the 2000s coal mine collapses took place in Donetsk and the region, taking the lives of hundreds; those included the [[2008 Ukraine coal mine collapse]], the [[2007 Zasyadko mine disaster]], and the [[2015 Zasyadko mine disaster]]. Ukraine has had a series of mining accidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and one reason being given is the linking of miners' pay to production, which serves as an incentive to ignore safety procedures that would slow production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7103086.stm|title=Ukraine's mine death toll rises|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=20 November 2007|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>

Donetsk is the Capital of the Donetsk People's Republic.

Since 7 April 2014 Donetsk is ''[[de facto]]'' governed by the [[Donetsk People's Republic]], even though it has only been recognized by the [[Republic of South Ossetia]] as of October 2014.

The territory of Donetsk is divided into 9 administrative [[raion]]s (districts), whose local government is administered by ''raion councils'', which are subordinate to the Donetsk City Council.

Donetsk, together with the nearby [[Mariupol]], were the host towns of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]]. The stadiums hosting the event on behalf of Donetsk were [[RSC Olimpiyskiy]] (which hosted the final) and the [[Metalurh Stadium (Donetsk)|Metalurh Stadium]].

Donetsk is home to the [[ice hockey]] club [[HC Donbass]], playing at the [[Druzhba Arena]] since 2011, which won the 2011 [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship|Ukrainian national champion]], and which is the only elite level team in the country. After playing a single season in the [[Russian Major League]], the club upgraded its arena to [[Kontinental Hockey League]] regulations, and joined the league in 2012. When moving to the KHL, the club created a local farm club to play in the Ukrainian Championship under the name [[HC Donbass-2]], which won the 2012 and 2013 national titles. In 2013 Donetsk was hosting the [[2012–13 IIHF Continental Cup]] ice hockey Super Final, which [[HC Donbass]] won, and the [[2013 IIHF World Championship Division I#Group B Tournament|2013 IIHF World Championship Division I – Group B]], where [[Ukraine national ice hockey team|Ukraine]] finished 1st and earned promotion to Group A (both were hosted at the [[Druzhba Arena]]).

The city used to be the home of few notable at the time yet now defunct clubs. The [[MFC Shakhtar Donetsk]] club won the [[Ukrainian Futsal Championship|Ukrainian futsal championship]] five times, but was dissolved in January 2011 midway through the season due to financial problems (at the time – the most titled club in [[Ukraine]]). One of the top [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] volleyball teams at the time, [[VC Shakhtar Donetsk]], who were the last team to win the [[Soviet Volleyball Championship]], in 1992. The team also won the first two championships in the independent [[Ukraine]] league, in 1992 and 1993 (the 1992 Ukraine championship was held in Donetsk), and won the Ukraine Cup in 1993, but after having financial issues, the club was relegated in 1997, and after one season in the second tear it was shut down.

Donetsk hosted the [[Soviet Union|USSR Tennis Championship]] in 1978, 1979 and 1980, and hosted some tennis matches of the 2005 [[Davis Cup]]. Donetsk was home to the [[Alexander Kolyaskin Memorial]], which was held between 2002–2008 and part of the [[ATP Challenger Series]], and Donetsk is the home of the female [[Viccourt Cup]], which is classified as an [[ITF Women's Circuit]] and started in 2012.

Donetsk was always an important [[sport of athletics|athletics]] centre, and hosted various events. Donetsk was one of the host towns for the 1978 and 1980 Soviet Athletics Championships, and was the sole host town of the event in 1984. Donetsk also hosted the [[1977 European Athletics Junior Championships]]. The stadium used for those athletics events was the [[RSC Olimpiyskiy]] (at the time called RSC Lokomotiv).

Among the different [[track and field]] sports, Donetsk especially has a big name in [[pole vaulting]]. [[Serhii Bubka]], regarded by many as the greatest pole vaulter in history, grew up in the city, and also started in 1992 an annual pole vaulting event in Donetsk, called [[Pole Vault Stars]]. Bubka himself set the [[Men's pole vault indoor world record progression|world indoor record]] at the event three times (1990, 1991, 1993). His indoor world pole vault record of 6.15m, set in the Donetsk Olympic Stadium on 21 February 1993, was not broken until 2014. The [[Russia]]n female pole vaulter [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] set a new world record at the event every year between 2004–2009.

The [[2015 IIHF World Championship Division I]] ice hockey tournament had been scheduled for 18 to 24 April 2015 in Donetsk but was later moved to [[Kraków]], Poland due to the ongoing war.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Donetsk britania 02.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Velikobritaniya'' ({{lang-en|Great Britain}}) hotel is one of the oldest buildings in Donetsk, constructed in 1883.]]

Donetsk, at the time ''Yuzovka'', was divided into two parts: north and south. In the southern part were the city's factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals and schools. Not far from the factories was the ''English colony'' where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city's southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style.

These buildings used rectangular and triangular shaped façades, green rooftops, large windows, which occupied a large portion of the building, and balconies. In this part of the town, the streets were large and had pavements. A major influence on the formation of architecture in Donetsk was the ''official architect'' of a [[Novorossiya]] company — ''Moldingauyer''. Preserved buildings of the southern part of Yuzovka consisted of the residences of John Hughes (''1891, partially preserved''), Bolfur (''1889'') and Bosse.

In the northern part of Yuzovka, ''Novyi Svet'', lived traders, craftsmen and bureaucrats. Here were located the market hall, the police headquarters and the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Jesus. The central street of Novyi Svet and the neighbouring streets were mainly edged by one- or two-story residential buildings, as well as markets, restaurants, hotels, offices and banks. A famous preserved building in the northern part of Yuzovka was the Hotel Great Britain.

The first general plan of Stalino was made in 1932 in [[Odessa]] by the architect P. Golovchenko. In 1937, the project was partly reworked. These projects were the first in the city's construction bureau's history.

A large portion of the city's buildings from the second half of the 20th century were designed by the architect Pavel Vigdergauz, which was given the [[USSR State Prize|Government award of the USSR]] for architecture in the city of Donetsk in 1978.

=== Religion ===

In 2014, a fake leaflet "signed by Chairman of Donetsk's temporary government Denis Pushilin" was distributed to Jews on the festival of Passover. The leaflet informed Donetsk's Jewish citizen to register themselves, their property, and their family to the pro-Russian authorities. The leaflet claimed that failure to comply with its demands would result in the revocation of citizenship and confiscation of property. The leaflet prompted confusion and fear among Donetsk's Jewish population, who saw echoes of [[the Holocaust]] in the leaflet.<ref>Margalit, Michal.

[[File:Trolleybus Donezk.jpg|thumb|left|A Donetsk trolley bus with the Cathedral of Transfiguration of Jesus in the background.]]
[[File:TramLM2008.jpg|thumb|left|Tram LM-2008]]

The main forms of transport within Donetsk are: trams, electric [[trolley bus]]es, buses and [[marshrutka]]s (private [[minibuses]]). The city's public transport system is controlled by the united ''Dongorpastrans'' [[municipal]] company. The city has 12 tram lines (~130&nbsp;km), 17 trolley bus lines (~188&nbsp;km), and about 115 bus lines.<ref name="transport">{{cite web|url=http://www.partner.donetsk.ua/transport/|script-title=ru:Транспорт|trans-title=Transport|work=Partner-Portal|accessdate=11 May 2007|language=ru|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510133417/http://www.partner.donetsk.ua/transport/|archivedate=10 May 2007}}</ref> Both the tram and trolley bus systems in the city are served by 2 [[Bus station|depots]] each.<ref name="transport" /> Another method of transport within the city is [[taxicab]] service, of which there are 32 in Donetsk.

The city also contains autostations located within the city and its suburbs: autostation ''Yuzhny'' (South), which serves mainly transport lines to the south, hence its name; autostation ''Tsentr'' (Centre), which serves transport in the direction of [[Marinka, Ukraine|Marinka]] and [[Vuhledar]] as well as intercity transport; the autostation ''Krytyi rynok'' (Indoor market), which serves mainly transport in the north and east directions; and the autostation ''Putilovsky'', which serves mainly the north and northwest transport directions.

The construction of the [[Donetsk Metro|metro]] system in the city, begun in 1992, was recently abandoned due to the lack of funding. No lines or stations have been finished.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://1tv.com.ua/uk/news/2012/01/18/14506|script-title=uk:У Донецьку припиняють зводити метро|trans-title=Metro construction in Donetsk is stopping|language=uk|work=1tv.com.ua|date=18 January 2012|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502190006/http://1tv.com.ua/uk/news/2012/01/18/14506|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref>

Other railway stations are: ''Rutchenkovo'', located in the Kyivskyi Raion; ''Mandrykino'' (Petrovskyi Raion), and ''Mushketovo'' (Budionivskyi Raion). Some passenger trains avoid Donetsk station and serve the [[Yasynuvata]] station, located outside the city limits. Although not used for regular transport, the city also has a children's railway. (As of September 2009) a new railway terminal facility that will comply with [[UEFA]] requirements (since Donetsk is one of the host city's for [[UEFA EURO 2012]]) is planned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/order/?id=170301|title=Construction of railway terminal in Donetsk for UEFA EURO 2012 worth UAH 414mln|work=[[Ukrinform]]|date=23 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162528/http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/order/?id=170301|archivedate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

The Donetsk Oblast was an important transport hub in Ukraine, so was its centre Donetsk. The ''[[Donets Railway|Donetsk Railways]]'', based in Donetsk, is the largest railway division in the Republic. It serves the farming and industrial businesses of the area, and the populations of the Donetsk and [[Lugansk]] Republics and parts of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] and [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]] oblasts.

=== Road transport ===
The [[File:Tabliczka E50.svg|25px|link=European route E50]] highway, part of the [[International E-road network]], runs through the city ''en route'' to [[Rostov-on-Don]] in [[Russia]].

In addition, another international road runs through the city: the [[Highway M04 (Ukraine)|M 04]]. Also, three national Ukrainian roads (N 15, N 20, and N 21) pass through the city.

The construction of the fourth stage of a circular road bypassing Donetsk is to be completed in 2014.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/185414.html Building of fourth stage of Donetsk ring road to end in 2014], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 January 2014)</ref>

=== Air travel ===
In addition to public and rail transport, Donetsk used to have an [[Donetsk Airport|international airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vip-terminal.dn.ua/|title=Service Center, International Airport 'Donetsk'|accessdate=6 March 2007|work=VIP-Terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615231005/http://www.vip-terminal.dn.ua/eng/index.htm|archivedate=15 June 2006}}</ref> It was constructed during the early 1940s and early 1950s.  It was rebuilt in 1973 and again from 2011 to 2012. Because of fighting the airport has been closed as of 26 May 2014 and the airport has since then largely been destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loiko|first=Sergei L.|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/great-reads/la-fg-c1-ukraine-airport-20141028-story.html|title=Ukraine fighters, surrounded at wrecked airport, refuse to give up|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Donetsk|date=28 October 2014|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028102545/http://www.latimes.com/world/great-reads/la-fg-c1-ukraine-airport-20141028-story.html|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref> The airspace above Donetsk has also been closed since the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|MH17]] disaster.
