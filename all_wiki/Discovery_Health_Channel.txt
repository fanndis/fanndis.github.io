'''Discovery Health Channel''' was an [[United States|American]] [[pay television|subscription television]] [[television channel|channel]]. Launched in July 1998, it was owned by [[Discovery Communications]] as a spin-off of [[Discovery Channel]], focusing on health and wellness-oriented programming.

In the beginning, DHC's programming consisted of reruns of medical- and health-themed programming from other Discovery networks, particularly [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. As the network matured, it began producing its own reality series, mostly dealing with babies (''Babies: Special Delivery'', ''Birth Day''), bodies (''Plastic Surgery: Before and After'', ''National Body Challenge''), and medicine (''The Critical Hour'', ''[[Dr. G: Medical Examiner]]''). DHC also showed episodes of the [[CBS]] medical drama series ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' on a semi-regular basis. DHC also aired fitness-related programming, most of which later spun off to its sister network [[FitTV]]. DHC won its first Daytime Emmy in 2004 for its original series about adoptive families, ''Adoption Stories''.

On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced a joint venture with [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions]] to re-launch Discovery Health as [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network]], in 2009.<ref name="wp-ownannounce">{{cite web|title=Discovery, Winfrey to Team Up On Network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011501562.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}</ref> After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011, replacing Discovery Health.<ref name="nyp-owndelay">{{cite web|title=Oprah costs Discovery a fortune|url=https://nypost.com/2010/08/04/oprah-costs-discovery-a-fortune/|website=New York Post|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name="np-ownlaunch">{{cite web|title=Oprah Winfrey's OWN network lineup will aim to offer 'mindful television'|url=https://nationalpost.com/oprah+winfrey+network+lineup+will+offer+mindful+television/4046078/story.html|website=National Post|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

On February 1, 2011, FitTV was rebranded as [[Discovery Fit & Health]]. The network initially took on Discovery Health's programming with FitTV's fitness programming as a complement. It was relaunched in 2015 as Discovery Life, to reflect a generalization of its scope to include life events and family stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/discovery-to-switch-fit-and-health-channel-to-discovery-life-in-january-1201259329/|title=Discovery to Switch Fit and Health Channel to Discovery Life in January|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2014-07-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/discovery-health-lives-combining-fittv/362449|title=Discovery Health Lives On, Combining With FitTV |website=Multichannel|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/discoverys-fit-health-rebrand-discovery-life-158802/|title=Discovery's Fit & Health to Rebrand as Discovery Life|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-US}}</ref>
