{{Peerage |Types}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], '''life peers''' are appointed members of the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]] whose titles cannot be inherited, in contrast to [[hereditary peer]]s. In modern times, life peerages, always created at the rank of [[baron]], are created under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] and entitle the holders to seats in the [[House of Lords]], presuming they meet qualifications such as age and citizenship. The legitimate children of a life peer are entitled to [[Style (manner of address)|style]] themselves with the prefix "[[The Honourable]]", although they cannot inherit the peerage itself.

==Before 1887==
{{see also|Pre-1876 life peerages |Cromwell's Other House}}

[[The Crown]], as ''[[fount of honour]]'', creates peerages of two types, being hereditary or for life. In the early days of the peerage, the Sovereign had the right to summon individuals to one Parliament without being bound to summon them again. Over time, it was established that once summoned, a peer would have to be summoned for the remainder of his life, and later, that the peer's heirs and successors would also be summoned, thereby firmly entrenching the hereditary principle.

Nevertheless, life peerages lingered. From the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] to that of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (between 1603 and 1760), 18 life peerages were created for women. Women, however, were excluded from sitting in the House of Lords, so it was unclear whether or not a life peerage would entitle a man to do the same. For over four centuries—if one excludes those who sat in [[Cromwell's House of Lords]] (or Other House) during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]]—no man had claimed a seat in the Lords by virtue of a life peerage. In 1856, it was thought necessary to add a peer learned in law to the House of Lords (which was the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|final court of appeal]]), without allowing the peer's heirs to sit in the House and swell its numbers. [[James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale|Sir James Parke]], a [[Exchequer of Pleas#Barons|Baron]] (judge) of the [[Exchequer of pleas|Exchequer]], was created Baron Wensleydale for life, but the House of Lords concluded that the peerage did not entitle him to sit in the House of Lords. Lord Wensleydale was therefore appointed a hereditary peer. (In the event, he had no sons, so his peerage did not pass to an heir.) ''(See also [[Peerage law#Wensleydale Peerage Case (1856)|Wensleydale Peerage Case (1856)]].)''

The Government introduced a bill to authorise the creation of two life peerages carrying seats in the House of Lords for judges who had held office for at least five years. The House of Lords passed it, but the bill was lost in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In 1869, a more comprehensive life peerages bill was brought forward by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|the Earl Russell]]. At any one time, 28 life peerages could be in existence; no more than four were to be created in any one year. Life peers were to be chosen from senior judges, civil servants, senior officers of the [[British Army]] or [[Royal Navy]], members of the House of Commons who had served for at least ten years, scientists, writers, artists, [[peerage of Scotland|peers of Scotland]], and [[peerage of Ireland|peers of Ireland]]. (Peers of Scotland and Ireland did not all have seats in the House of Lords, instead electing a number of [[representative peers]].) The bill was rejected by the House of Lords at its [[third reading]].

Finally, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1887 allowed senior judges to sit in the House of Lords as life peers, known as ''Lords of Appeal in Ordinary''.<ref>[[William Sharp McKechnie|McKechnie, William Sharp]], 1909: [https://archive.org/details/reformofhouseofl00mckeuoft ''The reform of the House of Lords; with a criticism of the Report of the Select Committee of 2nd December, 1908''], p.13</ref> Those appointees who were not already members of the House of Lords were created life peers by the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]] (for their titles, see the [[list of law life peerages]]). Initially it was intended that peers created in this way would only sit in the House of Lords while serving their term as judges, but in 1887 (on the retirement of [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Lord Blackburn]]) the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1887 provided that former judges would retain their seats for life. This ended with the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in 2009.

==Life Peerages Act 1958==
The Life Peerages Act sanctions the regular granting of life peerages, but the power to appoint Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act was not [[derogated]]. The Act placed no limits on the number of peerages that the Sovereign may award, as was done by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act. A peer created under the Life Peerages Act has the right to sit in the House of Lords, provided that he or she is at least 21 years of age, is not suffering punishment upon conviction for [[treason]], and is a citizen of Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} or of a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and is resident in the UK for tax purposes.

Life baronies under the Life Peerages Act are created by the Sovereign but, in practice, are only granted when proposed by the [[List of British Prime Ministers|Prime Minister]].

Life peers created under the Life Peerages Act do not, unless they also hold ministerial positions, receive salaries. They are, however, entitled to an allowance of £300 for travel and accommodation for each day on which the peer "signs in" to the House, though the peer does not have to take part in the business of the House.

==="Working peers"===
From time to time, lists of "working peers" are published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/11/peerages-honours-and-appointments-2-57256|title=Latest peerages announced - GOV.UK}}</ref> They do not form a formal class, but represent the various political parties and are expected to regularly attend the House of Lords. Most new appointments of life peers fall into this category.

Normally, the Prime Minister chooses only peers from his or her own party, but permits the leaders of opposition parties to recommend peers from their parties. The Prime Minister may determine the number of peers each party may propose; he or she may also choose to amend these recommendations, but by convention does not do so.

==="People's peers"===
Peers may be created on a ''non-partisan basis''. Formerly, nominations on merit alone were made by the Prime Minister, but this function was partially transferred to a new, non-statutory [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]] in 2000. Individuals recommended for the peerage by the Commission go on to become what have been described by some in the British media as "people's peers".<ref>{{cite web | title='People's peers' under scrutiny|author=BBC| work=Caltech|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1950254.stm| accessdate=19 November 2006 | date=25 April 2002 | location=London}}</ref> The Commission also scrutinises party recommendations for working peerages to ensure propriety. The Prime Minister may determine the number of peers the Commission may propose, and also may amend the recommendations. Again, by convention, no amendment is made to the recommendations of the Commission.

===Honours===
Individuals may be created peers in various honours lists as rewards for achievement; these peers are not expected to attend the House of Lords regularly, but are at liberty to do so if they please. The [[New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]], the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|Queen's Birthday Honours List]] (to mark the Sovereign's official birthday, the second Saturday in June), the [[Dissolution Honours List]] (to mark the dissolution of Parliament) and the [[Resignation Honours List]] (to mark the end of a Prime Minister's tenure) are all used to announce life peerage creations.

===Public offices===
Creations may be made for individuals on retirement from important public offices, such as Prime Minister, [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] or [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or [[Archbishop of York|York]].

[[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], who had renounced his hereditary title of the 14th [[Earl of Home]] on becoming Prime Minister, was the first former occupant of the office to receive a life barony. [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] all took life peerages following their retirement from the House of Commons, although Thatcher's husband, [[Denis Thatcher]], was made [[Thatcher baronets|a baronet]]. [[Edward Heath]]{{cn|date=April 2019}} and [[John Major]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/962335.stm |title=Major to turn down peerage |publisher=BBC News |date=8 October 2000 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> chose not to become a peer.  [[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]] and [[David Cameron]] have yet to receive a peerage. 

[[Harold Macmillan]] declined a peerage on leaving office, but over 20 years after retiring accepted a second offer of the customary, hereditary earldom for retiring Prime Ministers, as [[Earl of Stockton]]; this was the last earldom to be offered outside the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]. While [[David Lloyd George]] also waited a similar period for [[Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor|his earldom]], most offers have been made and accepted shortly after retirement such as the Earls of [[Earl of Oxford and Asquith|Oxford and Asquith]], [[Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Baldwin]], [[Earl Attlee|Attlee]] and [[Earl of Avon|Avon]].

Many Cabinet members, including [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellors of the Exchequer]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretaries]], [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretaries]] and [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretaries]], retiring since 1958 have generally been created life peers. [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]] was created a hereditary viscount on the recommendation of Margaret Thatcher. Viscount Whitelaw died without male issue.

Life peerages have been granted to [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speakers of the House of Commons]] upon retirement. Speakers had previously been entitled by custom to a hereditary peerage as a [[viscount]]. George Thomas, the former Speaker and Secretary of State for Wales, was created [[Viscount Tonypandy]] but died without male issue.

The Prime Minister continues to recommend a small number of former public office-holders for peerages. This generally includes Chiefs of Defence Staff, Secretaries of the Cabinet, and Heads of the Diplomatic Service. Every Archbishop of Canterbury who has retired since 1958 has been created a life peer, as have most recent Archbishops of York on retirement. A small number of other bishops—such as [[David Sheppard]] of Liverpool and [[Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth|Richard Harries]] of Oxford—were ennobled on retiring. The [[Lord Chamberlain]] must be a member of the House of Lords and so is ennobled on appointment (if not already a peer), while most retiring [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Private Secretaries to the Queen]] and [[Governor of the Bank of England|Governors of the Bank of England]] have also become peers.

High judicial officers have sometimes been created life peers upon taking office. All [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales]] have, since 1958, been created life peers under the Life Peerages Act, with the exception of [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], who was already a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary before becoming Lord Chief Justice. Similarly, [[Robert Reed, Baron Reed of Allermuir|Lord Reed]] was created a life peer in 2019 when he was appointed [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|President of the Supreme Court]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crown Office|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3471861|access-date=2020-10-05|website=www.thegazette.co.uk}}</ref> all of his predecessors in that role having already been created life peers as former Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.  

Life peerages may in certain cases be awarded to hereditary peers. After the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] passed, several hereditary peers of the first creation, who had not inherited their titles but would still be excluded from the House of Lords by the Act, were created life peers: [[Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington]]; [[Frederick James Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale]]; [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford]] and [[Baron Pakenham|1st Baron Pakenham]]; and [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon]]. None of the peers of the first creation who were members of the Royal Family was granted a life peerage, as they had all declined. Life peerages were also granted to former [[Leader of the House of Lords|Leaders of the House of Lords]], including [[John Julian Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead]]; [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington]]; [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury]] (better known as [[Viscount Cranborne]] and [[Lord Cecil of Essendon]], having attended the Lords by virtue of a [[writ of acceleration]]); [[George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe]]; [[Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd]]; and [[David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham]].

As part of the celebrations to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Life Peerages Act 1958|Life Peerages Act]], [[Gareth Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn]] was voted by the current members of the House of Lords as the outstanding life peer since the creation of the life peerage.<ref name="grtstpeer">{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/epolitix/20080715/tpl-former-lords-leader-honoured-with-aw-0a1c1a1.html |title=Former Lords leader honoured with award |work=Yahoo/Epolitix |accessdate=20 July 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

There are currently 689 life peers eligible to vote in the House of Lords, as of 8 November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/composition-of-the-lords/|title=Lords by party, type of peerage and gender|website=UK Parliament}}</ref> This includes 214 Conservative, 175 Labour, 85 Liberal Democrat and 152 crossbench peers. There are also 10 others representing 4 other parties<!--DUP, Green, UUP, Plaid Cymru-->, 46 non-affiliated, 6 peers labelling themselves as "Independent" but close to a party<!--Independent Labour, Conservative Independent etc.-->, and the Lord Speaker. In addition, there are about 70 life peers <!-- about 100 retired peers are listed in the source, of whom about 30 have already died--> who have retired from the House of Lords since 2010, as well as several who are otherwise ineligible to vote or removed for non-attendance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/retired-lords/|title=Retired members of the House of Lords|website=UK Parliament}}</ref> 

The Appellate Jurisdiction Act originally provided for the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who would continue to serve while holding judicial office, though in 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the House of Lords for life, under the style and dignity of baron. The number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was increased from time to time – to three in 1882, to four in 1891, to six in 1913, to seven in 1919, to nine in 1947, to 11 in 1968 and to 12 in 1994. These provisions were repealed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] which created the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].

The rate of creation of life peerages under the Life Peerages Act has been fluctuating, with a high rate being most common right after a new party is elected to government. Consequently, [[David Cameron]] and [[Tony Blair]] have created life peerages at high rates, at 41 and 36 peerages per year respectively. However, current prime minister [[Boris Johnson]] has the highest rate of creations, at 57 peerages in about a year in office (as of 8 November 2020).

Conservative Prime Ministers have created on average 21 life peers per year in office, Labour Prime Ministers an average of 27 per year. In absolute terms, the Conservatives (in 37 years) have created slightly more (766 out of 1416, as of September 2019) life peerages than Labour  (in 24 years); Conservative Prime Ministers (especially Macmillan) also created the vast majority (52) of the 59 ''hereditary'' peerages created since 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peerages.info/peerages6.htm  |title=United Kingdom peerage creations 1801 to 2019 |last=Beamish |first=David |website=www.peerages.info |access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

In 1999, there were 172 Conservative and 160 Labour life peers in the House of Lords, and by 4 January 2010, there were 141 Conservative and 207 Labour life peers in the House of Lords. The hereditary element of the House of Lords, however, was much less balanced. In 1999, for example, immediately before most hereditary peers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hereditarypeers.com|title=Home Page}}</ref> were removed by the [[House of Lords Act 1999|House of Lords Act]], there were 350 Conservative hereditary peers, compared with 19 Labour peers and 23 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] peers.

==Disclaiming==
The [[Peerage Act 1963]] allows the holder of an hereditary peerage to disclaim their title for life. There is no such provision for life peers.  The [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]]'s draft proposal for Lords reform in 2011 "provides that a person who holds a life peerage may at any time disclaim that peerage by writing to the Lord Chancellor. The person [and their spouse and children] will be divested of all rights and interests attaching to [that] peerage."<ref>[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/house-of-lords-reform-draft-bill.pdf House of Lords Reform Draft Bill] (Clause 62)</ref> This proposal did not become law. In 2014 under the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014|House of Lords Reform Act]] it became possible for peers to resign from the House of Lords (without disclaiming the peerage).

==Titles and forms of address==
Most life peers take a title based on their surname, either alone (e.g. [[Roy Hattersley|Baron Hattersley]]) or in combination with a placename to differentiate them from others of the same surname (e.g. [[Helena Kennedy, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws|Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws]]). Surnames need not be used at all if desired.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4123628.stm News article from the BBC remarking on the custom, on the occasion of Tony Banks taking the title Baron Stratford instead of the more conventional Baron Banks</ref> [[Ian Paisley]], for example, opted for the title ''Lord Bannside'', and [[John Gummer, Baron Deben|John Gummer]] chose the title ''Lord Deben''. There are also occasions when someone's surname is not appropriate as a title, such as [[Michael Lord, Baron Framlingham|Michael Lord (now ''Lord Framlingham'')]] and [[Michael Bishop, Baron Glendonbrook|Michael Bishop (now ''Lord Glendonbrook'')]].<ref>[https://nortonview.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/my-lord-and-bishop/ The Norton View — My Lord and Bishop] (Accessed 22 May 2015)</ref>

The formal style for life peers is "The Rt Hon the Lord/Lady X" or "Firstname, Lord/Lady X" though women life peers often use "Firstname, Baroness X" to emphasise that they hold a peerage in their own right. In these examples, X is the title in one of the forms discussed above. Life peers who have achieved wide fame under their original name, such as the actor [[Laurence Olivier]], are often incorrectly referred to as Lord/Lady Firstname Lastname after their [[ennoblement]].<ref>[http://www.burkespeerage.com  Burke's Peerage]; only the daughters of earls, marquesses and dukes, and the younger sons of marquesses and dukes are properly referred to by the [[courtesy title]] of Lord or Lady Firstname Lastname.</ref>
