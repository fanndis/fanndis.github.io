The term can refer to any head, face, or body covering worn by Muslim women that conforms to [[Haya (Islam)|Islamic standards of modesty]].

In the Qur'an, the term ''hijab'' refers to a partition or curtain in the literal or metaphorical sense. The verse where it is used literally is commonly understood to refer to the curtain separating visitors to [[Muhammad]]'s house from his wives' lodgings. This had led some to argue that the mandate of the Qur'an to wear hijab applied to the wives of Muhammad, and not women generally.<ref name=aslan/><ref name="ahmedWomIslam"/>

In recent times, wearing hijab in public has been required by law in Iran and the Indonesian province of [[Aceh]]. Other countries, both in Europe and in the [[Muslim world]], have passed laws banning some or all types of hijab in public or in certain types of locales. Women in different parts of the world have also experienced unofficial pressure to wear or not wear hijab.

==In Islamic scripture==
{{Islamic Culture}}

===Quran===
The Quran instructs both Muslim men and women to dress in a modest way, but there is disagreement on how these instructions should be interpreted. The verses relating to dress use the terms ''khimār'' (head cover) and ''[[jilbāb]]'' (a dress or cloak) rather than ''ḥijāb''.<ref name="El Guindi"/> Of the more than 6,000 verses in the Quran, about half a dozen refer specifically to the way a woman should dress or walk in public.<ref name="Bucar, Elizabeth 2012">Bucar, Elizabeth, The Islamic Veil. Oxford, England: Oneworld Publications , 2012.</ref>

The clearest verse on the requirement of modest dress is [[Surah 24]]:31, telling women to guard their private parts and draw their ''khimār'' over their bosoms.<ref name=IslamOnline>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100626064435/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1119503546760 Evidence in the Qur'an for Covering Women's Hair], [[IslamOnline]].</ref><ref name=Hameed>Hameed, Shahul. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222184525/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=AskAboutIslamE&cid=1123996016174&pagename=IslamOnline-English-AAbout_Islam%2FAIELayout Is Hijab a Qur’anic Commandment?]," IslamOnline.net. 9 October 2003.</ref>

{{Quote|And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their private parts; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their ''khimār'' over their breasts and not display their beauty except to their husband, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments.|{{cite quran|24|31|style=nosup}}}}

In [[Surah 33]]:59 Muhammad is commanded to ask his family members and other Muslim women to wear outer garments when they go out, so that they are not harassed:<ref name =Hameed/>

{{Quote|O Prophet! Enjoin your wives, your daughters, and the wives of true believers that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): That is most convenient, that they may be distinguished and not be harassed.|{{cite quran|33|59|style=nosup}} }}

The Islamic commentators generally agree this verse refers to sexual harassment of women of [[Medina]]. It is also seen to refer to a free woman, for which [[Tabari]] cites [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn Abbas]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] states that the ''jilbab'' distinguishes free Muslim women from those of [[Jahiliyyah]], so other men know they are free women and not slavegirls or whores, indicating covering oneself does not apply to non-Muslims. He cites [[Sufyan al-Thawri]] as commenting that while it may be seen as permitting to look upon non-Muslim women who adorn themselves, it is not allowed in order to avoid lust. [[Al-Qurtubi]] concurs with Tabari about this ayah being for those who are free. He reports that the correct view is that a ''jilbab'' covers the whole body. He also cites the [[Sahabah]] as saying it is no longer than a ''rida'' (a shawl or a wrapper that covers the upper body). He also reports a minority view which considers the [[Niqāb|niqab]] or head-covering as jilbab. [[Ibn Arabi]] considered that excessive covering would make it impossible  for a woman to be recognised which the verse mentions, though both Qurtubi and Tabari agree that the word recognition is about distinguishing free women.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2IdgumzY9VgC&pg=PT112&dq=ibn+kathir+jilbab&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwltCIotXgAhUkTY8KHU1nBZcQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&q=ibn%20kathir%20jilbab&f=false Islam and the Veil: Theoretical and Regional Contexts], page 111-113]</ref>

Some scholars like [[Ibn Hayyan]], [[Ibn Hazm]] and [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]] questioned the ayah's common explanation. Hayyan believed that "believing women" referred to both free women and slaves as the latter are bound to more easily entice lust and their exclusion is not clearly indicated. Hazm too believed that it covered Muslim slaves as it would violate the law of not molesting a slave or fornication with her like that with a free woman. He stated that anything not attributed to Muhammad should be disregarded.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2IdgumzY9VgC&pg=PT114&dq=ibn+hazm&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwltCIotXgAhUkTY8KHU1nBZcQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&q=ibn%20hazm&f=false Islam and the Veil: Theoretical and Regional Contexts], page 114]</ref>

The word ''ḥijāb'' in the Quran refers not to women's clothing, but rather a spatial partition or curtain.<ref name="El Guindi"/> Sometimes its use is literal, as in the verse which refers to the screen that separated Muhammad's wives from the visitors to his house (33:53), while in other cases the word denotes separation between deity and mortals (42:51), wrongdoers and righteous (7:46, 41:5), believers and unbelievers (17:45), and [[Nūr (Islam)|light from darkness]] (38:32).<ref name="El Guindi"/>

The interpretations of the ''ḥijāb'' as separation can be classified into three types: as visual barrier, physical barrier, and ethical barrier. A visual barrier (for example, between Muhammad's family and the surrounding community) serves to hide from sight something, which places emphasis on a symbolic boundary. A physical barrier is used to create a space that provides comfort and privacy for individuals, such as elite women. An ethical barrier, such as the expression ''purity of hearts'' in reference to Muhammad's wives and the Muslim men who visit them, makes something forbidden.<ref name="Bucar, Elizabeth 2012"/>

* Narrated [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya]], Ummul Mu'minin: "When the verse 'That they should cast their outer garments over their persons' was revealed, the women of Ansar came out as if they had crows hanging down over their heads by wearing outer garments." {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|32|4090}}.

* Yahya related to me from Malik from Muhammad ibn Zayd ibn Qunfudh that his mother asked Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "What clothes can a woman wear in prayer?" She said, "She can pray in the khimār (headscarf) and the diri' ({{lang-ar|الدِّرْعِ|links=no|lit=shield, armature}}, {{Translation|'a woman's garment'}}) that reaches down and covers the top of her feet."

Traditionally, the four major [[madhhab|Sunni schools of thought]] ([[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]]) hold by [[ijma|consensus]] that it is [[fard|obligatory]] for the entire body of the woman (see ''[[awrah]]''), except her hands and face (and feet according to Hanafis) to be covered during prayer and in the presence of people of the opposite sex other than close family members (whom one is forbidden to marry—see ''[[mahram]]'').<ref name="seekershub.org">{{Cite web |url=http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2010/09/19/a-detailed-exposition-of-the-fiqh-of-covering-ones-nakedness-awra/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224055556/http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2010/09/19/a-detailed-exposition-of-the-fiqh-of-covering-ones-nakedness-awra/ |archive-date=24 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web |url=http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2016/04/11/can-you-clarify-the-standard-explanation-of-the-verse-of-hijab/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226170717/http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2016/04/11/can-you-clarify-the-standard-explanation-of-the-verse-of-hijab/ |archive-date=26 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Hsu, Shiu-Sian.

It is recommended that women wear clothing that is not form fitting to the body, such as modest forms of [[Western clothing]] (long shirts and skirts), or the more traditional ''jilbāb'', a high-necked, loose robe that covers the arms and legs. A ''khimār'' or ''shaylah'', a scarf or cowl that covers all but the face, is also worn in many different styles.

Some [[Salafi]] scholars such as [[Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen]] believe that covering the hands and face for all adult women is obligatory.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11774/ruling-on-covering-the-face-with-detailed-evidence |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219020013/https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11774/ruling-on-covering-the-face-with-detailed-evidence |archive-date=19 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Protests_in_Bahrain_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English_(13).jpg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]i women wearing the hijab]]

The major and most important Shia hadith collections such as Nahj Al-Balagha and Kitab Al-Kafi for the most part do not give any details with regards to hijab requirements, however, in a quotation from [[Man La Yahduruhu al-Faqih]] [[Musa al-Kadhim]] when enquired by his brother solely makes reference to female hijab requirements during the salat (prayer), stating "She covers her body and head with it then prays. And if her feet protrude from beneath, and she doesn't have the means to prevent that, there is no harm".<ref>Rispler-Chaim, Vardit. "The siwāk: A Medieval Islamic Contribution to Dental Care." Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 2.1 (1992): 13-20.</ref>

===Miscellaneous===
In private, and in the presence of close relatives (''mahrams''), rules on dress relax. However, in the presence of the husband, most scholars stress the importance of mutual freedom and pleasure of the husband and wife.<ref>[[Heba Kotb|Heba G. Kotb M.D.]], Sexuality in Islam, PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004</ref>

Traditional scholars had differences of opinion on covering the hands and face. The majority adopted the opinion that the face and hands are not part of their [[Intimate parts in Islam|nakedness]]. Some held the opinion that covering the face is [[Ahkam|recommended]] if the woman's beauty is so great that it is distracting and causes [[Fitna (word)|temptation or public discord]].<ref name="islamqa.org">{{Cite web |url=https://islamqa.org/maliki/binbayyah/29888 |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219130045/https://islamqa.org/maliki/binbayyah/29888 |archive-date=19 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Quranists===
[[Quranists]] are Muslims who view the Quran as the primary source of religious stipulation. Among the prerequisites which Quranists procure include the following verses:

{{Quote|O wives of prophet! You are not like other women; if you want to be righteous do not be too soft to make  those in whose heart a disease hopeful; and speak in recognised manner. And stay in your homes and make not a dazzling display like that of the former times of ignorance and offer prayer and pay zakah; and obey God and His messenger; o people of (Prophet’s) house! God wants to remove impurity from you and make you clean and pure.|{{cite quran|33|32-33|style=nosup}}}}

{{Quote|O believers!

Nonetheless, since [[Quranism]] overall lacks a formulated and coordinated framework, adherents to its creed overall do not have a unanimous concurrence over how Quranic verses apply, which some Quranist-oriented female Muslims observing the hijab and others not. [[Queen Rania of Jordan|Rania]], the wife of King of Jordan, once took a Quran-centric approach on why she does not observe the hijab, although she has never self-identified as a [[Quranist]].<ref>Volk, Anthony. "Islam and Liberalism: Conflicting Values?." Harvard International Review 36.4 (2015): 14.</ref>

===Alternative views===
Some Muslims take a relativist approach to hijab. They believe that the commandment to maintain ''modesty'' must be interpreted with regard to the surrounding society. What is considered modest or daring in one society might not be considered so in another. It is important, they say, for believers to wear clothing that communicates modesty and reserve.<ref>{{cite web

Along with scriptural arguments, [[Leila Ahmed]] argues that head covering should not be compulsory in Islam because the veil predates the revelation of the Qur'an. Head-covering was introduced into Arabia long before Muhammad, primarily through Arab contacts with Syria and Iran, where the hijab was a sign of social status. After all, only a woman who need not work in the fields could afford to remain secluded and veiled.<ref name=aslan/><ref>{{Cite book

Ahmed argues for a more liberal approach to hijab. Among her arguments is that while some Qur'anic verses enjoin women in general to "draw their Jilbabs (overgarment or cloak) around them to be recognized as believers and so that no harm will come to them"{{cite quran|33|58|end=59}} and "guard their private parts ... and drape down ''khimar'' over their breasts [when in the presence of unrelated men]",{{cite quran|24|31}} they urge modesty. The word ''khimar'' refers to a piece of cloth that covers the head, or headscarf.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mO5_R80ih5cC&q=khimar&pg=PA130 |title=Islam and gender justice  |author=V.A.

According to at least three authors ([[Karen Armstrong]], [[Reza Aslan]] and Leila Ahmed), the stipulations of the hijab were originally meant only for Muhammad's wives, and were intended to maintain their inviolability. This was because Muhammad conducted all religious and civic affairs in the mosque adjacent to his home:
[[File:Afghan National Army (ANA) Brig. Gen. Khatool Mohammadzai, center, the director for women's affairs and the deputy director for the education and physical training within the ANA, poses with a group of 120220-A-WI966-673.jpg|thumb|right|[[Afghans|Afghan]] army and police officials wearing hijabs in [[Kandahar]]]]
{{Quote|1=People were constantly coming in and out of this compound at all hours of the day. When delegations from other tribes came to speak with Prophet Muhammad, they would set up their tents for days at a time inside the open courtyard, just a few feet away from the apartments in which Prophet Muhammad's wives slept. And new emigrants who arrived in [[Medina|Yatrib]] would often stay within the mosque's walls until they could find suitable homes.<ref name=aslan>[[Reza Aslan|Aslan, Reza]], ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No God but God]]'', Random House, (2005), p.65–6</ref>}}

According to Ahmed:

{{Quote|By instituting seclusion Prophet Muhammad was creating a distance between his wives and this thronging community on their doorstep.<ref name="ahmedWomIslam">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0Grq2BzaUgC&pg=PA55 |title=Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate |access-date=2013-04-20 |isbn=9780300055832 |year=1992 |last1=Ahmed |first1=Leila }}</ref>}}

They argue that the term ''darabat al-hijab'' ('taking the veil') was used synonymously and interchangeably with "becoming Prophet Muhammad's wife", and that during Muhammad's life, no other Muslim woman wore the hijab. Aslan suggests that Muslim women started to wear the hijab to emulate Muhammad's wives, who are revered as "Mothers of the Believers" in Islam,<ref name=aslan/> and states "there was no tradition of veiling until around 627 [[Common Era|C.E.]]" in the Muslim community.<ref name=aslan/><ref name="ahmedWomIslam"/>

Another interpretation differing from the traditional states that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind men and men lacking physical desire (i.e., [[Asexuality|asexuals]] and [[hyposexual]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://islamqa.info/en/92753 |title=Is it ok to take off the kimar and niqab in front of a blind man? |publisher=Islamqa.info |access-date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905044304/http://islamqa.info/en/92753 |archive-date=5 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&FatwaId=113271 Women revealing their adornment to men who lack physical desire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084325/http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&FatwaId=113271 |date=27 December 2016 }} retrieved 25 June 2012</ref><ref>Queer Spiritual Spaces: Sexuality and Sacred Places – Page 89, Kath Browne, Sally Munt, Andrew K.

Some scholars think that these contemporary views and arguments, however, contradict the hadith sources, the classical scholars, exegesis sources, historical consensus, and interpretations of the [[Sahabah|companions]] (such as [[Aisha]] and [[Abdullah ibn Masud]]).

Many traditionalist Muslims reject the contemporary views, however, some traditionalist Muslim scholars accept the contemporary views and arguments as those hadith sources are not sahih and [[ijma]] would no longer be applicable if it is argued by scholars (even if it is argued by only one scholar). Notable examples of traditionalist Muslim scholars who accept these contemporary views include the Indonesian scholar [[Buya Hamka]].

In Turkey the hijab was formerly banned in private and state universities and schools. The ban applied not to the scarf wrapped around the neck, traditionally worn by Anatolian peasant women, but to the head covering pinned neatly at the sides, called ''türban'' in Turkey, which has been adopted by a growing number of educated urban women since the 1980s.  As of the mid-2000s, over 60% of Turkish women covered their head outside home, though only 11% wore a ''türban''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6122010.stm | work=BBC News | title=Headscarf issue challenges Turkey | date=7 November 2006 | first=Sarah | last=Rainsford | access-date=24 June 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420191433/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6122010.stm | archive-date=20 April 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7025294.stm |title=Women condemn Turkey constitution |work=BBC News |first=Sarah |last=Rainsford |date=2 October 2007 |access-date=4 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813003706/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7025294.stm |archive-date=13 August 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11880622 | work=BBC News | title=Quiet end to Turkey's college headscarf ban | date=31 December 2010 | author=Jonathan Head | access-date=21 July 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613170826/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11880622 | archive-date=13 June 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="salon.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/04/23/headscarf/ |title=Head scarves to topple secular Turkey? |work=Salon |first=Tracy |last=Clark-Flory |access-date=4 August 2008 |date=23 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513032710/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/04/23/headscarf/ |archive-date=13 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The ban was lifted from universities in 2008,<ref>Ayman, Zehra; Knickmeyer, Ellen.

=== Burqa and niqab ===
[[File:Muslim woman in Yemen.jpg|thumb|upright|A Muslim woman in [[Yemen]] wearing a [[niqab]]]]
There are several types of veils which cover the face in part or in full.

The ''[[burqa]]''  (also spelled ''burka'') is a garment that covers the entire body, including the face.<ref name="channel4" /> It is commonly associated with the [[Burqa|Afghan ''chadri'']], whose face-veiling portion is typically a piece of netting that obscures the eyes but allows the wearer to see out.

The ''[[niqab]]'' is a term which is often incorrectly used interchangeably with burqa.<ref name="channel4">{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/from-hijab-to-burqa-a-guide-to-muslim-headwear|title=From hijab to burqa - a guide to Muslim headwear|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=24 October 2013|access-date=2 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905053217/http://www.channel4.com/news/from-hijab-to-burqa-a-guide-to-muslim-headwear|archive-date=5 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It properly refers to a garment that covers a woman's upper body and face, except for her eyes.<ref name="channel4" /> It is particularly associated with the style traditionally worn in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], where the veil is attached by one side and covers the face only below the eyes, thereby allowing the eyes to be seen.

Only a minority of Islamic scholars believe that covering the face is mandatory, and the use of niqab beyond its traditional geographic strongholds has been a subject of political controversy.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC|title=Niqab|access-date=23 August 2016|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_1.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212152950/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/niqab_1.shtml|archive-date=12 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|title=The Islamic veil across Europe|journal=BBC News|date=1 July 2014|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13038095|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209161441/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13038095|archive-date=9 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 2014 survey of men and women in seven Muslim-majority countries, the Afghan burqa was the preferred form of woman's dress for 11% of respondents in Saudi Arabia, 4% in Iraq, 3% in Pakistan, 2% in Lebanon, and 1% or less in Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey.<ref name="2014poll" /> The niqab face veil was the preferred option for 63% of respondents in Saudi Arabia, 32% in Pakistan, 9% in Egypt, 8% in Iraq, and 2% or less in Lebanon, Tunisia, and Turkey.<ref name="2014poll" />

Strict seclusion and the veiling of matrons were also customary in ancient Greece.

There is archeological evidence suggesting that early Christian women in Rome covered their heads.<ref name="freund" /> Writings of [[Tertullian]] indicate that a number of different customs of dress were associated with different cults to which early Christians belonged around 200 CE.<ref name="freund" /> The best known early Christian view on veiling is the passage in [[1 Corinthians 11]]:4-7, which states that "every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head".<ref name="freund" /> This view may have been influenced by Roman pagan customs, such as the head covering worn by the priestesses of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] ([[Vestal Virgin]]s), rather than Jewish practices.<ref name="freund" /> In turn, the rigid norms pertaining to veiling and seclusion of women found in Christian Byzantine literature have been influenced by ancient Persian traditions, and there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=26–28}}</ref>

Intermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the Semitic peoples of the Middle East.<ref name="El Guindi" /> Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses.<ref name="El Guindi" /> In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.<ref name="El Guindi" />

Leila Ahmed argues that "Whatever the cultural source or sources, a fierce misogyny was a distinct ingredient of Mediterranean and eventually Christian thought in the centuries immediately preceding the rise of Islam."<ref name="Ahmed 1992 35">{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=35}}</ref> Ahmed interprets veiling and segregation of sexes as an expression of a misogynistic view of shamefulness of sex which focused most intensely on shamefulness of the female body and danger of seeing it exposed.<ref name="Ahmed 1992 35" />

===During Muhammad's lifetime===

Available evidence suggests that veiling was not introduced into Arabia by Muhammad, but already existed there, particularly in the towns, although it was probably not as widespread as in the neighboring countries such as Syria and Palestine.<ref name="ahmed55-56" /> Similarly to the practice among Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Assyrians, its use was associated with high social status.<ref name="ahmed55-56" /> In the early Islamic texts, term ''hijab'' does not distinguish between veiling and seclusion, and can mean either "veil" or "curtain".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=53–54}}</ref> The only verses in the Qur'an that specifically reference women's clothing are those promoting modesty, instructing women to guard their private parts and wear scarves that fall onto their breast area in the presence of men.<ref name="Ahmed 1992 55">>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=55}}</ref> The contemporary understanding of the hijab dates back to Hadith when the "verse of the hijab" descended upon the community in 627 CE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|title=No God but God|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-6213-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla/page/65 65]|url=https://archive.org/details/nogodbutgodorigi00asla/page/65}}</ref> Now documented in Sura 33:53, the verse states, "And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition.

===Later pre-modern history===
[[File:Félix Bonfils Jeune femme de Naplouse.jpg|thumb|upright|Young woman from [[Nablus]] in a hijab (c. 1867–1885)]]
The practice of veiling was borrowed from the elites of the Byzantine and Persian empires, where it was a symbol of respectability and high social status, during the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]] of those empires.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hijab|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001|isbn=9780195125580|url=https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary00bada}}</ref>  Reza Aslan argues that "The veil was neither compulsory nor widely adopted until generations after Muhammad's death, when a large body of male scriptural and legal scholars began using their religious and political authority to regain the dominance they had lost in society as a result of the Prophet's egalitarian reforms".<ref name="Aslan 2005 66" />

Because Islam identified with the monotheistic religions of the conquered empires, the practice was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=36}}</ref> Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities.<ref name="El Guindi" /> Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Islam: The Straight Path|url=https://archive.org/details/islam00john|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/islam00john/page/99 99]|edition=3}}</ref> Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, "a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle."<ref>Bloom (2002), p.47</ref>

By the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a ''burqa'' ([[muslin]] cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth).<ref name="El Guindi" /> The name of this garment, ''harabah'', derives from early Christian and Judaic religious vocabulary, which may indicate the origins of the garment itself.<ref name="El Guindi" /> Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a form of ''niqab'' when they visited urban areas, "as a sign of civilization".<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be7sCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA276|page=276|title=Religion in Public Spaces: A European Perspective|editor1=Silvio Ferrari |editor2=Sabrina Pastorelli|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|author=Sara Silverstri|chapter=Comparing Burqa Debates in Europe|isbn=9781317067542}}</ref>

Why don't you make her wear the headscarf? So you can't make one girl, your own daughter, wear it, and yet you want me to go and make ten million women wear it?"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The late-twentieth century saw a resurgence of the hijab in Egypt after a long period of decline as a result of westernization. Already in the mid-1970s some college aged Muslim men and women began a movement meant to reunite and rededicate themselves to the Islamic faith.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com">{{cite web|last1=El Guindi|first1=Fadwa|last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa|title=Ḥijāb|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0306|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|access-date=11 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024173453/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0306|archive-date=24 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Bullock 2000 22–53">{{cite journal |last=Bullock|first=Katherine|title=Challenging Medial Representations of the Veil|journal=The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=22–53}}</ref> This movement was named the [[Islamic revival|Sahwah]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Elsaie |first=Adel |title=Dr. |url=http://www.usislam.org/islamicyouth/islamic_youth_Campaign.htm |publisher=United States of Islam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224004547/http://www.usislam.org/islamicyouth/islamic_youth_Campaign.htm |archive-date=24 December 2012 }}</ref> or awakening, and sparked a period of heightened religiosity that began to be reflected in the dress code.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com" /> 
The uniform adopted by the young female pioneers of this movement was named al-Islāmī (Islamic dress) and was made up of an "al-jilbāb—an unfitted, long-sleeved, ankle-length gown in austere solid colors and thick opaque fabric—and al-khimār, a head cover resembling a nun's [[wimple]] that covers the hair low to the forehead, comes under the chin to conceal the neck, and falls down over the chest and back".<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com" /> In addition to the basic garments that were mostly universal within the movement, additional measures of modesty could be taken depending on how conservative the followers wished to be. Some women choose to also utilize a face covering (al-niqāb) that leaves only eye slits for sight, as well as both gloves and socks in order to reveal no visible skin.

Soon this movement expanded outside of the youth realm and became a more widespread Muslim practice. Women viewed this way of dress as a way to both publicly announce their religious beliefs as well as a way to simultaneously reject western influences of dress and culture that were prevalent at the time. Despite many criticisms of the practice of hijab being oppressive and detrimental to women's equality,<ref name="Bullock 2000 22–53" /> many Muslim women view the way of dress to be a positive thing. It is seen as a way to avoid harassment and unwanted sexual advances in public and works to desexualize women in the public sphere in order to instead allow them to enjoy equal rights of complete legal, economic, and political status. This modesty was not only demonstrated by their chosen way of dress but also by their serious demeanor which worked to show their dedication to modesty and Islamic beliefs.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com" />

Controversy erupted over the practice. Many people, both men and women from backgrounds of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of [[Women's rights in Iran|women and their rights]]. There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab was truly a female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com" /> Many instances, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran's current policy of forced veiling for women, have brought these issues to the forefront and generated great debate from both scholars and everyday people.

As the awakening movement gained momentum, its goals matured and shifted from promoting modesty towards more of a political stance in terms of retaining support for [[Pan-Islamism]] and a symbolic rejection of Western culture and norms. Today the hijab means many different things for different people. For Islamic women who choose to wear the hijab it allows them to retain their modesty, morals and freedom of choice.<ref name="Bullock 2000 22–53" /> They choose to cover because they believe it is liberating and allows them to avoid harassment. Many people (both Muslim and non-Muslim){{who|date=November 2020}} are against the wearing of the hijab and argue that the hijab causes issues with gender relations, works to silence and repress women both physically and metaphorically, and have many other problems with the practice.{{cn|date=November 2020}} This difference in opinions has generated a plethora of discussion on the subject, both emotional and academic, which continues today.

Ever since 11 September 2001, the discussion and discourse on the hijab has intensified. Many nations have attempted to put restrictions on the hijab, which has led to a new wave of rebellion by women who instead turn to covering and wearing the hijab in even greater numbers.<ref name="Bullock 2000 22–53" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=Bronwyn|title=The Great Hijab Coverup|journal=Off Our Backs; A Women's Newsjournal|year=2006|volume=36|issue=3|pages=38–40|jstor=20838653}}</ref>

==== Iran ====
In Iran some women act to transform the hijab by challenging the regime subsequently reinventing culture and women's identity within Iran. The female Iranian fashion designer, Naghmeh Kiumarsi, challenges the regime's notion of culture through publicly designing, marketing, and selling clothing pieces that feature tight fitting jeans, and a “skimpy” headscarf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naghmehkiumarsi.org/news/|title=Naghmeh Kiumarsi Official Website {{!}} News|website=naghmehkiumarsi.org|access-date=1 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501005752/http://naghmehkiumarsi.org/news/|archive-date=1 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Kiumarsi embodies her own notion of culture and identity and utilizes fashion to value the differences among Iranian women, as opposed to a single identity under the Islamic dress code and welcomes the evolution of Iranian culture with the emergence of new style choices and fashion trends.

Women's resistance in Iran is gaining traction as an increasing number of women challenge the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Smith (2017) addressed the progress that Iranian women have made in her article, “Iran surprises by realizing Islamic dress code for women,”<ref name="Istanbul">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/iran-surprises-by-relaxing-islamic-dress-code-for-women-m9wmhkgl7|title=Iran surprises by relaxing Islamic dress code for women|last=Istanbul|first=Hannah Lucinda Smith|date=29 December 2017|work=The Times|access-date=1 May 2019|issn=0140-0460|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501005745/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/iran-surprises-by-relaxing-islamic-dress-code-for-women-m9wmhkgl7|archive-date=1 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> published by ''The Times'', a reputable news organization based in the UK.

== Academic studies on the hijab ==
Although the field is quite new, several academic studies on the hijab have been conducted, and there is growing body of research. It is hypothesized that the beneficial mental health effects of the hijab is due to religiosity rather than the article of clothing itself, and the hijab acts as a proxy for religiosity,<ref name=":8" /> but it's also possible use of the hijab may protect Muslim women from appearance-based public scrutiny.<ref name=":9" />

=== Canada ===
Muslim women who dressed more modestly were more secure about their body image, and less likely to be pressured by Western media beauty standards. Whereas Muslim women who did not wear hijabs and wore Western clothing were more insecure about their body. Non-Western cultures in the Middle East and Asia, which were incompatible with Islamic values, such as not properly wearing a hijab as is Islamically prescribed, also resulted in similar insecurity as wearing Western clothing.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last1=Chaker|first1=Zina|last2=Chang|first2=Felicia M.|last3=Hakim-Larson|first3=Julie|date=1 June 2015|title=Body satisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and perceived pressure to be thin among Canadian women: The role of acculturation and religiosity|journal=Body Image|language=en|volume=14|pages=85–93|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.04.003|pmid=25932974|issn=1740-1445}}</ref>

On the question of the hijab being a "symbol of female oppression", findings from [[Montreal]]<ref name=":10" /> finds that much of this is baseless and often the result of hypersexualized Western culture trying to deny Muslim women, who do not wish to be sexualized and objectified, their voices. One Muslim woman interviewed states that "I find that Québec women are like [sex] symbols. They are used to sell stuff: toilet paper, cell phones, etc. In school, girls want to impress boys.

In a study comparing Muslim women with non-Muslim women, Muslim women wearing conservative Islamic clothing (i.e., hijabs/abayas) had higher self-esteem, better body image, healthier body weight, felt less sexually objectified, and more respected, compared to non-Muslim Western women who wore Western clothing. Women who wore more conservative Islamic clothing felt less pressure to have an unhealthy thinner body, as well as in reality had a much healthier [[Body mass index|BMI]] on the more thinner side.

More religiosity was correlated to lower body dissatisfaction, sexual objectification, and less eating disorders.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Mussap|first=Alexander J.|date=1 March 2009|title=Strength of faith and body image in Muslim and non-Muslim women|journal=Mental Health, Religion & Culture|volume=12|issue=2|pages=121–127|doi=10.1080/13674670802358190|s2cid=146737577|issn=1367-4676}}</ref>

Other findings show effects appear to be driven by the hijab specifically, rather than religiosity, which was a significant covariate.

A replication of these studies in a French setting finds Muslim women who wore the hijab reported lower weight discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and pressure to conform to Western media beauty standards. The effects are attributed to use of the hijab specifically, even after controlling for religiosity. The authors conclude that in the absence of data to the contrary, lawmakers should not rush to demonize the hijab, and should highlight the positive mental health effects of the hijab.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kertechian|first1=Sevag K.|last2=Swami|first2=Viren|date=25 November 2016|title=The hijab as a protective factor for body image and disordered eating: a replication in French Muslim women|journal=Mental Health, Religion & Culture|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1056–1068|doi=10.1080/13674676.2017.1312322|s2cid=151846671|issn=1367-4676|url=https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/701613/1/Results8.docx}}</ref>

The first study done in a Muslim majority country; finds that both the hijab (the clothing itself) and religiosity are both major factors in of themselves, in contributing to positive body image. Muslim women with high religiosity but who did not wear the hijab had higher rates of social appearance anxiety, whereas Muslim women with both high religiosity and wore a hijab did not.

==Compulsion and pressure==

{{Further|Hijab by country}}

Some governments encourage and even oblige women to wear the hijab, while others have banned it in at least some public settings. In many parts of the world women also experience informal pressure for or against wearing hijab, including physical attacks.

===Legal bans===

==== Muslim world ====
The tradition of veiling hair in Iranian culture has ancient pre-Islamic origins,<ref>{{Iranica|clothing-ii|CLOTHING ii. In the Median and Achaemenid periods}}</ref> but the widespread custom was forcibly ended by [[Reza Shah]]'s regime in 1936, as he claimed hijab to be incompatible with his modernizing ambitions and ordered "unveiling" act or [[Kashf-e hijab]]. The police arrested women who wore the veil and would forcibly remove it, and these policies outraged the [[Shi'a]] clerics, and ordinary men and women, to whom appearing in public without their cover was tantamount to nakedness. Many women refused to leave the house out of fear of being assaulted by Reza Shah's police.<ref>El-Guindi, Fadwa, ''Veil: Modesty, Privacy, and Resistance'', Berg, 1999</ref> In 1941, the compulsory element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned.

Turkey had a ban on headscarves at universities until recently.

A team of psychologists in Belgium have investigated, in two studies of 166 and 147 participants, whether the Belgians' discomfort with the Islamic hijab, and the support of its ban from the country's public sphere, is motivated by the defense of the values of autonomy and universalism (which includes equality), or by xenophobia/ethnic prejudice and by anti-religious sentiments. The studies have revealed the effects of subtle prejudice/racism, values (self-enhancement values and security versus universalism), and religious attitudes (literal anti-religious thinking versus spirituality), in predicting greater levels of anti-veil attitudes beyond the effects of other related variables such as age and political conservatism.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2009.02.005|title = Host society's dislike of the Islamic veil: The role of subtle prejudice, values, and religion| journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations| volume=33| issue=5| pages=419–428|year = 2009|last1 = Saroglou|first1 = Vassilis| last2=Lamkaddem| first2=Bahija| last3=Van Pachterbeke| first3=Matthieu| last4=Buxant| first4=Coralie}}</ref>

===Unofficial pressure to wear hijab===
{{see also|Honor killing|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}

Muslim girls and women have fallen victim to [[honor killing]]s in both the Western world and elsewhere for refusing to wearing the hijab or for wearing it in way considered to be improper by the perpetrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chesler|first=Phyllis|date=1 March 2010|title=Worldwide Trends in Honor Killings|url=https://www.meforum.org/2646/worldwide-trends-in-honor-killings|journal=Middle East Quarterly|access-date=5 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190116124224/https://www.meforum.org/2646/worldwide-trends-in-honor-killings|archive-date=16 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Successful informal coercion of women by sectors of society to wear hijab has been reported in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] where Mujama' al-Islami, the predecessor of [[Hamas]], reportedly used "a mixture of consent and coercion" to {{"'}}restore' hijab" on urban educated women in Gaza in the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3012687|title = Women, the Hijab and the Intifada|journal = Middle East Report|issue = 164/165|pages = 24–78|last1 = Hammami|first1 = Rema|year = 1990|doi = 10.2307/3012687}}</ref>

Similar behaviour was displayed by Hamas itself during the [[First Intifada]] in Palestine. Though a relatively small movement at this time, Hamas exploited the political vacuum left by perceived failures in strategy by the Palestinian factions to call for a "return" to Islam as a path to success, a campaign that focused on the role of women.<ref>Rubenberg, C., ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank'' (USA, 2001) p.230</ref> Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the hijab alongside other measures, including insisting women stay at home, segregation from men and the promotion of [[polygamy]]. In the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn "just to avoid problems on the streets".<ref>Rubenberg, C., ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank'' (USA, 2001) p.231</ref>

Wearing of the hijab was enforced by the [[Taliban]] [[Taliban regime|regime in Afghanistan]]. The Taliban required women to cover not only their head but their face as well, because "the face of a woman is a source of corruption" for men not related to them.<ref name="Gohari">M. J. Gohari (2000). ''The Taliban: Ascent to Power''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 108-110.</ref>

In [[Srinagar]], the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, a previously unknown militant group calling itself ''[[Lashkar-e-Jabbar]]'' claimed responsibility for a series of acid attacks on women who did not wear the [[burqa]] in 2001, threatening to punish women who do not adhere to their vision of Islamic dress. Women of Kashmir, most of whom are not fully veiled, defied the warning, and the attacks were condemned by prominent militant and separatist groups of the region.<ref>{{cite news | last = Popham | first = Peter (in Delhi) | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kashmir-women-face-threat-of-acid-attacks-from-militants-9153249.html | title = Kashmir women face threat of acid attacks from militants | newspaper = The Independent | date = 30 August 2001 | access-date = 20 April 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160828023043/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kashmir-women-face-threat-of-acid-attacks-from-militants-9153249.html | archive-date = 28 August 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1484145.stm |title=Kashmir women face acid attacks |work=BBC News |date=10 August 2001 |access-date=20 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131201121/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1484145.stm |archive-date=31 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2015, authorities in Uzbekistan organized a "deveiling" campaign in the capital city [[Tashkent]], during which women wearing hijab were detained and taken to a police station. Those who agreed to remove their hijab were released "after a conversation", while those who refused were transferred to the counterterrorism department and given a lecture. Their husbands or fathers were then summoned to convince the women to obey the police. This followed an earlier campaign in the [[Fergana Valley]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Bruce Pannier, Farruh Yusupov|title='Deveiling' Drive Moves To Uzbekistan's Capital|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=14 June 2015|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/uzbekistan-deveiling-drive-hijab/27070345.html|access-date=22 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920123512/http://www.rferl.org/content/uzbekistan-deveiling-drive-hijab/27070345.html|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Journal of International Women's Studies,16''(2), 70-97</ref> Although, South Asian Muslim women in both locations are similar in describing discrimination experiences as subtle and indirect interactions.<ref name=":4" />  The same study also reports differences among South Asian Muslim women who wear the hijab, and those who do not. For non-hijabis, they reported to have experienced more perceived discrimination when they were around other Muslims.<ref name=":4" />

Perceived discrimination is detrimental to well-being, both mentally and physically.<ref>Pascoe, E. A., & Smart Richman, L. (2009). Perceived discrimination and health: a meta-analytic review. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''135''(4), 531</ref> However, perceived discrimination may also be related to more positive well-being for the individual.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|hdl=10063/1005|title=Persevere in Adversity: Perrceived Religious Discrimination and Islamic Identity as Predictors of Psychological Wellbeing in Muslim Women in New Zealand|last=Jasperse|first=Marieke Lyniska|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41336356.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|location=New Zealand|access-date=28 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924214843/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41336356.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> A study in New Zealand concluded that while Muslim women who wore the headscarf did in fact experience discrimination, these negative experiences were overcome by much higher feelings of religious pride, belonging, and centrality.<ref name=":5" />
