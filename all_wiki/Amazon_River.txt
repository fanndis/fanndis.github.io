==Origin of the name==

The Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the [[Marañón River|Marañón]], and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese, and Amazon River in English.

The name Rio was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by [[Francisco de Orellana]]. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the [[Amazons|Amazon warriors]], a tribe of women warriors related to [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]<ref name="theoi.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html |title=Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2 |access-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830025406/http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2">{{Cite web |url=http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm |title=Argonautica Book 2 |access-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005183749/http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm |archive-date=5 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> mentioned in [[mythology]].

However other scholars insist that the name is derived from the Native American word amassona, meaning “boat destroyer.”<ref>"Amazon River", Encarta Encyclopedia, Microsoft Student 2009 DVD.</ref>

The word Amazon itself may be derived from the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] compound *ha-maz-an- "(one) fighting together"<ref>"Amazon | Origin And Meaning Of Amazon By Online Etymology Dictionary". 2018.

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of Amazon history}}

=== Pre-Columbian era ===<!--NOTE; no typo; pre-Columbian refers to "before Columbus", not "before Columbia"-->
[[File:Brazil, the Amazons and the coast (1879) (14780994814).jpg|thumb|[[Arapaima]] is 23 million years old, dating back to the [[Miocene]]]]

During what many [[archaeologist]]s called the ''[[formative stage]]'', Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland [[agriculture|agrarian]] systems. The [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the [[Muisca Confederation|Muisca]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]]. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.

Shell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse{{clarify|date=February 2017}} and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the [[Marajoara culture]]. [[Figurative mound]]s are the most recent types of occupation.

There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.<ref name=Wohl_p24_25>Wohl, 2011, pp. 24–25.</ref> These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by [[selective cultivation]] and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as ''[[terra preta]] de índio'' ("Indian dark earth").<ref name=Wohl_p25>Wohl, 2011, p. 25.</ref> Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.<ref name=Wohl_p25/>

Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. James Stuart Olson wrote: "The [[Munduruku]] expansion dislocated and displaced the [[Kawahíb people|Kawahíb]], breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups&nbsp;... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River."<ref>{{cite book|first=James Stuart|last=Olson|title=The Indians of Central and South America: an ethnohistorical dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=175c4xOpLtYC&pg=PA57|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1991|pages=57–248|isbn=978-0-313-26387-3|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912153816/https://books.google.com/books?id=175c4xOpLtYC&pg=PA57&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false|archive-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Arrival of Europeans ===
[[File: Amazon CIAT (2).jpg|thumb|Amazon tributaries near Manaus]]
In March 1500, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]] was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River.<ref name=Morison1974>{{cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel|title=The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492–1616|url=https://archive.org/details/europeandiscover00mori|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|location=New York}}</ref> Pinzón called the stream ''Río Santa María del Mar Dulce'', later shortened to ''Mar Dulce'', literally, ''sweet sea'', because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, [[Francisco de Orellana]], was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the [[Andes]], to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Juru%C3%A1_River | Jurua]].

=== Exploration ===
[[File: The Marañon or Amazon River with the Mission of the Society of Jesus WDL1137.png|thumb|[[Samuel Fritz]]'s 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco]]

[[Gonzalo Pizarro]] set off in 1541 to explore east of [[Quito]] into the South American interior in search of ''[[El Dorado]]'', the "city of gold" and [[La Canela]], the "valley of [[cinnamon]]".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana Francisco de Orellana Francisco de Orellana (Spanish explorer and soldier)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503155124/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana |date=3 May 2009 }}. Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> He was accompanied by his second-in-command [[Francisco de Orellana]]. After {{convert|170|km|mi}}, the [[Coca River]] joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as [[Puerto Francisco de Orellana]]); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as ''Río de la Canela'' ("Cinnamon River") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.

De Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the [[Aguarico River|Aguarico]]) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating "noxious plants", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&nbsp; km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solimões, for a further {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542.

Regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (''Cinnamomum Verum'') is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family ''Lauraceae'') are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.

In 1560 another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the [[Orinoco River]], which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.

Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Teixeira]] was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectamazonas.org/brief-history-amazon-exploration|title=A Brief History of Amazon Exploration|last=Graham|first=Devon|publisher=Project Amazonas|accessdate=18 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725230550/http://www.projectamazonas.org/brief-history-amazon-exploration|archive-date=25 July 2014}}</ref>

From 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian ''[[bandeirante]]'' [[António Raposo Tavares]] led an expedition from [[São Paulo]] overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over {{cvt|10000|km|0}}.

In what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several [[colonization |colonial]] and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the [[Urarina]]. In the late 1600s Czech Jesuit Father [[Samuel Fritz]], an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the [[Marañón River]] must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Marañón "has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called [[Lawriqucha|Lauricocha]], near [[Huánuco]]." Fritz reasoned that the Marañón is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th–19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Marañón was generally considered the source of the Amazon.<ref name = "Dias">{{Cite web |url=http://redebrasilis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camila-L.-Dias-Jesuit-Maps-and-Political-Discourse-muse.pdf |title=Camila Loureiro Dias, "Maps and Political Discourse: The Amazon River of Father Samuel Fritz," ''The Americas,'' Volume 69, Number 1, July 2012, pp. 95–116. |access-date=15 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001180423/http://redebrasilis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camila-L.-Dias-Jesuit-Maps-and-Political-Discourse-muse.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Cabanagem]] revolt (1835–1840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30 to 40% of the population of [[Grão-Pará Province|Grão-Pará]], estimated at 100,000 people, died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm| title= Cabanagem (1835–1840): Uma das mais sangrentas rebeliões do período regencial | work= [[Universo Online]] Liçao de Casa | author= Renato Cancian | accessdate= 12 November 2007 | language= pt | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102212940/http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm| archive-date= 2 November 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds were Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as [[Tabatinga]], on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}

On 6 September 1850, Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mauá ([[Irineu Evangelista de Sousa]]) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the "Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the ''Monarca'' ('Monarch'), the ''Cametá'', the ''Marajó'' and the ''Rio Negro''.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Sobre Escravos e Regatões|url=http://www.snh2015.anpuh.org/resources/anais/39/1439329194_ARQUIVO_ANPUHSobreescravoseregatoes1.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2015|language=pt}}</ref>

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purús, and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}

On 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the [[upper Amazon]] basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}

Thanks in part to the [[mercantile]] development associated with [[steamboat]] navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for [[natural rubber]], the Peruvian city of [[Iquitos]] became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.<ref>Historia del Peru, Editorial Lexus. p. 93.</ref> During the [[rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as [[typhus]] and [[malaria]], killed 40,000 native Amazonians.<ref>La Republica Oligarchic. Editorial Lexus 2000 p. 925.</ref>

The first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purús and many other tributaries,{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} such as the Marañón, to ports as distant as [[Nauta]], Peru.

By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were [[Natural rubber|India-rubber]], [[cacao bean]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of minor importance, such as [[Fur|pelts]] and exotic forest produce ([[resin]]s, barks, woven [[hammock]]s, prized bird [[feather]]s, live animals) and extracted goods, such as [[lumber]] and gold.

=== 20th-century development ===

Since colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.

Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than {{convert|65|km2}}, excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=790}} This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president [[Getúlio Vargas]], with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.

In the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the "economic miracle" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of "Operation Amazon", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6k-6rsy7toC&q=operation+amazon+1966&pg=PA32|title=The Economics of Deforestation in the Amazon: Dispelling the Myths|last=Campari|first=João S.|year=2005|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9781845425517|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130235652/https://books.google.com/books?id=P6k-6rsy7toC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=operation+amazon+1966&source=bl&ots=d21-mSw_X5&sig=8GsKcFxm_B_EP5NM6QwdcYl_Rk8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd_aLz3-_SAhWKPBQKHYl7BCsQ6AEIXTAP#v=onepage&q=operation%20amazon%201966&f=false|archive-date=30 November 2017}}</ref>

However, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Programme. A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the "land without people" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]] (''Transamazônica'').<ref name=":0" />

The Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as [[BR-319]] (Manaus-[[Porto Velho]]), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.

Many settlements grew along the road from Brasília to Belém with the highway and National Integration Programme, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrLl2LxX488C|title=The Fate of the Forest: Developers, Destroyers, and Defenders of the Amazon, Updated Edition|last1=Hecht|first1=Susanna B.|last2=Cockburn|first2=Alexander|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-02-263-2272-8|language=en}}</ref>

From that point, Quebrada [[Carhuasanta]] emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms Río Lloqueta which becomes Río Hornillos and eventually joins the [[Apurímac River|Río Apurímac]].

A 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in ''[[Area (journal)|Area]]'', a peer-reviewed journal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the [[Mantaro River|Río Mantaro]] drainage.<ref name="ContosTripcevich" /> A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Junín to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the [[International Scale of River Difficulty|class IV–V]] nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower "Abyss" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80&nbsp;km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80&nbsp;km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.geographydirections.com/2014/04/03/redefining-the-upper-amazon-river|last=Contos|first=James (Rocky)|title=Redefining the Upper Amazon River|website=Geography Directions|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=15 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152411/https://blog.geographydirections.com/2014/04/03/redefining-the-upper-amazon-river/|archive-date=12 March 2017}}</ref>

After about {{cvt|700|km|mi}}, the Apurímac then joins Río Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the [[Urubamba River]] to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by [[floodplain]]. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Marañón, some {{cvt|1600|km|mi}}, the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous [[Amazon rainforest]].

=== The Upper Amazon or Solimões ===
[[File:Amazonas, Iquitos - Leticia, Kolumbien (11472506936).jpg|thumb|Amazon River near [[Iquitos]], Peru]]
Although the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the ''[[Solimões]] das Águas''. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the ''Solimões'' and its tributaries, are called the "Upper Amazon".

The Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Perú. It has a series of major tributaries in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], some of which flow into the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] and [[Ucayali]], and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]], [[Caquetá River|Caquetá]], [[Vaupés River|Vaupés]], [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Guainía]], [[Morona]], [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], Nucuray, Urituyacu, [[Chambira River|Chambira]], [[Tigre River|Tigre]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]].

At some points the river divides into [[anabranch]]es, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral [[Stream channel|channels]], all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat ''igapó'' lands, which are never more than {{convert|5|m|ft}} above low river, into many islands.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=788}}

From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}

=== The Lower Amazon ===
[[File:Manaus Encontro das aguas 10 2006 103 8x6.jpg|thumb|[[Meeting of Waters]]; the [[confluence]] of [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (blue) and [[Solimões|Rio Solimões]] (sandy) near [[Manaus]], Brazil]]
[[File:Rio Solimoes and Rio Negro.JPG|thumb|Water samples of the [[Solimões]] (left) and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (right)]]

The Lower Amazon begins where the darkly coloured waters of the Rio Negro meet the sandy coloured [[Solimões|Rio Solimões]] (the upper Amazon), and for over {{cvt|6|km|0}} these waters [[Meeting of Waters|run side by side without mixing]]. At Óbidos, a bluff {{cvt|17|m|ft}} above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a [[bay|gulf]] of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.

Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above Óbidos city is about {{convert|5000000|km2|sqmi}}, and, below, only about {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi}} (around 20%), exclusive of the {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi}} of the Tocantins basin.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} The [[Tocantins River]] enters the southern portion of the [[Amazon delta]].

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about {{convert|240|km|mi}} from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as [[Monte Alegre, Pará|Monte Alegre]]. These hills are cut down to a kind of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] which lies between them and the river.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=788}}

On the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]] in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.{{sfn|Church|1911|pp=788–89}}

=== Mouth ===
[[File:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south]]
[[Belém]] is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The [[Pará River|Pará]] and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called ''furos'' near the town of [[Breves, Pará|Breves]]; between them lies [[Marajó]], the world's largest combined river/sea island.

If the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon [[estuary]] is some {{convert|325|km|mi}} wide.<ref name=guo /> In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of [[Pracuúba]] in the Brazilian state of [[Amapá]], to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of [[Curuçá]], in the state of [[Pará]].

A more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the [[Araguari River (Amapá)|Araguari River]] to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over {{convert|180|km|mi}}. If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about {{convert|15|km|mi}}.

The plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.<ref name="auto" />

=== Lack of bridges ===
There are no [[bridge]]s across the entire width of the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon_(river).html|title= Amazon (river)|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia|edition=2007|accessdate=12 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306073804/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon_%28river%29.html|archive-date=6 March 2008}}</ref> This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a [[ferry]]. The [[Manaus Iranduba Bridge]] linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.

While debate as to whether the Amazon or [[Nile|the Nile]] is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between {{convert|6275|and|7025|km|mi}} long.<ref name=liu-etal-river-length /> It is often said to be "at least" {{convert|6400|km|mi}} long.<ref name=britannica-amazon /> The Nile is reported to be anywhere from {{convert|5499|to|7088|km|mi}}.<ref name=liu-etal-river-length /> Often it is said to be "about" {{convert|6650|km|mi}} long.<ref name=britannica-nile>{{cite encyclopedia |title= Nile River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year= 2010 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415347/Nile-River |accessdate= 3 August 2010 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130526/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415347/Nile-River |archive-date= 29 April 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also [[List of rivers by length]]).<ref name=liu-etal-river-length /><ref name=river-source />

Using [[Nevado Mismi]], which in 2001 was labelled by the [[National Geographic Society]] as the Amazon's source, these scientists made new calculations of the Amazon's length. They calculated the Amazon's length as {{convert|6992|km|mi}}. Using the same techniques, they calculated the length of the Nile as {{convert|6853|km|mi}}, which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of ''Canal do Sul'' and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the ''Río Pará'' bay in its entire length.<ref name=britannica-amazon-length /><ref name=inpe /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070619-amazon-river.html |last=Roach |first=John |title=Amazon Longer Than Nile River, Scientists Say |date=18 June 2007 |website=National Geographic |accessdate=2 August 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815112238/http://animal.discovery.com/fish/river-monsters/candiru-catfish/ |archive-date=15 August 2012  }}</ref> [[Guido Gelli]], director of science at the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network [[Rede Globo|Globo]] in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world. However, other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001, and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists. A [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article, published in 2009, concluded that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of {{cvt|7088|km|mi}} for the Nile and {{cvt|6575|km|mi}} for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.<ref name="liu-etal-river-length" />
Therefore, as of 2018 the length of both Amazon and Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.<ref name=britannica-amazon /><ref name=britannica-amazon-length />

== Watershed ==
{{Main|Amazon basin}}
The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately {{convert|7050000|sqkm|sqmi|0}}. It drains from west to east, from [[Iquitos]] in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north latitude]] to [[20th parallel south|20 degrees south latitude]]. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-[[Andes|Andean]] plateau, just a short distance from the [[Pacific Ocean]].{{sfn|Church|1911|p=784}}

The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than {{convert|9|m|ft}}, flooding the surrounding forests, known as ''[[Freshwater swamp forest|várzea]]'' ("flooded forests"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.<ref name=wwf>{{cite web |title= Amazon River and Flooded Forests |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] |url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/g200/g147.html |accessdate= 4 August 2010 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312074026/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/g200/g147.html |archive-date= 12 March 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> In an average [[dry season]], {{convert|110000|km2}} of land are water-covered, while in the [[wet season]], the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to {{convert|350000|km2}}.<ref name=guo>{{cite book |last= Guo |first= Rongxing |title= Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook |year= 2006 |publisher= Nova |isbn= 978-1-60021-445-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z5Le627xQLgC&pg=PA44 |page= 44 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151015200335/https://books.google.com/books?id=z5Le627xQLgC&pg=PA44 |archive-date= 15 October 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to {{convert|300000|m3/s|cuft/s}} in the rainy season, with an average of {{convert|209000|m3/s|cuft/s}} from 1973 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/colloques2/42687.pdf|last=Molinier M|display-authors=et al|title=Hydrologie du Bassin de l'Amazone|date=22 November 1993|accessdate=16 July 2017|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007151725/http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/colloques2/42687.pdf|archive-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's [[freshwater|fresh water]] entering the ocean.<ref name=wwf /> The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about {{convert|400|km|mi}} long and between {{convert|100|and|200|km|mi}} wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the [[salinity]] and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to {{cvt|2500000|km2}} in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.<ref name=smith />

The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's [[sediment]]s out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.<ref name=Penn />

There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the [[Orinoco]] basins, the so-called [[Casiquiare canal]]. The Casiquiare is a river [[distributary]] of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]].

=== Flooding ===
[[File:Amazon-river-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] satellite image of a flooded portion of the river]]
Not all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.

The depth of the Amazon between [[Manacapuru]] and [[Óbidos, Brazil|Óbidos]] has been calculated as between {{convert|20|to|26|m|ft}}. At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about {{convert|24|m|ft}} above [[Sea level|mean sea level]]. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.<ref name=junk>{{cite book |last= Junk |first= Wolfgang J. |title= The Central Amazon Floodplain: Ecology of a Pulsing System |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-540-59276-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1eMWTwL4rbEC&pg=PA44 |page= 44 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150908072225/https://books.google.com/books?id=1eMWTwL4rbEC&pg=PA44 |archive-date= 8 September 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages {{convert|20|to|50|m|ft}}, in some places as much as {{convert|100|m|ft}}.<ref name=whitton>{{cite book |last= Whitton |first= B.A. |title= River Ecology |year= 1975 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-03016-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q5H_1PtdvrAC&pg=PA462 |page= 462 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150915133552/https://books.google.com/books?id=q5H_1PtdvrAC&pg=PA462 |archive-date= 15 September 2015 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to [[Manaus]], {{convert|1500|km|mi}} upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels of {{convert|3000|or|9000|t}} and {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} [[Draft (hull)|draft]] can reach as far as [[Iquitos]], Peru, {{convert|3600|km|mi}} from the sea.

Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the [[Pongo de Manseriche]], just above Achual Point in Peru.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=788}}

Annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting [[Undular bore#In hydraulics|undular]] [[tidal bore]] is called the ''[[pororoca]]'', with a leading wave that can be up to {{convert|25|ft|m|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} high and travel up to {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} inland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Environmental Geology: Facing the Challenges of Our Changing Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFTxRdqBZCYC&pg=PA110|pages=110–11|first=Jon|last=Erickson|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2014|accessdate=25 March 2016|isbn=9781438109633|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208120955/https://books.google.com/books?id=TFTxRdqBZCYC&pg=PA110|archive-date=8 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|date=1982|first=David K.|last=Lynch|title=Tidal Bores|volume=247|issue=4|page=146|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1082-146|bibcode=1982SciAm.247d.146L|url=http://www.thulescientific.com/TidalBores.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328090911/http://thulescientific.com/TidalBores.pdf|archive-date=28 March 2016}}</ref>

== Geology ==
The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the [[Miocene]] epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early [[Pleistocene]].

The proto-Amazon during the [[Cretaceous]] flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western [[Gondwana]]. 80 million years ago, the two continents split.  Fifteen million years ago, the main [[tectonic uplift]] phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] underneath the [[South American Plate]]. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and [[Guayana Shield|Guyana]] bedrock shields,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/|title=The Amazon Rainforest|website=Mongabay|access-date=2020-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827231405/https://rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Eleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the [[sandstone]] from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During [[glacial period]]s, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the world's second largest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.<ref>{{cite journal|first1= J. |last1= Figueiredo |first2= C. |last2= Hoorn |first3= P. |last3= van der Ven |first4= E. |last4= Soares |title= Late Miocene onset of the Amazon River and the Amazon deep-sea fan: Evidence from the Foz do Amazonas Basin |journal= Geology |year= 2009 |volume= 37 |issue= 7 |pages= 619–22 |doi= 10.1130/g25567a.1 |bibcode= 2009Geo....37..619F }}</ref>

The [[tucuxi]] (''Sotalia fluviatilis''), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The [[Amazonian manatee]] (''Trichechus inunguis''), also known as "seacow", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into salt water. It is classified as vulnerable by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/27405-manatees.html|title=Manatees: Facts About Sea Cows|work=Live Science|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617115739/https://www.livescience.com/27405-manatees.html|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Microbiota ====
Freshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, [[metagenomics]] has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.<ref name="amazonMetagenome">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghai R, Rodriguez-Valera F, McMahon KD |title=Metagenomics of the water column in the pristine upper course of the Amazon river |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e23785 |year=2011 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023785 |pmid=21915244 |pmc=3158796 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...623785G |display-authors=etal }}</ref> The most important microbes in the Amazon River are [[Actinobacteria]], [[Alphaproteobacteria]], [[Betaproteobacteria]], [[Gammaproteobacteria]] and [[Crenarchaeota]].
