The '''Australian Open''' is a [[tennis]] tournament held annually over the last fortnight of January at [[Melbourne Park]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia. The tournament is the first of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis events held each year, preceding the [[French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles; junior's championships; and wheelchair, legends, and exhibition events. Prior to 1988, it was played on [[grass court]]s, but since then three types of [[hardcourt]] surfaces have been used: green-coloured [[Rebound Ace]] up to 2007, blue [[Plexicushion]] from 2008 to 2019, and blue [[GreenSet]] since 2020.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/australian-open-court-surface-is-speeding-up/2007/11/19/1195321694990.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Stathi | last=Paxinos | title=Australian Open court surface is speeding up | date=20 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2019/07/26/greenset-worldwide-new-official-court-surface-supplier|title= GreenSet Worldwide New Official Court Surface Supplier|author=Tennis Australia|location=Melbourne|date=26 July 2019|accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref>

It was also the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, [[Rod Laver Arena]], [[Melbourne Arena]] and the refurbished [[Margaret Court Arena]] equipped with retractable roofs.

==History==

The Australian Open is managed by [[Tennis Australia]], formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), and was first played at the [[Albert Cricket Ground|Warehouseman's Cricket Ground]] in Melbourne in November [[1905 Australasian Championships|1905]]. This facility is now known as the Albert Reserve Tennis Centre and was a [[grass court]].<ref name=jazzsports>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzsports.com/tennis-odds-grand-slam-events/australian-open-tennis-odds/australian-open-tennis-history.php |title=Australian Tennis Open History |publisher=Jazzsports |accessdate=22 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130004049/http://www.jazzsports.com/tennis-odds-grand-slam-events/australian-open-tennis-odds/australian-open-tennis-history.php |archivedate=30 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The tournament was first known as the Australasian Championships. It became the Australian Championships in 1927. Then, in 1969, it became the Australian Open.<ref name=OfficialHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history.html |title=History of the Australian Open&nbsp;– the Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific |author=Tristan Foenander |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=22 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120114020/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history.html |archivedate=20 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Since 1905, the Australian Open has been staged in five Australian cities: [[Melbourne]] (55 times), [[Sydney]] (17 times), [[Adelaide]] (14 times), [[Brisbane]] (7 times), [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (3 times), and two New Zealand cities: [[Christchurch]] ([[1906 Australasian Championships|1906]]) and [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] ([[1912 Australasian Championships|1912]]).<ref name=OfficialHist /> Though started in 1905, the tournament was not designated as being a major championship until 1924, by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) at a 1923 meeting.

In 1972, it was decided to stage the tournament in [[Melbourne]] each year because it attracted the biggest patronage of any Australian city.<ref name=jazzsports /> The tournament was played at the [[Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club]] from 1972 until its move to the new [[Melbourne Park]] complex in 1988.

The new facilities at Melbourne Park (formerly Flinders Park) were envisaged to meet the demands of a tournament that had outgrown Kooyong's capacity. The move to Melbourne Park was an immediate success, with a 90 percent increase in attendance in 1988 (266,436) on the previous year at Kooyong (140,000).<ref name=TheAge>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23049738-5015682,00.html |title=Open began as Aussie closed shop |publisher=[[news.com.au]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Frank Cook |date=14 February 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201114912/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C23049738-5015682%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of Australia's geographic remoteness, very few foreign players entered this tournament in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the trip by ship from Europe to Australia took about 45 days. The first tennis players who came by boats were the US [[Davis Cup]] players in November 1946.<ref name=TheAge/> Even inside the country, many players could not travel easily. When the tournament was held in Perth, no one from Victoria or New South Wales crossed by train, a distance of about {{Convert|3000|km|mi}} between the East and West coasts. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended and the tournament was won by a New Zealander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=100 |title=Anthony Frederick Wilding "Tony"|publisher=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=1 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182502/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=100 |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}</ref>

The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships suffered from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states, and New Zealand, had their own championships; the first being organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (later the Championship of Victoria).<ref name=tennis.com.au>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&pageId=878 |title=History of Tennis&nbsp;– From humble beginnings |publisher=[[Tennis Australia]] |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131194530/http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&pageId=878 |archivedate=31 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In those years, the best two players&nbsp;– Australian [[Norman Brookes]] (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander [[Anthony Wilding]]&nbsp;– almost did not play this tournament. Brookes took part once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped to determine the best Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, [[William Larned]], [[Maurice McLoughlin]], [[Beals Wright]], [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]], [[Bill Tilden]], [[René Lacoste]], [[Henri Cochet]], [[Bobby Riggs]], [[Jack Kramer]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Pancho Gonzales]], [[Budge Patty]], and others, while Brookes, [[Ellsworth Vines]], [[Jaroslav Drobný]], came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as [[Manuel Santana]], [[Jan Kodeš]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Ilie Năstase]] (who only came once, when 35 years old) and [[Björn Borg]] came rarely or not at all.

Beginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the [[Milton Courts]] at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals who were not allowed to play the traditional circuit.<ref name=Ausstadiums>{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php |title=Milton Tennis Centre|publisher=Australian Stadiums|accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117043727/http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php| archivedate= 17 January 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed this championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, [[George MacCall]]'s [[National Tennis League]], which employed [[Rod Laver]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Andrés Gimeno]], Pancho Gonzales, [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Fred Stolle]], prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by [[Arthur Ashe]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23047855-5001023,00.html |title=Hewitt chases amazing slam win |publisher=[[news.com.au]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Nikki Tugwell |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201114907/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C23047855-5001023%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1983, [[Ivan Lendl]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Mats Wilander]] entered the tournament. Wilander won the singles title<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilandertribute.com/22.html |title=Australian Open 1983|author=Alan Trengove|publisher=wilandertribute.com |accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> and both his [[Davis Cup]] singles rubbers in the [[1983 Davis Cup#Final|Swedish loss to Australia]] at [[Kooyong Stadium|Kooyong]] shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10000700 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630131645/http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10000700 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2013 |title=World Group 1983 Final|publisher=[[Davis Cup]]|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> Following the 1983 Australian Open, the [[International Tennis Federation]] prompted the [[Tennis Australia|Lawn Tennis Association of Australia]] to change the site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a big event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21131668-5001023,00.html |title=Rebound Ace under review|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 January 2007|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as [[Rebound Ace]].<ref name="nyt2008">{{cite news|author1=Christopher Clarey|title=On the surface, Australian Open gets a new bounce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/sports/13iht-srtennis.5.9176593.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 January 2008}}</ref> Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts.

The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer.<ref name="nyt2008"/> This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to [[DecoTurf]], the surface used by the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2008/01/28/story7.html|title=Tennis court surfacer serves up two major deals|work=Boston Business Journal|date=28 January 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Rafael Nadal Vs Philipp Kohlschreiber (4309085696).jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Nadal]] vs [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]] at the 2010 Australian Open]]
Before the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in particular in the early years because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976&nbsp;– January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players. From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant no tournament was organized in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed. However, some top players, including [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]], have said that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, thus preventing players from reaching their best form, and expressed a desire to shift it to February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24922806-3162,00.html|title=Rafael Nadal keen to call time on early slam|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|date=17 January 2009|accessdate=18 September 2009 | first=Leo | last=Schlink}}</ref> Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside the summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures.

In 2008 [[New South Wales]] authorities made clear their desire to bid for hosting rights to the tournament once Melbourne's contract expired in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sydney plans Australian Open bid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7665088.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=11 October 2008}}</ref> The proposal met a scathing response from Wayne Kayler-Thomson, the head of the Victorian Events Industry Council, who labelled it "disappointing that NSW cannot be original and seek their own events instead of trying to cannibalise other Australian cities."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Cameron Houston|author2=Jason Dowling|title=NSW in negotiations to transfer Open from Melbourne|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw-in-negotiations-to-transfer-open-from-melbourne-20081010-4ydk.html|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 October 2008}}</ref> The prospect of moving the tournament is unlikely as over the following years the [[Melbourne Park]] precinct was upgraded with enhanced facilities for players and spectators.

In December 2018, tournament organisers announced the Australian Open would follow the examples set by [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and introduce [[Tennis scoring system#Scoring a tiebreak game|tie-breaks]] in the final sets of men's and women's singles matches. Unlike Wimbledon and the US Open, which initiate conventional tie-breaks at 12-12 games and 6-6 games respectively, the Australian Open utilises a first to 10 points breaker at 6 games all.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/sports/tennis/australian-open-tiebreaker.html|title=Australian Open Will Begin Using Final-Set Tiebreaker|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, the tournament organisers decided to replace the official court manufacturer for [[GreenSet]] retaining the iconic blue cushioned acrylic hardcourt.

===Television coverage===
From 1973 to 2018, the [[Seven Network]] served as the host broadcaster of the Australian Open. In March 2018, it was announced that the [[Nine Network]] had acquired the rights to the tournament beginning in 2020, for a period of five years.

In Europe the tournament is broadcast on [[Eurosport]]. Other broadcasters in the region have included the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom, [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation|SRG]] in Switzerland, [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] in Netherlands and [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] in Serbia. In the United Kingdom, the BBC dropped its live coverage of the 2016 tournament just a month before the start due to budget cuts, leaving Eurosport as the exclusive live broadcaster.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Elsewhere, [[beIN Sports]] broadcasts it into the Middle East and Northern Africa, and SuperSport in Sub-Sahara Africa. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast on [[ESPN2]], [[ESPN3]] and the [[Tennis Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2013-australian-open-tv-schedule-on-espn2/|title=2013 Australian Open TV Schedule on ESPN|work=sportsmediawatch.com}}</ref> The championship matches are televised live on ESPN.  While it is broadcast on [[ESPN International]] in Central and Latin America. It is broadcast on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] in Canada.

In Asia-Pacific region, the tournament is broadcast on five television networks in China, including national broadcaster CCTV, provincial networks Beijing TV, Shanghai TV and Guangdong TV and English language Star Sports, as well as online on IQIYI Sports. Elsewhere in the region, it is broadcast in Japan by national broadcaster NHK, and pay-TV network WOWOW. In the Indian Sub-continent, Sony Six has broadcast since 2015 and, in the rest of Asia, it is broadcast on [[Fox Sports Asia]] through to 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/fox-sports-asia-lands-australian-open-rights-until-2021|title=Fox Sports Asia lands Australian Open rights until 2021|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>[[File:Rod Laver Arena panorama January 2020.jpg|thumb|400px|Panorama of [[Rod Laver Arena]] during the 2020 Australian Open]]

===Attendance===
The following record of attendance begins in 1987, when the tournament moved from being held in December to in January (the immediate preceding tournament was December 1985). 1987 was the last year that the Kooyong Tennis Club hosted the tournament; since 1988 it has been held at Melbourne Park. The average growth rate over the period covered below is more than 7%.

==Courts==

The Australian Open is played at [[Melbourne Park]], which is located in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct]]; the event moved to this site in 1988. Currently three of the courts have retractable roofs, allowing play to continue during rain and extreme heat. As of 2017, spectators can also observe play at Show Courts 2 and 3, which have capacities of 3,000 each,<ref name="australianopen1">{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/a_z_guide.html|title=Event Guide – Australian Open Tennis Championships 2014 – Official Site by IBM|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> as well as at Courts 4–15, 19 and 20 with the aid of temporary seating grandstands of capacity anywhere from 50 to 2,500.<ref>{{cite web| title = Accessibility Map | url = http://www.tennis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EO-16-0005-Accessibility-Map_No-Crops_FA.pdf | accessdate =16 January 2017 | publisher = Tennis.com}}</ref>

Construction of a new 5,000 seat capacity stadium began in 2019 as part of a $271 million redevelopment of the precinct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/04/23/melbourne-gets-new-5000-seat-tennis-arena|title=Melbourne gets new 5000-seat tennis arena|work=SBS News|date=23 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Between 2008 and 2019, all of the courts used during the Australian Open were hard courts with [[Plexicushion]] acrylic surfaces (though Melbourne Park does have eight practice clay courts these are not used for the tournament). This replaced the [[Rebound Ace]] surface used from the opening of Melbourne Park. The ITF rated the surface's speed as medium.<ref>{{cite web| title = About Court Pace Classification | url = http://www.itftennis.com/technical/courts/classified-surfaces/about-court-pace-classification.aspx | accessdate =16 January 2017 | publisher = ITF}}</ref> In 2020, the courts were switched to [[GreenSet]], though retained their distinctive blue appearance.

==Records==
Unlike the other three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, which became open in 1968, the Australian tournament opened to professionals in 1969. Thus, the records here break at the 1969 tournament.
