'''Virgilio Olivar Garcillano''' (born '''''c.'''''1948) also known as '''''Garci''''', is a former official of the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] who allegedly was involved in [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s alleged [[electoral fraud]] in the [[Hello Garci scandal]].

Garcillano also momentarily was seen in [[Surigao City]], particularly in a beach resort under heavy guard. An arrest warrant was issued to his last known address in [[Cagayan de Oro City]] but his father-in-law refused to sign it, but it was considered served. The [[Philippine National Police]] and [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] were requested by the [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] to locate Garcillano to respond to allegations in Congress.

Independent sources confirmed that Virgilio Garcillano took a flight from [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]] last July 14, to [[Singapore]], contrary to denials by Philippine authorities. He spent a night in [[Singapore]], and then flew for [[London]].

The management of the Bureau of Immigration, Air Transportation Office, and other government agencies were blamed for the escape of Garcillano.

==Doble Controversy==
An insider of [[Smart Communications]] worked with the ISAFP (Intelligence Service, Armed Forces of the Philippines) in wiretapping political leaders during the 2004 elections, and Smart admitted it was possible that an employee coordinated with ISAFP. Vidal Doble said two of his former superiors at the "''Project Lighthouse''" operation – Col. Paul Sumayo and Capt. Frederick Rebong – "''coordinated''" with a "''recruit''" and contact inside Smart. Ramon Isberto of Smart, said - "''This first came out two to three years ago. The company has not participated in any efforts to monitor conversations.''" Speechless wiretappers: Doble said he and everybody else involved in "Project Lighthouse" were shocked to hear President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] speak with former Virgilio Garcillano about the rigging of poll results. Doble said "Project Lighthouse" had 14 members divided into four teams - "''All of the teams knew about the conversation of PGMA (Arroyo) and commissioner Garcillano''."  Doble revealed those who gave the order to launch "Project Lighthouse": Western Command (Wescom) chief Vice Admiral Tirso Danga, former deputy chief of staff for intelligence; Brigadier Gen. Marlou Quevedo, former ISAFP chief; Army Col. Allen Capuyan, former head of the ISAFP's special operations group; and "''down the line''" the project "''group commander''" Col. Sumayo; Capt. Rebong; and Capt. Lindsay Rex Sagge.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/57157/Doble-Hello-Garci-wiretap-ops-done-through-Smart-mole  GMA NEWS.TV, Doble's ‘Hello Garci’ wiretap ops done through Smart mole]</ref>
