A part of his education was at the city's Ranvir Rananjay Post-Graduate College and he gained an MA in [[Hindi]] and a PhD from [[Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University|Awadh University]].<ref name="15thLokSabha">{{cite web |url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=3929|title=Fifteenth Lok Sabha Members Bioprofile |publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>

==Political career==
Singh had lent support to [[Sanjay Gandhi]] when that member of the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] had chosen to contest the [[Amethi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Amethi constituency]] in the [[1980 Indian general election|elections of 1980]]. The Amethi area has strong links to the Nehru-Gandhi family and at that time the neighbouring constituency of [[Rae Bareli (Lok Sabha constituency)|Rae Bareli]] was held by Sanjay's mother, [[Indira Gandhi]]. He subsequently became a friend of [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who succeeded Sanjay as the representative for Amethi.<ref name="TOI20030821" />

His association with the Gandhi family "shot [him] into political limelight", according to ''[[The Times of India]]''. However, Singh left the Gandhi-led [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) party in 1988 and joined [[Janata Dal]], which was led by a relative of his first wife. Despite a general mood favouring Janata Dal, Singh's attempt to oust Rajiv Gandhi in the [[1989 Indian general election]] did not reflect it and he was heavily defeated by the incumbent. He later changed his allegiance to that of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and in the [[1998 Indian general election|1998 Lok Sabha elections]] he won the Amethi constituency seat.<ref name="TOI20030821" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/sep/10flip.htm  |first=T.

Although Singh stood again as the BJP candidate in the [[1999 Indian general election|elections of 1999]], on that occasion he was faced with a challenge from the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, [[Sonia Gandhi|Sonia]], who played heavily on her family's contributions to the area.

==Personal life==
===Murder of Syed Modi===
[[Syed Modi]], a [[badminton]] player who had won numerous national and international titles, was shot dead on 28 July 1988 in Lucknow. The murder attracted worldwide attention. There were suggestions that Modi's wife, Ameeta, was involved in a relationship with Singh, who was a close friend of the couple and at whose house they had married. In late August, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) launched a search of Singh's house.<ref name="NYT19880828">{{Cite news|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DF123CF93BA1575BC0A96E948260|title = India Murder Scandal Mixes Sex and Politics|date = 28 August 1988|newspaper = The New York Times|accessdate = 1 March 2012|author = Bernard Weinraub}}</ref> The investigation was urged upon the CBI by the government of Uttar Pradesh and in November 1988<!--yes, the source says 1998 but it is a clear typo-->, Ameeta Modi, Singh and another politician, [[Akhilesh Kumar Singh]], were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Four others were charged with the murder itself. Subsequently, Modi, Sanjay Singh and Akilesh Singh successfully challenged the charges laid against them, resulting in the charges against Modi and Sanjay Singh being dropped in September 1990 and those against Akilesh Singh following the same course in 1996. The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] upheld the rulings of the lower courts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Syed Modi case closed, motive unclear |first=Ravi Singh |last=Sisodiya |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-23/india/28186767_1_cbi-probe-syed-modi-chargesheet |date=21 August 2009|newspaper=The Times of India |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>

===Assault on Sanjay Singh===
The campaign for November 1989 elections was blighted by large scale violence. Sanjay Singh, campaigning for Janata Dal, was shot at, and had to be hospitalized in serious condition.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Awasthi |first1=Dilip |title=Both Rajiv Gandhi's and V.P.

===Disputed divorce and disputed remarriage===
Singh claims to be married to Modi's widow, Ameeta, but his first wife, Garima, has contested the legitimacy of the marriage. Both the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court of India have declared the alleged mutual divorce between herself and Singh in 1995 to be null and void<ref>{{cite news |work=India Today |title=Allahabad High Court invalidates former Union minister Sanjay Singh-Amita Modi marriage |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19960615-allahabad-high-court-invalidates-former-union-minister-sanjay-singh-amita-modi-marriage-835067-1996-06-15 |accessdate=21 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=Indian Kanoon |title=Sanjay Singh vs Garima Singh on 3 March, 1998 |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/672141/ |accessdate=21 July 2020}}</ref>. Singh has accepted the court rulings but denies her claim that they were made because he arranged for an imposter to portray her in the divorce case. Despite the rulings, he maintains that Ameeta is his legally wedded wife.<ref name="outlook">[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Battle-Of-Amethi-II/291562 Battle Of Amethi, II], Outlook India.</ref>

===Inheritance dispute===
In 2014, the marital arrangements resulted in a public dispute regarding property inheritance. Singh and his wife, [[Ameeta Singh|Ameeta]], live at Bhupati Bhawan, a 450-year-old former royal palace in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, that Garima had to leave around the time of the now-voided divorce. In July 2014, Garima returned to claim the right of inheritance for her son and grandson which she felt was endangered because, she claims, Ameeta had been selling the properties as well as transferring them into the [[charitable trust]] headed by her.<ref name="ET">[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-20/news/54135405_1_syed-modi-amethi-palace-coup Royal feud: 50-year-old Bhupati Bhawan Palace in Amethi locked in inheritance battle], The Economic Times.</ref><ref name="HT">[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-new-squabble-at-amethi-domestic-troubles-of-sanjay-singh-enter-the-fray/article1-1252913.aspx The new squabble at Amethi: Domestic troubles of Sanjay Singh enter the fray], Hindustan Times.</ref>

On 25 July 2014, Garima Singh reached the palace along with her children. A row developed between her party and people guarding the building, news of which soon spread to nearby villages and attracted people who supported her and her eldest son, Anant Vikram Singh. A fight ensued.<ref name="Hindu">[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sanjay-singh-kids-locked-in-battle-over-amethi-palace/article6252949.ece Sanjay Singh, kids locked in battle over Amethi palace], The Hindu.</ref><ref name="intoday">[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amethi-maharaj-sanjay-singh-in-nasty-property-feud/1/374871.html Amethi maharaj Sanjay Singh in nasty property feud], India Today.</ref>

On 14 September 2014 Sanjay and Ameeta were about to enter the palace, where Garima and the children were now living, when clashes erupted between the opposing supporters. Police resorted to a baton charge to control the situation. Several people were severely injured, there were claims of police brutality<ref name="sify">[http://www.sify.com/mobile/news/amethi-clash-18-arrested-one-media-person-injured-news-national-ojosJhdffeejj.html Amethi clash: 18 arrested, one media person injured], Sify.</ref> and a policeman was killed.<ref name="DNA">[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-amethi-royal-dispute-gets-ugly-as-cop-dies-in-firing-2018700 Amethi royal dispute gets ugly as cop dies in firing], DNA India.</ref>

During the inheritance dispute, Anant Vikram Singh has demanded a further CBI inquiry into the killing of Syed Modi.<ref name="ET" />  Garima Singh and her children claim that the local administration has been working in tandem with Singh and continuously posed obstacles in their way to obtain justice.<ref name="outlook" />
