==Gases in Earth's atmosphere==
{{Main|Greenhouse effect|Atmosphere of Earth}}
===Non-greenhouse gases===
The major constituents of Earth's atmosphere, [[nitrogen]] ({{chem|N|2}})(78%), [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}})(21%), and [[argon]] (Ar)(0.9%), are not greenhouse gases because [[diatomic molecule|molecules containing two atoms of the same element]] such as {{chem|N|2}} and {{chem|O|2}} have no net change in the [[Molecular dipole moment|distribution of their electrical charges]] when they vibrate, and [[monatomic]] gases such as Ar do not have vibrational modes. Hence they are [[Selection rule#Vibrational spectra|almost totally unaffected]] by [[infrared|infrared radiation]]. Some molecules containing just two atoms of different elements, such as [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl), do absorb infrared radiation, but these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] or [[solubility]]. Therefore, they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and often are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases.

===Greenhouse gases===
[[File:Atmospheric Transmission.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=refer to caption and adjacent text|Atmospheric absorption and scattering at different [[wavelength]]s of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]]. The largest absorption band of [[carbon dioxide]] is not far from the maximum in the [[infrared|thermal emission]] from ground, and it partly closes the window of transparency of water; hence its major effect.]]{{see also|Global warming|Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere}}
Greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit [[thermal infrared|infrared radiation in the wavelength range emitted by Earth]].<ref name="IPCC AR4-SYR" /> Carbon dioxide (0.04%), nitrous oxide, methane and ozone are trace gases that account for almost 0.1% of Earth's atmosphere and have an appreciable greenhouse effect.

In order, the most abundant{{clarify|reason=Please quantify the atmospheric concentration of each of the listed greenhouse gases.|date=April 2019}} greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

* [[Water vapor]] ({{chem|H|2|O}})
* [[Carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}})
* [[Methane]] ({{chem|CH|4|}})
* [[Nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}})
* [[Ozone]] ({{chem|O|3|}})
* [[Chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs)
* [[Hydrofluorocarbons]] (includes [[HCFCs]] and HFCs)

Atmospheric concentrations are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound or absorption by bodies of water).<ref name="IPCC_WG1_AR4_Ch7">{{cite news |title= FAQ 7.1 |page= 14}} in {{harvp|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}</ref> The proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the "[[airborne fraction]]" (AF). The ''annual airborne fraction'' is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year's total emissions. As of 2006 the annual airborne fraction for {{CO2}} was about 0.45. The annual airborne fraction increased at a rate of 0.25&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.21% per year over the period 1959–2006.<ref name=Canadell2007>{{cite journal|author = Canadell, J.G. |author2=Le Quere, C. |author3=Raupach, M.R. |author4=Field, C.B. |author5=Buitenhuis, E.T. |author6=Ciais, P. |author7=Conway, T.J. |author8=Gillett, N.P. |author9=Houghton, R.A. |author10=Marland, G. | year =  2007| title =  Contributions to accelerating atmospheric {{CO2}} growth from economic activity, carbon intensity, and efficiency of natural sinks| journal =  Proc.

===Indirect radiative effects===

Some gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example, methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor). Oxidation of CO to {{CO2}} directly produces an unambiguous increase in [[radiative forcing]] although the reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from Earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of {{CO2}} ([[wavelength]] 15 microns, or [[wavenumber]] 667&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>). On the other hand, the single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much shorter wavelengths (4.7 microns, or 2145&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>), where the emission of radiant energy from Earth's surface is at least a factor of ten lower.  Oxidation of methane to {{CO2}}, which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous reduction in radiative absorption and emission since {{CO2}} is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane. However, the oxidations of CO and {{chem|CH|4}} are entwined since both consume OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of the total radiative effect includes both direct and indirect forcing.

A second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases. For example, the destruction of [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s (NMVOCs) in the atmosphere can produce ozone. The size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted.<ref name="forsteretal">{{cite book |url= https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg1/changes-in-atmospheric-constituents-and-radiative-forcing/|contribution=2.10.3 Indirect GWPs |title=Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing |series=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007| author=Forster, P.|accessdate=2012-12-02|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Methane has indirect effects in addition to forming {{CO2}}. The main chemical that reacts with methane in the atmosphere is the [[hydroxyl radical]] (OH), thus more methane means that the concentration of OH goes down. Effectively, methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect. The oxidation of methane can produce both ozone and water; and is a major source of water vapor in the normally dry [[stratosphere]]. CO and NMVOCs produce {{CO2}} when they are oxidized. They remove OH from the atmosphere, and this leads to higher concentrations of methane. The surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of CO is three times that of {{CO2}}.<ref name=maccartyetal>{{cite web|last=MacCarty|first=N.|title=Laboratory Comparison of the Global-Warming Potential of Six Categories of Biomass Cooking Stoves|url=http://www.scscertified.com/lcs/docs/Global_warming_full_9-6-07.pdf|publisher=Approvecho Research Center|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111144703/http://www.scscertified.com/lcs/docs/Global_warming_full_9-6-07.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2013}}</ref> The same process that converts NMVOCs to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone. [[Halocarbon]]s have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone. Finally, [[hydrogen]] can lead to ozone production and {{chem|CH|4}} increases as well as producing stratospheric water vapor.<ref name="forsteretal" />

===Contribution of clouds to Earth's greenhouse effect===
The major non-gas contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect, [[Cloud forcing|clouds]], also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on greenhouse gas radiative properties. Clouds are water droplets or [[ice crystal]]s suspended in the atmosphere.<ref name="kiehl197">{{cite journal| title=Earth's annual global mean energy budget| first=J.T.| last=Kiehl|author2=Kevin E.

The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame<ref name=TableOfWarmingPotentials5/> but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect has so far been smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime in the absence of additional carbon sequestration. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation. Shindell et al. (2005)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2004GL021900 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/methane.html |title=An emissions-based view of climate forcing by methane and tropospheric ozone |year=2005 |last1=Shindell |first1=Drew T. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |page=L04803 |bibcode=2005GeoRL..32.4803S |issue=4}}</ref> argues that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/methane.html |title=Methane's Impacts on Climate Change May Be Twice Previous Estimates |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

In addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s and [[perfluorocarbon]]s (see [[IPCC list of greenhouse gases]]). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, [[nitrogen trifluoride]] has a high [[global warming potential]] (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.<ref name="NF3">{{cite journal |last= Prather |first= Michael J. |author2=J Hsu |title= {{chem|NF|3}}, the greenhouse gas missing from Kyoto |journal= [[Geophysical Research Letters]] |volume=35 |pages=L12810 |year=2008 |doi=10.1029/2008GL034542 |bibcode=2008GeoRL..3512810P |issue= 12|url= https://escholarship.org/uc/item/45q10130 }}</ref>

===Proportion of direct effects at a given moment===
It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases.<ref name="kiehl197"/><ref name="realclimate.org"/> In addition, some gases, such as methane, are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Isaksen|first=Ivar S.A.|author2=Michael Gauss|author3=Gunnar Myhre|author4=Katey M.

If input of this gas into the box ceased, then after time <math>\tau</math>, its concentration would decrease by about 63%.

The atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the [[mean lifetime]].

[[Image:Annual greenhouse gas index (1980-2017).png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The radiative forcing (warming influence) of long-lived greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere is undergoing accelerating growth.

Earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun, reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as [[thermal radiation|heat]]. Earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy. If this [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]] is shifted, Earth's surface becomes warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of changes in global climate.<ref name="epa ggas">{{cite web| year = 2016| publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)| title =  Climate Change Indicators in the United States - Greenhouse Gases |url = https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/greenhouse-gases}}.</ref> 

A number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere.<ref name="epa ggas"/> As [[#Atmospheric lifetime|explained above]], some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long period. [[Radiative forcing]] quantifies (in Watts per square meter) the effect of factors that influence Earth's energy balance; including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Positive radiative forcing leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative radiative forcing leads to cooling.<ref name="epa cforce">{{cite web| year = 2016| publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)| title =  Climate Change Indicators in the United States - Climate Forcing| url = https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-climate-forcing}}[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-08/documents/print_climate-forcing-2016.pdf]</ref>

The Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) is defined by atmospheric scientists at [[NOAA]] as the ratio of total direct radiative forcing due to long-lived and well-mixed greenhouse gases for any year for which adequate global measurements exist, to that present in year 1990.<ref name="butmon" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-annual-greenhouse-gas-index |title=Climate change: annual greenhouse gas index |publisher=[[NOAA]] Climate.gov science news & Information for a climate smart nation  |author=LuAnn Dahlman |date=14 August 2020}}</ref>  These radiative forcing levels are relative to those present in year 1750 (i.e. prior to the start of the [[industrial era]]).  1990 is chosen because it is the baseline year for the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and is the publication year of the [[IPCC First Assessment Report|first IPCC Scientific Assessment of Climate Change]].  As such, NOAA states that the AGGI "measures the commitment that (global) society has already made to living in a changing climate. It is based on the highest quality atmospheric observations from sites around the world. Its uncertainty is very low."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/ |title=The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) - An Introduction |publisher=[[NOAA]] Global Monitoring Laboratory/Earth System Research Laboratories |accessdate=5 September 2020 }}</ref>

===Global warming potential===
The [[global warming potential]] (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same '''mass''' of {{CO2}} and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a gas has a high (positive) [[radiative forcing]] but also a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale. Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than {{CO2}} its GWP will increase when the timescale is considered. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.

[[Methane]] has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 ± 3 years. The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|2007 IPCC report]] lists the GWP as 72 over a time scale of 20 years, 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years.<ref name="TableOfWarmingPotentials" /> A 2014 analysis, however, states that although methane's initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of {{CO2}}, because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime, after six or seven decades, the impact of the two gases is about equal, and from then on methane's relative role continues to decline.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/how-count-methane-emissions-0425|title=How to count methane emissions|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-08-20|first=David L. |last=Chandler}} Referenced paper is {{cite journal |first1=Jessika |last1=Trancik |first2=Morgan |last2=Edwards |url= https://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~shs/Methane/Methane%20and%20time.pdf |title= Climate impacts of energy technologies depend on emissions timing |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150116044523/https://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~shs/Methane/Methane%20and%20time.pdf |archive-date=16 January 2015 |journal= Nature Climate Change |volume =4 |date=25 April 2014 |issue=5 |page= 347 |doi=10.1038/nclimate2204 |hdl=1721.1/96138 |access-date=15 January 2015}}</ref> The decrease in GWP at longer times is because [[Atmospheric methane#Removal processes|methane]] is degraded to water and {{CO2}} through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

Aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons, most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial [[Holocene]], concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant, because the large natural sources and sinks roughly balanced. In the industrial era, human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf |title= Historical Overview of Climate Change Science – FAQ 1.3 Figure 1 |page=116}} in {{harvp|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/spm/sres-en.pdf |title=Chapter 3, IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, 2000 |publisher= Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |year=2000 |accessdate=2010-10-16 |url-status=live   }}</ref>

The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] compiled by the IPCC (AR4) noted that "changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system", and concluded that "increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century".<ref>{{cite web

Referred to by: {{harvp|Blasing|2013}}. Based on {{harvp|Blasing|2013}}: Pre-1750 concentrations of CH4,N2O and current concentrations of O3, are taken from Table 4.1 (a) of the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001. Following the convention of IPCC (2001), inferred global-scale trace-gas concentrations from prior to 1750 are assumed to be practically uninfluenced by human activities such as increasingly specialized [[agriculture]], [[land clearing]], and combustion of fossil fuels. Preindustrial concentrations of industrially manufactured compounds are given as zero. The short atmospheric lifetime of ozone (hours-days) together with the spatial variability of its sources precludes a globally or vertically homogeneous distribution, so that a fractional unit such as parts per billion would not apply over a range of altitudes or geographical locations. Therefore a different unit is used to integrate the varying concentrations of ozone in the vertical dimension over a unit area, and the results can then be averaged globally. This unit is called a [[Dobson Unit]] (D.U.), after G.M.B. Dobson, one of the first investigators of atmospheric ozone. A Dobson unit is the amount of ozone in a column that, unmixed with the rest of the atmosphere, would be 10 micrometers thick at standard temperature and pressure.

Since the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the concentrations of many of the greenhouse gases have increased. For example, the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280&nbsp;ppm to 415&nbsp;ppm, or 120&nbsp;ppm over modern pre-industrial levels.

==Role of water vapor==
[[File:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Increasing water vapor in the stratosphere at Boulder, Colorado]]

[[Water vapor]] accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect, between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when including clouds.<ref name="realclimate.org" /> Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales, such as near irrigated fields. Indirectly, human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a process known as water vapor feedback.<ref name="Held&Soden2000">{{Cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Isaac M.|last2=Soden|first2=Brian J.|date=November 2000|title=Water vapor feedback and global warming|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=441–475|citeseerx=10.1.1.22.9397|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.441|issn=1056-3466}}</ref> The atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature, from less than 0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass in saturated air at about 32&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Kimberly Masters|url=https://archive.org/details/environment00kimm_0|title=The environment: a revolution in attitudes|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=2005|isbn=978-0787690823|location=Detroit|chapter=The greenhouse effect and climate change|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DdtzAAAACAAJ}}|url-access=registration}}</ref> (See [[Relative humidity#Other important facts]].)

The average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days, compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as {{chem|CH|4}} and {{CO2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2010|title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2010|date=15 April 2012|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|page=1.4|language=en|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> Water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases. The [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]] establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures. This and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor (assuming that the [[relative humidity]] remains approximately constant; modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so). Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further warming and so is a "[[positive feedback]]" that amplifies the original warming. Eventually other earth processes{{which|date=October 2020}} offset these positive feedbacks, stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of Earth's water through a Venus-like [[runaway greenhouse effect]].<ref name="Held&Soden2000" />

Although [[CFCs]] are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the [[Montreal Protocol]], which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to [[ozone depletion]] rather than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes often are confused in the media. On 15 October 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] reached a legally binding accord to phase out [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs) in an amendment to the [[Montreal Protocol]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/climate-change-environmentalists-hail-deal-to-limit-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons |title= Climate change: global deal reached to limit use of hydrofluorocarbons |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |last2=Milman |first2=Oliver |website= [[The Guardian]] |language=en |access-date=2018-08-21 |last3=Vidal |first3= John |date=15 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37665529 |title=Climate change: 'Monumental' deal to cut HFCs, fastest growing greenhouse gases |work= BBC News |date=15 October 2016 |accessdate =15 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/world/africa/kigali-deal-hfc-air-conditioners.html |title= Nations, Fighting Powerful Refrigerant That Warms Planet, Reach Landmark Deal |work= New York Times |date=15 October 2016 |accessdate= 15 October 2016}}</ref>

===Greenhouse gases emissions by sector===
[[File:Global GHG Emissions by Sector 2016.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Chart showing 2016 global greenhouse gas emissions by sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earthcharts.org/emissions-sources/|title=Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=EarthCharts|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref> Percentages are calculated from estimated global emissions of all Kyoto Greenhouse Gases, converted to CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent quantities (GtCO<sub>2</sub>e).]]
{{Expand section|1=Information on emissions from other sectors|date=July 2013|small=no}}
"An important source of political opposition to measures aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) arises from concerns over their negative effects on the competitiveness of domestic firms."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Condon|first=Madison|last2=Ignaciuk|first2=Ada|date=2013-06-01|title=Border Carbon Adjustment and International Trade: A Literature Review|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/991|journal=OECD Trade and Environment Working Papers}}</ref>{{rp|4}} Global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to different sectors of the economy. This provides a picture of the varying contributions of different types of economic activity to global warming, and helps in understanding the changes required to mitigate climate change.

Manmade greenhouse gas emissions can be divided into those that arise from the combustion of fuels to produce energy, and those generated by other processes. Around two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the combustion of fuels.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?breakBy=sector&chartType=area&sectors=846,849,845,848,847,853,850,855,854,852,851|title=Climate Watch|website=www.climatewatchdata.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>

Energy may be produced at the point of consumption, or by a generator for consumption by others. Thus emissions arising from energy production may be categorised according to where they are emitted, or where the resulting energy is consumed. If emissions are attributed at the point of production, then electricity generators contribute about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>IEA, CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2018: Highlights (Paris: International Energy Agency, 2018) p.98</ref> If these emissions are attributed to the final consumer then 24% of total emissions arise from manufacturing and construction, 17% from transportation, 11% from domestic consumers, and 7% from commercial consumers.<ref>IEA, CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion 2018: Highlights (Paris: International Energy Agency, 2018) p.101</ref> Around 4% of emissions arise from the energy consumed by the energy and fuel industry itself.

The remaining third of emissions arise from processes other than energy production. 12% of total emissions arise from agriculture, 7% from land use change and forestry, 6% from industrial processes, and 3% from waste.<ref name=":0" /> Around 6% of emissions are fugitive emissions, which are waste gases released by the extraction of fossil fuels.
====Electricity generation====
{{See also|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}

Electricity generation emits over a quarter of global greenhouse gases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/march/tracking-the-decoupling-of-electricity-demand-and-associated-co2-emissions.html|title=March: Tracking the decoupling of electricity demand and associated CO2 emissions|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref> [[Coal-fired power station]]s are the single largest emitter, with over 10 Gt {{CO2}} in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/geco/emissions/|title=Emissions|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2019-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812215445/https://www.iea.org/geco/emissions/|archive-date=12 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although much less polluting than coal plants, natural [[gas-fired power plant]]s are also major emitters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/07/we-have-too-many-fossil-fuel-power-plants-to-meet-climate-goals/|title=We have too many fossil-fuel power plants to meet climate goals|date=2019-07-01|website=Environment|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>

====Tourism====
According to [[UNEP]], global [[tourism]] is closely linked to [[climate change]]. Tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Tourism accounts for about 50% of traffic movements. Rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5% of the production of {{CO2}}. The number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594&nbsp;million in 1996 to 1.6&nbsp;billion by 2020, adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unep.org/resourceefficiency/Business/SectoralActivities/Tourism/TheTourismandEnvironmentProgramme/FactsandFiguresaboutTourism/ImpactsofTourism/EnvironmentalImpacts/EnvironmentalImpactsofTourism-GlobalLevel/tabid/78777/Default.aspx |title= Environmental Impacts of Tourism – Global Level |publisher= UNEP}}</ref>

==== Trucking and haulage ====
{{update section|date=September 2019}}
The [[Road transport#Trucking and haulage|trucking and haulage industry]] plays a part in production of {{CO2}}, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.freightbestpractice.org.uk/download.aspx?pid=4738 |title=A Cheaper and More Efficient Freight Industry In and Out of the UK|work=freightbestpractice.org.uk |accessdate=13 September 2015}}{{dead link |date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
Average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling—in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas journey times have fallen by around a third.<ref>{{citation

==== Plastic ====
Plastic is produced mainly from [[fossil fuel]]s. Plastic manufacturing is estimated to use 8 percent of yearly global oil production. The EPA estimates{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} as many as five mass units of carbon dioxide are emitted for each mass unit of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) produced—the type of plastic most commonly used for beverage bottles,<ref name="Plastic Pollution and Climate Change">{{cite web |last1=Glazner |first1=Elizabeth |title=Plastic Pollution and Climate Change |url=http://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/pft/2015/11/17/plastic-pollution-and-climate-change |website=Plastic Pollution Coalition |publisher=Plastic Pollution Coalition |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref> the transportation produce greenhouse gases also.<ref name="What Is the Carbon Footprint of a Plastic Bottle?">{{cite web |last1= Blue|first1=Marie-Luise|title=What Is the Carbon Footprint of a Plastic Bottle? |url=https://sciencing.com/carbon-footprint-plastic-bottle-12307187.html |website=Sciencing |publisher=Leaf Group Ltd |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref> Plastic waste emits carbon dioxide when it degrades.

From the other side, if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink<ref>{{cite web|author=EPA|year=2012 |url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/waste/downloads/Landfilling.pdf|title= Landfilling}}</ref> although biodegradable plastics have caused [[methane emissions]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levis|first1=James W.|last2=Barlaz|first2=Morton A.|title=Is Biodegradability a Desirable Attribute for Discarded Solid Waste?

For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy, if the glass or metal package is [[disposable product|single-use]], of course.

In 2019 a new report "Plastic and Climate" was published. According to the report plastic will contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 850&nbsp;million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere in 2019. In current trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34&nbsp;billion tonnes by 2030. By 2050 plastic could emit 56&nbsp;billion tonnes of Greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14 percent of the Earth's remaining [[Emissions budget|carbon budget]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sweeping New Report on Global Environmental Impact of Plastics Reveals Severe Damage to Climate |url=https://www.ciel.org/news/plasticandclimate/ |website=Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref> The report says that only solutions which involve a [[Consumption (economics)|reduction in consumption]] can solve the problem, while others like biodegradable plastic, ocean cleanup, using renewable energy in plastic industry can do little, and in some cases may even worsen it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Plastic & Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet |date=May 2019 |publisher=Center for International Environmental Law, Environmental Integrity Project, FracTracker Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, 5 Gyres, and Break Free From Plastic. |pages=82–85 |url=https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>

==== Pharmaceutical industry ====
The [[pharmaceutical industry]] emitted 52 [[Tonne|megatonnes]] of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2015. This is more than the automotive sector. However this analysis used the combined emissions of conglomerates which produce pharmaceuticals as well as other products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belkhir |first1=Lotfi |title=Big Pharma emits more greenhouse gases than the automotive industry |url=https://theconversation.com/big-pharma-emits-more-greenhouse-gases-than-the-automotive-industry-115285 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref>

==== Aviation ====
Approximately 3.5% of the overall human impact on climate are from the aviation sector. The impact of the sector on climate in the late 20 years had doubled, but the part of the contribution of the sector in comparison to other sectors did not change because other sectors grew as well.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Jordan |title=Aviation Accounts for 3.5% of Global Warming Caused by Humans, New Research Says |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/aviation-emissions-global-warming-2647461303.html |accessdate=6 September 2020 |agency=Ecowatch |date=4 September 2020}}</ref>

==== Digital sector ====
In 2017 the [[Digital economy|digital sector]] produced 3.3% of global GHG emissions, above civil aviation (2%). In 2020 this is expected to reach 4%, the equivalent emissions of India in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Infographic: The Carbon Footprint of the Internet – ClimateCare|url=https://climatecare.org/infographic-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet/|access-date=2020-09-17|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The myth of the green cloud|url=https://www.eib.org/en/stories/digital-footprint|access-date=2020-09-17|website=European Investment Bank|language=en}}</ref>

==== Sanitation sector ====
[[Wastewater]] as well as sanitation systems are known to contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions (GHG) mainly through the breakdown of excreta during the treatment process. This results in the generation of methane gas, that is then released into the environment. Emissions from the sanitation and wastewater sector have been focused mainly on treatment systems, particularly treatment plants, and this accounts for the bulk of the [[carbon footprint]] for the sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dickin|first=Sarah|last2=Bayoumi|first2=Moustafa|last3=Giné|first3=Ricard|last4=Andersson|first4=Kim|last5=Jiménez|first5=Alejandro|date=2020-05-25|title=Sustainable sanitation and gaps in global climate policy and financing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-020-0072-8|journal=npj Clean Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1038/s41545-020-0072-8|issn=2059-7037}}</ref>

In as much as climate impacts from wastewater and sanitation systems present global risks, low-income countries experience greater risks in many cases.  In recent years, attention to adaptation needs within the sanitation sector is just beginning to gain momentum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=World Health Organisation|first=|date=1 July 2019|title=Climate, Sanitation and Health|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/sanitation-waste/sanitation/sanitation-and-climate-change20190813.pdf?ua=1|journal=WHO Discussion Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> 

===Regional and national attribution of emissions===
{{See also|Kyoto Protocol and government action}}

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|GHG emissions in the United States]] can be traced from different sectors.

There are several ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions, for example, see World Bank (2010)<ref name="world bank emissions data">

''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''2''' (3) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> include:
* Definition of measurement boundaries: Emissions can be attributed geographically, to the area where they were emitted (the territory principle) or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions. These two principles result in different totals when measuring, for example, electricity importation from one country to another, or emissions at an international airport.
* Time horizon of different gases: Contribution of a given greenhouse gas is reported as a {{CO2}} equivalent. The calculation to determine this takes into account how long that gas remains in the atmosphere. This is not always known accurately and calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information.
* What sectors are included in the calculation (e.g., energy industries, industrial processes, agriculture etc.): There is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data.
* The measurement protocol itself: This may be via direct measurement or estimation. The four main methods are the emission factor-based method, mass balance method, predictive emissions monitoring systems, and continuous emissions monitoring systems. These methods differ in accuracy, cost, and usability.

These measures are sometimes used by countries to assert various policy/ethical positions on climate change (Banuri et al., 1996, p.&nbsp;94).<ref name=banuri>{{cite book

The use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability, which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets. There are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the development of communication between different tools.<ref name="sapiens.revues.org"/>

Emissions may be measured over long time periods. This measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions. Cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (IEA, 2007, p.&nbsp;199).<ref name=iea>

The national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions. The national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.<ref name="holtz-eakin">{{cite journal| title = Stoking the fires? {{CO2}} emissions and economic growth |last=Holtz-Eakin |first=D. |year=1995 |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=85–101 |doi=10.1016/0047-2727(94)01449-X |s2cid=152513329 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w4248.pdf }}</ref>

Emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods. Emissions changes may, for example, be measured against a base year of 1990. 1990 was used in the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) as the base year for emissions, and is also used in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (some gases are also measured from the year 1995).<ref name="grubb kyoto protocol"/>{{Rp|146, 149}} A country's emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year.

Another measurement is of per capita emissions. This divides a country's total annual emissions by its mid-year population.<ref name="world bank emissions data"/>{{Rp|370}} Per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.&nbsp;106–07).<ref name=banuri/>

While cities are sometimes considered to be disproportionate contributors to emissions, per-capita emissions tend to be lower for cities than the averages in their countries.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dodman |first=David |s2cid=154669383 |date=April 2009|title=Blaming cities for climate change?

==Removal from the atmosphere==

===Natural processes===
Greenhouse gases can be [[carbon sink|removed from the atmosphere]] by various processes, as a consequence of:
* a physical change (condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere).
* a chemical reaction within the atmosphere. For example, methane is [[oxidized]] by reaction with naturally occurring [[hydroxyl radical]], OH'''·''' and degraded to {{CO2}} and water vapor ({{CO2}} from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane [[Global warming potential]]). Other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols.
* a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other components of the planet. An example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans.
* a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other components of the planet. This is the case for {{CO2}}, which is reduced by [[photosynthesis]] of plants, and which, after dissolving in the oceans, reacts to form [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] ions (see [[ocean acidification]]).
* a [[Photochemistry|photochemical change]]. [[Halocarbons]] are dissociated by [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light releasing Cl'''·''' and F'''·''' as [[free radical]]s in the [[stratosphere]] with harmful effects on [[ozone]] (halocarbons are generally too stable to disappear by chemical reaction in the atmosphere).

===Negative emissions===
{{main|Carbon dioxide removal}}

A number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as [[bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] and [[carbon dioxide air capture]],<ref name=RoyalSociety>{{cite web|work=The Royal Society |year=2009 |url=http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 |title=Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty |accessdate=12 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907031520/http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 |archivedate=7 September 2009 }}</ref> or to the soil as in the case with [[biochar]].<ref name="RoyalSociety"/> The IPCC has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale man-made negative emissions to avoid serious climate change.<ref name=IPCC2007>{{citation|last1=Fischer|first1=B.S.|first2=N. |last2=Nakicenovic|first3=K. |last3=Alfsen|first4=J.

==History of scientific research==
In the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that {{chem|N|2}} and {{chem|O|2}} do not absorb infrared radiation (called, at that time, "dark radiation"), while water (both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds) and {{CO2}} and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation.<ref name=CarbonicAcid>{{cite journal |last1=Arrhenius |first1=Svante |title=On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground |journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |date=1896 |volume=41 |issue=251 |pages=237–276 |doi=10.1080/14786449608620846|url=http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arrhenius |first1=Svante|title=On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Ground|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|year=1897|pages=14|volume=9|issue=54|bibcode = 1897PASP....9...14A |doi = 10.1086/121158 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them.
