The cross '''''Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice''''' ("For Church and Pope" in [[Latin]]) is a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Holy See|decoration]] of the [[Holy See]]. It is currently conferred for distinguished service to the [[Catholic Church]] by [[laity|lay people]] and [[clergy]].

==History==
The [[medal]] was established by [[Leo XIII]] on July 17, 1888, to commemorate his [[golden jubilee|golden sacerdotal jubilee]] and was originally bestowed on those men and women who had aided and promoted the jubilee, and by other means assisted in making the jubilee and the Vatican Exposition successful.<ref name="WS">{{cite wikisource |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |wslink=Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Pontifical_Decorations |year=1913}}</ref>

In 1898, it became a permanent [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Holy See|papal distinction]].<ref name=kuenker>{{cite web|url=https://www.kuenker.de/de/archiv/stueck/84864|title=Ehrenzeichen (auch als ""Ehrenkreuz"" bezeichnet) ""Pro Ecclesia et Pontefice""|website=www.kuenker.de| accessdate=2018-04-30}}</ref> [[Pius X]] reduced the classes to a single one in 1908.<ref name=kuenker/>

Until 1993, it was the highest honour that could be obtained by women.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.kirche-und-leben.de/artikel/was-sind-paepstliche-ehrentitel/| title= Was sind Päpstliche Ehrentitel?|website=www.kirche-und-leben.de|author=Norbert Göckener| accessdate=2019-07-15}}</ref>

==Appearance==
===1888 version of Leo XIII===
The cross was initially only cast in [[gold]] and [[silver]].<ref name=kuenker/> A [[bronze]] version was added later.<ref name=kuenker/> On the medal is a cross made octangular by [[fleurs-de-lis]] fixed in the angles of the cross. The arms of the cross narrow towards the center, with slightly indented ends, approaching the form of the [[Cross fleury|patonce cross]]. In the center of the cross is a small medal with the image of [[Leo XIII]]. The words "Leo XIII P. M. Anno X" (tenth year of his pontificate) circle the image. In the center of the reverse side are the papal emblems. The [[motto]] ''Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice'' is stamped in the circle surrounding the emblems.

On the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] side of the medal, the branches of the cross are [[comet]]s, which, with the fleurs-de-lis, form the [[coat of arms]] of the {{ill|Pecci family|it|Pecci (famiglia)}}. Stamped on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] side are the words "Pridie" (on the left branch), "Kal" (on the top branch), and "Januar" (on the right branch) and the year "1888" (at the foot of the cross). The medal's [[ribbon]] is red, with delicate lines of white and yellow on each border.{{efn|There is information about the existence of a purple ribbon with white-yellow edges, which should have been used from 1893 to 1908. Such a ribbon most certainly did not exist. It is probably the visual implementation based on the description in the papal letter ''Quod singulari Dei concessu'': "[…] purpurei coloris linea alba flavaque ad utramque oram virgata dependeat […]". The translation of "purpurei coloris" as violet and "linea alba flavaque" as a yellow-white line leads to a different appearance of the ribbon. See: <br />[[file:Lint van het Kruis Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice in drie opeenvolgende versies.gif]]}} The cross is worn on the left side of breast.{{efn|The frequently cited article [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Pontifical_Decorations Pontifical Decorations] wrongly states that the cross is worn on the right side.}}<ref name="AntFot">{{cite web| url= http://antique-photos.com/en/awardsdatabase/foreign-awards/vatican/378-pro-ecclesia-et-pontifice.html| title= Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. For the Church and the Pope|website=antique-photos.com|accessdate=2019-07-29}}</ref>

===Current version since Paul VI===
The current version was introduced by pope [[Paul VI]] and is only awarded in gold. The obverse depicts the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in the centre of the cross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicbishops.ie/2012/05/28/cardinal-brady-confers-papal-award-cross-pro-ecclesia-pontifice-for-church-pontiff-joe-fallon/ |title=Cardinal Brady confers Papal award of the Cross Pro-Ecclesia et Pontifice – ‘for the Church and the Pontiff’ – to Mr Joe Fallon &#124; Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference |website=www.catholicbishops.ie|publisher=Catholicbishops.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref> The inscription ''Pro Ecclesia'' (For Church) is stamped on the left arm, ''Et Pontifice'' (And Pope) on the right. Three small [[cross pattée|crosses]] are situated at the end of the left, bottom and right cross arm. During the pontificat of Paul VI and [[John Paul II]], the top arm of the cross carried the [[Papal coats of arms|coat of arms of the reigning Pope]] and his name in Latin on the bottom cross arm. The decoration's ribbon shows is yellow and white: the colors of the Papacy.

The design was modified under [[Benedict XVI]]: The individual coat of arms in the top arm of the decoration was replaced by a small cross while the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|coat of arms of the Holy See]] replaced the small cross on the bottom arm.<ref name=kuenker/> The name of the reigning pope no longer appears on the front side.<ref name=kuenker/>
