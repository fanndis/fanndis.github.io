{{Great Recession series}}
The '''Great Recession''' was a period of marked general decline ([[recession]]) observed in national economies globally that occurred between 2007 and 2009. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country (see map).<ref name=DPAD121912>{{cite web |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/index.shtml |publisher = Development Policy and Analysis Division of the UN secretariat |access-date = December 19, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=UN011513>{{cite book |title = World Economic Situation and Prospects 2013 |publisher = United Nations |isbn = 978-9211091663 |page = 200 |author = United Nations |edition = 1st |type = trade paperback |date = January 15, 2013 |quote = The global economy continues to struggle with post-crisis adjustments}}</ref> At the time, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the [[Great Depression]].

The causes of the Great Recession include a combination of vulnerabilities that developed in the financial system, along with a series of triggering events that began with the bursting of the United States [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] in 2005–2006. When housing prices fell and homeowners began to walk away from their mortgages, the value of mortgage-backed securities held by investment banks declined in 2007–2008, causing several to collapse or be bailed out in September 2008. This 2007–2008 phase was called the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. The combination of banks unable to provide funds to businesses, and homeowners paying down debt rather than borrowing and spending, resulted in the Great Recession that began in the U.S. officially in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009, thus extending over 19 months.<ref name="BernankeFCIC1">{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm |title=Bernanke-Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2010-09-02 |access-date=2013-05-31}}</ref><ref name="nber.org">[https://www.nber.org/cycles/ US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925210636/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |date=September 25, 2008 }}, NBER, accessed August 9, 2012.</ref> As with most other recessions, it appears that no known formal theoretical or empirical model was able to accurately predict the advance of this recession, except for minor signals in the sudden rise of forecasted probabilities, which were still well under 50%.<ref>Park, B.U., Simar, L. & Zelenyuk, V.

Empirical Economics 58, 379–392. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-019-01708-2</ref>

The recession was not felt equally around the world; whereas most of the world's [[Economic development|developed economies]], particularly in North America, South America and Europe, fell into a severe, sustained recession, many more recently developed economies suffered far less impact, particularly [[Economy of China|China]], [[Economy of India|India]] and [[Economy of Indonesia|Indonesia]], whose [[Economic growth|economies grew]] substantially during this period – similarly, the [[Developed country|highly developed]] country of [[Economy of Australia|Australia]] was unaffected, having experienced uninterrupted growth since the early 1990s.

==Terminology==
Two [[word sense|senses]] of the word "recession" exist: one sense referring broadly to "a period of reduced economic activity"<ref name="Merriam-Webster_recession">{{Citation |author = Merriam-Webster |title = headword "recession" |work = Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary online |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recession |postscript = . }}</ref> and ongoing hardship; and the more precise sense used in [[economics]], which is [[operational definition|defined operationally]], referring specifically to the [[Inflection point|contraction phase]] of a [[business cycle]], with two or more consecutive quarters of [[GDP]] contraction (negative GDP growth rate).
 
The definition of "great" is ''amount or intensity considerably above the normal or average'' and, contrary to some common beliefs, does not infer a positive connotation, merely large in size or scope.  

Under the academic definition, the recession ended in the United States in June or July 2009.<ref>[[Daniel Gross]], [http://www.newsweek.com/id/206631?from=rss The Recession Is... Over?], ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 14, 2009.

[[Robert Kuttner]] argues, "&thinsp;'The Great Recession,' is a misnomer. We should stop using it. Recessions are mild dips in the business cycle that are either self-correcting or soon cured by modest fiscal or monetary stimulus. Because of the continuing deflationary trap, it would be more accurate to call this decade's stagnant economy The Lesser Depression or The Great Deflation."<ref>Kuttner, Robert.

The Great Recession met the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] criteria for being a [[global recession]] only in the single calendar year 2009.<ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition">{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What's a Global Recession?|last=Davis|first=Bob|date=April 22, 2009|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=September 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name="IMF WEO 2009">{{cite web |url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf |title = World Economic Outlook&nbsp;— April 2009: Crisis and Recovery |work = Box 1.1 (page 11-14) |publisher = IMF |date = April 24, 2009 |access-date = September 17, 2013 }}</ref> That IMF definition requires a ''decline in annual real [[Gross world product|world GDP]] per{{nbhyph}}capita''.

US mortgage-backed [[securities]], which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world, as they offered higher yields than U.S. government bonds. Many of these securities were backed by subprime mortgages, which collapsed in value when the U.S. housing bubble burst during 2006 and homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments in large numbers starting in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html |title = A Global Breakdown Of The Recession In 2009 |author = Nouriel Roubini |date = January 15, 2009 |work = Forbes |author-link = Nouriel Roubini }}</ref>

The emergence of [[subprime lending|sub-prime loan]] losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. With loan losses mounting and the fall of [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, a major panic broke out on the inter-bank loan market. There was the equivalent of a bank run on the [[shadow banking system]],  resulting in many large and well established [[investment bank]]s and [[commercial bank]]s in the United States and [[Europe]] suffering huge losses and even facing bankruptcy, resulting in massive public financial assistance (government bailouts).<ref name="KrugmanGeithner1">{{cite web |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-Geithner: Does He Pass The Test? |publisher = Nybooks.com |date = July 10, 2014 |access-date = August 23, 2014 }}</ref>

Governments and central banks responded with [[fiscal policy]] and [[monetary policy]] initiatives to stimulate national economies and reduce financial system risks. The recession renewed interest in [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]]' economic ideas on how to combat recessionary conditions. Economists advise that the stimulus measures such as quantitative easing (pumping money into the system) and holding down central bank wholesale lending interest rate  should be withdrawn as soon as economies recover enough to "chart a path to sustainable growth".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/c1.pdf |title = IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2009: "Exit strategies will be needed to transition fiscal and monetary policies from extraordinary short-term support to sustainable medium-term frameworks."

===Panel reports===
The majority report provided by US [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], composed of six Democratic and four Republican appointees, reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by:
* Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages;
* Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk;
* An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis;
* Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels."<ref name="stanford1">{{cite web |url = http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions |title = Financial Crisis Inquiry Report-Conclusions-January 2011 |publisher = Fcic.law.stanford.edu |date = March 10, 2011 |access-date = April 22, 2013 }}</ref>

There were two Republican dissenting FCIC reports. One of them, signed by three Republican appointees, concluded that there were multiple causes. In his separate dissent to the majority and minority opinions of the FCIC, Commissioner [[Peter J. Wallison]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI) primarily blamed U.S. housing policy, including the actions of [[Fannie Mae|Fannie]] & [[Freddie Mac|Freddie]], for the crisis. He wrote: "When the bubble began to deflate in mid-2007, the low quality and high risk loans engendered by government policies failed in unprecedented numbers."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_wallison_dissent.pdf |title = FCIC-Final Report Dissent of Wallison |date=January 2011}}</ref>

In its "Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy," dated November 15, 2008, leaders of the [[G20 major economies|Group of 20]] cited the following causes:
{{quote|During a period of strong global growth, growing capital flows, and prolonged stability earlier this decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html |title = Declaration of G20 |publisher = Whitehouse.gov |date=November 2008}}</ref>}}

Federal Reserve Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] testified in September 2010 before the FCIC regarding the causes of the crisis. He wrote that there were shocks or triggers (i.e., particular events that touched off the crisis) and vulnerabilities (i.e., structural weaknesses in the financial system, regulation and supervision) that amplified the shocks. Examples of triggers included: losses on subprime mortgage securities that began in 2007 and a [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] that began in mid-2007, which adversely affected the functioning of money markets. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''private'' sector included: financial institution dependence on unstable sources of short-term funding such as [[repurchase agreements]] or Repos; deficiencies in corporate risk management; excessive use of leverage (borrowing to invest); and inappropriate usage of derivatives as a tool for taking excessive risks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the ''public'' sector included: statutory gaps and conflicts between regulators; ineffective use of regulatory authority; and ineffective crisis management capabilities. Bernanke also discussed "[[Too big to fail]]" institutions, monetary policy, and trade deficits.<ref name="BernankeFCIC1"/>

===Narratives===
[[File:U.S. Fixed Investment as Pct GDP.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|U.S. residential and non-residential investment fell relative to GDP during the crisis]]
There are several "narratives" attempting to place the causes of the recession into context, with overlapping elements. Five such narratives include:
# There was the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the [[shadow banking system]], which includes investment banks and other non-depository financial entities.

# Record levels of [[household debt]] accumulated in the decades preceding the crisis resulted in a [[balance sheet recession]] (similar to [[debt deflation]]) once housing prices began falling in 2006.

Underlying narratives #1–3 is a hypothesis that growing [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] and [[Household income in the United States|wage stagnation]] encouraged families to increase their [[household debt]] to maintain their desired living standard, fueling the bubble.

Narrative #5 challenges the popular claim that subprime borrowers with shoddy credit caused the crisis by buying homes they couldn't afford.  This narrative is supported by new research showing that the biggest growth of mortgage debt during the U.S. housing boom came from those with good credit scores in the middle and top of the credit score distribution—and that these borrowers accounted for a disproportionate share of defaults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/articles/rethinking-how-the-housing-crisis-happened/|title=Rethinking how the housing crisis happened|website=mitsloan.mit.edu|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>

===Trade imbalances and debt bubbles===
[[File:US Private Debt to GDP by Sector.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|U.S. households and financial businesses significantly increased borrowing (leverage) in the years leading up to the crisis]]
''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in July 2012 that the inflow of investment dollars required to fund the U.S. trade deficit was a major cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis: "The trade deficit, less than 1% of GDP in the early 1990s, hit 6% in 2006. That deficit was financed by inflows of foreign savings, in particular from East Asia and the Middle East. Much of that money went into dodgy mortgages to buy overvalued houses, and the financial crisis was the result."<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/node/21558591 |title = The Economist-Points of Light-July 14, 2012 |publisher = Economist.com |date = July 14, 2012 |access-date = April 22, 2013 }}</ref>

In May 2008, NPR explained in their [[Peabody Award]] winning program "[[The Giant Pool of Money]]" that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed into the mortgage market, driving the U.S. housing bubble. This pool of fixed income savings increased from around $35 trillion in 2000 to about $70 trillion by 2008. NPR explained this money came from various sources, "[b]ut the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries became kind of rich, making things like TVs and selling us oil. China, India, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia made a lot of money and banked it."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/transcript |title = NPR-This American Life-The Giant Pool of Money-May 2008 |publisher = Thisamericanlife.org |access-date = April 22, 2013 }}</ref>

Describing the crisis in Europe, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in February 2012 that: "What we're basically looking at, then, is a balance of payments problem, in which capital flooded south after the creation of the euro, leading to overvaluation in southern Europe."<ref>{{cite news |url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/european-crisis-realities/ |title = NYT-Paul Krugman-European Crisis Realities-February 2012 |publisher = Krugman.blogs.nytimes.com |date = February 25, 2012 |access-date = April 22, 2013 }}</ref>

===Monetary policy===
Another narrative about the origin has been focused on the respective parts played by the public monetary policy (in the US notably) and by the practices of private financial institutions.  In the U.S., mortgage funding was unusually decentralised, opaque, and competitive, and it is believed that competition between lenders for revenue and market share contributed to declining underwriting standards and risky lending.

While Alan Greenspan's role as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]] has been widely discussed, the main point of controversy remains the lowering of the [[Federal funds rate]] to 1% for more than a year, which, according to [[Austrian School|Austrian theorists]], injected huge amounts of "easy" credit-based money into the financial system and created an unsustainable economic boom),<ref>{{Cite news |last = Polleit |first = Thorsten |url = https://mises.org/story/2810 |title = Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster |publisher = Mises Institute |date = December 13, 2007 |access-date = January 4, 2009 }}</ref> there is also the argument that Greenspan's actions in the years 2002–2004 were actually motivated by the need to take the U.S. economy out of the [[early 2000s recession]] caused by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]]—although by doing so he did not help avert the crisis, but only postpone it.<ref>{{cite web |first = Ann |last = Pettifor |url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/america-s-financial-meltdown-lessons-and-prospects |title = America's financial meltdown: lessons and prospects |publisher = openDemocracy |date = September 16, 2008 |access-date = January 4, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072138/http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/america-s-financial-meltdown-lessons-and-prospects |archive-date = December 16, 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mises.org/story/1670|title=America's Unsustainable Boom|last=Karlsson|first=Stefan|date=November 8, 2004|publisher=Mises Institute|access-date=January 4, 2009}}</ref>

The IMF reported in April 2012: "Household debt soared in the years leading up to the downturn. In advanced economies, during the five years preceding 2007, the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points, to 138 percent. In Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income. A surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. The concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable, which masked households' growing exposure to a sharp fall in asset prices. When house prices declined, ushering in the global financial crisis, many households saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt, and, with less income and more unemployment, found it harder to meet mortgage payments. By the end of 2011, real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41% in Ireland, 29% in Iceland, 23% in Spain and the United States, and 21% in Denmark. Household defaults, underwater mortgages (where the loan balance exceeds the house value), foreclosures, and fire sales are now endemic to a number of economies. Household [[deleveraging]] by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries. It has been most pronounced in the United States, where about two-thirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults."<ref name="imf.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/pdf/c3.pdf|title=IMF-Report Extract Chapter 3&nbsp;– April 2012|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |title = McKinsey-Debt and deleveraging: The global credit bubble and its economic consequences-Updated-July 2011 |publisher = Mckinsey.com |date = March 13, 2013 |access-date = August 17, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130307011351/http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/financial_markets/debt_and_deleveraging_the_global_credit_bubble_update |archive-date = March 7, 2013 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===Pre-recession warnings===
The onset of the economic crisis took most people by surprise.

===Ineffective or inappropriate regulation===

====Regulations encouraging lax lending standards====
Several analysts, such as Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, have asserted that private lenders were encouraged to relax lending standards by government affordable housing policies.<ref>Peter J. Wallison, "Cause and Effect: Government Policies and the Financial Crisis", Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, November 2008.</ref><ref>Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Statement of Edward Pinto, December 9, 2008, 4.</ref> They cite The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which initially required that 30 percent or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to affordable housing. The legislation gave HUD the power to set future requirements. These rose to 42 percent in 1995 and 50 percent in 2000, and by 2008 (under the G.W. Bush Administration) a 56 percent minimum was established.<ref name="Wallison 1">{{cite web |author = Peter J. Wallison |title = Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission |publisher = American Enterprise Institute |date = January 2011 |url = http://www.aei.org |access-date = November 20, 2012 }}</ref> To fulfill the requirements, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established programs to purchase $5 trillion in affordable housing loans,<ref>Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 121.</ref> and encouraged lenders to relax underwriting standards to produce those loans.<ref name="Wallison 1"/>

These critics also cite, as inappropriate regulation, "The National Homeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream ("Strategy"), which was compiled in 1995 by Henry Cisneros, President Clinton's HUD Secretary. In 2001, the independent research company, Graham Fisher & Company, stated: "While the underlying initiatives of the [Strategy] were broad in content, the main theme ... was the relaxation of credit standards."<ref>{{cite web |title = Housing in the New Millennium: A Home without Equity Is Just a Rental with Debt |publisher = Graham Fisher|author = Rosner, Josh |date = June 29, 2001 |url=http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-docs/2001-06-29%20Rosner%20Housing%20in%20the%20New%20Millenium.pdf }}</ref>

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is also identified as one of the causes of the recession, by some critics. They contend that lenders relaxed lending standards in an effort to meet CRA commitments, and they note that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.<ref>Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 148.</ref>

However, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) Democratic majority report concluded that Fannie & Freddie "were not a primary cause" of the crisis and that CRA was not a factor in the crisis.<ref name="stanford1"/> Further, since housing bubbles appeared in multiple countries in Europe as well, the FCIC Republican minority dissenting report also concluded that U.S. housing policies were not a robust explanation for a wider global housing bubble.<ref name="stanford1"/> The hypothesis that a primary cause of the crisis was U.S. government housing policy requiring banks to make risky loans has been widely disputed,<ref>{{cite web |title = Examining the Big Lie |publisher = The Big Picture |author = Barry Ritholtz |date = November 26, 2011 |url = http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/examining-the-big-lie-how-the-facts-of-the-economic-crisis-stack-up/ }}</ref> with [[Paul Krugman]] referring to it as "imaginary history".<ref>{{cite news |title = Triumph of the Wrong |work = The New York Times |author = Paul Krugman |date = November 6, 2014 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/opinion/paul-krugman-triumph-of-the-wrong.html }}</ref>

One of the other challenges with blaming government regulations for essentially forcing banks to make risky loans is the timing. Subprime lending increased from around 10% of mortgage origination historically to about 20% only from 2004 to 2006, with housing prices peaking in 2006. Blaming affordable housing regulations established in the 1990s for a sudden spike in subprime origination is problematic at best.<ref name="stanford1"/> A more proximate government action to the sudden rise in subprime lending was the SEC relaxing lending standards for the top investment banks during an April 2004 meeting with bank leaders. These banks increased their risk-taking shortly thereafter, significantly increasing their purchases and securitization of lower-quality mortgages, thus encouraging additional subprime and Alt-A lending by mortgage companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt|first=Stephen|last=Labaton|date=October 2, 2008|access-date=January 16, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> This action by its investment bank competitors also resulted in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking on more risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05fannie.html|title=Pressured to Take More Risk, Fannie Reached Tipping Point|first=Charles|last=Duhigg|date=October 4, 2008|access-date=January 16, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (1999), which reduced the regulation of banks by allowing commercial and investment banks to merge, has also been [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act#Controversy|blamed]] for the crisis, by [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] among others.<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5835269 Who's Whining Now?

====Derivatives====
Several sources have noted the failure of the US government to supervise or even require transparency of the [[financial instruments]] known as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/warning/ The Warning]| Frontline</ref><ref name=devils/><ref name=faiola/> Derivatives such as [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs) were unregulated or barely regulated.

An unlimited amount could be wagered on the same housing-related securities, provided buyers and sellers of the CDS could be found.<ref>{{cite web |author = Michael Lewis |url = http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 |title = Vanity Fair-Michael Lewis-Betting the Blind Side-April 2010 |publisher = Vanityfair.com |access-date = August 17, 2013 }}</ref> When massive defaults occurred on underlying mortgage securities, companies like AIG that were selling CDS were unable to perform their side of the obligation and defaulted; U.S. taxpayers paid over $100 billion to global financial institutions to honor AIG obligations, generating considerable outrage.<ref name="Scott Lanman">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=az3C8NMLBKbY|title=Bloomberg&nbsp;– Senators Dodd & Shelby Demand Information|last=Lanman|first=Scott|date=March 5, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

A 2008 investigative article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' found leading government officials at the time (Federal Reserve Board Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], Treasury Secretary [[Robert Rubin]], and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] Chairman [[Arthur Levitt]])  vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives. In 1998, [[Brooksley E. Born]], head of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], put forth a policy paper asking for feedback from regulators, lobbyists, and legislators on the question of whether derivatives should be reported, sold through a central facility, or whether capital requirements should be required of their buyers.

====Shadow banking system====
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis.]]

Paul Krugman wrote in 2009 that the [[bank run|run]] on the [[shadow banking system]] was the fundamental cause of the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realised that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible&nbsp;– and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect".<ref name="Krugman 2009">{{cite book |last = Krugman |first = Paul |author-link = Paul Krugman |year = 2009 |title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 |publisher = W.W.

During 2008, three of the largest U.S. investment banks either went bankrupt ([[Lehman Brothers]]) or were sold at [[fire sale]] prices to other banks ([[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]). The investment banks were not subject to the more stringent regulations applied to depository banks. These failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], potentially facing failure, opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation but receiving access to credit via the Federal Reserve.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt, and Risk|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|date=October 3, 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/28/business/20080928-SEC-multimedia/index.html|title=The Day the S.E.C.

AIG was contractually required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100&nbsp;billion of U.S. taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of AIG. While this money was legally owed to the banks by AIG (under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from AIG by the institutions), a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was used to bail out banks.<ref name="Scott Lanman" />

Economist [[Gary Gorton]] wrote in May 2009: {{quote|Unlike the historical banking panics of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the current banking panic is a wholesale panic, not a retail panic. In the earlier episodes, depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in exchange for their checking accounts. Unable to meet those demands, the banking system became insolvent. The current panic involved financial firms "running" on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase agreements (repo) or increasing the repo margin ("haircut"), forcing massive deleveraging, and resulting in the banking system being insolvent.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/gorton.pdf |title = Gary Gorton-NBER and Yale-Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007-Updated May 2009 |access-date = April 22, 2013 }}</ref>}}

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported in January 2011: {{quote|In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections&nbsp;– the Federal Reserve as a [[lender of last resort]], federal deposit insurance, ample regulations&nbsp;– to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America's banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system&nbsp;– opaque and laden with short term debt&nbsp;– that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market&nbsp;– for example, the multitrillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives&nbsp;– were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns.

===Systemic crisis===
The financial crisis and the recession have been described as a symptom of another, deeper crisis by a number of economists. For example, [[Ravi Batra]] argues that growing inequality of [[financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major [[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|political changes]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.truthout.org/weapons-mass-exploitation/1304696645 |title = Weapons of Mass Exploitation? |publisher = Truthout.org |date = May 8, 2011 |access-date = June 4, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604225511/http://www.truthout.org/weapons-mass-exploitation/1304696645 |archive-date = June 4, 2011 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Batra |first = Ravi |url = http://www.askbutwhy.com/2011/04/ravi-batra-on-thom-hartmann-show-04-29.html |title = Ravi Batra interview |publisher = Thom Hartman's radio show (at 1:15) |date = April 29, 2011 |access-date = June 4, 2011 }}</ref> Feminist economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession.

The Great Recession had a significant economic and political impact on the United States.  While the recession technically lasted from December 2007{{snd}}June 2009 (the nominal GDP trough), many important economic variables did not regain pre-recession (November or Q4 2007) levels until 2011–2016. For example, real GDP fell $650 billion (4.3%) and did not recover its $15 trillion pre-recession level until Q3 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1|title=Real Gross Domestic Product|last=U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis|date=January 1, 1947|website=FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>  Household net worth, which reflects the value of both stock markets and housing prices, fell $11.5 trillion (17.3%) and did not regain its pre-recession level of $66.4 trillion until Q3 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO|title=Households and Nonprofit Organizations; Net Worth, Level|last=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)|date=October 1, 1945|website=FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref> The number of persons with jobs (total non-farm payrolls) fell 8.6 million (6.2%) and did not regain the pre-recession level of 138.3 million until May 2014.<ref>[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS FRED-All Employees Total Nonfarm Payrolls-Retrieved July 7, 2018]</ref>  The unemployment rate peaked at 10.0% in October 2009 and did not return to its pre-recession level of 4.7% until May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE|title=Civilian Unemployment Rate|last=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=January 1, 1948|website=FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

A key dynamic slowing the recovery was that both individuals and businesses paid down debts for several years, as opposed to borrowing and spending or investing as had historically been the case. This shift to a [[Sectoral balances|private sector surplus]] drove a sizable government deficit.<ref name="NPI">{{cite web|url=https://www.npi.org.uk/blog/economic-policy/united-states-sector-balances-over-five-decades/|title=United States sector balances over five decades|website=New Policy Institute|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref> However, the federal government held spending at about $3.5 trillion from fiscal years 2009–2014 (thereby decreasing it as a percent of GDP), a form of austerity. Then-Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery:
*The housing sector did not rebound, as was the case in prior recession recoveries, as the sector was severely damaged during the crisis. Millions of foreclosures had created a large surplus of properties and consumers were paying down their debts rather than purchasing homes.
*Credit for borrowing and spending by individuals (or investing by corporations) was not readily available as banks paid down their debts.
*Restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts (i.e., austerity) was not sufficient to offset private sector weaknesses.<ref name="Bernanke_Recovery">{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121120a.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board – The Economic Recovery and Economic Policy|website=federalreserve.gov|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

On the political front, widespread anger at [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|banking bailouts]] and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus]] measures (begun by President [[George W. Bush]] and continued or expanded by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]) with few consequences for banking leadership, were a factor in driving the country politically rightward starting in 2010. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was the largest of the bailouts.  In 2008, TARP allocated $426.4 billion to various major financial institutions.  However, the US collected $441.7 billion in return from these loans in 2010, recording a profit of $15.3 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx|title=TARP Programs|website=treasury.gov|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>  Nonetheless, there was a political shift from the Democratic party.  Examples include the rise of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and the loss of Democratic majorities in subsequent elections. President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush administration and continued during his administration as completed and mostly profitable {{as of|2014|December|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/business/us-signals-end-of-bailouts-of-automakers-and-wall-street.html|title=U.S. Declares Bank and Auto Bailouts Over, and Profitable|first=Jonathan|last=Weisman|date=December 19, 2014|access-date=January 16, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> {{as of|2018|January|}}, bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration.

[[File:Eurozone-structural1.jpg|thumb|Relationship between fiscal tightening (austerity) in [[Eurozone countries]] with their GDP growth rate, 2008–2012<ref name=martin/>]]
The crisis in Europe generally progressed from banking system crises to sovereign debt crises, as many countries elected to bail out their banking systems using taxpayer money. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Greece was different in that it faced large public debts rather than problems within its banking system. Several countries received bailout packages from the [[European troika|troika]] (European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund), which also implemented a series of emergency measures.

Many European countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011. For example, according to the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' Greece improved its budget deficit from 10.4% GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also improved their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP.<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html |title = CIA World Factbook-Greece Example |publisher = Cia.gov |access-date = August 17, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="Eurostat1">{{Cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119182304/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/euroindicators/peeis/|url-status=dead|title=Eurostat-Selected Principal European Economic Indicators|archive-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref>

However, with the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased (i.e., worsened) from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart at right. Greece's public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011<ref name="cia.gov"/>  to 185% in 2014. This indicates that despite improving budget deficits, GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline (improvement) in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period. [[Eurostat]] reported that the debt to GDP ratio for the 17 Euro area countries together was 70.1% in 2008, 79.9% in 2009, 85.3% in 2010, and 87.2% in 2011.<ref name="Eurostat1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |title=Eurostat News Release-Euro indicators-23 April 2012 |access-date=August 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919121523/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23042012-AP/EN/2-23042012-AP-EN.PDF |archive-date=September 19, 2013 }}</ref>

According to the ''CIA World Factbook'', from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined.<ref name="cia.gov"/> Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in September 2012 at 11.6%, up from 10.3% the prior year. Unemployment varied significantly by country.<ref>{{cite news |last = Smith |first = Aaron |url = https://money.cnn.com/2012/10/31/news/economy/euro-unemployment/index.html |title = Eurozone unemployment hits record high |publisher = Money.cnn.com |date = October 31, 2012 |access-date = August 17, 2013 }}</ref>

Economist [[Martin Wolf]] analysed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth from 2008 to 2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies (see chart at right) in several European countries during April 2012. He concluded that: "In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions [budget deficit reductions] bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions." Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) [[Coefficient of determination|explained]] approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis.<ref name=martin>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/04/27/the-impact-of-fiscal-austerity-in-the-eurozone/ |first = Martin |last = Wolf |title = The Impact of Fiscal Austerity in the Eurozone |publisher = Blogs.ft.com |date = April 27, 2012 |access-date = August 17, 2013 }}</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] analysed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth, similar to Martin Wolf. He also wrote: "...&nbsp;this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/austerity-and-growth-again-wonkish/|title=Austerity And Growth, Again (Wonkish)|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>

The financial crisis did not affect developing countries to a great extent. Experts see several reasons: Africa was not affected because it is not fully integrated in the world market. Latin America and Asia seemed better prepared, since they have experienced crises before. In Latin America, for example, banking laws and regulations are very stringent. Bruno Wenn of the German DEG suggests that Western countries could learn from these countries when it comes to regulations of financial markets.<ref>{{cite web |title = Exceedingly high interest rates |author = Bruno Wenn |publisher = dandc.eu |date = January 2013 |url = http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/european-bank-regulators-would-do-well-learn-their-latin-american-counterparts }}</ref>

In Brazil, disaffected youth rallied against a minor bus-fare hike;<ref name="nytReport">Romero, Simon.

In all these cases, the ostensible immediate cause of the protest was amplified by the underlying social suffering induced by the great recession.

In January 2009, the government leaders of Iceland were forced to call elections two years early after the people of Iceland staged mass protests and clashed with the police because of the government's handling of the economy.<ref name="BBC1"/> Hundreds of thousands protested in France against President Sarkozy's economic policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|title=The New York Times&nbsp;– Breaking News, World News & Multimedia|last=Dobbs|first=David|publisher=International Herald Tribune|access-date=April 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220508/http://iht.com/articles/2009/01/29/europe/france.4-418938.php|archive-date=February 28, 2009}}</ref> Prompted by the financial crisis in Latvia, the opposition and trade unions there organised a rally against the cabinet of premier Ivars Godmanis.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial phase of the crisis]] led to emergency interventions in many national financial systems. As the crisis developed into genuine recession in many major economies, economic stimulus meant to revive economic growth became the most common policy tool. After having implemented rescue plans for the banking system, major developed and emerging countries announced plans to relieve their economies. In particular, economic stimulus plans were announced in [[Chinese economic stimulus program|China]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|United States]], and the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb20081126_365422.htm|title=EU Proposes €200 Billion Stimulus Plan|date=November 26, 2008|work=Businessweek|access-date=January 21, 2010}}</ref> In the final quarter of 2008, the financial crisis saw the [[G-20 major economies|G-20 group of major economies]] assume a new significance as a focus of economic and financial crisis management.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (central bank) lowered interest rates and significantly expanded the money supply to help address the crisis.

The [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] injected nearly $1.5 billion into the banking system, nearly three times as much as the market's estimated requirement. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] added almost $1.32 billion, through a refinance operation, its biggest in at least a month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/16/business/cbanks.php |title=Asian central banks spend billions to prevent crash |work=International Herald Tribune |date=September 16, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919042036/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/16/business/cbanks.php |archive-date=September 19, 2008 }}</ref>

On November 9, 2008, the [[Chinese economic stimulus program]], a RMB¥ 4 trillion ($586 billion) stimulus package, was announced by the central government of the People's Republic of China in its biggest move to stop the global financial crisis from hitting the world's second largest economy. A statement on the government's website said the State Council had approved a plan to invest 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) in infrastructure and social welfare by the end of 2010. The stimulus package was invested in key areas such as housing, rural infrastructure, transportation, health and education, environment, industry, disaster rebuilding, income-building, tax cuts, and finance.

Later that month, China's export driven economy was starting to feel the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe despite the government already cutting key interest rates three times in less than two months in a bid to spur economic expansion. On November 28, 2008, the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[State Administration of Taxation]] jointly announced a rise in export tax rebate rates on some labour-intensive goods. These additional tax rebates took place on December 1, 2008.<ref>

The stimulus package was welcomed by world leaders and analysts as larger than expected and a sign that by boosting its own economy, China is helping to stabilise the global economy. News of the announcement of the stimulus package sent markets up across the world. However, [[Marc Faber]] claimed that he thought China was still in recession on January 16.

In Taiwan, the central bank on September 16, 2008, said it would cut its required reserve ratios for the first time in eight years. The central bank added $3.59 billion into the foreign-currency interbank market the same day. Bank of Japan pumped $29.3 billion into the financial system on September 17, 2008, and the Reserve Bank of Australia added $3.45 billion the same day.<ref name="World_Banks">{{Cite news |title = Germany Rescues Hypo Real Estate |url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3692522,00.html |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |date = October 6, 2008 }}</ref>

In developing and emerging economies, responses to the global crisis mainly consisted in low-rates monetary policy (Asia and the Middle East mainly) coupled with the depreciation of the currency against the dollar. There were also stimulus plans in some Asian countries, in the Middle East and in Argentina. In Asia, plans generally amounted to 1 to 3% of GDP, with the notable exception of [[Chinese economic stimulus plan|China]], which announced a plan accounting for 16% of GDP (6% of GDP per year).

===European policy responses===
Until September 2008, European policy measures were limited to a small number of countries (Spain and Italy). In both countries, the measures were dedicated to households (tax rebates) reform of the taxation system to support specific sectors such as housing. The European Commission proposed a [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|€200 billion stimulus plan]] to be implemented at the European level by the countries. At the beginning of 2009, the UK and Spain completed their initial plans, while Germany announced a new plan.

On September 29, 2008, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch authorities partially nationalised [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]]. The German government bailed out [[Hypo Real Estate]].

On October 8, 2008, the British Government announced a [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] of around £500 billion<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/4961897/Gordon-Brown-should-say-sorry-over-economy-minister-says.html |title=Gordon Brown should say 'sorry' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=March 9, 2009 |access-date=March 9, 2009 |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> ($850 billion at the time). The plan comprises three parts. The first £200 billion would be made in regard to the banks in liquidity stack.

Along with this, £50&nbsp;billion will be made available if the banks needed it, finally the government will write off any eligible lending between the British banks with a limit to £250 billion.

In early December 2008, German Finance Minister [[Peer Steinbrück]] indicated a lack of belief in a "Great Rescue Plan" and reluctance to spend more money addressing the crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/172613 |title = It Doesn't Exist! |publisher = Newsweek.com |date = December 6, 2008 |access-date = December 15, 2008 }}</ref> In March 2009, The European Union Presidency confirmed that the EU was at the time strongly resisting the US pressure to increase European budget deficits.<ref>{{Cite news |last = Waterfield |first = Bruno |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/5048291/EU-presidency-US-and-UK-economic-recovery-plans-are-a-way-to-hell.html |title = EU resists deficits |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = March 25, 2009 |access-date = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}</ref>

===Global responses===

Most political responses to the economic and financial crisis has been taken, as seen above, by individual nations. Some coordination took place at the European level, but the need to cooperate at the global level has led leaders to activate the [[G-20 major economies]] entity. A first summit dedicated to the crisis took place, at the Heads of state level in November 2008 ([[2008 G-20 Washington summit]]).

The [[G-20 major economies|G-20 countries]] met in a summit held on [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|November 2008 in Washington]] to address the economic crisis. Apart from proposals on international financial regulation, they pledged to take measures to support their economy and to coordinate them, and refused any resort to protectionism.

[[2009 G-20 London Summit|Another G-20 summit]] was held in London on April 2009. Finance ministers and central banks leaders of the G-20 met in [[Horsham]], England, on March to prepare the summit, and pledged to restore global growth as soon as possible. They decided to coordinate their actions and to stimulate demand and employment. They also pledged to fight against all forms of [[protectionism]] and to maintain trade and foreign investments. These actions will cost $1.1tn.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7979483.stm | work=BBC News | title=G20 leaders seal tn global deal | date=April 2, 2009}}</ref>

They also committed to maintain the supply of credit by providing more liquidity and recapitalising the banking system, and to implement rapidly the stimulus plans. As for central bankers, they pledged to maintain low-rates policies as long as necessary. Finally, the leaders decided to help emerging and developing countries, through a strengthening of the IMF.

==Policy recommendations==

===IMF recommendation===
The IMF stated in September 2010 that the financial crisis would not end without a major decrease in unemployment as hundreds of millions of people were unemployed worldwide. The IMF urged governments to expand social safety nets and to generate job creation even as they are under pressure to cut spending. The IMF also encouraged governments to invest in skills training for the unemployed and even governments of countries, similar to that of Greece, with major debt risk to first focus on long-term economic recovery by creating jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/global/14euro.html|title=I.M.F. Calls for Countries to Focus on Jobs|last=Alderman|first=Liz|date=September 13, 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Raising interest rates===
{{further|Corporate debt bubble}}
The [[Bank of Israel]] was the first to raise interest rates after the global recession began.<ref name="marketwatch.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/israels-surprise-rate-cut-may-mean-other-em-cuts-2011-09-26|title=Israel rate cut suggests more emerging market cuts&nbsp;– Emerging Markets Report|publisher=MarketWatch|access-date=May 15, 2012}}</ref> It increased rates in August 2009.<ref name="marketwatch.com"/>

On October 6, 2009, [[Australia]] became the first G20 country to raise its main interest rate, with the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] moving rates up from 3.00% to 3.25%.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8291968.stm |title = Australia raises interest rates |publisher = BBC News |date = October 6, 2009 |access-date = January 21, 2010 }}</ref>

The [[Norges Bank]] of [[Norway]] and the [[Reserve Bank of India]] raised interest rates in March 2010.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/global/20rupee.html |work = The New York Times |title = India's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates |date = March 19, 2010 }}</ref>

On November 2, 2017 the [[Bank of England]] raised interest rates for the first time since March 2009 from 0.25% to 0.5% in an attempt to curb inflation.

==Comparisons with the Great Depression==
{{main|Comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression}}

On April 17, 2009, the then head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression. "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today." The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronised by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries.<ref>{{Cite news |last = Evans |first = Ambrose |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title = IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |work=The Daily Telegraph |date = April 16, 2009 |access-date = January 21, 2010 |location = London }}</ref>

[[Olivier Blanchard]], IMF Chief Economist, stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the United States, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928–1929.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html|title=IMF fears 'social explosion' from world jobs crisis|date=September 13, 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref>
