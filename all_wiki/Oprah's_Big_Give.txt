==Format==

The show is the first prime time reality series by Harpo Productions, and focuses on 10 contestants as they travel across the [[United States|country]] with a large sum of money, and try to help people in unique ways, and participate in a series of challenges in order to become America's greatest unknown [[philanthropist]].<ref name="EOnlineRICHMOND" />

In each episode, contestants travel to a different U.S. city and are given some amount of money and an assignment.  Sometimes the contestants are paired or grouped, and sometimes they may act as individuals.  In some cities, contestants are assigned to help a particular individual or organization, while in others they are simply told to find people in need.  The contestants then have the opportunity to raise additional money in order to reach their goals. At the end of each episode, the panel of judges selects one person to go home.

At the end of the season, it was revealed to the winner that they won $1 million ($500,000 for themselves, and $500,000 to give away).
