"'''Naughty Girl'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] from her debut solo [[studio album]] ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). It was written by Beyoncé, [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and Angela Beyincé, and produced by Storch and Beyoncé. The song was released by [[Columbia Records]] as the fourth and final [[Single (music)|single]] from the album on March 14, 2004. An official remix featuring American rapper Marquis Bryant was released in May 2004, as well. Musically, "Naughty Girl" is an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that [[Interpolation (popular music)|interpolates]] from [[Donna Summer]]'s 1975 song "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]". Influenced by [[Arabic music]], [[dancehall]], [[funk]] and [[reggae]], the song contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of [[sexual arousal|sexual lust]] and conquest, leading up to a desire for a [[one-night stand]].

"Naughty Girl" received positive feedback by [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised Beyoncé's assertive vocals and the song's sensual vibe. However, opinions about how convincingly Beyoncé was able to portray a naughty girl were polarized. The song was nominated in the category Best R&B/Soul Single by a Female Artist at the [[2005 Soul Train Music Awards]]. "Naughty Girl" peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive release from the album to reach the top-five on that chart. The single reached the top-ten in New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. "Naughty Girl" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|American]] and [[Australian Recording Industry Association|Australian]] trade associations of record producers.  It was also certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand]].

The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and was inspired by the dancing of [[Cyd Charisse]] and [[Fred Astaire]] in the 1953 [[Musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] ''[[The Band Wagon]]''. In it, Beyoncé flirtatiously and seductively dances with R&B singer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] to portray a naughty girl. The video received four nominations at the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]] and eventually won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] accolade. The song was included on Beyoncé's [[set list]]s on her tours. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized "Naughty Girl" as one of the most performed songs of 2005 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. "Naughty Girl" has been covered by singer-songwriter [[Roesy (singer)|Roesy]] and band [[Richard Cheese|Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine]].
