'''Choate Rosemary Hall''' (often known as '''Choate'''; {{IPAc-en|tʃ|oʊ|t}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Choate |author=Ben Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03FOB-onlanguage-t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2014}}</ref>) is a [[Independent school|private]], [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]], [[College-preparatory school|college-preparatory]] [[boarding school]] in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], United States. Founded in 1890, it took its present name and began a co-educational system with the 1971 merger of The Choate School for boys and Rosemary Hall for girls. It is part of the [[Eight Schools Association]] and the [[Ten Schools Admissions Organization]]. Its alumni include many members of the New England establishment and the American political elite.

=== Early years ===
[[File:Squire Stanley House - Choate Rosemary Hall.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Squire Stanley House, built 1690–1750 and visited in 1775 by George Washington. The Choate School began here in 1896. It is now a third form (first-year) girls dormitory.]]

::''See also: [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] for its history before the 1971 re-affiliation with Choate.''

The schools that would eventually become Choate Rosemary Hall were begun by members of two prominent New England families, the Choates and Atwaters.<ref>Ephraim Orcutt Jameson, ''The Choates in America, 1643–1896'' (Ipswich, Massachusetts, 1896); Charles Henry Stanley Davis, ''History of Walligford, Conn.'' (Meriden, Conn., 1870)</ref>

Rosemary Hall was founded in 1890 by Mary Atwater Choate at Rosemary Farm in Wallingford, her girlhood home and the summer residence of she and her husband, [[William Gardner Choate]]. Mary, an alumna of [[Miss Porter's School]], was the great-granddaughter of Caleb Atwater (1741–1832), a Connecticut merchant magnate who supplied the American forces during the Revolutionary War. In 1775 General [[George Washington]] visited the Atwater store in Wallingford en route to assuming command of the [[Continental Army]]. On that occasion, Washington took tea with Judge Oliver Stanley at the "Red House" (built 1690–1750), now Squire Stanley House on the Choate campus.

In 1878 Mary Atwater Choate had co-founded a vocational organization for Civil War widows, the New York Exchange for Women's Work, prototype of many such exchanges across the country (it survived until 2003).<ref>{{cite news |title=A Genteel Nostalgia, Going Out of Business |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 23, 2003 |page=137 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/nyregion/a-genteel-nostalgia-going-out-of-business.html }}</ref> In 1889 Mary planned a new institution on the same principle of female self-sufficiency and she advertised in ''The New York Times'' for a headmistress to run a school that would train girls in the "domestic arts." The advertisement was answered by Caroline Ruutz-Rees (1865–1954), a 25-year-old Briton teaching in New Jersey.<ref>Tom Generous, ''Choate Rosemary Hall: A History of the School'' (Wallingford, Conn., 1997), p. 3. Much of the matter in this section is taken from Generous.</ref>

On October 3, 1890, the ''New Haven Morning News'' reported: "The opening of Rosemary Hall took place at Wallingford yesterday ... at the beautiful Rosemary Farms, which have been the property of Mrs. Choate's family for five generations. ... Rev. [[Edward Everett Hale]] addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful. 'Never forget,' said he, 'that it is a great art to do what you do well. If you limp, limp well, and if you dance, dance well'."

The eight arriving girls occupied the original school building, "old Atwater House" (built 1758), located at the northwest corner of Christian and Elm streets, where new Atwater House now stands. They also had the use of "Atwater homestead" (built 1774, now known as Homestead), which stands at the center of the present day campus, on the northeast corner of Christian and Elm streets.

[[File:Homestead (dorm) - Choate Rosemary Hall.JPG|thumb|left|210px|The Homestead, built 1774. A small door leads to a secret passage behind the chimney that may have been a station on the Underground Railroad.]]

Caroline Ruutz-Rees (pronounced "roots-reece," the first syllable rhyming with "foot"), headmistress of Rosemary Hall until 1938, was a figure of extraordinary personality and influence, a militant feminist and suffragist of national prominence. On the Wallingford golf course she wore bloomers, which shocked the locals, and on buggy rides to Wallingford station she carried a pistol.<ref>"Rosemary's 50th", ''Time'', November 4, 1940, p. 137</ref> She quickly changed Rosemary Hall's mission from "domestic arts" to that of a contemporary boys school.

The Choate School was founded by William and Mary Choate in 1896. William Gardner Choate (1830–1921), [[Harvard University|Harvard]] class of 1852, was U.S. District Judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern Circuit of New York]] from 1878 to 1881, and afterward a partner of Shipman, Barlow, Laroque, and Choate. He was a national authority on admiralty, railroad, bankruptcy, and corporation law.<ref>"Memorial of William Gardner Choate", ''New York County Lawyers' Association Yearbook 1921'' (New York, 1921), pp. 199–200</ref> Like his younger, more famous brother, he was a prominent clubman (Harvard and The Century). That brother was [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], lawyer, prosecutor of the [[Tweed Ring]], and [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the Court of St. James's]].

William and Mary Choate invited Mark Pitman (1830–1905), their tenant in the aforementioned Red House, to start a boys' school under their sponsorship. Pitman, [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]] class of 1859, was 66 years old, a widower, and had been principal of Woolsey School in New Haven, Connecticut, since 1872.<ref>''Obituary Record of the Graduates of Bowdoin College and the Medical School of Maine for the Decade Ending June 1, 1909'' (Brunswick, Maine, 1911), pp. 350–1</ref> He accepted the Choates' offer, not least perhaps because it would provide employment for his unmarried adult daughters, Leila, Elizabeth, and Helen. Six boys entered the new school in fall term 1896, their average age about ten. Four of the six lived in Red House with the Pitmans, and Red House (now Squire Stanley House) has remained a dormitory to the present day.

Pitman taught Latin, English, history, and science; Elizabeth taught art, Helen piano, and Leila was writing teacher and school nurse. Mary Choate's physician brother, Huntington Atwater, taught crafts and was school doctor. There was no formal relationship with the Choates' other foundation, Rosemary Hall, a hundred yards to the east on Christian Street, but there were coeducational audiences for plays and recitals and Mary Choate hosted dances at the Homestead.

In 1897 the boys school erected Choate House across the street from Red House, the first purpose-built institutional building (and John F. Kennedy's dormitory in 1931-2). It contained recitation rooms, an infirmary, a dining room, and housing for fifteen boys. In 1899 Choate House was venue for the first "Junior Dance", but a year later the Rosemary girls would depart for a seventy-one year absence.

The official history of Choate Rosemary Hall, written by Tom Generous, says that the rift between Caroline Ruutz-Rees and Mary Choate, proponents of two very different sorts of feminism, was public knowledge as early as 1896. In that year the two women did not share the lectern at Prize Day, and local newspapers published "denials" of a rumor that Ruutz-Rees would leave the school.<ref>Generous, ''op cit'', p. 17</ref> But by 1900 the headmistress and her educational style had acquired influential champions among the students' parents and two of them, residents of Greenwich, Connecticut, joined forces to effect the removal of the school to their town.

Shipping magnate Nathaniel Witherell donated {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land in the Rock Ridge section of Greenwich. Julian Curtiss gathered a group of investors and established a joint stock corporation funded through the sale of six-percent bonds. Ruutz-Rees was the chief shareholder. The Greenwich residence of Rosemary Hall began in fall term 1900, when 57 girl students moved into the Main Building, known as "The School", a U-shaped shingled house on Zaccheus Mead Lane.

In Wallingford, Mark Pitman died on December 3, 1905. Until 1908 Sumner Blakemore was titular headmaster, but the school was effectively the domain of the three Pitman sisters. At the 1908 graduation ceremony the Japanese Consul General watched his countryman Noyobu Masuda give the valedictory address. Then Judge Choate introduced the man who would assume the headmastership in the fall, George St. John, and his wife, Clara Seymour St. John. She was a [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] alumna, member of a well-connected Connecticut family, sister of future (1937–1951) Yale president [[Charles Seymour]], and descendant of Yale president (1740–1766) [[Thomas Clap]].

George Clair St. John (1877–1966), Harvard class of 1902, aged 31 in the fall of 1908, had grown up on a farm in Hoskins Station, Connecticut. He was an ordained Episcopal priest. He had taught at [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]] in Pennsylvania and [[Ransom Everglades School|Adirondack-Florida School]], and was teaching at [[Hackley School]] in Tarrytown, N.Y., when Samuel Dutton of [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Columbia Teachers College]] recruited him for the headmastership. St. John "knew, long before I read Mr. Dutton's letter, that I wanted some day to have a school of my own. In my thought about it, Dean Briggs was my first text."<ref>St. John, ''op cit'', p. 11</ref> This was [[LeBaron Russell Briggs]], dean of men at Harvard when St. John was there and afterward dean of the faculty until 1925. Briggs, St. John wrote, "fathered the whole college", and the St. Johns too would serve ''in loco parentis''.

[[File:Dining hall - Choate Rosemary Hall.JPG|thumb|right|320px|The dining hall in Hill House west wing]]

Their first move to secure parental powers was decisive. In September 1909, as the official history tells it, the St. Johns "signed with the Choates an 'Agreement to Lease and Purchase.' Under its terms, the younger couple rented the school, its property and reputation, for five years at a sum equal to 11 percent of The Choate School's net income per year. ... Less than twenty months later, on May 12, 1911, St. John reported to the trustees that he had purchased the title to the school by acquiring mortgages of roughly $41,000. He resold the title in turn to The Choate School, Incorporated, for $23,000 cash and $38,000 in stock ... For all intents and purposes, The Choate School belonged to George St. John."<ref>Generous, ''op cit'', p. 66</ref>

In his first quarter-century as headmaster, St. John created much of Choate as it is regarded today. Of the Georgian brick and stone campus, he had built by 1932 Hill House, West Wing, the Gymnasium, Memorial House, the Chapel, the Library, the Winter Exercise Building, and Archbold Infirmary, which was the largest school infirmary in the country. He grew the enrollment from 35 to 505 boys and the faculty from 5 to 64 masters. In the decade following the First World War (classes of 1918 to 1928) Choate sent 412 of its 618 graduates to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, according to a table published in ''The Choate News'' in fall term 1928.<ref>''The Choate News'', October 13, 1928, reproduced in Generous, ''op cit'', p. 90</ref>

George St. John belonged to the generation of legendary, long-serving headmasters who shaped the New England prep school, chief among whom were [[Endicott Peabody]] of [[Groton School]], [[Frank Boyden]] of [[Deerfield Academy]], [[Horace Dutton Taft]] of [[Taft School]], Frederick Sill of [[Kent School]], Samuel Drury of [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], Alfred Stearns of [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy Andover]], [[Lewis Perry]] of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], and George Van Santvoord of [[Hotchkiss School]].<ref>James McLachlan, ''American Boarding Schools: A Historical Study'' (New York, 1970), ''passim''; Christopher F. Armstrong, "On the Making of Good Men: Character-Building in the New England Boarding Schools", in ''The High-Status Track: Studies of Elite Schools and Stratification'', ed. P.W. Kingston and L.S. Lewis (Albany, N.Y., 1990), pp. 9–10</ref>

The Rev. George St. John of Choate was succeeded in 1947 by his son, the Rev. Seymour St. John '31 (1912–2006), and the "St. John dynasty" was continued to 1973. Seymour was Yale class of 1935 and was ordained after graduating from [[Virginia Theological Seminary]] in 1942. During his time as head he built as many buildings as his father had built, greatly broadened the curriculum, raised the national profile of the school, and made it more progressive ([[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Norman Thomas]], and [[William Sloane Coffin]] were regular speakers) and cosmopolitan (Russian, Near Eastern, and Afro-American studies centers were founded, and Russian, Chinese, and Arabic courses were begun). St. John was a longtime advocate of coeducation and initiated the Choate-Rosemary contacts. At his death, headmaster Edward Shanahan told the ''New York Times'', "The merger demanded an enormous expenditure of resources by Choate because the building of a new campus was to occur within the footprints of its property. Seymour was central to the decision to expand those resources."<ref>{{cite news |title=Seymour St. John, 94, Leader of Choate School for 26 Years, Dies |journal=New York Times |date=April 20, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/nyregion/20stjohn.html }}</ref>

=== JFK, the Muckers, and "Ask not" ===
[[File:John F. Kennedy Choate Studies Letter - NARA - 192825.tif|thumb|left|200px|John Kennedy '35 writes home on school stationery to say his "studies are going pretty hard" and mentioning [[Lem Billings|LeMoyne Billings]] '35, his roommate and lifelong closest friend]]

In 1931 [[John F. Kennedy]] entered Choate as a third form (9th grade) student, following his older brother [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe Jr.]], who was a star athlete at the school. Jack Kennedy—sickly, underweight, and nicknamed Rat Face by his schoolfellows—spent his first two years at Choate in his brother's shadow, and compensated for it with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. He named his group The Muckers Club, which had thirteen members—Kennedy and twelve disciples. (Among these was Kennedy's lifelong inseparable friend [[Lem Billings|Kirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings]], who kept an apartment in the White House during JFK's presidency.)<ref>Nigel Hamilton, ''JFK: Reckless Youth'' (Random House, 1992), pp. 88-101, 119-27; Robert Dallek, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917–1963'' (Little, Brown and Co., 2003), pp. 33-9; David Pitt, ''Jack and Lem: John F. Kennedy and Lem Billings: The Untold Story of an Extraordinary Friendship'' (Da Capo Press, 2008), ''passim''</ref>

As Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks included a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist [[Chris Matthews]] published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean [[LeBaron Russell Briggs|LeBaron Briggs]]) was, "The youth who loves his alma mater will always ask not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can I do for her?'" Speculation that this was the original of JFK's inaugural address "Ask not" goes back at least as far as a 1966 ''Time'' magazine article, and several of JFK's Choate contemporaries noticed the echo in 1961.<ref>''Time'' magazine, January 28, 1966; ''Parade'' magazine, December 15, 1968; Thurston Clarke, ''Ask Not: The Inauguration of John F. Kennedy and the Speech that Changed America'' (Henry Holt and Co., 2004), p. 78; Chris Matthews, "The Genesis of JFK's 'Ask Not' Line", ''The Blog'', HuffingtonPost.com, January 20, 2011; Chris Matthews, ''Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero'' (Simon and Schuster, 2011), pp. 23, 325-6, 441-2; "Document may shed light on origins of JFK speech", Associated Press, November 3, 2011</ref> Kennedy graduated from Choate in 1935. In senior class polling for the yearbook (of which he was business manager), Kennedy was voted Most Likely to Succeed.

Choate's curriculum includes elective and interdisciplinary courses, from astronomy and architecture to printmaking and post-modernism to digital video and development economics.<ref>https://www.choate.edu/academics/teachingatchoate.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111222635/http://www.choate.edu/academics/teachingatchoate.aspx |date=2010-01-11 }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.choate.edu/academics/pdf/coursecat.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527232048/http://www.choate.edu/academics/pdf/coursecat.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}</ref> There are more than 300 courses in the curriculum, which has requirements in community service and in contemporary global studies. All disciplines have honors courses. As of 2017, Choate no longer offers AP (Advanced Placement) courses.

A two-year intensive Science Research Program includes mentored laboratory work during the summer at universities in the United States and abroad. The Capstone Program allows sixth form (senior) students to explore an area of the curriculum in depth. Working under a faculty adviser, students take at least five courses that focus on a curricular theme, culminating in a substantial final project. During the college application process, Choate's College Counseling Office highlights Capstone Project participation in letters of recommendation.

The performing and visual arts are supported by the resources of the Paul Mellon Arts Center. Among extracurricular arts clubs are five ''[[a cappella]]'' groups; [[step dance]], [[slam poetry]], hip hop, and rap groups; improv, musical theater, and instrumental ensembles of all sizes; photography and film-making clubs; and supporting publications for the arts, fashion, and culture. The Arts Concentration Program provides students with individually tailored instruction and class scheduling.

The Senior Project Program provides on- or off-campus internships in academic research, visual art, and the performing arts. Other specialized programs include American Studies, creative writing, economics, FBLA, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, religion, debate, and the Fed Challenge. The 2011–12 academic year saw the introduction of an Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies Program (AMES).<ref>[http://www.choate.edu/academics/special_middeasternstudies.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130142824/http://www.choate.edu/academics/special_middeasternstudies.aspx|date=November 30, 2011}}</ref> Choate's Office of Global Studies supports study-abroad and other international initiatives.

In 2012 Choate became the first among its peer preparatory schools to require that all faculty and students own an iPad. The fall term that year saw the beginning of full integration of the tablet's capabilities into the syllabus. Choate's director of academic technology discussed Choate's iPad program in an August 2012 article in ''US News''.<ref>Ryan Lytle, "Tablets Trump Laptops in High School Classrooms", ''U.S. News & World Report'', August 3, 2012</ref>

===Choate–Deerfield rivalry===
Choate Rosemary Hall and Deerfield Academy have had a long-standing rivalry. The final weekend of the fall sports season is Deerfield Day (at Deerfield it's called "Choate Day"), when the two schools compete in every sport at varsity and sub-varsity levels. The tradition began in 1922 with an exchange of letters between Deerfield head [[Frank Boyden]] and Choate head George St. John. Since then, busloads (in the early years, trainloads) of students have made the 80-mile journey along the Connecticut River valley to cheer their teams on the rival's campus.

In the days leading up to the event, rallies and activities are held, led by Choate's Boar Pen cheering section and Deerfield's Captain Deerfield. At Choate there's the igniting of a fire-breathing dragon of sophisticated construction. At Deerfield there's a bonfire topped by a burning C, and ritual encircling of the school seal so that Choate teams won't tread on it. In recent years, alumni clubs of the two schools have met at venues around the world, from London to Los Angeles, to watch live-streaming of the varsity football game.<ref>Grace Alford-Hamburg, "Deerfield Day, A History of Rivalry and Tradition", ''The News'', November 11, 2011; James Chung, "Choate Day", ''The Deerfield Scroll'', November 7, 2012</ref>

Similar boarding school traditions include the [[Andover–Exeter rivalry]] and [[Hotchkiss School#Hotchkiss–Taft rivalry|Hotchkiss–Taft rivalry]].

=== Historic cricket match ===
The [[cricket]] match that Rosemary Hall hosted in Wallingford in 1893 against Mrs. Hazen's School of Pelham Manor, N.Y., has been described as "the first interscholastic girls sporting event in American history."<ref>Tom Melville, ''The Tented Field: A History of Cricket in America'' (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Press, 1998), p. 114</ref> (Girls ''intramural'' sports had, of course, existed, but the Rosemary cricket match is the earliest discoverable ''extramural'' item.) The dating to 1893 occurs in the official history of Choate, published in 1997. Other discussions of the event give an inferential date of 1895 or earlier, referencing newspaper articles in 1896 that imply a well-established rivalry. An 1898 wire story titled "Women and Cricket" said that the Rosemary–Hazen series was four years old. Whatever the date of the first match, journalistic treatment of the novelty was "over-publicized and mildly sensationalized", according to a standard [[history of American cricket]] published in 1998. "Bareheaded and wearing sweaters and short skirts", reported ''[[The New York Times]]'', "daughters of some of the most prominent men in the country defied the cold, wintry wind." The ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' under the headline "Girls Play Cricket" noted that "the Pelham girls' skirts were some two or three inches longer than those of their opponents." In November 1896 the ''[[Yale Medical Journal]]'' carried a notice that Yale Med student Frederick Hulseberg had been "engaged to coach the Rosemary Hall cricket team this fall", thereby becoming the first coach of women's cricket in America.<ref>"Girls at the Wickets", ''The New York Times'', November 14, 1896; "Girls Play Cricket", ''The Morning Herald'' (Baltimore), November 16, 1896, p. 6; "Women and Cricket", ''The Evening Telegram'' (St. John's, Newfoundland), June 27, 1898, p. 3; Melville, ''loc cit''; Tom Generous, ''Choate Rosemary Hall: A History of the School'' (Wallingford, Conn., 1997); Venu Palaparthi, "1895 Cricket match between Mrs. Hazen's School and Rosemary Hall – A Historic First for Interscholastic Girls Sports", July 10, 2009, DreamCricket.com; ''Yale Medical Journal'', vol. III, no. 1 (Nov. 1896), p. 46; ''Choate Rosemary Hall Bulletin'', Spring 1964, p. 12</ref>

=== Stengel and the Braves ===
During World War II, baseball commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], under orders from the [[Office of Defense Mobilization|Office of Defense Transportation]], told major league team owners to find spring training venues close to home. In Boston, the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] chose Tufts University and the [[History of the Boston Braves|Braves]] at first considered [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy (Andover)]]. But a sports editor at ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was a Choate alumnus, and he persuaded the Braves to look at Choate's Winter Exercise Building (now the Johnson Athletic Center), one of the largest glass-roofed, cage-netted rooms in the country, and easily able to accommodate a baseball infield. The Braves moved into Choate dormitories on March 21, 1943 and again in March 1944.

Their roster included [[Warren Spahn]], [[Johnny Sain]] ("Spahn and Sain and pray for rain"), and manager [[Casey Stengel]]. The journalistic opportunity afforded by Stengel in a prep school setting was not lost, and a famous wire-service photo shows him dressed in mortarboard and gown "lecturing" his players. His nickname "The Perfessor" first appears at this time, as does a fine example of Stengelese: asked to comment on Choate's facilities, he said, "Excellent workouts in that there cage you just saw, which is a honey in all my years to the present time, if I may be permitted to drop into the vernacular."<ref>Marc Myers, "Wartime Baseball: Training at Choate", ''The New York Times'', March 28, 1982; Joel Zoss and John Bowman, ''Diamonds in the Rough: The Untold History of Baseball'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004), p. 103; "Stengel Pleased With Choate", ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'', March 18, 1943, p. 4; Jeffrey Kurz, "When Choate was the home of the Braves", Meriden, Conn.

== Traditions ==
Choate Rosemary Hall's traditional events include:
* Matriculation Ceremony at the start of school, in which each student signs a pledge card of commitment "to personal growth, to integrity, to self-discipline, and to caring for others."
* Cake Race is held on the last day of fall classes. Students and staff throng the cross country course for a 5K race, with winners in each form awarded a cake.

[[File:Archbold (dorm) - Choate Rosemary Hall.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Archbold, built 1928, designed by Ralph Adams Cram. The facade and lawn as shown are set up for the annual graduation ceremony.]]
* Festival of Lessons and Carols is based on a service held in [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. The yuletide candlelight event in Seymour St. John Chapel includes Bible readings, music by Choate choruses, and instrumental groups, and carol-singing by the congregation.
* Physics Phlotilla takes place in spring term. Students gather on the banks of the Science Center Pond to watch a competition among makeshift cardboard boats.

=== Gertrude Stein and ''The Lit'' ===
In 1935 [[Gertrude Stein]] gave a series of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for literary posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and [[Dudley Fitts]], critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in ''The Choate Literary Magazine''. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, "I had to restore a great deal of the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely what you said about the noun." (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.)<ref>Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas Papers, shelfmark 106.2109, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University</ref>

Stein's essay appeared in the February 1935 issue of ''The Lit'' with the title "How Writing Is Written." It has many times since been anthologized and given academic treatment, with the Choate text unaltered. It "occupies a unique place in Stein's corpus as a social text that carries the marks of its particular occasion ... direct address to her audience (around sixty boys, as well as faculty and some former students)."<ref>Logan Esdale, "Contexts", in Gertrude Stein, ''Ida: A Novel'' (Yale University Press, 2012)</ref> Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in ''Everybody's Autobiography'' (published 1937). She wrote, "It was the first time I had ever seen such a school. When I was brought up in East Oakland we all went to public school ... The boys from twelve to sixteen listened really listened [''sic''] to everything I had to say ... I had been much struck by the Choate school literary magazine which did have extraordinary good writing in it."<ref>Robert Bartlett Haas, ed., ''How Writing Is Written'' (Los Angeles: Black Sparrow Press, 1974); A. Walton Litz, Louis Menand, and Lawrence Rainey, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism'', vol. VII (Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 110-13; Gertrude Stein, ''Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House, 1937), pp. 247-8</ref>

=== Edward Albee and ''The Lit'' ===
In 1944 [[Edward Albee]] transferred from [[Valley Forge Military Academy and College|Valley Forge Military Academy]] to Choate, with admissions director Frank Wheeler making a prescient note, "I have a feeling he will distinguish himself in literature."<ref>"Odd Man In" (cover story), ''Newsweek'', October 10, 1966</ref> His brilliance was quickly recognized and mentored by such teachers as John Joseph, Charles Rice, and Sandy Lehmann. He was made managing editor of ''The Lit'' and for two years a large part of its content, in all genres, was supplied by him. Incidents from Albee's time at Choate are reworked for his plays, including the famous "bergin and water" speech in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]]'' and the "walking crow" speech in ''[[Tiny Alice]]'', which reproduces almost verbatim English teacher Lehmann's criticism of a sonnet Albee wrote for ''The Lit''.<ref>Mel Gussow, ''Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography'' (Simon and Schuster, 1999), pp. 56, 158</ref> The May 1946 Commencement issue of ''The Lit'' contained Albee's first published play, a long one-acter called ''Schism''. Another play written at Choate, ''Each In His Own Way'', went unpublished and forgotten until 1996, when a classmate preparing for their 50th reunion found it in a scrapbook.<ref>Gussow, ''op cit'', pp. 54-61</ref>
