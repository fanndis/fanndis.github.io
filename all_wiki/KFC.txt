KFC was founded by [[Colonel Sanders|Colonel Harland Sanders]], an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], during the [[Great Depression]]. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant [[franchising]] concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in [[Utah]] in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the [[hamburger]]. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent figure of [[Cultural history of the United States|American cultural history]], and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders, and he sold it to a group of investors led by [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] and [[Jack C. Massey]] in 1964.

KFC was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mexico]], and [[Jamaica]] by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early-1970s, KFC was sold to the [[distilled spirit|spirits]] distributor [[Heublein]], which was taken over by the [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R.J. Reynolds]] food and [[tobacco]] conglomerate; that company sold the chain to [[PepsiCo]]. The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987, it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in [[China]]. It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to [[Yum! Brands]].

KFC's original product is [[pressure frying|pressure-fried]] chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of [[KFC Original Recipe|11 herbs and spices]]. The constituents of the recipe are a [[trade secret]]. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard "bucket", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee [[Pete Harman]] in 1957. Since the early-1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as [[chicken sandwich|chicken fillet sandwich]]es and [[wrap (sandwich)|wraps]], as well as [[salad]]s and [[side dish]]es such as [[French fries]] and [[coleslaw]], desserts, and [[soft drink]]s; the latter often supplied by [[PepsiCo]]. KFC is known for its [[slogan]]s "It's Finger Lickin' Good!", "Nobody does chicken like KFC", and "So good".

Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name "Kentucky Fried Chicken".<ref name="autogenerated26" /> For Harman, the addition of KFC was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; a product from Kentucky was exotic, and evoked imagery of [[Southern hospitality]].<ref name="autogenerated26" /> Harman trademarked the phrase "It's finger lickin' good", which eventually became the company-wide slogan.<ref name="autogenerated15" /> He also introduced the "bucket meal" in 1957 (14 pieces of chicken, five [[bread roll]]s and a [[pint]] of [[gravy]] in a cardboard bucket).<ref name=Darden1>{{cite book|last=Darden|first=Robert|title=Secret Recipe: Why Kfc Is Still Cooking After 50 Years|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Tapestry Press|isbn=978-1-930819-33-7|pages=12, 57–58, 101, 159, 175, 211}}</ref> Serving their signature meal in a paper bucket was to become an iconic feature of the company.<ref name=Darden1 />

By 1963 there were 600 KFC restaurants, making the company the largest fast food operation in the United States.<ref name="JakleSculle1999" /> KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the [[hamburger]].<ref name="Smith2007">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC|access-date=March 11, 2013|page=341|date=May 1, 2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-530796-2}}</ref>

In 1964, Sanders sold the company to a group of investors led by [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] and [[Jack C.

By 2015, the company was struggling, having lost business to other retailers and being surpassed by [[Chick-fil-A]] as the leading chicken retailer in the U.S. three years previously. To combat this, the company launched a new initiative with a plan to revamp its packaging, decor and uniforms, as well as expanding its menu. Additionally, beginning in May 2015, a new series of advertisements was launched featuring [[Darrell Hammond]] as Colonel Sanders.<ref name="2015revamp">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/25/the-fried-chicken-wars-inside-kfcs-weird-new-fight-to-dethrone-chick-fil-a/|title=The fried-chicken wars: Inside KFC's weird new fight to dethrone Chick-fil-A|first=Drew|last=Harwell|date=May 25, 2015|access-date=May 27, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]| archive-date=May 26, 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150526114110/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/25/the-fried-chicken-wars-inside-kfcs-weird-new-fight-to-dethrone-chick-fil-a/ | url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently,  in a planned rotation of actors, [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Rob Riggle]] portrayed Sanders in similar ads through the fall of 2016.

Initially, KFC wanted to file a lawsuit against the couple to stop an auction of the notes, but by early 2001, it dropped the lawsuit, claiming the scribbled notes are "nowhere close" to the original recipe.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sabra Chartrand|title=Patents; Many companies will forgo patents in an effort to safeguard their trade secrets.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/05/business/patents-many-companies-will-forgo-patents-effort-safeguard-their-trade-secrets.html|access-date=March 12, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 2001}}</ref>

Joe Ledington of Kentucky, a nephew by marriage of Colonel Sanders, claimed to have found a copy of the original KFC fried chicken recipe on a handwritten piece of paper in an envelope in a scrapbook. In August 2016, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' staffers conducted a cooking test of this recipe and claimed after a few attempts that, with the addition of [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] flavor-enhancer, [[Ac'cent]], they produced fried chicken which tasted "indistinguishable" from the chicken they purchased at KFC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dodrill|first1=Tara|title=KFC Secret Recipe Found?

===Equipment===
KFC initially used stove-top covered [[cooking pot]]s to fry its chicken.<ref name=shelton>{{cite news|last=Coomes|first=Steve|title=Winston Shelton: The Colonel's Corporal|newspaper=[[Louisville Magazine]]|date=July 17, 2012|url=http://www.louisville.com/content/winston-shelton-colonels-corporal-food-dining|access-date=October 1, 2013}}</ref> In the 1960s, the officially recommended model was the L S Hartzog developed "KFC 20-Head Cooker", a large device that cost $16,000.<ref name=winston>{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.winstonind.com/kfc/history/ |publisher=Winston Industries |access-date=October 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213804/http://www.winstonind.com/kfc/history/ |archive-date=October 4, 2013 }}</ref> The Hartzog model had no oil filtration system, meaning that filtering had to be done manually, and the pressure fryers occasionally exploded, often causing harm to employees.<ref name=shelton /> In 1969, inventor and engineer [[Winston L. Shelton]] developed the "Collectramatic" pressurized fryer to overcome the problems KFC faced in quickly frying chicken to meet growing customer demand. The Collectramatic used precision time and temperature controls and self-filtered the cooking oil – all while meeting Colonel Sanders' high standards.<ref name=shelton /> Fred Jeffries, then vice president of purchasing at KFC, claimed that the invention helped fuel the company's rapid expansion and success:

<blockquote>There's no way it (KFC) could have grown as it did without the Collectramatic. Stores were doing about $200,000 a year in sales on average with the pots ... but they could never have done the $900,000 a year it became without Win's fryer. He (Shelton) helped set the stage for that with true engineering thinking.<ref name=shelton /></blockquote>

Although a number of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which had the support of Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y. Brown had given tacit approval to franchisees to exclusively use the older L S Hartzog fryer, saying "Though those old pots were damn dangerous, at least we knew they worked! I was mostly afraid these new fryers would break down in the middle of business."<ref name=shelton /> Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic.<ref name=shelton /> Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, [[John Y. Brown Sr.]], who owned multiple KFC franchises, was successfully using the Collectramatic in every franchise he owned.<ref name=shelton />  The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC, acquired Hartzog and nullified the contract.<ref name=winston /> The Collectramatic has been an approved pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.<ref name=winston />

From 2013 onwards, KFC has been transitioning from using Collectramatic cookers to pressure fryers produced by [[Henny Penny (manufacturer)|Henny Penny]], which supplies KFC with various equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hennypenny.com/press-release/henny-penny-wins-kfc-equipment-supplier-of-the-year-award-2/|title=Henny Penny Wins KFC Equipment Supplier of the Year Award}}</ref> The 'Velocity' series of pressure fryers includes increased load capacity, automatic oil filtration and increased oil longevity.

In 2010,  according to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "in the US where fried chicken remains closely associated with age-old racist stereotypes about black people in the once segregated south", KFC Australia aired the thirty-second promotion on television named "KFC's cricket survival guide" which shows a [[cricket]] fan surrounded by fans from the opposing team. The television announcer asks, "Need a tip when you're stuck in an awkward situation?" the fan passes around his "bucket of KFC", even though the commercial was intended for an Australian audience, of which found its way to social media in the United States, prompting sharp disapproval. KFC Australia made a statement to the fact the commercial was "misinterpreted by a segment of people in the US" and it was a "light-hearted reference to the West Indian cricket team" and "The ad was reproduced online in the US without KFC's permission, where we are told a culturally-based stereotype exists, leading to the incorrect assertion of racism...
