'''Richard Andrew Gephardt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|p|h|ɑːr|d}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?179983-3/gephardt-campaign-iowa|title=Gephardt Campaign in Iowa|work=Washington Journal|publisher=C-SPAN|date=January 15, 2004|access-date=June 25, 2020}}</ref> born January 31, 1941) is an American politician who served as a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from [[Missouri]] from 1977 to 2005. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 1989 to 1995 and [[Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] from 1995 to 2003. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for [[President of the United States]] in 1988 and 2004. Gephardt was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1988, 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/07/01/gop-envisions-gephardt-as-possible-obama-running-mate.html |title=GOP Envisions Gephardt as Possible Obama Running Mate |magazine=U.S. News & World Report |access-date=2009-08-23}}</ref>

Since his retirement from politics, Gephardt has become a significant [[lobbyist]].  He founded a Washington-based public affairs firm, Gephardt Government Affairs, and an Atlanta-based labor consultancy, the Gephardt Group, as well as consulting for [[DLA Piper]], [[FTI Consulting]] and [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref name="Forbes">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-gephardt/ |title=Richard Gephardt |magazine=[[Forbes]] |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref> He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of [[Issue One]].<ref>https://www.issueone.org/reformers/#reformer-full-list</ref>

==Early life==
Gephardt was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], the son of Loreen Estelle (née Cassell) and Louis Andrew Gephardt, a [[Teamsters|Teamster]] milkman; part of his ancestry is [[German American|German]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/gephardt.html |title=Ancestry of Dick Gephardt |publisher=Wargs.com |access-date=2009-08-23}}</ref> He graduated from the former Southwest High School in 1958. Gephardt is an [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He earned his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] at [[Northwestern University]] in 1962 where he was president of [[Beta Theta Pi]], the student senate, and his freshman class. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at the [[University of Michigan Law School]] in 1965.

In 1965, he was admitted to the [[Missouri Bar]]. He then entered the [[Missouri Air National Guard]], where he served until 1971.

He and his wife Jane have three grown children, Matt, Katie, and [[Chrissy Gephardt|Chrissy]]. His brother, Donald L. Gephardt, was the Dean of The College of Fine and Performing Arts at [[Rowan University]] in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]].

==Political career==
{{see also|Electoral history of Dick Gephardt}}
Gephardt was Democratic committeeman for the 14th ward in St. Louis from 1968 to 1971, moving up to become 14th ward [[alderman]] from 1971 to 1976, as part of a group of young aldermen known informally as "The [[Young Turks]]."<ref>{{cite book |last=Kindleberger |first=Charles |editor-last=Tranel |editor-first=Mark |title=St. Louis Plans: The Ideal and the Real St. Louis |publisher=Missouri Historical Society Press |date=2007 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/stlouisplansidea00unse/page/151 151] |chapter=Chapter 5: Planning Since the 1970s in the City of St. Louis |isbn=978-1883982614 |url=https://archive.org/details/stlouisplansidea00unse/page/151 }}</ref>

===House of Representatives===
In 1976, Gephardt was elected to Congress from the St. Louis-based 3rd District, succeeding 24-year incumbent [[Leonor Sullivan]]. He was elected 13 more times, opting not to run for reelection in 2004. For most of his Congressional career, Gephardt's National Political Director was St. Louis-based political consultant [[Joyce Aboussie]]. Gephardt voted in favor of the [[Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|bill]] establishing [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] as a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] in August 1983 but did not vote on the [[Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987]] (or the vote to override [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s veto in March 1988).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/98-1983/s293|title=TO PASS H.R. 3706.

===1988 presidential campaign===
[[File:Dickgephardt1988.gif|thumb|left|campaign logo]]
Gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in the [[1988 U.S. presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. Gephardt formally announced his candidacy in February 1987—one of the first to do so—and campaigned hard in Iowa, ultimately spending over 100 days in the state. He was stuck in low double digits in polls, but began moving ahead in [[Iowa]] in late December 1987 after running an ad that criticized trade barriers by Korea and Japan as unfair- known as the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiTg7zcNgP0 "Hyundai Ad."] Gephardt won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[South Dakota]] primary in February while finishing a strong second in [[New Hampshire]], making him a serious contender for the nomination.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-02/news/mn-305_1_ad-gephardt|title = But It Is Called Oversimplified : 'Hyundai' TV Ad Boosts Gephardt|last = Risen|first = James|date = March 2, 1988|work = [[Los Angeles Times]]|author-link = James Risen}}</ref>

Gephardt's early victories did not translate into support in other states, though, and he was not able to raise adequate funds to compete in the Southern primaries. His campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the March "[[Super Tuesday]]" primaries, when he won only the Missouri primary. An ad aired by Governor [[Michael Dukakis]]'s campaign focused on Gephardt's "flip-flopping" voting record and showed a Gephardt look-alike doing forward and backward flips for the camera. Many felt the ad killed any chance Gephardt had of winning the nomination.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Gephardt dropped out after winning only 13% in Michigan, despite support from the [[United Auto Workers]]. Dukakis considered selecting Gephardt as his vice presidential running mate but instead chose [[Texas]] Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]].

===House leadership===
[[File:Dick Gephardt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Gephardt from the 1997 ''Congressional Pictorial Directory'']]
In part due to the visibility gained from his 1988 presidential bid, Gephardt was elected [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|majority leader]] by his House colleagues in June 1989, making him the second-ranking Democrat in the House, behind then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Tom Foley]]. Gephardt served in that position until January 1995.

After Foley was unseated in the Republican landslide of 1994 that gave the Republicans a 52-seat majority, Gephardt became the leader of the House Democrats, as [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|minority leader]], initially opposite [[Newt Gingrich]] and then, from 1999 onward, [[Dennis Hastert]]. When Gingrich faced a coup within his own party in 1997, Gephardt could have become Speaker if there had been a floor vote and he gained the support of Republican members dissatisfied with Gingrich, but Gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred. In the 1996, 1998, and 2000 elections, Gephardt led the Democrats to gains in the House,<ref name="articles.cnn.com">{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-11-18/politics/column.shields.opinion.gephardt_1_leader-gephardt-dick-gephardt-caucus?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |work=CNN |title=AllPolitics Clinton, Gephardt Share Welfare Event Stage |date=August 12, 1997 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324053623/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-11-18/politics/column.shields.opinion.gephardt_1_leader-gephardt-dick-gephardt-caucus?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |archive-date=2012-03-24 }}</ref> although they did not retake the majority until 2006, after Gephardt had left Congress.

Gephardt became a prolific financial supporter of Democrats around the country in the early 1990s, assembling a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office. Although Gephardt worked hard for many of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s programs, he and his union supporters strongly opposed NAFTA and other "free trade" programs, so Clinton relied on Republican support to pass those initiatives. During the [[Impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton|impeachment proceedings of President Clinton]], Gephardt led a walkout in the House after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/clinton_under_fire/latest_news/238784.stm | work=BBC News | title=Clinton impeached | date=December 19, 1998}}</ref>

[[File:Dick Gephardt 1998.jpg|thumb|left|Gephardt speaking at a vigil for [[Matthew Shepard]] in 1998]]
In 2000, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] named Gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates. The other names on the short list were Indiana Senator [[Evan Bayh]], North Carolina Senator [[John Edwards]], Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]], Connecticut Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], and New Hampshire Governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=123200 |title=Gore Down To Short List |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 3, 2000 |work=ABC News|access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref> Gore eventually selected Lieberman.

In the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, Gephardt campaigned on the economy and Social Security, but the continuing resonance of the [[September 11 attacks]], the momentum for military action against Iraq, and President [[George W. Bush]]'s popularity lead to Republican gains, with the Democrats losing four House seats. [[Harold Ford]] of Tennessee called the results an "absolute blowout" and called upon Gephardt to step down, saying that it was time for "new ideas and new faces". Due to his previous success, it has been said that Gephardt would have been easily returned as Minority Leader if he had decided to stay on.<ref name="articles.cnn.com"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2310717.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dick Gephardt: Home issue campaigner | date=November 7, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2414343.stm | work=BBC News | title=Top Democrat leader resigns | date=November 7, 2002}}</ref> However, Gephardt, who was planning to run for president in 2004, did not run for reelection as House Minority Leader, stepping down in January 2003. His leadership position was contested by the centrist [[Martin Frost]], the outgoing Democratic Caucus Chair, and the liberal [[Nancy Pelosi]], the Minority Whip, who was elected as Gephardt's successor. No longer having Congressional leadership duties freed Gephardt up to concentrate on a 2004 presidential bid.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/234096711.html?dids=234096711:234096711&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+07%2C+2002&author=Nick+Anderson&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Election+2002+%2F+NATIONAL+RESULTS%3B+Gephardt+to+Leave+Leadership+Post%3B+Resigning+as+minority+chief+of+the+House+could+free+the+Democrat+for+a+presidential+bid.&pqatl=google | first=Nick | last=Anderson | title=Election 2002 / NATIONAL RESULTS; Gephardt to Leave Leadership Post; Resigning as minority chief of the House could free the Democrat for a presidential bid | date=November 7, 2002}}</ref>

===2004 campaign for president===

Gephardt announced his [[2004 U.S. presidential election|second run for president]] on January 5, 2003. His successor as Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, endorsed him. His campaign was notable for the high-profile [[coming out]] of his daughter [[Chrissy Gephardt|Chrissy]] in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, while she was helping him on the campaign trail,<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140201,00.html No Secrets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921060451/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140201,00.html |date=September 21, 2016 }}, ''[[People (magazine)|people]]'', June 2, 2003</ref><ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125100&page=1 Gay Daughter Joins Gephardt Campaign] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825215631/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125100&page=1 |date=August 25, 2016 }}, ''[[ABC News]]'', June 9, 2003</ref> a subject they also discussed in interviews for the 2007 [[documentary film]] ''[[For the Bible Tells Me So]]'';<ref>[http://www.pageoneq.com/news/2007/Chrissy_and_Dick_Gephardt_appear_on_CNN_to_promote_new_film_For_The_Bible_Tell_1016.html Chrissy and Dick Gephardt appear on CNN to promote new film, ''For The Bible Tells Me So''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215703/http://www.pageoneq.com/news/2007/Chrissy_and_Dick_Gephardt_appear_on_CNN_to_promote_new_film_For_The_Bible_Tell_1016.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, PageOneQ, October 16, 2007</ref> he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for [[gay rights]] since the campaign.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120906161743/http://www.nhpr.org/node/5550 Home State Record: Dick Gephardt], ''[[New Hampshire Public Radio]]'', December 30, 2003</ref>

Although Republicans considered him a formidable candidate, Gephardt was seen by many as too old-fashioned and unelectable.<ref name="Swarns">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/20/us/2004-campaign-missouri-congressman-gephardt-s-poignant-echo-site-his-1988.html?ref=richardagephardt | work=The New York Times | first=Rachel L. | last=Swarns | title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN; Gephardt's Poignant Echo at the Site of His 1988 Victory | date=January 20, 2004}}</ref> His fundraising efforts were behind those of former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and Senators [[John Kerry]] and [[John Edwards]], and tied with [[Joe Lieberman]]. Gephardt's support of the [[Iraq Resolution|Iraq War resolution]] hurt him among [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activists. He promoted a form of [[universal health care]], and was backed by 21 labor unions, but did not have enough support to receive the [[AFL-CIO]]'s endorsement.<ref name="Swarns"/>

[[File:Dick Gephardt supporters.jpg|thumb|Supporters of Gephardt's campaign in 2003]]
Throughout early 2003, Gephardt was ahead in polling for the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucus]], but by August Dean had taken the lead, his campaign fueled by antiwar activists. The Gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early August ''[[St Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' article that revealed that 11 of the 33 "Gephardt team leaders" listed on his Iowa campaign's website actually supported other candidates or were neutral.

The race between Gephardt and Dean became negative, and took an ugly turn in October when a Gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a Dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/dont_quote_me/documents/03301021.asp |title=An unlikely bigfoot |work=Boston Phoenix |access-date=2009-08-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202074648/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/dont_quote_me/documents/03301021.asp |archive-date=2010-02-02 }}</ref> Many press at the event claimed the Dean staffer was picking a fight and that the Gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment. Dean chairman [[Joe Trippi]] (who worked for Gephardt in 1988) and Gephardt chairman Steve Murphy became involved in a war of words over the incident, as well as Murphy's allegation that the Dean campaign was bringing in out-of-state non-residents to participate in the caucus. In the final days of the Iowa campaign, both Dean and Gephardt faded, and they finished third and fourth, respectively. Gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33367-2004Jan20.html |work=Washington Post |title=Gephardt Ends Bid for White House|date=21 January 2004|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

After he dropped out of the presidential race, Gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for [[John Kerry]]. On March 7, 2004, [[New Mexico]] Governor [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]], also seen as a strong contender for the position, endorsed Gephardt for Vice President. "I think he's the best candidate," Richardson said of Gephardt in an interview with the [[Associated Press]]. "There's a good regional balance with Kerry and Gephardt." Kerry announced on July 6, 2004, that he had chosen [[John Edwards]] as his running mate. On the same day, the ''[[New York Post]]'' published a headline stating that Gephardt had become Kerry's running mate. The headline was compared to the 1948 "[[Dewey defeats Truman]]" headline in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that incorrectly reported the presidential election results that year. In 2007, it was revealed in Kerry campaign adviser [[Bob Shrum]]'s book ''No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner'' that Kerry wanted to choose Gephardt but was convinced by Shrum and others to choose Edwards.

==Political views==
After his election to the U.S. House in 1976, Gephardt's political views gradually moved to the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Originally, Gephardt was strongly anti-[[abortion]] and was viewed as a [[social conservative]]. He was initially extremely critical of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] landmark ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' ruling that legalized abortion. He wrote on the subject in 1984:
{{quote|Life is the division of human [[cell (biology)|cells]], a process that begins with [[Conception (biology)|conception]]. The ([[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] abortion) ruling was unjust, and it is incumbent on the Congress to correct the injustice... I have always been supportive of pro-life legislation. I intend to remain steadfast on this issue.... I believe that the life of the unborn should be protected at all costs.<ref>[[William Saletan|Saletan, William]] and Zenilman, Avi. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/ballot_box/2003/09/the_flipflops_of_dick_gephardt.html The Flip-Flops of Dick Gephardt], ''[[Slate.com]]'' (2003-09-15)</ref>}}

In 1987, when Gephardt decided to run for president, he announced that he would no longer support legislation to restrict abortion rights. He told the [[Right to Life|National Right to Life Committee]]; "I now do not support any [[Human Life Amendment|Constitutional amendment]] pertaining to the legality of abortion."

Gephardt's views on economic policy also changed over the years. He voted for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[tax cuts]] in 1981; in the 2000s, however, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by President [[George W. Bush]], saying that the enormous surplus created during the administration of [[Bill Clinton]] should have been spent on [[health care]] instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic [[Populism|populist]]. He supports universal health coverage, [[fair trade]], and [[progressive taxation]]. Although he once chaired the [[centrist]] [[Democratic Leadership Council]], Gephardt in his later years in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC's pro-business positions.

On October 10, 2002, Gephardt was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. He was an early supporter of the war, and cosponsor of the authorization resolution. However, three years later Gephardt said of his support for the war that "It was a mistake ... I was wrong."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2005/10/gephardt_on_ira.html |title=The Next Hurrah: Gephardt on Iraq: "I was wrong" |publisher=Thenexthurrah.typepad.com |date=2005-10-17 |access-date=2009-08-23}}</ref>

In his new role as a Washington lobbyist, Gephardt, on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, has been actively lobbying against the House resolution condemning the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire.
