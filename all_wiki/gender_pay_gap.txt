The '''gender pay gap''' or '''gender wage gap''' is the average difference between the [[remuneration]] for men and women who are working.  Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus ''adjusted'' pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked,  occupations chosen, education and job experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genderequality.ie/en/GE/Pages/GenderPayGap|title=Gender Pay Gap|website=www.genderequality.ie}}</ref> In the United States, for example, the '''non-adjusted''' average female's annual salary is 79% of the average male salary, compared to 95% for the '''adjusted''' average salary.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/equal-pay-day-2015/ | title=78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap | work=CNN Money | date=April 14, 2015 | access-date=May 28, 2015 | author=O'Brien, Sara Ashley | location=New York | quote=7% wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation even controlling for college major, occupation, age, geographical region and hours worked. }}</ref><ref>{{cite report| date        = Spring 2018|url=https://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The-Simple-Truth|title=The Simple Truth About The Gender Wage Gap| location    = 1310 L St. NW, Suite 1000 Washington, DC 20005 | access-date = 19 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224051057/https://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The-Simple-Truth|archive-date= February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/study-gender-pay-gap-narrows-but-still-exists.aspx | title=Study: Global Gender Pay Gap Has Narrowed but Still Exists | journal=SHRM | date=April 2, 2019 | access-date=May 25, 2020 | author=Gurchiek, Kathy | quote=Average Cents/Pence Earned by Women Per Dollar/Pound/Euro of Male Earnings: .95 }}</ref>

The reasons link to legal, social and economic factors, and extend beyond '[[equal pay for equal work]]'.<ref name=":0">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7896990/3-06032017-AP-EN.pdf</ref>  (The two terms, gender pay gap, and equal pay are not the same.<ref name=":0" />)

The gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective even when the reason for the gap is entirely voluntary, because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon [[Welfare|welfare payments]], especially in old age.

==Historical perspective==
[[File:US womens earnings as a percentage of mens 1979-2005.gif|thumb|right|Women's weekly earnings as a percentage of men's in the U.S. by age, 1979-2005<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2006/oct/wk1/art02.htm|title=Women's earnings as a percentage of men's, 1979-2005|publisher=United States Department of Labor|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>]]

A 2005 [[meta-analysis]] by Doris Weichselbaumer and [[Rudolf Winter-Ebmer]] of more than 260 published pay gap studies for over 60 countries found that, from the 1960s to the 1990s, raw (aka non-adjusted) wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially from around 65% to 30%. The bulk of this decline, was due to better labor market endowments of women (i.e. better education, training, and work attachment).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weichselbaumer|first1=Doris|last2=Winter-Ebmer|first2=Rudolf|year=2005|title=A Meta-Analysis on the International Gender Wage Gap|url=http://www.econ.jku.at/papers/2003/wp0311.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=19|issue=3|pages=479–511|doi=10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.9241|s2cid=88508221}}</ref>

Another meta-analysis of 41 empirical studies on the wage gap performed in 1998 found a similar time trend in estimated pay gaps, a decrease of roughly 1% per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=T.

A 2011 study by the British [[Chartered Management Institute|CMI]] concluded that, if pay growth continues for female executives at current rates, the gap between the earnings of female and male executives would not be closed until 2109.<ref name="guardian equal pay cmi report">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/31/cmi-equal-pay-report|title=Women executives could wait 98 years for equal pay, says report|author=Goodley, Simon|date=2011-08-31|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 31, 2011|location=London|quote=While the salaries of female executives are increasing faster than those of their male counterparts, it will take until 2109 to close the gap if pay grows at current rates, the Chartered Management Institute reveals.}}</ref>

==Calculation==
The non-adjusted '''gender pay gap''', or '''gender wage gap''' is typically the [[median]] or [[mean]] average difference between the remuneration for all working men and women in the sample chosen. It is usually represented as either a percentage or a ratio of the "difference between average gross hourly [or annual] earnings of male and female employees as % of male gross earnings".<ref name="ec.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics|title=Gender pay gap statistics - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>

Some countries use only the full-time working population for the calculation of national gender gaps.<ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|title=How Pew Research measured the gender pay gap|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/11/how-pew-research-measured-the-gender-pay-gap/}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=20 February 2020|title=Australia's Gender Pay Gap Statistics|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/data/fact-sheets/australias-gender-pay-gap-statistics|website=Australian Government Workplace Gender Equality Statistics}}</ref> Others are based on a sample from the entire working population of a country (including part-time workers), in which case the [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) is used to obtain the remuneration for an equal amount of paid hours worked.<ref name="ec.europa.eu"/><ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031163903/https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap|url=https://www.wgea.gov.au/addressing-pay-equity/what-gender-pay-gap|title=What is the gender pay gap? - The Workplace Gender Equality Agency|date=31 October 2015|work=web.archive.org|archive-date=2015-10-31|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/public/assets/pdf/gender-pay-gap-explained.pdf|title=The Gender Pay Gap Explained|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/wb/media/gender_wage_gap.pdf|title=Breaking down the gender wage gap|work=dol.gov|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728035654/https://www.dol.gov/wb/media/gender_wage_gap.pdf|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-259.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=www.census.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://africacheck.org/reports/south-african-women-earn-27-less-men/|title=Do South African women earn 27% less than men?|website=Africa Check}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> 

Non-governmental organizations apply the calculation to various samples. Some share how the calculation was performed and on which data set.<ref name="auto4"/> The gender pay gap can, for example, be measured by ethnicity,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iwpr.org/publications/gender-wage-gap-2017-race-ethnicity/|title=The Gender Wage Gap: 2017 Earnings Differences by Race and Ethnicity|website=Institute for Women's Policy Research}}</ref> by city,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3|title=7 charts that show the glaring gap between men and women's salaries in the US|first=Sonam Sheth, Shayanne Gal, Andy|last=Kiersz|website=Business Insider}}</ref> by job,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/gender-pay-gap|title=Gender Pay Gap|first=Information is|last=Beautiful|website=Information is Beautiful}}</ref> or within a single organization.<ref>{{cite web|date=2018-03-29|title=New Numbers Show the Gender Pay Gap Is Real|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-29/the-gender-pay-gap-is-real-say-new-numbers-from-the-u-k|access-date=2020-09-26|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/03/26/google-reveals-uk-gender-pay-gap-17pc/|title=Google reveals UK gender pay gap of 17pc|first=James|last=Titcomb|date=26 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2018/03/29/microsoft-publishes-gender-pay-data-for-uk/|title=Microsoft publishes gender pay data for UK|date=29 March 2018|website=Microsoft News Centre UK}}</ref>

===Adjusting for different causes===
Comparing salary "within, rather than across" data sets helps to focus on a specific factor, by controlling for other factors. For example, to eliminate the role of horizontal and vertical segregation in the gender pay gap, salary can be compared by gender within a specific job function. To eliminate transnational differences in the job market, measurements can focus on a single geographic area instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/gender-pay-gap/|title=Gender Pay Gap|first=Information is|last=Beautiful|website=Information is Beautiful}}</ref>

== Reasons ==
[[File:Decomposition of the gender wage gap, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Decomposition of the gender wage gap (2010)]]
The non-adjusted gender pay gap is not itself a measure of discrimination. Rather, it combines differences in the average pay of women and men to serve as a barometer of comparison. Differences in pay are caused by occupational segregation (with more men in higher paid industries and women in lower paid industries), vertical segregation (fewer women in senior, and hence better paying positions), ineffective equal pay legislation, women’s overall paid working hours, and barriers to entry into the labor market (such as education level and single parenting rate).<ref name="auto3">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3888793/8979317/KS-TC-18-003-EN-N.pdf</ref>

Some variables that help explain the non-adjusted gender pay gap include economic activity, working time, and job tenure.<ref name="auto3"/> Gender-specific factors, including gender differences in qualifications and discrimination, overall wage structure, and the differences in remuneration across industry sectors all influence the gender pay gap.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blau|first1=Francine D.|last2=Kahn|first2=Lawrence M.|s2cid=55685704|date=November 2000|title=Gender Differences in Pay|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=14|issue=4|pages=75–100|doi=10.1257/jep.14.4.75|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.14.4.75}}</ref>

[[Eurostat]] estimated in 2016 that after allowing for average characteristics of men and women, women still earn 11.5% less than men. Since this estimate accounts for average differences between men and women, it is an estimation of the ''unexplained'' gender pay gap.

===Industry sector===
[[File:US womens earnings and employment by industry 2009.png|thumb|U.S. women's weekly earnings, employment, and percentage of men's earnings, by industry, 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110216.htm|title=Women's earnings and employment by industry, 2009|publisher=United States Department of Labor|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2010.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook|publisher=United States Department of Labor|date=December 2010|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>]]

[[Occupational segregation]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU16/SRU16.html|title=Social Research Update 16: Occupational Gender Segregation|website=sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref> or ''horizontal segregation''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/segregation|title=Segregation {{!}} Eurofound|website=www.eurofound.europa.eu|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref> refers to inequality in pay associated with occupational earnings.

In Jacobs (1995), Boyd ''et al.'' refer to the horizontal division of labor as "high-tech" (predominantly men) versus "[[high-touch]]" (predominantly women) with high tech being more financially rewarding.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender inequality at work|date=1995|publisher=Sage Publications|others=Jacobs, Jerry A., 1955-|isbn=978-0803956964|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=31013096|url=https://archive.org/details/genderinequality0000unse}}</ref>  Men are more likely to be in relatively high-paying, dangerous industries such as mining, construction, or manufacturing and to be represented by a union.<ref name="Blau">{{cite journal|author1=Blau, Francine D.|author2=Kahn, Lawrence M.|date=2007|title=The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone as Far as They Can?|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/key_issues/gender_research.pdf|journal=Academy of Management Perspectives|volume=21|issue=1|pages=7–23|doi=10.5465/AMP.2007.24286161|s2cid=152531847}}</ref>   Women, in contrast, are more likely to be in clerical jobs and to work in the service industry.<ref name="Blau" />

A 2017 study by the US [[National Science Foundation]]'s annual census revealed pay gaps in different areas of science: there is a much larger proportion of men in higher-paying fields such as [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the two highest-paying scientific fields. Men accounted for about 75% of doctoral degrees in those fields (a proportion that has barely changed since 2007), and expected to earn $113,000 compared with $99,000 for women. In the social sciences the difference between men and women with PhD's was significantly smaller, with men earning ~$66,000, compared with $62,000 for women. However, in some fields women earn more: women in chemistry earn ~$85,000, about $5,000 more than their male colleagues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woolston|first=Chris|date=2019-01-22|title=Scientists' salary data highlight US$18,000 gender pay gap|journal=Nature|volume=565|issue=7740|pages=527|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00220-y|pmid=30670866|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Discrimination===

The [[European Commission]] divides discrimination, as it impacts the EU wage gap, into several categories.

''Direct discrimination'' is when a woman is paid less than a man for the same job.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu">{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017DC0678|title=EUR-Lex - 52017DC0678 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> According to Harvard Economist, [[Claudia Goldin]], by and large women receive equal pay for equal work in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/|title=The True Story of the Gender Pay Gap (Ep. 232)|last=Rosalsky|first=Greg|website=Freakonomics|language=en|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>  A more persistent difference is the sectoral or industry discrimination, with women being paid less for a job of equal value in careers dominated by women.<ref>{{Cite book|author=European Commission|date=2014|title=Tackling the gender pay gap in the European Union|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/gender_pay_gap/140319_gpg_en.pdf|journal=Justice|isbn=978-92-79-36068-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117233220/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/gender_pay_gap/140319_gpg_en.pdf|archive-date=2014-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_en.htm|title=What are the causes? - European Commission|date=2016-03-05|website=European Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121349/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_en.htm|archive-date=2016-03-05|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>

===Motherhood===
Studies have shown that an increasing share of the gender pay gap over time is due to children.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The role of parenthood on the gender gap among top earners|journal=European Economic Review|volume=109|pages=103–123|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.05.008|year=2018|last1=Bütikofer|first1=Aline|last2=Jensen|first2=Sissel|last3=Salvanes|first3=Kjell G.|hdl=11250/2497041|s2cid=54929106|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kleven|first1=Henrik|last2=Landais|first2=Camille|last3=Søgaard|first3=Jakob Egholt|date=January 2018|title=Children and Gender Inequality: Evidence from Denmark|doi=10.3386/w24219|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 24219|url=http://papers.nber.org/papers/W24219|doi-access=free}}</ref> The phenomenon of lower wages due to childbearing has been termed the [[motherhood penalty]].

Motherhood can affect job choices as well. In a traditional role, women are the ones who leave the workforce temporarily to take care of their children. As a result, women tend to take lower paying jobs because they are more likely to have more flexible timings compared to higher-paying jobs. Since women are more likely to work fewer hours than men, they have less experience,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/04/14/here-are-the-facts-behind-that-79-cent-pay-gap-factoid/|title=Analysis &#124; Here are the facts behind that '79 cent' pay gap factoid|website=Washington Post}}</ref> which will cause women to be behind in the work force.

Another explanation of such gender pay gap is the distribution of housework. Couples who raise a child tend to designate the mother to do the larger share of housework and takes on the main responsibility of child care, and as a result women tend to have less time available for wage-earning. This reinforces the pay gap between male and female in the labor market, and now people are trapped in this self-reinforcing cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goldin|first1=Claudia|last2=Mitchell|first2=Joshua|date=February 2017|title=The New Life Cycle of Women's Employment: Disappearing Humps, Sagging Middles, Expanding Tops|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|issue=1|pages=161–182|doi=10.1257/jep.31.1.161|s2cid=157933907|issn=0895-3309|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22913.pdf}}</ref>

== Consequences ==
[[File:Cannes 2018 12.jpg|thumb|Female filmmakers protesting the gender pay gap and other [[Gender inequality|inequalities]] in the [[film industry]], during the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
The gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon [[Welfare|welfare payments]], especially in old age.

===For economic activity===
A 2009 report for the Australian [[Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] argued that in addition to fairness and equity there are also strong economic imperatives for addressing the gender wage gap.  The researchers estimated that a decrease in the gender wage gap from 17% to 16% would increase GDP per capita by approximately $260, mostly from an increase in the hours females would work. Ignoring opposing factors as hours females work increase, eliminating the whole gender wage gap from 17% could be worth around $93 billion or 8.5% of GDP. The researchers estimated the causes of the wage gap as follows, lack of work experience was 7%, lack of formal training was 5%, [[occupational segregation]] was 25%, working at smaller firms was 3%, and being female represented the remaining 60%.<ref name="natsem" />

An October 2012 study by the [[American Association of University Women]] found that over the course of 47 years, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2 million less than a man with the same education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/what-we-do/public-policy/aauw-issues/gender-pay-gap/|title=Women in their 20s earn more than men of same age, study finds|work=American Association of University Women}}</ref> Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a stimulus effect that would grow the United States economy by at least 3% to 4%.<ref>Laura Bassett (October 24, 2012) [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/gender-wage-gap-economic-stimulus_n_2007588.html "Closing The Gender Wage Gap Would Create 'Huge' Economic Stimulus, Economists Say"] ''Huffington Post''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/graduating-to-a-pay-gap-the-earnings-of-women-and-men-one-year-after-college-graduation.pdf|title=Graduating to a Pay Gap: The Earnings of Women and Men One Year after College Graduation|author1=Christianne Corbett|author2=Catherine Hill|date=October 2012|publisher=American Association of University Women|location=Washington, DC}}</ref>

===For women's pensions===
The [[European Commission]] argues that the pay gap has significant effects on pensions.  Since women's lifetime earnings are on average 17.5% (as of 2008) lower than men's, they have lower pensions.  As a result, elderly women are more likely to face poverty: 22% of women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty compared to 16% of men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/employment/110304_en.htm|title=Closing the gender pay gap|author=European Commission|author-link=European Commission|date=March 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306180420/http://ec.europa.eu/news/employment/110304_en.htm|archive-date=March 6, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===For learning===
Analysis conducted by the [[World Bank]] and available in the 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf|title=World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.}}</ref> connects earnings with skill accumulation, suggesting that women also accumulate less human capital (skills and knowledge) at work and through their careers. The report shows that the payoffs to work experience is lower for women across the world as compared to men. For example, in Venezuela, for each additional year of work, men's wages increase on average by 2.2 percent, compared to only 1.5 percent for women. In Denmark, by contrast, the payoffs to an additional year of work experience are the same for both men and women, at 5 percent on average. To address these differences, the report argues that governments could seek to remove limitations on the type or nature of work available to women and eliminate rules that limit women's property rights. [[Parental leave]], nursing breaks, and the possibility for flexible or part-time schedules are also identified as potential factors limiting women's learning in the workplace.

==Economic theories==
===Neoclassical models===
In certain [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] models, discrimination by employers can be inefficient; excluding or limiting employment of a specific group will raise the wages of groups not facing discrimination. Other firms could then gain a competitive advantage by hiring more workers from the group facing discrimination. As a result, in [[Long run and short run|the long run]] discrimination would not occur. However, this view depends on strong assumptions about the labor market and the [[production function]]s of the firms attempting to discriminate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Gary|s2cid=15060650|date=1993|title=Nobel Lecture: The Economic Way of Looking at Behavior|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|volume=101|issue=3|pages=387–389|doi=10.1086/261880|jstor=2138769}}</ref> Firms which discriminate on the basis of real or perceived customer or employee preferences would also not necessarily see discrimination disappear in the long run even under stylized models.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Labor Economics: Volume I|last1=Cain|first1=Glen G.|date=1986|isbn=9780444534521|editor1-last=Ashenfelter|editor1-first=Orley|pages=710–712|chapter=The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey|editor2-last=Laynard|editor2-first=R.}}</ref>

===Monopsony explanation===
In [[monopsony]] theory, which describes situations where there is only one buyer (in this case, a "buyer" for labor), [[Monopsony#Wage discrimination|wage discrimination]] can be explained by variations in labor mobility constraints between workers. Ransom and Oaxaca (2005) show that women appear to be less pay sensitive than men, and therefore employers take advantage of this and discriminate in their pay for women workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ransom|first1=Michael|last2=Oaxaca|first2=Ronald L.|author-link2=Ronald Oaxaca|date=January 2005|title=Intrafirm Mobility and Sex Differences in Pay|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp704.pdf|journal=[[Industrial and Labor Relations Review]]|volume=58|issue=2|pages=219–237|doi=10.1177/001979390505800203|jstor=30038574|citeseerx=10.1.1.224.3070|hdl=10419/20633|s2cid=153480792}}</ref>

==Policy measures==
===Anti-discrimination legislation===
According to the 2008 edition of the ''Employment Outlook'' report by the [[OECD]], almost all OECD countries have established laws to combat discrimination on grounds of gender. Examples of this are the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tharenou |first1=Phyllis |title=The Work of Feminists is Not Yet Done: The Gender Pay Gap—a Stubborn Anachronism |journal=Sex Roles |date=7 October 2012 |volume=68 |issue=3–4 |pages=198–206 |doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0221-8 |s2cid=144449088 }}</ref> Legal prohibition of discriminatory behavior, however, can only be effective if it is enforced. The OECD points out that:

<blockquote>herein lies a major problem: in all OECD countries, enforcement essentially relies on the victims' willingness to assert their claims. But many people are not even aware of their legal rights regarding discrimination in the workplace. And even if they are, proving a discrimination claim is intrinsically difficult for the claimant and legal action in courts is a costly process, whose benefits down the road are often small and uncertain. All this discourages victims from lodging complaints.<ref name="oecd1">[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook – 2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3–4.</ref></blockquote>

Moreover, although many OECD countries have put in place specialized anti-discrimination agencies, only in a few of them are these agencies effectively empowered, in the absence of individual complaints, to investigate companies, take actions against employers suspected of operating discriminatory practices, and sanction them when they find evidence of discrimination.<ref name="oecd1"/><ref name="oecd2">[[OECD]].

Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.</ref>

In 2003, the [[Government Accountability Office|U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that women in the United States, on average, earned 80% of what men earned in 2000 and workplace discrimination may be one contributing factor. In light of these findings, GAO examined the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the private and public sectors. In a 2008 report, GAO focused on the enforcement and outreach efforts of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (Labor). GAO found that EEOC does not fully monitor gender pay enforcement efforts and that Labor does not monitor enforcement trends and performance outcomes regarding gender pay or other specific areas of discrimination. GAO came to the conclusion that "federal agencies should better monitor their performance in enforcing anti-discrimination laws."<ref>U.S. Government Accountability Office.

[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08799.pdf Report ''Women's Earnings: Federal Agencies Should Better Monitor Their Performance in Enforcing Anti-Discrimination Laws''.]</ref>

In 2016, the EEOC proposed a rule to submit more information on employee wages by gender to better monitor and combat gender discrimination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/meetings/3-16-16/frye.cfm|title=Statement of Jocelyn Frye|website=www.eeoc.gov|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> In 2018, Iceland enacted legislation to reduce the country's pay gap.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/05/576082449/new-law-in-iceland-aims-at-reducing-countrys-gender-pay-gap|title=New Law In Iceland Aims At Reducing Country's Gender Pay Gap|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>

=== Awareness campaigns ===
Civil society groups organize awareness campaigns that include activities such as [[Equal Pay Day]] or the [[equal pay for equal work]] movement to increase the public attention received by the gender pay gap. For the same reason, various groups publish regular reports on the current state of gender pay differences. An example is the [[Global Gender Gap Report]].

=== Job flexibility ===
The growth of the [[temporary work|"gig" economy]] generates worker flexibility that, some{{who|date=November 2018}} have speculated, will favor women. However, the analysis of earnings among more than one million [[Uber]] drivers in the United States surprisingly showed that the gender pay gap between drivers is about 7% in favor of men. Uber's algorithm does not distinguish the gender of its workers, but men get more income because they choose better when and in which areas to work, and cancel and accept trips in a more lucrative way. Finally, men drive 2.2% faster than women, which also allows them to increase their income per unit of time.<ref name="uber1">{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf|title=The Gender Earnings Gap in the Gig Economy: Evidence from over a Million Rideshare Drivers|date=January 2018|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="uber2">{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b5c9112a-212b-11e8-9efc-0cd3483b8b80|title=Earning more is never a simple choice for women|date=6 March 2018|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="uber3">{{cite magazine|url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/uber-gender-pay-gap-study/|title=Pay Disparity Between Men and Women Even Exists in the Gig Economy|date=6 February 2018|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref> The study concludes the "gig" economy can perpetuate the gender pay gap even in the absence of discrimination.<ref name="uber1" /><ref name="uber2" /><ref name="uber3" />

In Australia, the Workplace Gender and Equality Agency (WGEA), an Australian Government statutory agency, publishes data from non-public sector Australian organizations.  There is a pay gap across all industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.wgea.gov.au/|title=WGEA Data Explorer|website=WGEA Data Explorer}}</ref> The gender pay gap is calculated on the average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time employees published by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]].

Australia has a persistent gender pay gap. Between 1990 and 2009, the gender pay gap remained within a narrow range of between 15 and 17%.<ref name="natsem">{{citation|author=National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling|url=http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf|title=The impact of a sustained gender wage gap on the economy|journal=Report to the Office for Women, Department of Families, Community Services, Housing and Indigenous Affairs|year=2009|pages=v–vi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201110158/http://www.actu.org.au/Images/Dynamic/attachments/6895/NATSEM_report.pdf|archive-date=December 1, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In August 2010, the Australian gender pay gap was 16.9%.<ref>{{citation|author=Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency|url=http://www.eowa.gov.au/Pay_Equity/Files/PE_STATS.pdf|title=Pay Equity Statistics|publisher=Australian Government|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217234222/http://www.eowa.gov.au/Pay_Equity/Files/PE_STATS.pdf|archive-date=February 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Ian Watson of [[Macquarie University]] examined the gender pay gap among full-time managers in Australia over the period 2001–2008, and found that between 65 and 90% of this earnings differential could not be explained by a large range of demographic and labor market variables. In fact, a "major part of the earnings gap is simply due to women managers being female". Watson also notes that despite the "characteristics of male and female managers being remarkably similar, their earnings are very different, suggesting that discrimination plays an important role in this outcome".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ian|last=Watson|year=2010|url=http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf|title=Decomposing the Gender Pay Gap in the Australian Managerial Labour Market|publisher=Macquarie University|journal=Australian Journal of Labour Economics|volume=13|number=1|pages=49–79|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306114914/http://www.business.curtin.edu.au/files/295watson1.pdf|archive-date=March 6, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> A 2009 report to the [[Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] also found that "simply being a woman is the major contributing factor to the gap in Australia, accounting for 60 per cent of the difference between women's and men's earnings, a finding which reflects other Australian research in this area". The second most important factor in explaining the pay gap was industrial segregation.<ref name="natsem" /> A report by the World Bank also found that women in Australia who worked part-time jobs and were married came from households which had a gendered distribution of labor, possessed high job satisfaction, and hence were not motivated to increase their working hours.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Gender Differences in Employment and Why They Matter|date=2011-09-12|publisher=The World Bank|isbn=9780821388105|series=World Development Report|pages=[https://archive.org/details/genderequalityde0000unse/page/198 198–253]|doi=10.1596/9780821388105_ch5|title=World Development Report 2012|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/genderequalityde0000unse/page/198}}</ref>

=== Brazil ===
{{Cleanup section|reason=needs tweaking for tone, flow|date=May 2018}}

The Global Gender Gap Report ranks Brazil at 95 out of 144 countries on pay equality for like jobs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Derocher |first1=John |title=Student |url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2018/latin-america-and-the-caribbean/ |website=Global Gender Gap Report 2018 |publisher=World Economic Forum |access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref>  Brazil has a score of 0.684, which is a little below 2017's global index.  In 2017, Brazil was one of the 6 countries that fully closed their gaps on both the Health and Survival and Educational Attainment sub-indexes. However, Brazil saw a setback in the progress towards gender parity this year, with its overall gender gap standing at its widest point since 2011. This is due to an exponential growth of Brazil's Political Empowerment gender gap, which measures the ratio of females in the parliament and at a ministerial level, that is too large to be counterbalanced by a range of modest improvements across the country's Economic Participation and Opportunity sub-index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2017|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2017|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref>

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]], or IBGE, women in Brazil study more, work more and earn less than men. On average, combining paid work, household chores and caring for people, women work three hours a week more than men. In fact, the average women will  work 54.4 hours a week, and the average man will only work 51.4 hours per week. Despite that, even with a higher educational level, women earn, on average, less than men do. Although the difference between men's and women's earnings has declined in recent years, in 2016 women still received the equivalent of 76.5% of men's earnings. One of the factors that may explain this difference is that only 37.8% of management positions in 2016 were held by women. According to IBGE, occupational segregation and the wage discrimination of women in the labor market also have an important role in the wage difference between men and women.<ref>Manhaes, Gisele Flores Caldas.

The survey also pointed out that 92.3% of domestic workers, a job culturally known as "feminine" and that pays low wages, are women.

In Brazil, under law, female workers may opt to take 6 months of maternity leave that must be fully paid by the employer. Many researches are concerned with this regulations. They question if these regulations may actually force workers into informal jobs, where they will have no rights at all. In fact, women who work on informal jobs earn only 50% of the average women in formal jobs. Between men the difference is less radical: men working on informal jobs earn 60% of the average men in formal jobs.<ref>Madalozzo, Regina (June 2010).

A study of wages among Canadian [[Supply chain management|supply chain managers]] found that men make an average of $14,296 a year more than women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Paul D.|last2=Morris|first2=Matthew|title=Sex and salary: Does size matter?

Women in Canada are more likely to seek employment opportunities which greatly contrast the ones of men. About 20 percent of women between the ages of 25 and 54 will make just under $12 an hour in Canada. The demographic of women who take jobs paying less than $12 an hour is also a proportion that is twice as large as the proportion of men taking on the same type of [[McJob|low-wage work]]. There still remains the question of why such a trend seems to resonate throughout the developed world. One identified societal factor that has been identified is the influx of women of color and immigrants into the work force. These groups both tend to be subject to lower paying jobs from a statistical perspective.<ref>Congress, C. L. (n.d.).

The term "leftover women" produces anxieties for women to rush marriage, delaying employment. In alignment with the traditional gender roles, the "Women Return to the Home" movement by the government encouraged women to leave their jobs to alleviate the men's unemployment rate.<ref name=Yoon2015>{{cite journal |last=Yoon |first=Jayoung |title=Labor Market Outcomes for Women in East Asia |journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies |volume=21 |issue=4 |year=2015 |pages=384–408 |doi=10.1080/12259276.2015.1106861 |s2cid=155639216 }}</ref>

[[File:EU 27 Gender Pay Gap 2014.png|thumb|Gender gap in average gross hourly earnings according to [[Eurostat]] 2014.<ref name="EC stats" />]]

At [[European Union|EU]] level, the gender pay gap is defined as the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of women and men within the economy as a whole. [[Eurostat]] found a persisting gender pay gap of 17.5% on average in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] in 2008.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} There were considerable differences between the Member States, with the non-adjusted pay gap ranging from less than 10% in Italy, Slovenia, Malta, Romania, Belgium, Portugal, and Poland to more than 20% in Slovakia, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, United Kingdom, and Greece and more than 25% in Estonia and Austria.<ref name="EC stats">[[European Commission]].

A recent survey of international employment law firms showed that gender pay gap reporting is not a common policy internationally. Despite such laws on a national level being few and far between, there are calls for regulation on an EU level. A recent (as of December 2015) resolution of the European Parliament urged the Commission to table legislation closing the pay gap. A proposal that is substantively the same as the UK plan was passed by 344 votes to 156 in the European Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20151002IPR95366/pay-gap-between-men-and-women-meps-call-for-binding-measures-to-close-it|title=Pay gap between men and women: MEPs call for binding measures to close it {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|website=News {{!}} European Parliament|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>

The European Commission has stated that the undervaluation of female work is one of the main contributors to the persisting gender pay gap.<ref>{{cite web|title = Wo liegen die Ursachen? - Europäische Kommission|url = http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_de.htm|website = ec.europa.eu|access-date = 2012-02-18}}</ref> They add that explanations of the pay gap goes beyond discrimination, and that other factors contributes in upholding the gap: factors such as work-life balance, the issue of women in leadership and the glass ceiling, and sectoral segregation, which has to do with the overrepresentation of women in low-paying sectors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The gender pay gap situation in the EU |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/equal-pay/gender-pay-gap-situation-eu_en |website=European Commission - European Commission |language=en}}</ref>

==== Finland ====
On average, between 1995 and 2005, women in Finland earned 28.4% less in non-adjusted salaries than men.<ref name="Nupponen"/> Taking into account the high [[progressive tax]] rate in Finland, the net income difference was 22.7%.<ref name="Nupponen"/> Adjusted for the amount of hours worked (and not including unpaid [[Conscription in Finland|national military service]] hours), these wage differences are reduced to approximately 5.7% (non taxed) and 0.4% (tax-adjusted).<ref name="Nupponen"/>

The difference in the amount of hours worked is largely attributed to social factors; for example, women in Finland spend considerably more time on domestic work instead.<ref name="Nupponen"/> Other considerable factors are increased pay rates for [[overtime]] and evening/night-time work, of which men in Finland, on average, work more.<ref name="Nupponen"/> When comparing people with the same job title, women in [[public sector]] positions earn approximately 99% of their male counterparts, while those in the [[private sector]] only earn 95%.<ref name="jylkkari">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.jylkkari.fi/2017/02/naisen-euron-mysteeri-asiantuntijat-selittavat-palkkaeron-syita/|last=Järvenpää|first=Heidi|magazine=Jyväskylän ylioppilaslehti|title=Naisen euron mysteeri – asiantuntijat selittävät palkkaeron syitä|language=fi|date=13 February 2017|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref> Public sector positions are generally more rigidly defined, allowing for less negotiation in individual wages and overtime/evening/night-time work.

==== Germany ====
Women earn 22–23% less than men, according to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany]]. The revised gender pay gap was 6–8% in the years 2006–2013.<ref>{{cite web|title = Pressemitteilungen - Gender Pay Gap 2013 bei Vollzeitbeschäftigten besonders hoch - Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|url = https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2014/03/PD14_104_621.html|website = Federal Statistical Office of German|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141115211450/https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2014/03/PD14_104_621.html|access-date = 2016-02-18|archive-date = 2014-11-15}}</ref> The [[Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft|Cologne Institute for Economic Research]] adjusted the wage gap to less than 2%. They reduced the gender pay gap from 25% to 11% by taking in account the work hours, education and the period of employment. The difference in revenue was reduced furthermore if women had not paused their job for more than 18 months due to motherhood.<ref>{{cite web|title = Beschäftigungsperspektiven von Frauen - Nur 2 Prozent Gehaltsunterschied|url = http://www.iwkoeln.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/beitrag/beschaeftigungsperspektiven-von-frauen-nur-2-prozent-gehaltsunterschied-102500|website = German Institute for Economic Research|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Gender Pay Gap: Wie groß ist der Unterschied wirklich?|url = http://www.zeit.de/karriere/beruf/2013-03/lohnunterschied-geschlechter-statistik|newspaper = Die Zeit|access-date = 2016-02-18|issn = 0044-2070}}</ref>

The most significant factors associated with the remaining gender pay gap are part-time work, education and occupational segregation (less women in leading positions and in fields like [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]).<ref>{{Cite news|title = Studie: Geschlecht senkt Gehalt um sieben Prozent|url = http://www.zeit.de/karriere/2013-03/gehalt-studie-frauen-maenner|newspaper = Die Zeit|access-date = 2016-02-18|issn = 0044-2070}}</ref>

==== Luxembourg ====
In [[Luxembourg]], the total gender income gap represents 32.5%.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/aid_development_cooperation_fundamental_rights/equalpayday_factsheets_2018_country_files_luxembourg_en.pdf|title=The gender pay gap in Luxembourg|date=November 2018|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> The gender pay gap of full-time workers regarding monthly gross wages has narrowed over the past few years. According to the data from [[OECD]] (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) the gender pay gap dropped over 10% between 2002 and 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/LMF_1_5_Gender_pay_gaps_for_full_time_workers.pdf|title=LMF1.5: Gender pay gaps for full-time workers and earnings differentials by educational attainment|date=September 18, 2018|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref> The gap is also dependent on the age group. Females between the ages of 25–34 years are getting higher wages than males in this time period. One of the reasons for that is that they have a higher level of education during this age. From the age of 35 years males earn higher salaries than females.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://statistiques.public.lu/catalogue-publications/bulletin-Statec/2017/PDF-Bulletin1-2017.pdf|title=BULLETIN DU STATEC 1 Salaires, emploi et conditions de travail Sommaire|date=February 2017|website=statistiques.public.lu|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref>

The current extent of gender pay gap refers to different factors such as varying working hours and diverse participation in the labor market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3888793/8979317/KS-TC-18-003-EN-N.pdf/3a6c9295-5e66-4b79-b009-ea1604770676|title=A decomposition of the unadjusted gender pay gap using Structure of Earnings Survey data|date=May 2018}}</ref> More females (30.4%) than males (4.6%) are working part-time,<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/LISCenter/3-Page-17-41.pdf|title=Gender, Employment, and Parenthood: The Consequences of Work-Family Policies|date=2015}}</ref> due to this fact the overall working hours for females are lowered.<ref name="auto1"/> The labor force participation represents 60.3% for females and 76% for males, because most women will take advantage of the maternity leave.<ref name="auto2"/> Males participate more often in higher paid jobs, for instance in executive positions (93.7%), what affects the scale of the gender pay gap as well.<ref name="auto1"/>

There is also a gender gap in [[Vocational education|vocational degree]] (12%) and apprentice training (3.4%) in Luxembourg.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=World Politics|volume=59|issue=1|pages=142–175|date=October 2006|jstor = 40060158|last1 = Estévez-Abe|first1 = Margarita|title=Gendering the Varieties of Capitalism.

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, recent numbers from the CBS (Central Bureau voor statistieken; ''English: Central Bureau of Statistics'') claim that the pay gap is getting smaller. Adjusted for occupation level, education level, experience level, and 17 other variables the difference in earnings in businesses has fallen from 9% (2008) to 7% (2014) and in government from 7% (2008) to 5% (2014). Without adjustments the gap is for businesses 20% (2014) and government 10% (2014). Young women earn more than men up until the age of 30, this is mostly due to a higher level of education. Women in the Netherlands, up until the age of 30, have a higher educational level on average than men; after this age men have on average a higher educational degree. The chance can also be caused by women getting pregnant and start taking part-time jobs so they can care for the children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/47/krijgen-mannen-en-vrouwen-gelijk-loon-voor-gelijk-werk-|title=Krijgen mannen en vrouwen gelijk loon voor gelijk werk?|last=CBS|website=www.cbs.nl|language=nl-NL|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>

{{main|Gender pay gap in India}}
For the year 2013, the gender pay gap in [[India]] was estimated to be 24.81%.<ref name="wageindicator">{{cite web|title=Gender Pay Gap in the Formal Sector: 2006 - 2013(September, 2013)|url=http://www.wageindicator.org/documents/publicationslist/publications-2013/gender-pay-gap-in-formal-sector-in-india-2006-2013|publisher=Wage Indicator Data Report}}</ref> Further, while analyzing the level of female participation in the economy, a report slots India as one of the bottom 10 countries on its list. Thus, in addition to unequal pay, there is also unequal representation, because while women constitute almost half the Indian population (about 48% of the total), their representation in the work force amounts to only about one-fourth of the total.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/11thf.htm|title=Eleventh Five Year Plan 2007-2012|website=planningcommission.nic.in}}</ref>

===Japan===
{{see also|Overview of inequality in Japan}}
Jayoung Yoon analyzes Japan's culture of the traditional male breadwinner model, where the husband works outside of the house while the wife is the caretaker. Despite these traditional gender roles for women, Japan's government aims to enhance the economy by improving the labor policies for mothers with [[Abenomics]], an economy revitalization strategy. Yoon believes Abenomics represents a desire to remedy the effects of an aging population rather than a desire to promote gender equality. Evidence for the conclusion is the finding that women are entering the workforce in contingent positions for a secondary income and a company need of part-time workers based on mechanizing, outsourcing and subcontracting. Therefore, Yoon states that women's participation rates do not seem to be influenced by government policies but by companies' necessities.<ref name=Yoon2015 />  ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'' said that Japan's economic participation and opportunity ranking (106th), 145th being the broadest gender gap, dropped from 2014 "due to lower wage equality for similar work and fewer female legislators, senior officials and managers".<ref name="Schwab2015"/>{{rp|25–27}}

===Korea===
As stated by Jayoung Yoon, [[South Korea]]'s female employment rate has increased since the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] as a result of women 25 to 34 years old leaving the workforce later to become pregnant and women 45 to 49 years old returning to the workforce. Mothers are more likely to continue working after child rearing on account of the availability of affordable childcare services provided for mothers previously in the workforce or the difficulty to be rehired after taking time off to raise their children.<ref name=Yoon2015 /> The World Economic Forum found that, in 2015, South Korea had a score of 0.55, 1.00 being equality, for pay equality for like jobs. From a total of 145 countries, South Korea had a gender gap ranking of 115th (the lower the ranking, the narrower the gender gap). On the other hand, political empowerment dropped to half of the percentage of women in the government in 2014.<ref name="Schwab2015"/>{{rp|26, 228}}

In 2018, the gender wage gap in [[South Korea]] is of 34.6% and women earned about 65.4% of what men did on average, according to [[OECD]] data.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Delfino |first1=Devon |title=12 countries where men earn significantly more than women |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-with-the-gender-pay-gap-2018-8#a-fight-for-gender-equality-13 |website=Business Insider}}</ref>  With regards to monthly earnings, including part-time jobs, the gender gap can be explained primarily by the fact that women work few hours than men, but occupation and industry segregation also pay an important role.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Pursuit of Gender Equality - An Uphill Battle |journal=OECD ILibrary |url=https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/the-pursuit-of-gender-equality_9789264281318-en |language=en}}</ref>

In addition, as many women leave the workplace once married or pregnant, the gender gap in pension entitlements is affected too, which in turn impacts the poverty level.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of Gender Equality: An Uphill Battle |website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org |year=2017 |doi=10.1787/9789264281318-en |isbn=9789264281301 |language=en}}</ref>

[[North Korea]], on the other hand, is one of few countries where women earn more than men.

=== New Zealand ===
Although recent studies have shown that the [[gender pay gap in New Zealand|gender wage gap in New Zealand]] has diminished in the last two decades, the gap continues to affect many women today. According to StatsNZ, the wage gap was measured to be 9.4 percent in September 2017. Back in 1998, it was measured to be approximately 16.3 percent. There are several different factors that affect New Zealand's wage gap. However, researchers claim that 80 percent of these factors cannot be elucidated, which often causes difficulty in understanding the gap.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=Gender Pay Gap|url=http://women.govt.nz/work-skills/income/gender-pay-gap|website=Women.govt|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>

In order to calculate the gap, New Zealand makes use of several different methods. The official gap is calculated by [[Statistics New Zealand]].

In fact, the overall goal of the [[OECD]] is to fix the wage gap so that gender no longer plays a significant role in an individual's income.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender Wage Gaps|url=http://www.oecd.org/std/37964069.pdf|website=oecd|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Although it has been a gradual change, New Zealand is one of the countries that has seen notable progress and researchers have predicted that it will continue to do so.

=== Russia ===
{{main|Gender pay gap in Russia}}
A wage gap exists in [[Russia]] (after 1991, but also before) and [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] shows that most of it cannot be explained by lower qualifications of women compared to men. On the other hand, [[occupational segregation]] by gender and [[Sexism|labor market discrimination]] seem to account for a large share of it.<ref name=Newell2001>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0939-3625(01)00028-0| title = The Gender Pay Gap in the Transition from Communism: Some Empirical Evidence| journal = Economic Systems| volume = 25| issue = 4| pages = 287–304| year = 2001| last1 = Newell | first1 = A. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = B. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.202.9177| s2cid = 17330181}}</ref><ref name=globulin>{{cite journal |last=Ogloblin |first=C.

The [[October Revolution]] (1917) and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, have shaped the developments in the gender wage gap. These two main turning points in the [[History of Russia|Russian history]] frame the analysis of Russia's gender pay gap found in the economic literature. Consequently, the pay gap study can be examined for two periods: the wage gap in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] (1917–1991) and the wage gap in the transition and post-transition (after 1991).

===Singapore===
According to Jayoung Yoon, Singapore's aging population and low fertility rates are resulting in more women joining the labor force in response to the government's desire to improve the economy. The government provides tax relief to mothers in the workforce to encourage them to continue working. Yoon states that "as female employment increases, the gender gap in employment rates…narrows down" in Singapore.<ref name=Yoon2015 /> ''The Global Gender Gap Report 2015'' ranks Singapore's gender gap at 54th out of 145 states globally based on the economic participation and opportunity, the educational attainment, the health and survival, and the political empowerment sub-indexes (a lower rank means a smaller gender gap). The gender gap narrowed from 2014's ranking of 59. In the Asia and Pacific region, Singapore has evolved the most in the economic participation and opportunity sub-index, yet it is lower than the region's means in educational attainment and political empowerment.<ref name="Schwab2015"/>{{rp|25–27}}

The extent to which discrimination plays a role in explaining gender wage disparities is somewhat difficult to quantify. A 2010 research review by the majority staff of the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] reported that studies have consistently found unexplained pay differences even after controlling for measurable factors that are assumed to influence earnings – suggestive of unknown/non-measurable contributing factors of which gender discrimination may be one.<ref name="jec p80">{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] |url=http://jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File_id=9118a9ef-0771-4777-9c1f-8232fe70a45c |title=Invest in Women, Invest in America: A Comprehensive Review of Women in the U.S. Economy |location=Washington, DC |date=December 2010 |page=80}}</ref> Other studies have found direct evidence of discrimination – for example, more jobs went to women when the applicant's sex was unknown during the hiring process.<ref name="jec p80" />
