'''Alcatel-Lucent S.A.''' ({{IPA-fr|alkatɛl lysɛnt}}) was a French/American global [[telecommunications equipment]] company, headquartered in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], France. It was formed in 2006 by the merger of France-based Alcatel and U.S.-based [[Lucent]], the latter being a successor of [[AT&T]]'s [[Western Electric]] and [[Bell_Labs|Bell Labs]].<ref name="finallyseal" />

In 2014, the Alcatel-Lucent group split into two: [[Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise]], providing enterprise communication services, and Alcatel-Lucent, selling to communications operators. The enterprise business was sold to a Chinese company in the same year, and in 2016 [[Nokia]] purchased the rest of Alcatel-Lucent. 

The company focused on [[Fixed line telephone|fixed]], [[Mobile phone|mobile]] and [[telecommunications convergence|converged]] [[networking hardware]], [[Internet protocol|IP]] technologies, [[Telecommunications convergence#Telecommunication convergence business support systems|software]] and services, with operations in more than 130 countries. It had been named Industry Group Leader for Technology Hardware & Equipment sector in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices review<ref>http://www.sustainability-indices.com/images/140911-djsi-review-2014-en-vdef.pdf</ref> and listed in the 2014 Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators for the 4th consecutive year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/press-releases/112014/2014-top-100-innovators|title=Thomson Reuters Names the 2014 Top 100 Global Innovators|access-date=18 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122020916/http://thomsonreuters.com/press-releases/112014/2014-top-100-innovators|archive-date=22 January 2015}}</ref> Alcatel-Lucent also owned [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], one of the largest research and development facilities in the communications industry, whose employees have been awarded nine Nobel Prizes and the company holds in excess of 29,000 patents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2018/12/18/2018-nobel-prize-in-physics-laureate-arthur-ashkin-delivers-his-nobel-lecture-at-nokia-bell-labs/|title=2018 Nobel Prize in Physics laureate Arthur Ashkin delivers his Nobel Lecture at Nokia Bell Labs|website=Nokia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Rue de la Boétie, 54-56.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Alcatel-Lucent head office to 2009]]
Alcatel-Lucent was formed when Alcatel (originally short for the Société '''Al'''sacienne de '''C'''onstructions '''A'''tomiques, de '''T'''élécommunications et d''''Él'''ectronique, a small company in [[Mulhouse]] absorbed by CGE in 1966) merged with [[Lucent Technologies]] on 1 December 2006. However, the predecessors of the company have been a part of telecommunications industry since the late 19th century. The company has roots in two early telecommunications companies: La Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) and the [[Western Electric Manufacturing Company]].<ref name="lucenthistory">{{cite web

Western Electric began in 1869 when [[Elisha Gray]] and Enos N. Barton started a manufacturing firm based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], US. By 1880, the company had relocated to Chicago, Illinois, and become the largest electrical manufacturing company in the United States. In 1881, the American Bell Telephone Company, founded by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and forerunner of [[American Telephone & Telegraph]] ([[AT&T]]), purchased a controlling interest in Western Electric and made it the exclusive developer and manufacturer of equipment for the [[Bell System|Bell telephone companies]].<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

CGE was formed in 1898 by French engineer Pierre Azaria in the [[Alsace]] region of what was then Germany and was a conglomerate involved in industries such as electricity, transportation, electronics and telecommunications. CGE would become a leader in digital communications and would also be known for building the [[TGV]] (train à grande vitesse) high-speed trains in France.<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

[[File:Alcatel One Touch 535, front side (filtered cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Alcatel One Touch 535, front side (introduced July 2003)|left]]

[[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] was created in 1925 from the consolidation of the R&D organizations of Western Electric and AT&T. Bell Labs would make significant scientific advances including: the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], the [[solar cell]], the digital signal processor chip, the [[Unix]] [[operating system]] and the [[cellular network|cellular concept of mobile telephone service]]. Bell Labs researchers have won 7 [[Nobel Prizes]].<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

Also in 1925, Western Electric sold its International Western Electric Company subsidiary to [[ITT Corporation]]. CGE purchased the telecommunications part of ITT in the mid-1980s.<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

AT&T re-entered the European telecommunications market in 1984 following the [[Bell System divestiture]]. Philips promoted the venture in part because its [[PRX (telephony)|PRX]] public switching technology was ageing and it sought a partner to help fund the development costs of digital switching. The joint company used the existing manufacturing and development facilities in [[The Hague]], [[Hilversum]], [[Brussels]] and [[Malmesbury]] as well as its U.S. resources to adapt the [[5ESS switch|5ESS]] system to the European market. The joint venture company AT&T & Philips Telecommunications BV doubled annual turnover between 1984 and 1987, winning major switching and transmission contracts, mainly in the effectively captive Netherlands market. In 1987, AT&T increased its holding to 60% and in 1990 it purchased the remainder of the Philips' holding.

In 1998, Alcatel Alsthom shifted its focus to the telecommunications industry, spinning off its Alsthom activities and changing the company's name to Alcatel. AT&T spun off Lucent Technologies in April 1996 with an [[initial public offering]] (IPO).<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

In April 2004, [[TCL Corporation]] and Alcatel announced the creation of a mobile phone manufacturing joint venture: [[Alcatel Mobile Phones]]. A year later Alcatel sold its share in the joint venture but licensed the Alcatel brand name to TCL, which continues to this day under [[Nokia]].

===Merger===
Facing intense competition in the telecommunications industry, Alcatel and Lucent Technologies merged on 30 November 2006.<ref name="mergertimeline2006">{{cite web|title=Alcatel-Lucent Merger Timeline |work=News Features |publisher=Alcatel-Lucent |year=2006 |url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features/News_Feature_Detail_000046.xml |access-date=2010-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930041108/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/%21ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA%21%21?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features%2FNews_Feature_Detail_000046.xml |archive-date=2011-09-30 }}</ref>

On 5 April 2006, Alcatel announced that it would swap its shares of [[Alcatel Alenia Space]] and [[Telespazio]] for €673 million and a 12.1% stake in Thales, a key player in the French defence industry. This increased Alcatel's stake in [[Thales Group|Thales]] to 20.8%.<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

Alcatel-Lucent acquired [[Nortel]]'s [[UMTS]] radio access business at the end of 2006. During 2007 the company acquired Canadian [[wavelength-division multiplexing|metro WDM networking]] supplier Tropic Networks, Inc.; enterprise services gateway products developer NetDevices; [[IPTV]] software company Tamblin; and the telecommunications consulting practice Thompson Advisory Group, Inc. Alcatel-Lucent had a joint venture with Dutch company [[Draka Holding]] N.V. for manufacturing [[optical fibre]], but Draka bought out Alcatel-Lucent's 49.9% stake for €209 million in December 2007.<ref>{{citation|periodical=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/12/18/afx4450827.html|date=2007-12-18|access-date=2010-07-28|title=Draka to pay 209 mln eur to Alcatel-Lucent for 49.9 pct stake in Comteq JV|last=Leers|first=Kaj}}</ref> [[Motive, Inc.]], a Texas-based provider of service management software for broadband and mobile data services, was acquired in 2008.<ref name="lucenthistory"/>

In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first patent for the [[telephone]], and subsequently started [[AT&T]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AT&T History|url=http://www.corp.att.com/history/|access-date=26 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607083754/http://www.corp.att.com/history/|archive-date=7 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bell Labs]] is named in his honor.

In 1937, [[Clinton Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter. His fundamental work is part of the foundation for much of today's solid-state electronics.

In 1947, John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, William Shockley of Bell Labs invented the [[transistor]]. In 1956, they received a [[Nobel Prize]] for their invention.  The transistor led to an electronics revolution during the post-war boom. The transition from [[vacuum tubes]] to transistors enabled all technologies to be built on a smaller scale and use less electricity. Items that before required large dedicated spaces, could now fit into a home or even on a kitchen counter.<ref>{{cite web|title=IEEE Global History Network: Transistors|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Transistors}}</ref>

In 1954, [[Gerald Pearson]], Darryl Chapin and [[Calvin Fuller]] invented the [[solar cell]]. [[Telstar]], the first active communications satellite also developed by Bell Labs and launched in 1962, used these solar cell batteries as an external renewable source of power once launched. It was the first to carry live television over water, between England and the US.

In the late 1950s, [[Charles Townes]] and Arthur Shawlow of Bell Labs invented the [[laser]], which has numerous applications, including measuring/cutting in the manufacturing industry and research/surgery in the medical industry. Bell Labs was awarded the laser patent in 1960.

In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] discovered the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1978.

In 1969, [[Dennis Ritchie]] and a team of Bell Labs employees invented the [[UNIX]] operating system and the [[C programming language]].

In 2006, [[Willard S. Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]] were awarded the [[National Academy of Engineering]] prize, for work on [[charge-coupled device]]s which transform patterns of light into useful digital information. In 2009, they received a Nobel Prize for their invention. The device is widely used in digital cameras, video cameras and modern astronomy.

In 2013, there was a Net R&D investment of €2.3 billion (approx. 16% of sales).
There are more than 32,000 active patents, more than 3,000 obtained in 2013, and 14,900 pending patent applications.

==Awards and distinctions==
* July 2013 – In a test conducted on the Villarceaux campus of Alcatel-Lucent in [[Nozay, Essonne|Nozay]] (near [[Paris]]), the [[Bell Labs]] researchers have successfully done Data Transmission from a speed of 31 terabits per second (T−bps) at a distance of 7,200&nbsp;km, a capacity more than three times higher than the most advanced commercial submarine cables that exist today.

The investigators were able to obtain greater capacity ever obtained in underwater data transmission with a single fiber. This experiment was based on the pioneering work of Bell Labs in data channels in a single carrier of 200 gigabits per second (Gbit/s). As speeds and distances to such noise and signal distortion make recovery of the data a real challenge, the researchers used innovative detection techniques and applied a new set of technologies modulation, transmission and processing together with an advanced error correction coding.<ref>[http://www.businesscol.com/noticias/fullnews.php?id=26594 31 Terabits por segundo: Alcatel-Lucent bate récord mundial de transmisión de datos submarina].

===Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft===
{{Main|Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft}}
Lucent Technologies filed suit against [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] and [[Dell]], claiming they had violated patents on [[MP3]], [[MPEG]] and other technologies developed by [[Bell Labs]], a division of predecessor company [[American Telephone & Telegraph]]. Microsoft voluntarily joined the lawsuit in April 2003, and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent.

The first part of the case involved two audio coding patents that Alcatel-Lucent claimed were infringed by Microsoft's Windows Media Player application. Alcatel-Lucent won the trial and $1.52 billion in damages, but the judge granted<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/download/legal/Other/08-06-07Alcatel-LucentRuling.pdf Pleading Paper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Microsoft's motion for judgment and new trial.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6388273.stm | work=BBC News | title=Microsoft faces $1.5bn MP3 payout | date=2007-02-22 | access-date=2010-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft+hit+with+1.5+billion+patent+verdict/2100-1030_3-6161480.html?tag=nefd.top|title=Microsoft hit with $1.5 billion patent verdict|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|access-date=18 April 2015}}</ref>  Alcatel-Lucent appealed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://origin.arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070806-judge-tosses-verdict-1-52-billion-award-in-microsoft-mp3-patent-case.html |title=Judge tosses verdict, $1.52 billion award in Microsoft MP3 patent case |first=Eric |last=Bangeman |publisher=arstechnica |date=2007-08-06 |access-date=2007-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829163955/http://origin.arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070806-judge-tosses-verdict-1-52-billion-award-in-microsoft-mp3-patent-case.html |archive-date=29 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the second part of the case, the judge ruled that Microsoft had not violated Alcatel-Lucent's patents relating to speech recognition and the case was therefore dismissed before going to trial. Alcatel-Lucent intended to appeal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft+wins+in+second+Alcatel-Lucent+patent+suit/2100-1014_3-6163828.html?tag=nefd.top| title=Microsoft wins in second Alcatel-Lucent patent suit| first=Anne| last= Broache| publisher= CNET News.com| date= 2007-03-02| access-date=2007-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129581-c,legalissues/article.html| title=One Patent Claim Against Microsoft Dropped| first=Elizabeth| last= Montalbano| date=2007-03-03| access-date=2007-03-04}}</ref>

The third part of the case, involving several user interface-related patents, began on 21 May 2013.

Additional patent infringement cases, some filed by Microsoft and some filed by Alcatel-Lucent, are pending in the United States.
