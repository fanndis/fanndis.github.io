'''George Gideon Oliver Osborne''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CH}} (born '''Gideon Oliver Osborne'''; 23 May 1971) is a British politician and newspaper editor who served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] from 2010 to 2016. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he was [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] from 2001 to 2017. He was editor of the ''[[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]]'' from 2017 to 2020 before becoming editor-in-chief of the newspaper. He has been chair of the [[Northern Powerhouse]] Partnership (NPP) since 2016.

Osborne worked briefly as a freelancer for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' before joining the [[Conservative Research Department]] in 1994 and becoming head of its political section. He went on to be a [[Special adviser (UK)|special adviser]] to [[Douglas Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]], the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], and worked at [[10 Downing Street]] as well as for Prime Minister [[John Major]]'s campaign team in the party's unsuccessful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] campaign, before becoming a speechwriter and political secretary to Major's successor as party leader, [[William Hague]].

Osborne was elected as MP for Tatton in 2001, becoming the youngest Conservative member of the House of Commons. He was appointed [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] by Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] in 2004. The following year he ran David Cameron's successful [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|party leadership campaign]]. Cameron then appointed him [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and, after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Chancellor of the Exchequer in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron–Clegg coalition government]]. He served as [[David Cameron|Cameron's]] de facto [[Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party]] in opposition and in government alongside [[William Hague]], and continued in this role following the latter's retirement from the [[House of Commons]] in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].

As Chancellor, Osborne pursued austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit and launched the Northern Powerhouse initiative. After the Conservatives won an overall majority in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Cameron reappointed him Chancellor in his [[Second Cameron ministry|second government]] and gave him the additional title of [[First Secretary of State]]. During the premiership of David Cameron, George Osborne was widely viewed as a potential future Leader of the Conservative Party; one Conservative MP suggested that the closeness of his relationship with Cameron meant that the two effectively shared power during the duration of the Cameron Government. Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union]] and Cameron's consequent resignation, he was dismissed by newly-appointed Prime Minister [[Theresa May]]. He returned to the [[backbencher|backbenches]] for a year before leaving public office.

In 1993, Osborne intended to pursue a career in journalism. He was shortlisted for, but failed to gain a place on, ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} trainee scheme; he also applied to ''[[The Economist]]'', where he was interviewed and rejected by [[Gideon Rachman]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Kuper |first= Simon |date= 7 July 2016 |title= Brexit: a coup by one set of public schoolboys against another |url= https://next.ft.com/content/f4dedd92-43c7-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d |website= ft.com |accessdate= 8 July 2016 }}</ref> In the end, he had to settle for freelance work on the 'Peterborough' diary column in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=guardian28112011>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/28/real-george-osborne |title=The real George Osborne |date=28 November 2011 |website=theguardian.com |accessdate=8 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702205342/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/28/real-george-osborne |archive-date=2 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> One of his Oxford friends, journalist George Bridges, alerted Osborne some time later to a research vacancy at [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]].<ref name=guardian28112011 />

== Early political career ==
Osborne joined the [[Conservative Research Department]] in 1994, and became head of its Political Section. One of his first roles was to go to [[Blackpool]] and observe the October 1994 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/28/real-george-osborne The real George Osborne] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107173809/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/28/real-george-osborne |date=7 January 2017 }}. Andy Beckett. ''The Guardian''. 28 November 2011.</ref>

Between 1995 and 1997 he worked as a [[Special advisers (UK government)|special adviser]] to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] [[Douglas Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]] (during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] crisis), and in the [[Prime Minister's Office (United Kingdom)|Political Office at 10 Downing Street]]. Osborne worked on Prime Minister [[John Major]]'s campaign team in 1997, in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|Tories' heavy election defeat that year]].<ref name="FTprofile">{{Cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64902ee6-7baa-11dd-b839-000077b07658.html?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true |title=Profile: George Osborne |last=Eaglesham |first=Jean |date=6 September 2008 |work=Financial Times |access-date=22 March 2017 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> After the election, he again considered journalism, approaching ''[[The Times]]'' to be a leader writer, though nothing came of it.

Between 1997 and 2001 he worked for [[William Hague]], Major's successor as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader, as a speechwriter and political secretary. He helped to prepare Hague for the weekly session of [[Prime Minister's Questions]],<ref name="FTprofile" /> often playing the role of Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. Under the subsequent leaderships of [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]], he remained on the Prime Minister's Questions team.

== Member of Parliament ==
Osborne was elected as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]], Cheshire, at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|June 2001 election]]. He succeeded [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] MP [[Martin Bell]], who had defeated the controversial former Conservative minister [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] but had kept his promise not to stand there at the following election. Osborne won with a majority of 8,611 over the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, becoming (at that time) the youngest Conservative MP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. At [[2005 United Kingdom general election|the 2005 election]] he was re-elected with an increased majority of 11,731 (securing 51.8% of the vote), and [[2010 United Kingdom general election|in 2010]] increased his majority still further to 14,487.

== Shadow Chancellor (2005–2010) ==

He was appointed in September 2004 by then Conservative leader Michael Howard to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], as [[Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury]].

Following the 2005 general election, Howard promoted him to [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the young age of 33. Howard had initially offered the post to William Hague, who turned it down. Press reports suggest that the second choice for the post was David Cameron, who also rejected the job, preferring to take on a major public service portfolio (he was made [[Shadow Secretary of State for Education]]). Thus, Howard seems to have turned to Osborne as his third choice for the role.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hague rejects post of shadow chancellor |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 May 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/12/conservatives.whitehall |accessdate=4 May 2008 |first=Nicholas |last=Watt |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216150918/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/12/conservatives.whitehall |archive-date=16 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> His promotion prompted speculation he would run for the leadership of the Conservative Party when Howard stepped down, but he ruled himself out within a week.<ref name="Leader">{{cite news |title=Osborne will not enter Tory race |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4564605.stm |accessdate=22 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221232244/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4564605.stm |archive-date=21 February 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> Osborne served as [[campaign manager]] for David Cameron's [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|leadership campaign]], and kept the Shadow Chancellor's post when Cameron became leader later that year.

When David Cameron was asked in 2009 whether or not he would be willing to sack a close colleague such as Osborne, he stated, "With George, the answer is yes. He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are [[Godparent|godfathers]] to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23765406-david-cameron-would-i-sack-george-osborne-yes-absolutely-if-i-have-to.do |title=David Cameron: Would I sack George Osborne?

At this time Osborne expressed an interest in the ideas of "tax simplification" (including the idea of [[flat tax]]). He set up a "Tax Reform Commission" in October 2005 to investigate ideas for how to create a "flatter, simpler" tax system. The system then proposed would reduce the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Income tax|income tax]] rate to a flat 22%, and increase the personal allowance from £4,435 to between £10,000 and £15,500. However, the idea of a flat tax was not included in the 2010 Conservative Party manifesto.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4325866.stm |title=Flat tax inventor turns critic |date=10 October 2005 |work=BBC News |accessdate=16 April 2010 |first=Steve |last=Schifferes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824163336/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4325866.stm |archive-date=24 August 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Comments on Gordon Brown ===
During Osborne's response to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]]'s ''Pre-Budget Report'' on 5 December 2005, he accused Brown of being "a Chancellor past his sell-by-date, a Chancellor holding Britain back". In an interview the same week, he also referred to Brown as "brutal" and "unpleasant".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/3dbad21e-6378-11da-be11-0000779e2340.html |title=Shadow chancellor attacks 'brutal' Brown |author=Cathy Newman |work=Financial Times |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205015444/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/3dbad21e-6378-11da-be11-0000779e2340.html |archive-date=5 December 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref> Osborne was rebuked in October 2006 by [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], when he attacked the Chancellor at Oral Questions by citing a comment attributed to the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] [[John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness|John Hutton]], describing the Chancellor as likely to make an "effing awful" Prime Minister.<ref name="Hansard20061026">{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0001.htm#06102646000012 |title=Treasury questions |work=[[Hansard]] : Column 1637 |date=26 October 2006 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203131208/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061026/debtext/61026-0001.htm#06102646000012 |archive-date=3 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was widely suggested that Osborne was leading an assault on Brown that would allow the Conservatives to discredit him without damaging David Cameron's public image.<ref name="Hansard20061026" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/derek_draper/2006/08/camerons_boot_boys.html |title=Cameron's boot boys |author=Derek Draper |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203065448/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/derek_draper/2006/08/camerons_boot_boys.html |archive-date=3 February 2008 |url-status=live |author-link=Derek Draper }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article745905.ece |title=New era will begin with attack on Brown's record |author=Philip Webster |work=The Times |location=London |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=19 November 2007 }}</ref> That month, Osborne faced criticism from some quarters for appearing to suggest that Brown was "faintly autistic".

Osborne's school and university contemporary, financier [[Nathaniel Philip Rothschild|Nathaniel Rothschild]], said in October 2008 that Osborne had tried to solicit a £50,000 donation from the Russian aluminium magnate [[Oleg Deripaska]], which would have been a violation of the law against political donations by foreign citizens.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-flawed-judgement-of-a-shadow-chancellor-968549.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723091059/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-flawed-judgement-of-a-shadow-chancellor-968549.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 July 2010 |title=Leading article: ''Flawed judgement of a Shadow Chancellor'' |date=22 October 2008 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=23 November 2009 }}</ref><ref name="Times2008-10-23">{{cite news |last = Elliott |first = Francis |author2 = David Robertson |title = Nathaniel Rothschild: the solid financier reverted to type? |newspaper = [[The Times]] |date = 23 October 2008 |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4996488.ece |accessdate = 30 October 2010 |location = London |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125748/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4996488.ece |archive-date = 18 July 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref> Rothschild had hosted Deripaska, Osborne, [[Peter Mandelson]] and others at a party in his villa in [[Corfu]].

Other pledges included providing £200m of capital for David Cameron's [[Big Society]] Bank, which was supposed to finance community projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12402469|title=Banks agree Project Merlin lending and bonus deal|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210134202/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12402469|archive-date=10 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Hinkley Point C ====
George Osborne strongly supported [[China]]'s involvement in sensitive sectors such as the [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]]. The then Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] had been unhappy about Osborne's "[[gung-ho]]" attitude to the Chinese, and had objected to the project. It has been delayed for final approval after May assumed the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministership]]. In 2015, May's [[Special advisers (UK government)|political adviser]] [[Nick Timothy]] expressed his worry that China was effectively buying Britain's silence on [[Human rights in China|allegations of Chinese human rights abuse]], and criticised David Cameron and Osborne for "selling our [[national security]] to China" without [[rational]] concerns and "the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies." He warned that the Chinese could use their role in the programme (designing and constructing [[nuclear reactor]]s) to build weaknesses into [[computer systems]] which allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will and "...no amount of trade and investment should justify allowing a hostile state easy access to the country's critical national infrastructure."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730205353/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval |date=30 July 2016 }}.

Osborne was criticised by ''The Daily Telegraph'' in August 2016 after 500,000 people opened the new ISAs hoping to use them as a house deposit, only to find the bonus would not be paid until the house sale was completed—a flaw which led experts to describe the scheme as useless and a scam.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/help-to-buy-isa-scandal-500000-first-time-buyers-told-scheme-can/|title=Help to Buy Isa scandal:500,000 first time buyers told scheme cannot be used for initial deposit on homes|author=Katie Morley|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=20 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820013409/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/help-to-buy-isa-scandal-500000-first-time-buyers-told-scheme-can/|archive-date=20 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Political views ==
The ''[[Financial Times]]'' describes Osborne as "metropolitan and socially liberal. He is hawkish on foreign policy with links to Washington [[neo-conservatives]] and ideologically committed to cutting the state. A pragmatic [[Eurosceptic]]".<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html A Conservative Who's Who] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510014817/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html |date=10 May 2010 }} ''Financial Times''. com</ref> There is evidence of this commitment to cutting the state in his party's [[manifesto]], with Osborne and the Conservatives seeking to cut the deficit "faster and deeper" than any other main party as well as committing to various [[tax cuts]] such as [[inheritance tax]] and [[national insurance]]. According to an [[Institute for Fiscal Studies|IFS]] report before the 2010 general election,<ref>[http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/general-election-2010-parties-misleading-voters-over-deficit-warns-think-tank-ifs-tele-6015a50cb1a6.html?x=0 General Election 2010: Parties misleading voters over deficit, warns think tank IFS]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}.

After previously drawing parallels between Ed Miliband's economic views and those of [[Karl Marx]] in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', in a 2017 interview with former Treasury colleague [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley|Lord O'Neill]], Osborne said that Marx's claim in ''Das Kapital'' that [[Immiseration thesis|capitalists would take an increasing share of wealth from the proceeds of economic production at the expense of workers]] could be argued as an accurate description of something that appeared to be occurring under the process of [[globalization]], arguing that there was a need to "democratise capital" and ensure "that people have more capital in capitalism", such as larger pensions and more opportunities for savings and home and share ownership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/george-osborne-says-karl-marx-may-have-been-right-about-globalisation|title=George Osborne says Karl Marx may have been right about globalisation|last=Singleton|first=David|date=6 January 2017|website=[[Total Politics]]|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209203101/https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/george-osborne-says-karl-marx-may-have-been-right-about-globalisation|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Osborne announced he would be standing down as the MP for Tatton in April 2017, a day after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] was declared. He did not rule out returning to the Commons at some point. "It's still too early to be writing my memoirs", he wrote in a letter to his constituency party, and did not "want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor.

''[[Private Eye]]'' subsequently documented in detail the relationship between Osborne and ''Standard'' owner [[Evgeny Lebedev]], who appointed Osborne as editor. During Osborne's time as Chancellor of the Exchequer he regularly pledged Treasury money to ''Standard'' charitable campaigns, such as his offer in 2015 to match readers' donations by up to £1.5 million to the ''Standard''{{'}}s [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] appeal. In September 2015, the newspaper ranked Osborne in joint-first place on its annual 'Progress 1000' list of the most influential people in London. It was also highlighted that, as Chancellor, Osborne failed to tackle the advantageous tax status for so-called [[non-dom]]s, which Lebedev was understood to benefit from, while Lebedev's paper strongly supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] and the Conservatives' candidate [[Zac Goldsmith]] in the [[2016 London mayoral election]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=24 March 2017 |title=St. George lowers the Standard |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}</ref>

In mid-2018, the ''Standard'' reported a loss of £10 million for the last year to the end of September, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' labelling it "in the red again". That year the paper dropped 'London' from its title to reflect greater national and international ambitions as part of a relaunch.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/29/in-the-red-again-george-osborne-leads-evening-standard-to-10m-loss|title=In the red again: George Osborne leads Evening Standard to £10m loss|last=correspondent|first=Mark Sweney Media business|date=29 June 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 July 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> For 2018, the ''Standard'' reported a £11.5M loss amid speculation of "ad struggles".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/26/evening-standard-reports-loss-amid-ad-struggles-george-osborne|title=Evening Standard reports £11.5m loss amid ad struggles|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=26 June 2019|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 July 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Comments on Theresa May ===
In a profile of Osborne published by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in September 2017, it was said that he had commented to several staff at the ''Standard'' that he would not be satisfied until [[Theresa May]] was "chopped up in bags in my freezer".<ref>{{cite news|last=Caesar|first=Ed|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/longform/a17158/george-osborne-revenge/|title=George Osborne's Revenge|work=Esquire|date=September 2017|accessdate=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081703/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/longform/a17158/george-osborne-revenge/|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While Osborne had used macabre imagery about May in the past, he did not directly comment on the incident, although he was criticised for the alleged remark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/george-osborne-criticised-for-gruesome-remarks-against-theresa-may|title=George Osborne criticised for gruesome remarks against Theresa May|work=The Guardian|date=13 September 2017|accessdate=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913131007/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/george-osborne-criticised-for-gruesome-remarks-against-theresa-may|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An editorial in the ''Standard'', published nearly a week later, was interpreted as Osborne's apology to May.

=== Parallel political efforts ===
In September 2017 Osborne was named a distinguished visiting fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]] and a dean's fellow at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. He specialised in research on international politics and the global economy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enhancedonlinenews.com/news/eon/20170920005096/en|title=Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne Joins Stanford's Hoover Institution and Graduate School of Business|work=Enhanced Online News|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=23 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924103948/http://www.enhancedonlinenews.com/news/eon/20170920005096/en|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Osborne was discussed as a potential candidate for [[Mayor of London]] in [[2021 London mayoral election|the election]] originally scheduled to be held in 2020 but then pushed back to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in London|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/justine-greening-rules-herself-out-of-london-mayoral-contest_uk_5b32a6a5e4b0b745f17890ec|title=Justine Greening Rules Herself Out Of Race To Be Next London Mayor|work=HuffPost UK|last=Wearmouth|first=Rachel|date=26 June 2018|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref> He said that as well as considering a bid, he would not rule out a return to parliament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/07/george-osborne-refuses-rule-return-public-life-mp-london-mayor/|title=George Osborne refuses to rule out a return to public life as an MP or London Mayor|work=The Telegraph|last=Hope|first=Christopher|date=7 December 2017|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref> In an interview with [[LBC]] in March 2018, however, he said he would not stand for mayor as it would clash with his role as editor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/iain-dale/george-osborne-rules-out-standing-for-london-mayor/|title=George Osborne Rules Out Standing For London Mayor|work=LBC|date=15 March 2018|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref>

On 3 July 2019, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Osborne was seeking backing to replace [[Christine Lagarde]] as Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/george-osborne-prepares-bid-to-become-first-british-head-of-the-imf-m3lflbtqd|title=George Osborne prepares bid to become first British head of the IMF|last1=Aldrick|first1=Philip|last2=Elliott|first2=Francis|date=4 July 2019|work=The Times|access-date=5 July 2019|issn=0140-0460}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b690fdb6-9db2-11e9-9c06-a4640c9feebb|title=George Osborne eyes chance of taking IMF top job|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref> The global organisation, which works to foster monetary cooperation between nations, had its highest role held only by European nationals since its founding.

The [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] described the IMF as "the leading global enforcer of [[austerity]]", and said that allowing Osborne to head the organisation, whom he called "the architect of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|UK austerity]]", would be "a dangerous combination".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/george-osborne-british-head-imf-treasury-record/|title=George Osborne's Treasury record 'attacked' as he eyes up IMF bid|last=Vaughan|first=Richard|date=4 July 2019|work=inews|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

Osborne needed to be nominated by directors on the IMF's executive board, who were elected by member countries, to enter the contest.
