'''Woodrow Lyle Wyatt, Baron Wyatt of Weeford''' (4 July 1918 – 7 December 1997) was a British politician, author, [[journalist]] and broadcaster, close to the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]]. For the last twenty years of his life, he was chairman of the state betting organisation [[The Tote]].

==Early life: 1918−1945==
Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]], southwest London, Wyatt was the second son of Robert Harvey Lyle Wyatt, the founder and headmaster of Milbourne Lodge School, [[Esher]], and his wife Ethel (née Morgan).<ref name="Introduction">Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. xix.</ref> Born on America's Independence Day, he was named after the American President [[Woodrow Wilson]].<ref>Woodrow Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'' (London: Collins, 1987), p. 35.</ref> 

Wyatt was educated at [[Eastbourne College]] and [[Worcester College]], [[Oxford]], where he read [[jurisprudence]] and graduated with a second-class degree in 1939.<ref name="Introduction"/><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 77.</ref> He volunteered for military service ten days before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] with the [[Suffolk Regiment]]<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 78.</ref> and rose to the rank of major. Wyatt was posted to [[Normandy]] on [[D-Day]] plus one and was [[mentioned in despatches]].<ref name="Introduction"/><ref name="Beard">Matthew Beard and Richard Evans, 'Attlee's young star who went on to back Thatcher', ''The Times'' (8 December 1997), p. 9.</ref><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 97.</ref>  

He was nearly [[court-martial]]led after an acrimonious exchange with one of his senior officers.<ref name="Times">'Lord Wyatt of Weeford', ''The Times'' (9 December 1997), p. 21.</ref><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 101.</ref> Wyatt was afterwards posted to [[India]].<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 106–113.</ref> 

Wyatt edited ten volumes of ''English Story'' (1940–50).<ref name="Times"/>

==Member of Parliament: 1945–1955==
Wyatt was [[1945 United Kingdom general election|elected to Parliament in 1945]] as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP for [[Birmingham Aston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Aston]], and served until the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] when the constituencies boundaries were redrawn. 

During the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|Cabinet Mission to India in 1946]] he served as an informal liaison officer between the Mission and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]].<ref name="Times"/><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 145–163.</ref> Wyatt was a member of the 15-strong [[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]] group of Labour MPs.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 168.</ref> In the group's pamphlet, published in May 1947, Wyatt criticised the government's failure to demobilise the armed forces quickly enough.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 169.</ref>

[[Clement Attlee]] appointed Wyatt Under-Secretary at the War Office in April 1951, an office he held for six months until Labour was defeated in the October 1951 election.<ref name="Times"/>

He published ''Into the Dangerous World'' in 1952. Following the splitting of his Aston seat, Wyatt was unable to find a more promising option than the Conservative-held [[Grantham (UK Parliament constituency)|Grantham constituency]], which he nonetheless fought in 1955, being defeated by 2,375 votes. By coincidence, [[Grantham]] was the hometown of his latter-day friend [[Margaret Thatcher]].

==Journalism: 1955–1959==
[[Edward R. Murrow]] of [[CBS]] chose Grantham as one of the seats that he would cover during the 1955 election. [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]], who was the head of the BBC's Current Affairs department, happened to watch it and was impressed with Wyatt.<ref name="Times"/><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 231.</ref> She asked Wyatt to join [[Richard Dimbleby]] in presenting ''[[Panorama (TV programme)|Panorama]]'' as the programme's foreign affairs reporter.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 238.</ref> He later wrote: "My TV appearances catapulted me into fame. ... We had an audience of between 9 and 14 million. When I walked in the street or went into any public place I was recognized and my autograph sought".<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 242.</ref>

In February 1956, during the filming of a ''Panorama'' programme in [[Algeria]], Wyatt and his television crew were attacked by French settlers who had mistaken them for Americans.<ref>'Alarm Over Algeria', ''The Times'' (28 February 1956), p. 8.</ref><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 242–243.</ref>

In April 1956 Bill Carron, a member of the executive of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]] (AEU), informed Wyatt that Communists were trying to take over the union by falsifying votes for union officials.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 249–250.</ref> There were upcoming elections for two posts on the Executive and as the Communists already held three out of the seven seats, there was a possibility of a Communist majority. Wyatt later wrote: "The threat to the economy and to the Labour Party of a huge AEU block vote supporting extremist policies at Labour conferences, was obvious".<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 250.</ref> The [[Director-General of the BBC]], Sir [[Ian Jacob]], authorised Wyatt to produce a ''Panorama'' programme on it, which was broadcast on 14 May 1956.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 250–251.</ref> Wyatt later claimed that his programme "shook the union world. The voting went up by 40 per cent. ... it was enough to defeat the Communist candidates for all three posts. The AEU was saved".<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 251.</ref>

In September 1956 he wrote a series of articles in the ''Illustrated'' about the Communist threat to the trade unions and therefore, due to the influential trade union block vote, to the Labour Party. These were republished in pamphlet-form as ''The Peril in Our Midst''.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 254.</ref> In October 1956 he signed a statement urging British participation in the Common Market.<ref>'Britain Urged To Cooperate', ''The Times'' (8 October 1956), p. 4.</ref>

In June 1957 Wyatt visited South Africa under apartheid for ''Panorama''. He later wrote that the treatment of black South Africans was "worse than that of slaves in Ancient Athens or Rome" and that his programme was "the first time that millions in Britain got a glimpse of what life was really like in South Africa: paradise under a live volcano".<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 248–249.</ref> [[Eric Louw]], the South African Minister of External Affairs, made an official complaint to the British government about Wyatt's programme.<ref>'A "Distorted" Programme', ''The Times'' (5 July 1957), p. 10.</ref>

After Wyatt's programme on Communist vote-rigging in the AEU, [[Jock Byrne]] gave Wyatt documents containing evidence that since the war Communists had controlled the [[Electrical Trades Union (United Kingdom)|Electrical Trades Union]] (ETU) by falsifying votes.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 252.</ref> Wyatt received the permission of Ian Jacob to make a ''Panorama'' programme on union democracy in the ETU. This was broadcast on 9 December 1957 and Wyatt brought to light that [[Les Cannon]] had been defrauded of his election to the ETU's Executive by Communist vote-rigging. As union rules prohibited union members from discussing union affairs in public, ETU members on Wyatt's programme had their faces hidden.<ref>'E.T.U. attacked on television', ''The Times'' (10 December 1957), p. 6.</ref> In January 1958 Wyatt wrote an article on the subject for the ''New Statesman''.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 256.</ref> In July 1961 Justice Win of the High Court declared that the 1959 election for the ETU's general secretary was fraudulently won by the Communist [[Frank Haxell]] and that Byrne was the general secretary.<ref>'Judge Declares Mr. Byrne To Be E.T.U. Secretary', ''The Times'' (4 July 1961), p. 10.</ref><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 259.</ref>

He also campaigned in favour of compulsory secret ballots for union elections, which was eventually embodied in the Employment Act 1988.<ref>Julian Lewis, 'Woodrow Wyatt', ''The Times'' (17 December 1997), p. 19.</ref>

In January 1958 the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party rejected a request from the Holborn and St Pancras constituency Labour Party that Wyatt should be removed from the list of prospective parliamentary candidates due to his "anti-working class activity".<ref>'News in Brief', ''The Times'' (23 January 1958),  p. 7.</ref><ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', pp. 256–257.</ref>

==Member of Parliament: 1959–1970==
He returned to [[1959 United Kingdom general election|Parliament in 1959]] as member for [[Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bosworth]], Leicestershire. According to Wyatt, Gaitskell told him that the Opposition Chief Whip, [[Bert Bowden]], vetoed his appointment to Gaitskell's Shadow Cabinet.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 272.</ref>

In a speech to the Hinckley branch of the AEU in June 1960, Wyatt called the General Secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]], [[Frank Cousins]], "the bully with the block vote".<ref>'"Bully of the Block Vote"', ''The Times'' (11 June 1960), p. 12.</ref> After Labour's fourth successive electoral defeat in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], [[Anthony Howard (journalist)|Anthony Howard]] said that Labour's own polling evidence suggested that Labour could not win another election so long as it was identified with the trade unions: "Woodrow Wyatt's description of the late Frank Cousins...as “the bully with the block vote” was not just a damaging phrase: in the electorate's perception of Labour it lit a candle that has never really gone out".<ref>Anthony Howard, 'Labour needs its carthorse', ''The Times'' (24 June 1992), p. 14.</ref>

In November 1961, Wyatt wrote an article for ''The Guardian'' and delivered a speech in Leicester, both times advocating a [[Lib–Lab pact]] to keep the Conservatives out of power.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 277.</ref><ref>'Labour Pact With Liberals Urged', ''The Times'' (20 November 1961), p. 6.</ref> According to Wyatt, a furious Gaitskell telephoned him, saying: "Why don't you get out of the Party and stop embarrassing me?"<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 278.</ref> In January 1962, after Wyatt repeated this idea in an article for the ''New Statesman'', Gaitskell delivered a speech to the Bosworth Labour Party (in Wyatt's presence) rejecting it.<ref>'Mr. Gaitskell Says No Liberal Pact', ''The Times'' (27 January 1962), p. 8.</ref> The [[General Secretary of the Labour Party]], [[Morgan Phillips]], wrote to Wyatt, warning him that unless he dropped his advocacy for a Lib−Lab pact, he would be expelled from the party. Wyatt acquiesced.<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 280.</ref>

He was seen by some as a maverick and by others as a man of firm convictions which made him temperamentally unsuited to 'toeing the party line'. He rebelled in the 1964–1970 parliaments over steel nationalisation. His thirteen interviews with [[Bertrand Russell]] were published as ''Bertrand Russell Speaks His Mind'' in 1960. Wyatt was defeated at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].

==Journalism and The Tote: 1970–1997==
After ceasing to be an active politician, Wyatt was appointed by the Home Secretary, [[Roy Jenkins]], as Chairman of the [[The Tote|Horserace Totalisator Board]] from 1976–1997. At first he was an active chairman, rooting out corruption, but later grew complacent and the Tote stagnated.<ref name=shake>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/to-move-and-to-shake-1353932.html "To Move and To Shake" by [[Geraldine Bedell]]. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 24 November 1996.]</ref> According to [[John McCririck]]: "The Tote had been bankrupt and he turned it round. He made it a force in betting. When he became chairman, the Tote was a total mess but he put it on the map by his sheer personality and flair along with the introduction of computerisation".<ref name="Beard"/> However, a House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee produced a report critical of Wyatt.<ref name="Beard"/>

Wyatt was a prolific journalist, with a diverse range of interests, and by the late 1970s he had crossed the political spectrum and became an admirer of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. After Thatcher's election as Conservative leader in 1975, she arranged a meeting with Wyatt. He later wrote: "She won me over. The strength of her determination and the simplicity of her rational ideas uncluttered by intellectual confusion convinced me that she was the first party leader I had met, apart from Gaitskell, who might check Britain's slide and possibly begin to reverse it. She did not seem much like a Tory but she had the Tory Party to work for her, which was a useful start".<ref>Wyatt, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', p. 343.</ref>

In July 1979 Roy Jenkins recorded in his diary after meeting Wyatt and Thatcher: "Woodrow is on very close terms with her, talks freely, easily, without self-consciousness, says anything he wants to".<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''European Diary, 1977−1981'' (London: Collins, 1989), p. 480.</ref> Wyatt would usually ring Thatcher after midnight or on Sunday mornings where he would give her advice.<ref name="Campbell">John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 34.</ref> According to [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]], Thatcher did not always accept Wyatt's advice but "her ministers got sick of being told what 'Woodrow says' about this or that policy".<ref name="Campbell"/> He claims that when [[Geoffrey Howe]] complained in his memoirs that Thatcher preferred to listen to her private "voices" rather than to her colleagues and official advisers, "it was first and foremost of Wyatt that he was thinking".<ref name="Campbell"/>

During this period his ''[[News of the World]]'' column, 'The Voice of Reason', was regularly attacked by Thatcher's political opponents. His column reached an audience of approximately seventeen million readers.<ref>Sarah Curtis, 'Introduction', ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt'', p. xii.</ref> During this time he was vocal in opposing sanctions against apartheid South Africa, writing that [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[African National Congress|ANC]] were trying to establish "a communist-style black dictatorship".<ref>{{cite web|last1=The Guardian|title=The Conservative party's uncomfortable relationship with Nelson Mandela|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/06/conservative-party-uncomfortable-nelson-mandela}}</ref> Wyatt visited South Africa in 1986 and during a visit to a game reserve he saw black and white children playing together, leading him to remark: "They are comrades. Oh, if the rest of South Africa could be like that".<ref>Curtis, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One'', p. 93.</ref> He also interviewed [[P. W. Botha|President Botha]] and put to him that he should unban the ANC.<ref>Curtis, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One'', p. 95.</ref>

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1983<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49575 |date=20 December 1983 |page=16802}}</ref> and was created a [[life peer]] on 3 February 1987 with the title '''Baron Wyatt of Weeford''', ''of [[Weeford]] in the [[Staffordshire|County of Staffordshire]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50824 |date=6 February 1987 |page=1631}}</ref> The Wyatt family had lived at Weeford in the seventeenth century.<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry 1952, 'Wyatt of Hurst Barton Manor formerly of Bryn Gwynant', pp. 2805</ref>

His autobiography, ''Confessions of an Optimist'', was published in 1985. 

In the mid-1980s he played a key role as Murdoch's fixer in brokering negotiations with the electricians' union, aiding [[News International]] to move to [[Wapping]].<ref name=shake/> He set up a newspaper and printing business with his third wife, which soon failed.<ref name=shake/> On 31 August 1986 the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] censured Wyatt for an article he wrote in his "Voice of Reason" column. Wyatt said that although Britain's Asian and black population were "generally well behaved", a substantial part of the latter were "lawless, drug-taking, violent and unemployable".<ref>'Race rebuke writer is defended by Tory MP', ''The Times'' (1 September 1986), p. 4.</ref><ref>Curtis, ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume One'', p. 186.</ref>

After Thatcher's fall in 1990, Wyatt supported [[John Major]]. However, he temporarily dropped his support for Major after he sacked his Chancellor, [[Norman Lamont]], in 1993. Wyatt helped Lamont write his resignation speech.<ref name="Beard"/>

In 2000, the journalist [[Petronella Wyatt]], his daughter by his fourth marriage, published a book entitled ''Father, Dear Father: Life with Woodrow Wyatt''.

==''The Journals''==
[[File:Woodrow Wyatt.jpg|thumb|upright|Wyatt's diary cover (published posthumously as ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt'' by Macmillan, edited by Sarah Curtis)]]

Wyatt's caustic, candid and mischievously indiscreet diaries were published posthumously in three volumes as ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt'' by Macmillan and edited by Sarah Curtis. They are: Volume 1, 1985–88 (1998); Volume 2, ''Thatcher's Fall and Major's Rise'', 1989–92, (1999); and Volume 3, ''From Major to Blair'' (2000), which spans the period from 1992 until three months before his death in December 1997.

[[Andrew Neil]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' wrote of the diaries: "Wyatt has done the country a service in giving us the unalloyed truth about how this country's governing and social elite still operates", and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' called the journals "The most explosive political memoirs of modern times". However, the historian [[Robert Rhodes James]] "advised caution in believing them: 'Even if the diarist is not attempting to give a deliberately false version, a talented writer can easily over-dramatise...' There is plenty of internal evidence that Wyatt should be approached with a similar caution."<ref>David Sexton, "Don't believe all those diary droolings",  ''The Evening Standard'' (12 October 1998), p. 11.</ref> [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Lord Blake]], the Tory historian, called Wyatt a "notorious liar".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/woodrow-verushka-pericles-and-petronella-welcome-to-the-world-of-the-wyatts-533899.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Woodrow, Verushka, Pericles and Petronella: welcome to the world of the Wyatts | date=20 November 2004}}</ref> 

[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], Thatcher's authorised biographer, claims Wyatt's journals "are a good source for the 'off duty' remarks and attitudes of many of the leading figures of the age, including Mrs Thatcher. They often reveal her private reactions to public events when she considered herself among friends".<ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning'' (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 467, n.</ref>

==Marriages, children, and death==
Wyatt was married four times, to:

He arranged for cousins to take care of his first child when his wife made it clear she was not interested in doing so.<ref name=shake/> When they divorced, he was awarded custody of his son.

Wyatt was a first cousin of [[England cricket team|England Test cricket]]er [[Bob Wyatt]].<ref>

He was first cousin to [[Honor Wyatt]], the mother of musician [[Robert Wyatt]], whose alliance with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], juxtaposed with Woodrow Wyatt's right-wing politics, led to Robert Wyatt referring to his relative as an "appalling man with a sadistic sense of superiority".<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Dair|first1=Marcus|title=Different Every Time|date=2014|publisher=Serpents Tail|location=London|isbn=9781846687594|pages=20–22|edition=1st}}</ref>
