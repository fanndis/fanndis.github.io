Prior to the election, the centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by Prime Minister [[Bill English]], had [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|governed since 2008]] in a [[minority government]] with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Māori Party|Māori]], [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] and [[United Future]] parties. It was the first election for English as incumbent Prime Minister, having replaced [[John Key]] on 12 December 2016 and the first since [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975]] where both major parties had leadership changes. The main opposition parties to the National government were [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] (the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|official opposition]]), led by [[Jacinda Ardern]], the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]], and [[New Zealand First]].

The National Party won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the seats with 56, down from 60 in 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/23/new-zealand-election-2017-results-jacinda-ardern-bill-english-live |title=NZ First's Winston Peters kingmaker in New Zealand hung parliament – as it happened |first1=Claire |last1=Phipps |first2=Eleanor Ainge |last2=Roy |date=23 September 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=23 September 2017 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923061403/https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/sep/23/new-zealand-election-2017-results-jacinda-ardern-bill-english-live |url-status=live }}</ref> Labour made large gains following Jacinda Ardern [[2017 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|becoming the party leader]] seven weeks prior to the election, increasing its representation from 32 to 46 seats. Labour was the only parliamentary party to gain support but a large portion came at the expense of the Green Party, who lost almost half their seats (dropping from 14 to 8) following co-leader [[Metiria Turei]]'s resignation over self-admitted benefit and electoral fraud. The anti-immigration populist party New Zealand First won 9 seats, down from 12 in 2014. ACT retained its one seat. Election-night counts had National with 58 seats, Labour with 45 seats, and the Greens with 7 seats, but when [[special vote]]s were counted, National lost one list seat each to the Greens and Labour.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97651918/live-2017-election-results-revealed--including-384000-special-votes |title= 2017 election results revealed including 384000 special votes |publisher=Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 7 October 2017 |access-date= 16 June 2018 |archive-date= 17 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015624/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97651918/live-2017-election-results-revealed--including-384000-special-votes |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97654899/nicola-willis-says-dream-to-represent-national-in-parliament-not-over-yet |title= Nicola Willis says dream to represent-National in parliament not over yet |publisher=Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 7 October 2017 |access-date= 16 June 2018 |archive-date= 17 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180617042810/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97654899/nicola-willis-says-dream-to-represent-national-in-parliament-not-over-yet |url-status= live }}</ref>

The election saw five parties return to Parliament, down from seven in 2014 and the lowest number since the introduction of MMP in 1996. [[Māori Party]] co-leader [[Te Ururoa Flavell]] lost his seat of [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] and, with the party's vote count being below the [[electoral threshold|threshold]] of 5%, they also lost their list MP, co-leader [[Marama Fox]], and departed Parliament. [[United Future]] leader and sole MP [[Peter Dunne]] retired from politics during the campaign due to poor polling in his electorate of [[Ōhāriu]] and his successor failed to win the seat. The party voted to dissolve less than two months later.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://unitedfuture.org.nz/unitedfuture-proud-of-its-history-but-all-good-things-must-end/|title= UnitedFuture proud of it’s [sic] history, but all good things must end|publisher=[[Damian Light]]|accessdate= 14 November 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171114040544/http://unitedfuture.org.nz/unitedfuture-proud-of-its-history-but-all-good-things-must-end/|archive-date= 14 November 2017|url-status= dead}}</ref>

The election resulted in Ardern becoming New Zealand's third female Prime Minister, and Peters being reappointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], a role he had first held in 1996–98. This marked an end to nine years under the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]], and the beginning of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand]].

==Electoral system==
{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}

New Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the 120-member House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the [[electoral threshold|threshold]] (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 71 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 49 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang. The 2014 election saw a one-seat overhang where [[Peter Dunne]] won the [[Ōhāriu]] electorate when his [[United Future New Zealand|United Future Party]] was entitled to zero seats under the party vote.

The political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties either to form a [[coalition government]] or to obtain sufficient [[confidence and supply]] to operate as a [[minority government]].

Electorate boundaries in the 2017 election were the same as at the 2014 election, with 64 general electorates (48 in the [[North Island]] and 16 in the [[South Island]]), and 7 Māori electorates. Boundaries are due to be redrawn in 2019, after the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]].

===Electoral law changes===
The Electoral Amendment Act 2017 and the Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Act 2017 made a number of changes to the conduct of general elections, including:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71058_1/electoral-amendment-bill |title=Electoral Amendment Bill – New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017 |archive-date=19 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219184839/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71058_1/electoral-amendment-bill |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71456_1/broadcasting-election-programmes-and-election-advertising |title=Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Bill – New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017 |archive-date=19 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219184835/https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71456_1/broadcasting-election-programmes-and-election-advertising |url-status=live }}</ref>
* Voters no longer have to complete and sign a new enrolment form if they are already enrolled and notify of a change of address, for example, through [[New Zealand Post]]'s mail redirection service.
* The Electoral Commission no longer is required to send out nominations and polling place information to every voter by post; instead the Commission may use its discretion on how to advertise nominations and polling places.
* Polling booths may now use electronic electoral rolls to mark off voters.
* Counting of advance votes may now start earlier at 9:00&nbsp;am (previously 2:00&nbsp;pm), to take into account the increase in people voting in advance.
* The contact information of sitting MPs, such as business cards and signage on out-of-Parliament offices, has been clarified as not constituting election advertising.
* Election advertising is now legally prohibited in or near advance polling booths.
* Election hoardings may now be erected nine weeks before the election (previously two months), so the first day always falls on a Saturday.
* Parties are no longer allocated free airtime on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to broadcast opening and closing addresses.

===Eligibility to vote===
To vote in the general election, one must:
* be on the [[electoral roll]]
* be aged 18 or over on election day (i.e. born on or before 23 September 1999)
* be a [[New Zealand citizen]], [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent resident]], residence visa holder, an Australian citizen or other person entitled to reside in New Zealand indefinitely.
* have lived in New Zealand for one year or more continuously at some point
* have been in New Zealand within the last 3 years (for New Zealand citizens) or 1 year (non-New Zealand citizens); public servants and [[New Zealand Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel on duty outside New Zealand, including their partners and children, are not subject to this rule.
* not be expressly disqualified from enrolling or voting (e.g., serving a sentence of imprisonment; convicted of a corrupt election practice).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol |title=Who can and can't enrol? |publisher=Electoral Commission |access-date=4 May 2017 |archive-date=7 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507111831/http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol |url-status=live }}</ref>

Unless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election, a general election is held every three years. The last election was held on Saturday, 20 September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Election Results|url=http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=21 September 2014|archive-date=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922052111/http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Results==
{{further|Results of the 2017 New Zealand general election}}
Preliminary results were gradually released after polling booths closed at 19:00 ([[New Zealand Standard Time|NZST]]) on 23 September. The preliminary count only includes advance ordinary and election day ordinary votes; it does not include any [[special vote]]s. Special votes include votes from those who enrolled after the deadline of 23 August, those who voted outside their electorate (this includes all overseas votes), hospital votes, and those voters enrolled on the unpublished roll.<ref name = PreliminaryResults />

All voting papers, counterfoils and electoral rolls are returned to the electorate's returning officer for a mandatory recount; this also includes approving and counting any special votes, and compiling a master roll to ensure no voter has voted more than once. Official results, including all recounted ordinary votes and special votes, were released by the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] on Saturday 7 October 2017.<ref name = OfficialResults />

Parties and candidates have three working days after the release of the official results to apply for a [[Election recount|judicial recount]]. These recounts take place under the auspices of a [[District Court of New Zealand|District Court]] judge (the Chief District Court Judge in case of a nationwide recount),<ref>Sections 190 and 191, Electoral Act 1993</ref> and may delay the return of the election writ by a few days.

===Electorate results===
[[File:New Zealand electorates, 2017.svg|thumb|right|300px|Party affiliation of winning electorate candidates.]]

Prior to the election, the National Party held the majority of the electorate seats with 40. Labour held 27 seats, and NZ First, ACT, and United Future held one seat each. Between the 2014 and 2017 elections, one seat changed allegiance: in the [[2015 Northland by-election]], NZ First leader Winston Peters won the seat off National, after MP [[Mike Sabin]] resigned.

Fifty-five electorates saw the incumbent MP re-elected, while another 11 saw a new MP elected from the same party as the retiring incumbent.

In three electorates, the incumbent MP was defeated. Labour candidate and lawyer [[Duncan Webb]] claimed [[Christchurch Central (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch Central]] off National MP [[Nicky Wagner]]; Labour previously held the electorate continuously from its formation in 1946 until Wagner won it in 2011. After National lost [[Northland (New Zealand electorate)|Northland]] to NZ First leader Winston Peters in 2015, candidate [[Matt King (politician)|Matt King]] claimed the electorate back for National from Peters. Labour candidate and former television presenter [[Tamati Coffey]] claimed [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] off Māori Party MP [[Te Ururoa Flavell]]; Flavell's defeat saw the Māori Party without an electorate seat and with the party polling below 5% in the party vote, saw the party voted out of Parliament. Coffey's win also saw Labour claim a clean sweep of the Māori electorates for the first time since the 2002 election.

In [[Hutt South]], National list MP [[Chris Bishop (politician)|Chris Bishop]] claimed the electorate from Labour – the first time the electorate has swung since its creation in 1996. Contributing to the swing was the 2014 boundary changes which saw the Labour-leaning suburb of [[Naenae]] swapped for the National-leaning western hill suburbs of [[Lower Hutt]], and long standing Labour MP [[Trevor Mallard]] standing down at the election to contest the party list only. In [[Ōhāriu]], incumbent United Future MP [[Peter Dunne]] stepped down after holding the electorate in various incarnations since 1984. Labour candidate and former police officer [[Greg O'Connor (politician)|Greg O'Connor]] subsequently claimed the electorate.

Overall, National gained one electorate to hold 41, Labour gained two electorates to hold 29, while ACT retained its one electorate seat.

[[Hamilton West (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton West]] was considered to be New Zealand's [[bellwether]] seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94592380/new-face-ready-to-swing-hamilton-west|title=New face ready to swing Hamilton West|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|accessdate=25 August 2017|archive-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826041927/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94592380/New-face-ready-to-swing-Hamilton-West|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11850653|title=Labour MP Sue Moroney pulls out of election|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=25 August 2017|archive-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826031353/http://www2.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11850653|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the formation of the electorate in 1969, the winning candidate was from the party that went on to form the government, with the exception of 1993 when it elected a Labour MP while National went on to form the government (albeit with a one-seat majority). Hamilton West, [[Maungakiekie (New Zealand electorate)|Maungakiekie]] and [[Rotorua (New Zealand electorate)|Rotorua]] were also regarded as bellwethers in the MMP era, swinging with the government at every election since 1996. All three electorates in the 2017 election were won by National candidates.

==Campaigning==
===Expense limits and broadcasting allocations===
During the three-month regulated period prior to election day (i.e. 23 June to 22 September 2017), parties and candidates have limits on how much they may spend on election campaigning. It is illegal in New Zealand to campaign on election day itself.<ref>Section 197, Electoral Act 1993.</ref>

For the 2017 election, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend $1,115,000 plus $26,200 per electorate candidate on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). A party contesting all 71 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $2,975,200 on election campaigning.<ref>Section 206C, Electoral Act 1993.</ref> All electorate candidates are permitted to spend $26,200 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>Section 205C, Electoral Act 1993.</ref>

Registered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget. The Electoral Commission sets the amount of broadcasting funds each party gets; generally the allocation is based on the number of seats in the current Parliament, previous election results, and support in opinion polls. The initial broadcasting allocation was released on 26 May 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title= 2017 Broadcasting Allocation |url= https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/media/attachments/2017_broadcasting_allocation_decision_26_may_2017.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 26 May 2017 |accessdate= 27 May 2017 |archive-date= 3 July 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170703173102/https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/media/attachments/2017_broadcasting_allocation_decision_26_may_2017.pdf |url-status= live }}</ref> The broadcasting allocation was revised on 23 August 2017, redistributing funds from parties that failed to register in time for the election.<ref>{{cite web |title= 2017 Variation Broadcasting Allocation Decision Released |url= https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/media/attachments/2017_broadcasting_allocation_decision_26_may_2017.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission |date= 23 August 2017 |accessdate= 25 August 2017 |archive-date= 3 July 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170703173102/https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/media/attachments/2017_broadcasting_allocation_decision_26_may_2017.pdf |url-status= live }}</ref>

====Education====
On 27 August 2017, National pledged a $379&nbsp;million education package. New "digital academies" focused on IT training and similar to existing trades academies, would be introduced for 1,000 year-12 and 13 students at a cost of $48&nbsp;million. There would also be investments of $126&nbsp;million to improve maths achievements for primary school students and $160&nbsp;million to give all primary school students the opportunity to learn a second language if they wished. There would be an expansion of the National Standards scheme that would allow parents to check the progress of their child via their mobile phone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96196762/national-launches-official-campaign-with-education-bid|accessdate=27 August 2017|title=National launches official campaign with $379&nbsp;million education bid|date=27 August 2017|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|archive-date=28 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828015043/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96196762/national-launches-official-campaign-with-education-bid|url-status=live}}</ref>

Green Party leader [[James Shaw (New Zealand politician)|James Shaw]] reaffirmed on 22 August the party's intention to introduce a [[capital gains tax]], saying that it was "a priority" for the party and a measure "we want to see addressed in a first term of a new government."

Labour promised to reduce net immigration by about 20–30,000 annually, partly by reducing the number of students enrolled in "low value" courses that were susceptible to being used as a subterfuge for immigration. The party said it would introduce a stricter test regime to ensure employers seek to hire New Zealanders before recruiting overseas applicants, and would require skilled migrants to stay and work in the region their visa was issued for.<ref name="IMMIGRATE">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11907957|accessdate=23 August 2017|title=Policy series: where do the parties stand on immigration?|date=22 August 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|archive-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214059/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11907957|url-status=live}}</ref>

National planned to count migrants as "skilled" only if the job they were coming to paid more than about $49,000 a year, but the plan was opposed by employers who said their businesses would be put at risk by the blocking of foreign workers. Immigrants only needed to be paid over $41,859 a year – resulting in about 6000 more workers being able to stay in the country longer. Those earning less would be considered low-skilled and can stay in the country for a maximum of three years, after which a stand-down period applies before they can apply to come back. National planned to introduce legislation in 2018 that would raise the residency requirements for superannuation from 10 to 20 years.<ref name="IMMIGRATE"/>

NZ First leader Winston Peters vowed to reduce net immigration to around 10,000 per year. Peters said that unemployed New Zealanders would be trained to take jobs as the number was reduced, and the number of older immigrants would be limited, with more bonded to the regions.<ref name="IMMIGRATE"/>

The Green Party proposed that migration should be capped to 1 per cent of population growth, but later abandoned that policy due to the perception that the Greens were pandering to anti-immigrant rhetoric.

ACT had "long opposed populist attacks on immigrants", according to David Seymour.<ref>{{cite book |last= Seymour|first= David|date= 2017|title= Own Your Future|location= Auckland|publisher=ACT New Zealand|page= 94|author-link= David Seymour (New Zealand politician)}}</ref> ACT wanted immigrants to "demonstrate they've earned above the average wage in their field" to get residency, and it would put an end to foreigners leaving their kids in New Zealand while paying taxes overseas by implementing an "infrastructure charge" of $10 per day for a maximum of a year for all migrants.<ref>{{cite book |last= Seymour|first= David|date= 2017|title= Own Your Future|location= Auckland|publisher=ACT New Zealand|page= 103|author-link= David Seymour (New Zealand politician)}}</ref>

The Opportunities Party (TOP) wanted a change so that immigration would not be driven by student visas or reciprocal visitor working visas. The party also wanted to abandon the requirement for highly-skilled migrants to have a job to come to.<ref name="IMMIGRATE"/>

====Rail transport====
National Party leader and Prime Minister Bill English announced on 6 August 2017 that there would be a $267&nbsp;million investment in Auckland and Wellington commuter rail, which would include (in Auckland) electrification of the line between [[Papakura railway station|Papakura]] and [[Pukekohe Railway Station|Pukekohe]], a third line between Westfield and Wiri, and (in Wellington) [[Double-track railway|double-tracking]] the line between [[Trentham railway station, New Zealand|Trentham]] and [[Upper Hutt Railway Station|Upper Hutt]], and several other improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11899427|title=National's mega transport plan announced|date=6 August 2017|accessdate=13 August 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|archive-date=13 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813142605/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11899427|url-status=live}}</ref>

It was likely that the first project would be the $50&nbsp;million rebuild of [[Whangarei Boys' High School]], but several other large projects totalling several billion dollars were also being considered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96400791/national-to-set-up-new-commission-to-handle-publicprivate-partnerships|accessdate=2 September 2017|title=National to set up new commission to handle public-private partnerships|date=1 September 2017|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|archive-date=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902052325/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96400791/national-to-set-up-new-commission-to-handle-publicprivate-partnerships|url-status=live}}</ref>

Labour's finance spokesman [[Grant Robertson]] announced on 14 September 2017, nine days before the election, that there would be "no new taxes or levies" until after the 2020 election. Any changes arising from its tax working group would not take effect until 2021. Robertson's announcement reversed the position taken by leader Jacinda Ardern who had reserved the right to implement changes before obtaining a mandate at the 2020 election, and came as a Newshub-Reid Research poll showed National rising at the expense of Labour. Labour had gone into the previous two general elections with a capital gains tax policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11922151|accessdate=13 September 2017|title=Labour tidies up tax policy, will delay new changes until 2020|date=14 September 2017|website=Nzherald.co.nz|archive-date=13 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913223958/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11922151|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Green====
The Green Party launched its election campaign on 9 July in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]. Bryce Edwards writing for ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' claimed the party's policies announced in the run up to the election showed that: "After years of watering down policies and desperately trying to make themselves more respectable to the mainstream, they have made an abrupt shift to the left". One of the major announcements was the party's new radical welfare reform proposals. Social policy academic and welfare campaigner Susan St John gave the social welfare reforms a "definite thumbs up", pointing to two "breathtakingly bold policies" within the reforms. These two aspects included in the reforms were, one: "sole parents to keep their sole parent support when they attempt to repartner. She is the one to say, not WINZ [Work and Income New Zealand], when she is in a partnership in the nature of marriage". A second aspect would be to make "the In–Work Tax Credit available to all low income families".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11892626 Political Roundup: The Greens get radical] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723035830/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11892626 |date=23 July 2017 }}.

The party also announced as part of its 'Families Package' it would lower the bottom rate of tax to 9%, introduce a new top rate of tax of 40% on those with an income over $150,000 and increase all core benefits by 20%.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/335209/video-turei-says-if-asked-she-will-pay-money-back 'Poverty should never be used as a weapon' – Metiria Turei] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722192443/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/335209/video-turei-says-if-asked-she-will-pay-money-back |date=22 July 2017 }}.

Another policy announced by the party was the proposed introduction of an interim $0.10 per litre excise levy on bottled water.

==== The Opportunities Party (TOP) ====
In taxation, the party proposed to deem a minimum rate of return for all assets (including housing, land and business assets) and charge a tax on it. At the same time, reduce income tax rates so that the total tax take would remain unchanged. The changes would be done gradually to ensure house prices remain stable while incomes grow.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cantin |first=John |last2=Elwela |first2=Darshana |date=15 December 2016 |title=The Opportunities Party asset tax policy released |url=https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/nz/pdf/Dec/taxmail-issue1-december-2016-kpmg-nz.pdf |journal=TaxMail |publisher=KPMG |access-date=20 August 2017 |archive-date=20 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820114745/https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/nz/pdf/Dec/taxmail-issue1-december-2016-kpmg-nz.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The party considered the existing tax regime to favour owners of capital and to over-tax wage earners, to favour home-owners and to disadvantage those who rent their home, and to encourage investment in real estate rather than productive businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.top.org.nz/top1 |title=Tax reform |publisher=The Opportunities Party |access-date=20 August 2017 |archive-date=21 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821084255/http://www.top.org.nz/top1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

They would tighten immigration laws and shift the focus to attracting highly skilled migrants. Criteria for immigrants would involve demonstrating they can help improve the living standards of all New Zealanders, limiting net immigration to 1% population growth per annum (i.e. 47,900 based on June 2017 population),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://m.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/estimates_and_projections/NationalPopulationEstimates_HOTPAt30Jun17.aspx |title= National Population Estimates: At 30 June 2017 |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |date= 14 August 2017 |accessdate= 20 August 2017 |archive-date= 20 August 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170820115311/http://m.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/estimates_and_projections/NationalPopulationEstimates_HOTPAt30Jun17.aspx |url-status= live }}</ref> and making access to permanent residency harder and longer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.top.org.nz/top2 |title=Smarter immigration |publisher=The Opportunities Party |access-date=20 August 2017 |archive-date=23 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823053300/http://www.top.org.nz/top2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The party's founder, Gareth Morgan, announced plans to almost halve the number of prison inmates by 2027. Morgan said "New Zealand has some of the world's worst and most outdated criminal justice policies", and to reduce the prison population by 40%, the party wanted to scrap the 'three strikes' law, extend eligibility for the Youth Court to offenders under 20, and increase funding for restorative justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95751164/gareth-morgan-wants-to-reduce-prison-population-by-40-per-cent|accessdate=14 August 2017|title=Gareth Morgan wants to reduce prison population by 40 per cent|date=14 August 2017|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|archive-date=14 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814174004/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/95751164/gareth-morgan-wants-to-reduce-prison-population-by-40-per-cent|url-status=live}}</ref>

====United Future====
On 21 August 2017, United Future leader and sole MP [[Peter Dunne]] announced that he was quitting politics at the election, citing recent polling and his perception that there was a mood for change in his seat of [[Ōhāriu (New Zealand electorate)|Ōhāriu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11908155|accessdate=21 August 2017|title=United Future leader and Ohariu MP Peter Dunne quits politics|date=21 August 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|archive-date=21 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821084655/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11908155|url-status=live}}</ref> United Future's candidate for the Botany electorate took over as leader shortly after, promising to move his party towards Labour because of its stance on social issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/09/meet-damian-light-united-future-s-new-leader.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|title=Meet Damian Light, United Future's New Leader|date=7 September 2017|work=Newshub|archive-date=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221247/http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/09/meet-damian-light-united-future-s-new-leader.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Major debates===
Television New Zealand ([[TVNZ]]) hosted three television leaders' debates; two between the National and Labour leaders, and one where the leaders of the secondary and minor parties were also invited. The two National-Labour debates were to be moderated by [[Newstalk ZB]] and ''[[Seven Sharp]]'' host [[Mike Hosking]]. Hosking withdrew from moderating the multi-party debate due to illness; the debate was instead moderated by ''1 News'' political editor Corin Dann.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mike Hosking too unwell to host TVNZ's second debate |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/96624856/mike-hosking-too-unwell-to-host-tvnzs-second-debate |website= [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]] |date= 7 September 2017 |access-date= 7 September 2017 |archive-date= 7 September 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170907181245/https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/96624856/mike-hosking-too-unwell-to-host-tvnzs-second-debate |url-status= live }}</ref> It also hosted an online debate focusing on young voters and youth issues, moderated by ''[[Breakfast (TVNZ)|Breakfast]]'' host [[Jack Tame]].<ref name="TVNZdebates" />

To be able to participate in their multiparty leaders debate, TVNZ requires a party to have an MP already in parliament, or be polling above 3% in the most recent One News/Colmar Brunton poll. Polling at 1.9%, new party TOP met neither of that criteria. Party leader Gareth Morgan filed an urgent judicial review, arguing that as he was polling higher than ACT, United Future and the Mãori party (who all fit the criteria by having at least one MP in parliament), his party had a right to be involved in the debates and TOP's exclusion was problematic. The case was heard at the Auckland High Court on 7 September, with the judge ultimately ruling against Morgan.<ref name="TOPdebate" /><ref>{{cite court |litigants= Morgan v Television New Zealand Limited |vol= [2017] |reporter= NZHC |opinion= 2178 |date= 7 September 2017 |url= https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/6a/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/ac91731c-1fa3-4812-a123-3587f78fe4f3/ac91731c-1fa3-4812-a123-3587f78fe4f3.pdf |accessdate= 28 May 2018 }}</ref>

[[Three (New Zealand)|Three]] hosted one television leaders' debate between the National and Labour leaders on 4 September. The debate was moderated by ''[[Newshub]]'' political editor [[Patrick Gower]].<ref name="TV3debates" />

[[Fairfax New Zealand|Fairfax]] again hosted a debate, the ''[[Stuff.co.nz|Stuff]]'' Leaders Debate (formerly called ''[[The Press]]'' Leaders Debate), between the National and Labour leaders on 7 September. It was moderated by Fairfax's South Island editor-in-chief [[Joanna Norris]] and ''Stuff'' political editor Tracy Watkins, and was streamed online.<ref name="stuffdebates" />
