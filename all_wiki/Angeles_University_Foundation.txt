It was established on May 25, 1962, by Agustin P. Angeles, Barbara Yap-Angeles and family. After only less than nine years of operation, the Institution was granted University status on April 16, 1971, by the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education, Culture and Sports]].

==History==
Angeles University Foundation was established on May 25, 1962, by the prominent Angeles family of [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]], [[Pampanga]] in the Philippines. It began as the Angeles Institute of Technology (AIT) but after 9 years of operation, the institution was granted University status on April 16, 1971, by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.

On December 4, 1975, the [[university]] was converted into a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation - a decision of the founding family motivated by the aim of providing education to the [[Central Luzon]] region. Concomitant with this decision, the Angeles couple and their children, namely, Rosario, Lutgarda, Emmanuel, Antonio, Jesusa, Josefina and Lourdes executed a Deed of Donation of their shareholdings in favor of the foundation as starting fund which resulted to the relinquishment of their ownership and proprietary rights. AUF was incorporated under [[Republic Act]] No. 6055, otherwise known as the Foundation Law, and is a tax-exempt institution approved by the [[Philippine government]].

On February 14, 1978, AUF was converted into a [[Catholic]] [[university]] making it the first in [[Central Luzon]]. On February 20, 1990, the AUF Medical Center was inaugurated which would serve as the teaching, training and research hospital of the university.
