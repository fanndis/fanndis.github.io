The '''National Association for Business Economics''' ('''NABE''') is the largest international association of applied economists, strategists, academics, and policy-makers committed to the application of economics.<ref name="Palgrave">{{cite news | url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/be/about_nabe.html | publisher= Palgrave Macmillan Journals | title=About The National Association for Business Economics | accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> Founded in 1959, it is one of the member organizations of the [[Allied Social Sciences Association]]. According to the association's website, "NABE's mission is to provide leadership in the use and understanding of economics.".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nabe.com/members.htm |title=About NABE |work=National Association for Business Economics Website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828075610/http://www.nabe.com/members.htm |archivedate=2009-08-28 }}</ref>

The association's membership is divided into subject-oriented subdivisions or ''roundtables'' including: Financial, Health Economics, International, Manufacturing, Real Estate/Construction, Regional/Utility, Small Business/Entrepreneurship, Technology, and Transfer Pricing.
