The '''European Economic Area''' ('''EEA''') was established via the ''Agreement on the European Economic Area'', an international agreement which enables the extension of the [[European Union]]'s single market to member states of the [[European Free Trade Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features#1 |title=The Basic Features of the EEA Agreement - European Free Trade Association |website=www.efta.int}}</ref> The EEA links the EU member states and three EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) into an internal market governed by the same basic rules.  The United Kingdom benefits from this relationship during the transition/implementation period planned by the treaties.<ref name="BrexitNote" /> These rules aim to enable [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|free movement of persons]], goods, services, and capital within the [[European Single Market]], including the freedom to choose residence in any country within this area. The EEA was established on 1 January 1994 upon entry into force of the EEA Agreement. The contracting parties are the EU, its member states, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and the United Kingdom.<ref name="agreement">{{cite web |title=AGREEMENT ON THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA |url=http://efta.int/~/media/Documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/Main%20Text%20of%20the%20Agreement/EEAagreement.ashx |website=[[European Free Trade Association]] |accessdate=7 May 2017 |date=19 August 2016}}</ref>

The EEA Treaty is a commercial treaty and differs from the [[Treaties of the European Union|EU Treaties]] in certain key respects. According to Article 1 its purpose is to "promote a continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relation". The EFTA members do not participate in the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] or the [[Common Fisheries Policy]].

The right to free movement of persons between EEA member states and the relevant provisions on safeguard measures are identical to those applying between members of the EU.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu">{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:21994A0103(01)&from=en |title=Agreement on the European Economic Area |publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]] |accessdate=2018-11-25}}</ref><ref name="Directive-2004-38-EC">{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004L0038 |title=Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|accessdate=2018-11-25}}</ref> The right and rules applicable in all EEA member states, including those which are not members of the EU, are specified in Directive 2004/38/EC<ref name="Directive-2004-38-EC" /> and in the EEA Agreement.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/>

The EEA Agreement specifies that membership is open to member states either of the EU or of the EFTA. EFTA states that are party to the EEA Agreement participate in the EU's internal market without being members of the EU or the [[European Union Customs Union]]. They adopt most EU legislation concerning the single market, with notable exclusions including laws regarding the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features#5 |title=The Basic Features of the EEA Agreement &#124; European Free Trade Association |publisher=Efta.int |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> The EEA's "decision-shaping" processes enable EEA EFTA member states to influence and contribute to new EEA policy and legislation from an early stage.<ref name="influence">{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/~/media/Files/Publications/Bulletins/eeadecisionshaping-bulletin.pdf |title=2182-BULLETIN-2009-07:1897-THIS-IS-EFTA-24|accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> Third country goods are excluded for these states on [[rules of origin]].

When entering into force in 1994, the EEA parties were 17 states and two [[European Communities]]: the [[European Economic Community|European Community]], which was later absorbed into the EU's wider framework, and the now defunct [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. Membership has grown to 30 states as of 2020: [[Member state of the European Union|27 EU member states]], as well as three of the four member states of the EFTA ([[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]]).<ref name="agreement"/> The Agreement is applied provisionally with respect to [[Croatia]]—the remaining and most recent EU member state—pending [[ratification]] of its accession by all EEA parties.<ref name="croatiarat"/><ref name="croatsign">{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/eea/news/croatia-joins-eea-2750 |title=Croatia joins the EEA |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2014 |publisher=European Free Trade Association}}</ref> The United Kingdom transitionally continues to be an EEA member after it withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020, and entered into a transition period ending 31 December 2020.

==Origins==
{{see also|1995 enlargement of the European Union|2004 enlargement of the European Union|2007 enlargement of the European Union}}

In the late 1980s, the EFTA member states, led by Sweden, began looking at options to join the then-existing [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the precursor of the [[European Union]] (EU). The reasons identified for this are manifold. Many authors cite the economic downturn at the beginning of the 1980s, and the subsequent adoption by the EEC of the "Europe 1992 agenda", as a primary reason. Arguing from a [[liberal intergovernmentalism|liberal intergovernmentalist]] perspective, these authors argue that large multinational corporations in EFTA countries, especially Sweden, pressed for EEC membership under threat of relocating their production abroad. Other authors point to the end of the [[Cold War]], which made joining the EEC less politically controversial for neutral countries.<ref name="Bache and George">Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006) ''Politics in the European Union.'' Second Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press: 543–548.</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Jacques Delors]], who was [[President of the European Commission]] at the time, did not like the idea of the EEC enlarging with more member states, as he feared that it would impede the ability of the Community to complete internal market reform and establish monetary union. He proposed a European Economic Space (EES) in January 1989, which was later renamed the European Economic Area, as it is known today.<ref name="Bache and George" />

By the time the EEA was established in 1994, however, several developments hampered its credibility. First of all, Switzerland rejected the EEA agreement in a national referendum on 6 December 1992, obstructing full EU-EFTA integration within the EEA. Furthermore, Austria had applied for full EEC membership in 1989, and was followed by Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland between 1991 and 1992 (Norway's EU accession [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|was rejected in a referendum]], Switzerland froze its EU application after the EEA agreement was [[1992 Swiss referendums|rejected in a referendum]]). [[Revolutions of 1989|The fall of the Iron Curtain]] had made the EU less hesitant to accept these highly developed countries as member states, since that would relieve the pressure on the EU's budget when the former socialist countries of Central Europe were to join.<ref name="Bache and George" />

==Membership==
The EEA Agreement was signed in [[Porto]] on 2 May 1992 by the then seven states of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), the [[European Communities|European Community]] (EC) and its then 12 [[Member state of the European Union|member states]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/1992/index_en.htm |title=1992 |work=The EU at a glance – The History of the European Union |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |accessdate=7 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183726/http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/1992/index_en.htm |archivedate=6 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://efta.int/~/media/Documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/Final%20Act/FinalAct.ashx |title=Final Act}}&nbsp;{{small|(434 KB)}}</ref> On 6 December 1992, Switzerland's voters rejected the [[ratification]] of the agreement in a constitutionally mandated [[referendum]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nytimes.com/1992/12/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-reax.html |title=EEA Rejection Likely to Hurt Swiss Markets |last=Mitchener |first=Brandon |date=7 December 1992 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref> effectively freezing the application for EC membership submitted earlier in the year. Switzerland is instead linked to the EU by a series of [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral agreements]]. On 1 January 1995, three erstwhile members of the EFTA—[[Austria]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]—acceded to the [[European Union]], which had superseded the European Community upon the entry into force of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] on 1 November 1993. Liechtenstein's participation in the EEA was delayed until 1 May 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/1995/index_en.htm |title=1995 |work=The EU at a glance – The History of the European Union |publisher=Europa |accessdate=9 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405170456/http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/1995/index_en.htm |archivedate=5 April 2009}}</ref> Any European State becoming a member of the EU shall, or becoming a member of EFTA may, apply to become a Party to the EEA agreement according to article 128 of the agreement.<ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:1994:001:FULL&from=DE</ref>

The ''EEA EFTA States'' (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein) signed a ''Separation Agreement'' with the UK on 28 January 2020, which is understood to mirror the EEA-relevant parts of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.<ref name=UK_Brexit/>

===European microstates===
{{See also|Microstates and the European Union}}

In November 2012, after the [[Council of the European Union]] had called for an evaluation of the [[Microstates and the European Union|EU's relations with the sovereign European microstates]] of Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, which they described as "fragmented",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/118458.pdf |title=Council conclusions on EU relations with EFTA countries |publisher=[[Council of the European Union]] |date=14 December 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> the [[European Commission]] published a report outlining options for their further integration into the EU.<ref name=options>{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0680:REV1:EN:HTML |title=EUR-Lex – 52012DC0680R(01) – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> Unlike Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to the current situation: 1) a Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area, 2) a comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states, 3) EEA membership, and 4) EU membership. The Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was dismissed in the near future because "the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries". The remaining options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the Commission.

As EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU members, the consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], the then [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Foreign Minister of Norway]] which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the [[internal market]] because their requirements differed from those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationen.no/2011/05/19/politikk/eos/eos-avtalen/eu/eeas/6642688/|title=Norge sier nei til nye mikrostater i EØS|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> [[Espen Barth Eide]], Støre's successor, responded to the Commission's report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway was open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decide to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/aktuelt/taler_artikler/eide_taler/2013/eosutvalget_130128.html?id=712742|title=Innlegg på møte i Stortingets europautvalg|date=28 January 2013|accessdate=1 April 2013|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/61007/article/item/null |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130413223348/http://www.klassekampen.no/61007/article/item/null |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2013 |title=Eide: Bedre blir det ikke |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2013 }}</ref><ref name=NORLIE>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationen.no/2012/12/08/politikk/eos-avtalen/eos/san_marino/eu/7845048/|title=Regjeringa open for diskutere EØS-medlemskap for mikrostatar|language=Norwegian|last=Aalberg Undheim|first=Eva|date=8 December 2012|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latribunasammarinese.net/edizioni/2013/01-gennaio/03-01-2013boiw.pdf |title=La Norvegia chiude le porte a San Marino |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |publisher=La Tribuna Sammarinese |page=7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307181930/http://www.latribunasammarinese.net/edizioni/2013/01-gennaio/03-01-2013boiw.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organisation. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside both the EFTA and the EU, should be given consideration.<ref name=NORLIE/>

On 18 November 2013, the EU Commission concluded that "the participation of the small-sized countries in the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political and institutional reasons", and that Association Agreements were a more feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2013/EN/1-2013-793-EN-F1-1.Pdf |title=EU Relations with the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Monaco and the Republic of San Marino: Options for their participation in the Internal Market |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2013 |publisher=European Commission}}</ref>

==Withdrawal of the United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom, in [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|a 2016 referendum]], voted to [[Brexit|withdraw from the European Union]]. Staying in the EEA, possibly eventually as an EFTA member, was one of the suggested options.

A 2013 research paper presented to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] proposed a number of alternatives to EU membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU's [[internal market]], including continued EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the [[Switzerland–European Union relations|Swiss model]] of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the single market.<ref>{{cite web |url=//www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/rp13-42.pdf |title=Leaving the EU – RESEARCH PAPER 13/42 |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2015-05-19 |publisher=House of Commons Library}}</ref> The United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member upon joining the European Community.

==Rights and obligations==
The EEA relies on the same "four freedoms" underpinning the [[European Single Market]] as does the European Union: the free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital among the EEA countries. Thus, the EEA countries that are not part of the EU enjoy free trade with the European Union. Also, the 'free movement of persons is one of the core rights guaranteed in the European Economic Area (EEA) [...] [it] is perhaps the most important right for individuals, as it gives citizens of the 31 EEA countries the opportunity to live, work, establish business and study in any of these countries'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/eea/policy-areas/persons |title=Free Movement of Persons &#124; European Free Trade Association |publisher=Efta.int |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref>

As a counterpart, these countries have to adopt part of the [[European Union law|Law of the European Union]].
However they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process.<ref name="influence" />

Agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA. Not being bound by the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] is perceived as very important by Norway and Iceland, and a major reason not to join the EU. The Common Fisheries Policy would mean giving away fishing quotas in their waters.

The EEA countries that are not part of the EU do not contribute financially to Union objectives to the same extent as do its members, although they contribute to the [[EEA Grants]] scheme to "reduce social and economic disparities in the EEA". Additionally, some choose to take part in EU programmes such as [[Trans-European Networks]] and the [[European Regional Development Fund]]. Norway also has its own Norway Grants scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/Financial-contribution/#.V7xAbSlriM8 |title=Norway's financial contribution |author=Lars-Erik Hauge |website=eu-norway.org |access-date=24 August 2016 |quote=10.08.2016}}</ref> After the EU/EEA enlargement of 2004, there was a tenfold increase in the financial contribution of the EEA States, in particular [[Norway]], to social and economic cohesion in the Internal Market (€1167&nbsp;million over five years).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Legislation==
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
The non-EU members of the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) have agreed to enact legislation similar to that passed in the EU in the areas of [[social policy]], [[consumer protection]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[company law]] and statistics.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} These are some of the areas covered by the former [[European Community]] (the "first pillar" of the [[European Union]]).

The non-EU members of the EEA are not represented in [[Institutions of the European Union]] such as the [[European Parliament]] or European Commission. This situation has been described as "fax democracy", with Norway waiting for their latest legislation to be [[fax]]ed from the Commission.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ekman |first1=Ivar |title=In Norway, EU pros and cons (the cons still win) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/world/europe/26iht-norway.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 May 2017 |date=27 October 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050608/debtext/50608-17.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 8 Jun 2005 (pt 17) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=2005-06-08 |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> However, EEA countries are consulted about new EU legislative proposals and participate in shaping legislation at an early stage. The EEA Agreement contains provisions for input from the EEA/EFTA countries at various stages before legislation is adopted, including consent at the [[EEA Joint Committee]]. Once approved at the EEA Joint Committee, it is part of the EEA Agreement, and the EFTA states within the EEA must implement it in their national law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efta.int/eea/decision-shaping |title=Influencing the EU – EEA Decision Shaping &#124; European Free Trade Association |publisher=Efta.int |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref>

==Institutions==
{{See also|European Free Trade Association#Institutions|l1=European Free Trade Association}}

The [[EEA Joint Committee]] consists of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) and has the function of amending the EEA Agreement to include relevant EU legislation. An [[EEA Council]] meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the EEA members.

Rather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are regulated by the European Union institutions, as well as the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] and the [[EFTA Court]]. The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EFTA Surveillance Authority performs the European Commission's role as "guardian of the treaties" for the EFTA countries to ensure the EEA Agreement is being followed. The EFTA Court performs a similar role to the [[European Court of Justice]]'s in that it resolves disputes under the EEA Agreement.

While the ECJ and European Commission are respectively responsible for the interpretation and application of the EEA Agreement in the EU (between EU member states and within EU member states), and the EFTA Court and EFTA Surveillance Authority are likewise respectively responsible for interpreting and monitoring the application of the EEA Agreement among the EEA-EFTA states (between the EEA-EFTA states and within the EEA-EFTA states), disputes ''between'' an EU state and an EEA-EFTA state are referred to the EEA Joint Committee rather to either court. Only if the Joint Committee cannot provide a resolution within three months, would the disputing parties jointly submit to the ECJ for a ruling (if the dispute concerns provisions identical to EU law) or to arbitration (in all other cases).<ref name="governance of international agreements">[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/governance.pdf Internal preparatory discussions on framework for future relationship – Governance of an International Agreement p. 14]</ref>

The original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court or the EFTA Surveillance Authority, as the "EEA court" (which would be composed of five European Court of Justice members and three members from EFTA countries and which would be functionally integrated with the ECJ)<ref name="EEA Judicial System">{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/3/2/2043.pdf |title=The EEA Judicial System and the Supreme Courts of the EFTA States|accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> and the European Commission were to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice informed the [[Council of the European Union]] (Opinion 1/91) that they considered that giving the EEA court jurisdiction with respect to EU law that would be part of the EEA law, would be a violation of the treaties, and therefore the current arrangement was developed instead. After having negotiated the Surveillance Authority, the ECJ confirmed its legality in Opinion 1/92.

The EFTA Secretariat is headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The EFTA Surveillance Authority has its headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] (the same location as the headquarters of the European Commission), while the EFTA Court has its headquarters in Luxembourg (the same location as the headquarters of the European Court of Justice).

==EEA and Norway Grants==
{{main|EEA and Norway Grants}}

The EEA and Norway Grants are the financial contributions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe. In the period from 2004 to 2009, €1.3&nbsp;billion of project funding is made available for project funding in the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe.

Established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which brings together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in the Internal Market, the EEA and Norway Grants were administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.
