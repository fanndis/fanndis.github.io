The '''National Museum of Women in the Arts''' (NMWA), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is "the only major [[museum]] in the world solely dedicated" to celebrating women's achievements in the visual, performing, and literary arts.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/about|title=About|publisher= National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}</ref> NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and [[Wilhelmina Holladay]]. Since opening its doors in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/about/our-history|title=Our History – National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Frida Kahlo]], and [[Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun]]. The museum occupies the old [[Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)|Masonic Temple]], a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art.  It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art.  The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions.  Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by [[Clara Peeters]] that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist.  They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.

The National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection.  After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition "American Women Artists, 1830–1930".  To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] to write ''Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra'' inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert.  In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people.

In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark {{convert|78810|sqft}} former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works.  After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility {{convert|84110|sqft}}.

===Wilhelmina Cole Holladay===
{{main|Wilhelmina Cole Holladay}}
[[Wilhelmina Cole Holladay]] is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.

Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at [[Elmira College]] in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the [[University of Paris]].  She is listed in ''[[Who's Who of American Women]]'', ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'', ''[[Who's Who in the World]]'', and she holds many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from the United States and the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the [[National Arts Club]] in New York City.

===New York Avenue Sculpture Project===
{{see also|Les Trois Grâces|Nana on a Dolphin}}
By 2015, a selection of sculptures will be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museums efforts are in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on," due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.

[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]'s works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations.<ref name="Trescott1">{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}</ref> The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into "sculpture islands," as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director [[Susan Fisher Sterling]]. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant.<ref name="Trescott1"/> The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 – March 9, 2014, was [[Chakaia Booker]].<ref>{{cite blog|url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/chakaia-booker-evocative-dynamic-works-in-the-new-york-avenue-sculpture-project/|date=March 7, 2012|title=Chakaia Booker: Evocative, Dynamic Works in the New York Avenue Sculpture Project|author=Orin Zahra|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts}}</ref>

The project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others.<ref name="Pressphalle">{{cite web | author=Michelle Cragle | year=2010 | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts Announces Sculpture Project | work=Press Center | publisher=Niki Charitable Art Foundation | url=http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306070929/http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | archivedate=2010-03-06 }}</ref>

These works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation.<ref name="Gopnik1">{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>

== Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center ==
The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/learn/library-archives|title=Library & Archives – National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.

Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work.

In spring 2007, the LRC launched "[[Clara database|Clara: Database of Women Artists]]," a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.
