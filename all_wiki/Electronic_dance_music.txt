{{short description|broad category of electronic music}}
'''Electronic dance music''' ('''EDM'''), also known as '''dance music''', '''club music''', or simply '''dance''',<ref name="Koskoff_44">{{harvp|Koskoff|2004|p=44}}</ref> is a broad range of percussive [[electronic music]] genres made largely for [[nightclub]]s, [[rave]]s and [[List of electronic dance music festivals|festivals]]. It is generally [[Record producer|produced]] for [[gapless playback|playback]] by [[DJ]]s who create seamless selections of tracks, called a [[DJ mix|mix]], by [[segue]]ing from one recording to another.<ref>{{harvp|Butler|2006|pp=12–13, 94}}</ref> EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a [[live PA]].

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of [[Rave music|raving]], [[pirate radio]]s and an upsurge of interest in [[club culture]], EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal; although both [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[Chicago house]] music were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the [[record industry]] remained openly hostile to it. There was also a perceived association between EDM and [[drug culture]], which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.<ref name=guardian-conquered />

Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, largely in Australia and the United States. By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance music" and the [[initialism]] "EDM" was being [[Push–pull strategy#Push–pull music marketing future|pushed]] by the American [[music industry]] and [[Music journalism|music press]] in an effort to [[rebranding|rebrand]] American rave culture.<ref name=guardian-conquered/> Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[House music|house]], [[techno]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]], [[hardstyle]], and [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], as well as their respective subgenres.<ref name="genres">{{cite journal|date=2001|title=Genres, Subgenres, Sub-Subgenres and More: Musical and Social Difference Within Electronic/Dance Music Communities|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=commstud_pubs|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=13|pages=59–75|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2001.tb00013.x|author=Kembrew McLeod}}</ref><ref name="burgess115">[[Richard James Burgess]] (2014), ''The History of Music Production'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 page 115], [[Oxford University Press]]</ref><ref name="armada">[https://www.armadamusic.com/edm-electronic-dance-music EDM – ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC], [[Armada Music]]</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Electronic music|History of DJing}}
Various EDM genres have evolved over the last 40 years, for example; [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[dance-pop]] etc. <!--Editors, please don't expand this section in an effort to describe every genre. The point is not to provide a genre guide, but to refer people to the "list of electronic music genres" page, and to briefly cover the relationship between the genres and "EDM".-->Stylistic variation within an established EDM genre can lead to the emergence of what is called a [[subgenre]]. Hybridization, where elements of two or more genres are combined, can lead to the emergence of an entirely new genre of EDM.<ref name="genres" />

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the "[[Krautrock]]" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

Early synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.

The use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan & Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&pg=PA144|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref name="thevinyldistrict">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You’re Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name="condry_59"/><ref name="rockin"/> Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.<ref name="condry_59">{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&pg=PA59|page=60}}</ref> "[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,<ref name="guardian_ymo">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&nbsp;– and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''<ref name="wire_2002">{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221–226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> [[Video game music|video game sounds]].<ref name="guardian_ymo"/> ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].<ref name="thevinyldistrict"/><ref name="rockin"/> The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.<ref name="rockin">''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140–141]{{Better source|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:真鍋ちえみ|Chiemi Manabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe – 不思議・少女|website=Discogs}}</ref> and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System – Orient Express|website=Discogs}}</ref>

Both places became synonymous with acid house, and it was during this period that [[MDMA]] gained prominence as a party drug. Other important UK clubs included Back to Basics in [[Leeds]], Sheffield's Leadmill and Music Factory, and [[The Haçienda]] in Manchester, where Mike Pickering and Graeme Park's spot, Nude, was an important proving ground for American [[Underground music|underground]] dance music.{{refn|{{harvp|Fikentscher|2000|p=5}}, in discussing the definition of underground dance music as it relates to [[post-disco]] music in America, states that: "The prefix 'underground' does not merely serve to explain that the associated type of music—and its cultural context—are familiar only to a small number of informed persons. Underground also points to the [[sociological]] function of the music, framing it as one type of music that in order to have meaning and continuity is kept away, to large degree, from mainstream society, mass media, and those empowered to enforce prevalent moral and aesthetic codes and values."|group=Note}}<ref>{{harvp|Rietveld|1998|pp=54–59}}</ref> The success of house and acid house paved the way for [[Detroit Techno]], a style that was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in Chicago, New York, and Northern England, with Detroit clubs catching up later.<ref>{{harvp|Brewster|2006|pp=398–443}}</ref> The term Techno first came into use after a release of a 10 Records/Virgin Records compilation titled ''Techno: The Dance Sound of Detroit'' in 1988.<ref>Reynolds (1999:71) notes that: "Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the Belleville Three decided to fasten on the word techno – a term that had been bandied about but never stressed – in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre."

One of the first Detroit productions to receive wider attention was Derrick May's "[[Derrick May (musician)#Career|Strings of Life]]" (1987), which, together with May's previous release, "Nude Photo" (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 [[house music]] boom (see [[Second Summer of Love]]).<ref>Unterberger R., Hicks S., Dempsey J, (1999).

Trance is mostly [[Instrumental music|instrumental]], although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure.

[[AllMusic]] states on progressive trance: "the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound, since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place. Emphasizing the smoother sound of [[Eurodance]] or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] than [[Basement Jaxx]]), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium.

By the early 1990s, a style of music developed within the rave scene that had an identity distinct from American house and techno. This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as "hardcore" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as "jungle [[techno]]", a genre influenced by Jack Smooth and Basement Records, and later just "jungle", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.

By 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book

====Dubstep====
{{Main|Dubstep}}
Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of [[UK garage]], drawing on a lineage of related styles such as [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[dub reggae]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]],  [[broken beat]], and [[grime (music genre)|grime]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic – Dubstep] "Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub"</ref><ref name=Reynolds>Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages&nbsp;511–516, ({{ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4}}).</ref> In the United Kingdom the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.<ref name=Reynolds /><ref>[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown], [[New Musical Express]], 21 February 1981, {{ISSN|0028-6362}}.</ref>

The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as [[B-side]]s of [[2-step garage]] single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the "Forward" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ "Hatcha Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

'''Trap music (EDM)'''

{{Main|Trap music (EDM)}}

Trap music (EDM) originated from [[techno]], dub, and [[Dutch House]], but also from [[Southern hip hop]] in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This form of trap music can be simplified by these three features: "1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure are similar, most tracks are usually between 70-110 bpm) – with vocals sometimes being pitched down, 1/3 dance music –  high-pitched Dutch synth work, Hardstyle sampling, as well as a plethora of trap remixes of popular EDM songs, and 1/3 dub (low frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)".<ref name="RunTheTrap">{{Cite web|url=https://runthetrap.com/what-is-trap-music/|title=What is Trap Music? Trap Music Explained|website=Run The Trap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Some of the artist that popularized this genre, along with several others, would be producers such as [[RL Grime]] with the tracks ''"Core"'' and ''"Scylla"'' released in 2014, [[Flosstradamus]] with their "''Hdynation Radio"'' album released in 2015 and [[Carnage (DJ)]] with his track ''"Turn Up"'' released in 2012.<ref name="RunTheTrap" /> Trap music in this connotation was characterized by "soulful synths, 808s, the pan flute, sharp snares and long, syrup-slurred vowels" which created dirty and aggressive beats resulting in "dark melodies".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/what-the-hell-is-trap-music-and-why-is-dubstep-involved-2408170|title=What the Hell Is Trap Music (and Why Is Dubstep Involved)?|last=Haithcoat|first=Rebecca|date=2012-10-04|website=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref><ref name="RunTheTrap" />

==Terminology==
The earliest use of the term "electronic dance music" (EDM) was by English musician, producer, manager and innovator [[Richard James Burgess]] in 1980, whose single "European Man" with his band [[Landscape (band)|Landscape]] used the term on the back of the single's record sleeve: "Electronic Dance Music... EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1816877-European-Man/images|title=Images for Landscape - European Man}}</ref> Burgess is therefore known as having coined the term, as well as "[[New Romantic]]". In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic in an interview with ''The Electricity Club'', Burgess said: "Initially I was using three terms - Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricityclub.co.uk/richard-james-burgess-interview/|title=RICHARD JAMES BURGESS Interview|date=July 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aimpsummit2019.sched.com/speaker/richard_burgess.1zkp1h7s|title=Richard James Burgess's schedule for 2019 AIMP Indie Music Publishing Summit}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundexchange.com/about/our-team/board-of-directors/richard-james-burgess/|title=Richard James Burgess|website=SoundExchange}}</ref> In the United States, the term was used as early as 1985, although the term "dance music" did not catch on as a blanket term.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]]</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US "rave culture" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, "dance music" or "dance" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup> What is widely perceived to be "club music" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, "electronic dance music" can mean different things to different people. Both "club music" and "EDM" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Though ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' debuted a "dance" chart in 1974, the larger US music industry did not create music charts until the late 1990s.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the "Electronic Dance Music Awards".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>

==Production==
[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]

Electronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]]. This setup is generally sufficient to complete entire productions, which are then ready for [[audio mastering|mastering]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Richard James|title=The History of Music Production|date=2014|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0199357161|pages=136–146}}</ref>

With the increasing popularity of electronic dance music, [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]] and venues realized that DJs could generate larger profits than traditional musicians; [[Diplo]] explained that "a band plays [for] 45 minutes; DJs can play for four hours. Rock bands—there's a few headliner dudes that can play 3,000–4,000-capacity venues, but DJs play the same venues, they turn the crowd over two times, people buy drinks all night long at higher prices—it's a win-win."<ref name=Spin /> Electronic music festivals, such as [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] (EDC) in [[Las Vegas]] and [[Ultra Music Festival]] in [[Miami]] also grew in size, placing an increased emphasis on visual experiences, and DJs who had begun to attain a celebrity status.<ref name=guardian-conquered/><ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/> Other major acts that gained prominence, including [[Avicii]] and [[Swedish House Mafia]], toured major venues such as [[arena]]s and stadiums rather than playing clubs; in December 2011, Swedish House Mafia became the first electronic music act to sell out [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/>

In 2011, ''Spin'' declared a "new rave generation" led by acts like David Guetta, [[Deadmau5]], and [[Skrillex]].<ref name="Spin" /> In January 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced a new EDM-focused [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart, tracking the top 50 electronic songs based on sales, radio airplay, club play, and online [[Streaming media|streaming]].<ref name="billboard-deschart">{{cite web|title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am & Britney at No. 1|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1|website=Billboard|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> According to Eventbrite, EDM fans are more likely to use social media to discover and share events or gigs.

US [[radio]] conglomerate [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] (formerly Clear Channel Media and Entertainment) also made efforts to align itself with EDM.

====Criticism of over-commercialization====
Following the popularization of EDM in America a number of producers and DJs, including [[Carl Cox]], [[Steve Lawler]], and [[Markus Schulz]], raised concerns that the perceived over-commercialisation of dance music had impacted the "art" of DJing. Cox saw the "press-play" approach taken by newer EDM DJs as unrepresentative of what he called a "DJ ethos".<ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/> Writing in ''[[Mixmag]]'', DJ Tim Sheridan argued that "push-button DJs" who use auto-sync and play pre-recorded sets of "obvious hits" resulted in a situation overtaken by "the spectacle, money and the showbiz".<ref name="mixmag-killing">{{cite news|title=Is EDM killing the art of DJing? |url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |work=Mixmag |accessdate=7 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529084448/http://www.mixmag.net/words/features/is-edm-killing-the-art-of-djing |archive-date=29 May 2014 }}</ref>

Some house producers openly admitted that "commercial" EDM needed further differentiation and creativity. Avicii, whose 2013 album [[True (Avicii album)|''True'']] featured songs incorporating elements of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], such as lead single "[[Wake Me Up (Avicii song)|Wake Me Up]]", stated that most EDM lacked "longevity".<ref name=mixmag-bored>{{cite news|title=EDM Will Eat Itself: Big Room stars are getting bored|url=http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|work=Mixmag|accessdate=20 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118085704/http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|archive-date=18 January 2014}}</ref> Deadmau5 criticized the [[wikt:homogenization|homogenization]] of popular EDM, and suggested that it "all sounds the same". During the 2014 Ultra Music Festival, Deadmau5 made critical comments about up-and-coming EDM artist [[Martin Garrix]] and later played an edited version of Garrix's "[[Animals (Martin Garrix song)|Animals]]" remixed to the melody of "[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]". Afterwards, [[Tiësto]] criticized Deadmau5 on [[Twitter]] for "sarcastically" mixing Avicii's "[[Levels (Avicii song)|Levels]]" with his own "[[Ghosts 'n' Stuff]]".<ref>{{cite news|title= Deadmau5 Trolls Martin Garrix with 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm' Remix of 'Animals' at Ultra|url= http://radio.com/2014/03/31/deadmau5-trolls-martin-garrix-with-old-macdonald-had-a-farm-remix-of-animals-at-ultra|work= radio.com|date= March 31, 2014|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140428174220/http://radio.com/2014/03/31/deadmau5-trolls-martin-garrix-with-old-macdonald-had-a-farm-remix-of-animals-at-ultra/|archive-date= April 28, 2014}}</ref><ref name=mixmag-soundsthesame>{{cite news |title=Deadmau5 gives reason for techno track: "EDM sounds the same to me"|url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/57693/Deadmau5_talks_making_techno_EDM_all_sounds_the_same_to_me |work= Mixmag   |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=mixmag-trolled>{{cite news|title=Deadmau5: The Man Who Trolled the World |url=http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/deadmau5/man-who-trolled-the-world |work=Mixmag |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425040816/http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/deadmau5/man-who-trolled-the-world |archive-date=25 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name=mixmag-afrojackfight>{{cite news| title=Afrojack and Deadmau5 argue over what's "good music"| url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/afrojack-and-deadmau5-argue-over-whats-good-music| work=Mixmag| accessdate=20 January 2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234411/http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/afrojack-and-deadmau5-argue-over-whats-good-music| archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

In May 2014, the [[NBC]] comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parodied the stereotypes of EDM culture and push-button DJs in a [[SNL Digital Short|Digital Short]] entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUV7Q1C1SU "When Will the Bass Drop?"].

After years of rapid growth, the American popular EDM market started to wane in 2016 when a number of artists famous for producing so-called 'big room' electro-house started to diversify stylistically. This development was directly referenced by two such DJs – David Guetta and [[Showtek]] – in a [[techno]]-influenced single released in April 2016 titled 'The Death of EDM'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ministryofsound.com/posts/articles/2016/june/david-guettas-new-track-is-worse-for-techno-than-it-is-for-edm/|title=David Guetta's New Track Is Worse For Techno Than It Is For EDM|website=Ministry of Sound}}</ref>

===International===
In May 2015, the [[International Music Summit]]'s Business Report estimated that the global electronic music industry had reached nearly $6.9 billion in value; the count included music sales, events revenue (including nightclubs and festivals), the sale of DJ equipment and software, and other sources of revenue. The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including [[East Asia]], [[India]], and [[South Africa]], credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests. A number of major festivals also began expanding into [[Latin America]].<ref name=thump-edmworldwide>{{cite web|title=Electronic Music Industry Now Worth Close to $7 Billion Amid Slowing Growth|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/electronic-music-industry-now-worth-close-to-7-billion-amid-slowing-growth|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>

In [[Ethiopia]] EDM has become part of mainstream music after the 2018 breakthrough of a young artist named [[Rophnan]] which incorporated EDM sound with traditional rhythms and melodies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbesafrica.com/30-under-30/2019/07/01/30under30-creatives-category-2019/|title=#30Under30: Creatives Category 2019|last=Mwendera|first=Karen|date=July 1, 2019|website=Forbes Africa}}</ref> In his shows, tens of thousands of youth were packing stadiums across the country and radios started to play the emerging genre.<ref name=":raregenre">{{Cite web|url=https://addisfortune.net/addisfortunefeature/rophnan-roots-with-rare-genre/|title=Rophnan: Roots with Rare Genre|website=Addis Fortune|access-date=July 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/rophnan-shines-leza-awards-night|title=Rophnan shines at Leza Awards night &#124; The Reporter Ethiopia English|website=www.thereporterethiopia.com}}</ref>

[[China]] is a market where EDM had initially made relatively few inroads; although promoters believed that the mostly instrumental music would remove a metaphorical [[language barrier]], the growth of EDM in China was hampered by the lack of a prominent rave culture in the country as in other regions, as well as the popularity of domestic [[C-pop|Chinese pop]] over foreign artists. Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s "Lose Myself". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's "hands-on" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in "encouraging" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>

In the 1980s, electronic dance music was often played at illegal underground rave parties held in secret locations, for example, warehouses, abandoned aircraft hangars, fields and any other large, open areas. In the 1990s and 2000s, aspects of the underground [[rave]] culture of the 1980s and early 1990s began to evolve into legitimate, organized EDM concerts and [[music festivals|festival]]s. Major festivals often feature a large number of acts representing various EDM genres spread across multiple stages. Festivals have placed a larger emphasis on visual [[spectacles]] as part of their overall experiences, including elaborate stage designs with underlying thematics, complex lighting systems, [[laser show]]s, and [[pyrotechnics]]. [[Rave#Attire|Rave fashion]] also evolved among attendees, which ''[[The Guardian]]'' described as progressing from the 1990s "kandi raver" to "[a] slick and sexified yet also kitschy-surreal image midway between [[Venice Beach]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]], [[Willy Wonka]] and a [[Pride parade|gay pride parade]]".<ref name=guardian-conquered/><ref name=wsj-dumbingdown/><ref name=da-edclv>{{cite news |title=An Electric Desert Experience: The 2014 EDC Las Vegas Phenomenon |url= http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2014/06/edc |author = Valerie Lee | date = June 27, 2014 | work =Dancing Astronaut }}</ref> These events differed from underground raves by their organized nature, often taking place at major venues, and measures to ensure the health and safety of attendees.<ref name=lat-fataltoll>{{cite news |title=A fatal toll on concertgoers as raves boost cities' income| url= http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-coliseum-rave-deaths-20130203-story.html#page=1| work =Los Angeles Times |date = February 3, 2013}}</ref> [[MTV]]'s Rawley Bornstein described electronic music as "the new rock and roll",<ref name=mainstream>Lisa Rose, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/new_jersey_basks_in_the_summer.html "N.J. basks in the glow of the brave new rave: Electronic dance festivals go mainstream"], ''Newark Star Ledger'', May 16, 2012.</ref> as has Lollapalooza organizer Perry Ferrell.<ref>{{cite news | author =Sarah Maloy |title=Lollapalooza's Perry Farrell on EDM and Elevating the Aftershow: Video |url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/480607/lollapaloozas-perry-farrell-on-edm-and-elevating-the| work =Billboard | date= August 4, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Ecstasy monogram.jpg|thumb|Pictured above is what the drug ecstasy commonly looks like. Although there are many different shapes or forms.]]
[[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine]] (MDMA), also known as ecstasy, "E", or "Molly", is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and [[house party|house parties]].<ref name="pmid22392347">{{cite journal |vauthors=Carvalho M, Carmo H, Costa VM, Capela JP, Pontes H, Remião F, Carvalho F, Bastos Mde L | title = Toxicity of amphetamines: an update | journal = Arch. Toxicol. | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1167–1231 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22392347 | doi = 10.1007/s00204-012-0815-5 | quote = MDMA has become a popular recreational drug of abuse at nightclubs and rave or techno parties, where it is combined with intense physical activity (''all-night dancing''), crowded conditions (aggregation), high ambient temperature, poor hydration, loud noise, and is commonly taken together with other stimulant ''club drugs'' and/or alcohol (Parrott 2006; Von Huben et al. 2007; Walubo and Seger 1999). This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the "rave" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, "Death" or "Dr. Death", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.

MDMA is occasionally known for being taken in conjunction with psychedelic drugs. The more common combinations include MDMA combined with [[LSD]], MDMA combined with [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], MDMA with [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and MDMA with the disassociative drug [[ketamine]]. Many users use [[menthol]]ated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation while experiencing the drug's effects. Examples include menthol cigarettes, [[Vicks VapoRub]], [[NyQuil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=May 2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826051026/http://drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |archive-date=August 26, 2009 }}</ref> and [[throat lozenge|lozenges]].
