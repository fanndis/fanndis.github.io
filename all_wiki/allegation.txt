In law, an '''allegation''' is a claim of a [[fact]] by a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[pleading]], charge, or defense. Until they can be [[Evidence|proved]], allegations remain merely assertions.<ref name="dictionary">[http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?typed=allegation&type=1] See definition at law.com</ref>

There are also marital allegations: marriage bonds and allegations exist for couples who applied to [[marriage licence|marry by licence]]. They do not exist for couples who [[Banns of marriage|married by banns]]. The marriage allegation was the document in which the couple alleged (or frequently just the groom alleged on behalf of both of them) that there were no impediments to the marriage.

Generally, in a civil [[complaint]], a [[plaintiff]] alleges facts sufficient to establish all the elements of the [[Cause of action|claim]] and thus states a [[cause of action]]. The plaintiff must then carry the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and the [[legal burden of proof|burden of persuasion]] in order to succeed in the [[lawsuit]].

A [[defendant]] can allege [[affirmative defense]]s in its answer to the complaint.

Other allegations are required in a pleading to establish the correct [[jurisdiction]], [[personal jurisdiction]] and [[subject matter jurisdiction]].

==Disjunctive allegations==
'''Disjunctive allegations''' are allegations in a pleading joined together by an "or". In a complaint, disjunctive allegations are usually ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' defective because such a pleading does not put the party on notice of which allegations they must defend.<ref name="dictionary" />

On the other hand, defendants often [[alternative pleading|plead in the alternative]] by listing seemingly inconsistent defenses. For example, "I did not do the crime", "if I did, I didn't know", or "even if I did know, I've got a good excuse".  Such a pleading may be considered disjunctive and may be permissible.
