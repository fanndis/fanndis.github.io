Hiddleston is well known for his portrayal of [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''. He was invited to audition by [[Kenneth Branagh]], the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on ''Ivanov'' and ''Wallander''. Hiddleston said of Branagh, "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'.
