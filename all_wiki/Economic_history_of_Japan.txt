The '''economic history of Japan''' is most studied for the spectacular [[Economic growth|social and economic growth]] in the 1800s after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. It became the first non-Western great power, and expanded steadily until its defeat in the [[Second World War]]. When Japan recovered from devastation to become the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second largest economy]] behind the United States, and from 2010 behind China as well. Scholars have evaluated the nation's unique economic position during the [[Cold War]], with exports going to both U.S.- and Soviet-aligned powers, and have taken keen interest in the situation of the post-Cold War period of the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Japanese "lost decades"]].

[[File:Tomimotosen Tobishimaike end of 7th century copper and antimony.jpg|thumb|Copper ''[[wadōkaichin]]'' (和同開珎) [[Japanese currency|coinage]] from the 7th century, [[Asuka period]]]]
The [[Yamato period|Yamato]] polity evolved greatly during the Asuka period, which was concentrated in the Asuka region and exercised power over clans in [[Kyūshū]] and [[Honshū]], bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed other clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on [[China|Chinese]] models (including the adoption of the [[Chinese written language]]), they developed a system of trade roads and a central administration. By the mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to central policy. The basic administrative unit of the {{Nihongo|''[[Gokishichidō]]''|五畿七道|extra="five cities, seven roads"}} system was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; others were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.<ref name="FRD">{{Cite journal

===Heian period (794–1185)===
{{Main|Heian period#Economics}}

While on one hand, the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and was a fundamental base for their power.<ref name="Morris 1964 p.73">Morris, I., ''The World of the Shining Prince; Court Life in Ancient Japan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964), p. 73.</ref> The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the ''[[Japanese castes under the ritsuryō|Ryōmin]]'' (良民 "Good People") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the [[samurai]] were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realized system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange.<ref name="Morris 1964 p.73"/>

Throughout the Heian period, the power of the imperial court declined. The court became so self-absorbed with power struggles, and with the artistic pursuits of court nobles, that it neglected the administration of government outside the capital.<ref name="fujiwara">{{cite book |last=Henshall |first=Kenneth |year=2012 |title=A History of Japan: From Stone Age to Superpower |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] | location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD76fF5hqf8C |isbn=978-0-230-34662-8|pages=29–30}}</ref> The nationalization of land undertaken as part of the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' state decayed as various noble families and religious orders succeeded in securing tax-exempt status for their private ''[[shōen]]'' manors<ref name="Heian">{{cite book |last=Totman |first=Conrad |author-link=Conrad Totman |year=2005 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Malden, MA |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBGGBAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-1-119-02235-0|pages=149–151}}</ref> By the eleventh century, more land in Japan was controlled by ''[[shōen]]'' owners than by the central government.

==Feudal Japan==

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
{{Main|Kamakura period}}

The samurai armies of the whole nation were mobilized in 1274 and 1281 to confront [[Mongol invasions of Japan|two full-scale invasions]] launched by [[Kublai Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]].<ref>Sansom, 441–442.</ref> Though outnumbered by an enemy equipped with superior weaponry, the Japanese fought the Mongols to a standstill in Kyushu on both occasions until the Mongol fleet was destroyed by typhoons called ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', meaning "divine wind". In spite of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]'s victory, the defense so depleted its finances that it was unable to provide compensation to its vassals for their role in the victory. This had permanent negative consequences for the shogunate's relations with the samurai class.<ref>Henshall, 39–40.</ref> Japan nevertheless entered a period of prosperity and population growth starting around 1250.<ref name="population"/> In rural areas, the greater use of iron tools and fertilizer, improved irrigation techniques, and [[double-cropping]] increased productivity and rural villages grew.<ref>Farris, 144–145.</ref> Fewer famines and epidemics allowed cities to grow and commerce to boom.<ref name="population"/>

{{Main|Muromachi period#Economic and cultural developments}}

In spite of the war, Japan's relative economic prosperity, which had begun in the Kamakura period, continued well into the Muromachi period. By 1450 Japan's population stood at ten million, compared to six million at the end of the thirteenth century.<ref name="population">Farris, 141–142, 149.</ref> Commerce flourished, including considerable trade with China and Korea.<ref>Farris, 152.</ref> Because the ''daimyōs'' and other groups within Japan were minting their own coins, Japan began to transition from a barter-based to a currency-based economy.<ref>Perez, 40.</ref> During the period, some of Japan's most representative art forms developed, including [[ink wash painting]], ''[[ikebana]]'' flower arrangement, the [[tea ceremony]], [[Japanese garden]]ing, ''[[bonsai]]'', and ''[[Noh]]'' theater.<ref>Perez, 43–45.</ref> Though the eighth Ashikaga shogun, [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa|Yoshimasa]], was an ineffectual political and military leader, he played a critical role in promoting these cultural developments.<ref>Harold Bolitho, "Book Review: Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion," ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', August 2004, 799–800.</ref>

The Japanese contact with the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) began when China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates in coastal areas of China. Japanese pirates of this era and region were referred to as ''[[wokou]]'' by the Chinese (Japanese ''wakō''). Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wokou threat, [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] accepted a relationship with the Chinese that was to last for half a century. In 1401 he restarted the tribute system, describing himself in a letter to the Chinese Emperor as "Your subject, the King of Japan". Japanese wood, sulfur, copper ore, swords, and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk, porcelain, books, and coins, in what the Chinese considered tribute but the Japanese saw as profitable trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Japan: Revised Edition|last=Mason|first=Richard|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2011|chapter=10}}</ref>

==First contacts with Europe (16th century)==
{{Main|Nanban trade period}}
[[Renaissance]] Europeans were quite admiring of Japan when they reached the country in the 16th century. Japan was considered a country immensely rich in precious metals, a view that owed its conception mainly to [[Marco Polo]]'s accounts of gilded temples and palaces,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/wonders-and-whoppers-27166/?no-ist|title=Wonders and Whoppers / People & Places / Smithsonian|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref> but also due to the relative abundance of surface ores characteristic of a volcanic country, before large-scale deep-mining became possible in Industrial times. Japan was to become a major exporter of copper and silver during the period.

[[File:Hasekura in Rome.JPG|thumb|left|170px|The [[Samurai]] [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1615, Coll. Borghese, Rome]]
Japan was also perceived as a sophisticated [[feudal society]] with a high culture and advanced pre-industrial technology. It was densely populated and urbanized. Prominent European observers of the time seemed to agree that the Japanese ''"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well"'' ([[Alessandro Valignano]], 1584, "Historia del Principo y Progresso de la Compania de Jesus en las Indias Orientales).

Early European visitors were amazed by the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially iron. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill.

===Trade with Europe===
The cargo of the first Portuguese ships (usually about four small ships every year) that arrived in Japan consisted almost entirely of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contacts with the Emperor of China, as a punishment for [[Wokou|Wakō]] pirate raids. The Portuguese (who were called ''Nanban'', lit. Southern Barbarians) therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.

[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|230px|A Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], 17th century]]
From the time of the acquisition of [[Macau]] in 1557, and their formal recognition as trade partners by the Chinese, the Portuguese started to regulate trade to Japan, by selling to the highest bidder the annual "Captaincy" to Japan, in effect conferring exclusive trading rights for a single [[carrack]] bound for Japan every year. The carracks were very large ships, usually between 1000 and 1500 tons, about double or triple the size of a large [[galleon]] or [[junk (ship)|junk]].

That trade continued with few interruptions until 1638, when it was prohibited on the ground that the ships were smuggling priests into Japan.

Portuguese trade was progressively more and more challenged by Chinese smugglers on [[junk (ship)|junks]], Japanese [[Red Seal Ships]] from around 1592<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKKOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA73|title=Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume III: A Century of Advance.

The Dutch, who, rather than "Nanban" were called "Kōmō" (Jp:紅毛, lit. "Red Hair") by the Japanese, first arrived in Japan in 1600, on board the ''Liefde''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://japan.nlembassy.org/you-and-netherlands/dutch-japanese-relations.html|title=Dutch-Japanese relations / Netherlands Missions, Japan|accessdate=17 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209205254/http://japan.nlembassy.org/you-and-netherlands/dutch-japanese-relations.html|archive-date=9 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their pilot was [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]], the first Englishman to reach Japan. In 1605, two of the ''Liefde'''s crew were sent to [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. In 1609 however, the Dutch [[Jacques Specx]] arrived with two ships in Hirado, and through Adams obtained trading privileges from Ieyasu.

The Dutch also engaged in piracy and naval combat to weaken Portuguese and Spanish shipping in the Pacific, and ultimately became the only westerners to be allowed access to Japan from the small enclave of [[Dejima]] after 1638 and for the next two centuries.

==Edo period==
{{Main|Edo period#Economy}}
[[File:Le Musée Paul Dupuy - Horloge japonaise à double foliot (Wadokei) - Période Edo.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Japanese-made clockwatch of the 18th century, or [[Wadokei]]. Then time changed in the season because from sunrise to sunset made 12 hours and from sunset to sunrise made 12 hours.]]
Economic development during the Edo period included urbanization, increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and [[merchant association]]s. Increasingly, [[Han (country subdivision)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts. By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of more than 1 million and [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods. Rice was the base of the economy, as the daimyō collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in [[Edo]]. To raise money, the daimyō used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not yet harvested. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].<ref>G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1946) pp 9-25.</ref>

The beginning of the [[Edo period]] coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]], during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. At the beginning of the Edo period, Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, and then continued to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 350 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], were active throughout Asia.

In order to eradicate the influence of Christianization, Japan entered in a period of isolation called [[sakoku]], during which its economy enjoyed stability and mild progress.  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was in [[Kyushu]] for export through the Chinese and Dutch. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in the mid-19th century.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>

During the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', literally "Dutch studies") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired from Western techniques.

==Meiji period==

After 1854, when the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] first opened the country to Western commerce and influence ([[Bakumatsu]]), Japan went through two periods of economic development. When the Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown and the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] was founded, Japanese [[Westernization]] began completely. The first term is during [[Empire of Japan|Pre-war Japan]], the second term is [[Post-war Japan]].<ref>George Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)</ref>

In the first half of the [[Meiji period]], most [[labour disputes]] occurred in the [[mining]] and [[Textile industry|textile industries]] and took the form of small-scale [[Strike action|strikes]] and spontaneous [[riot]]s. The second half of the period witnessed rapid [[industrialization]], the development of a [[capitalist economy]], and the transformation of many [[Feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal]] workers to [[wage labour]]. The use of strike action increased, and 1897, with the establishment of a union for metalworkers, saw the beginnings of the modern [[Labor unions in Japan|Japanese trade-union movement]].<ref>Nimura, K. (1997).

The industrial revolution first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas. By the 1890s, Japanese textiles dominated the home markets and competed successfully with British products in China and India, as well. Japanese shippers were competing with European traders to carry these goods across Asia and even to Europe. As in the West, the textile mills employed mainly women, half of them under age twenty. They were sent there by their fathers, and they turned over their wages to their fathers.<ref>E. Patricia Tsurumi, ''Factory Girls: Women in the Thread Mills of Meiji Japan'' (1992) p. 83</ref> Japan largely skipped water power and moved straight to steam powered mills, which were more productive, and which created a demand for coal.

1907 saw the greatest number of disputes in a decade, with large-scale riots at Japan's two leading copper mines, [[Ashio, Tochigi|Ashio]] and Besshi, which were only suppressed by the use of troops. None of these early unions were large (the metalworkers union had 3,000 members, only 5% of workers employed in the industry), or lasted longer than three or four years, largely due to strong opposition from employers and the government's [[anti-union]] policies, notably the Public Order and Police Provisions Law (1900).<ref name="Nimura">Nimura, K.

One of the biggest impacts on the economy that the Meiji period brought was the end of the feudal system. With a relatively loose social structure, the Japanese people were able to advance through the ranks of society more easily than before. They were able to do this by inventing and selling their own wares. More important was the fact that the Japanese people now had the ability to become more educated. With a more educated population, Japan's industrial sector grew significantly. Implementing the Western ideal of capitalism into the development of technology and applying it to their military helped make Japan into both a militaristic and economic powerhouse by the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name="East Asian Curriculum Project">{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/japan/japanworkbook/modernhist/meiji.html#top|title=Japan Answers the Challenge of the Western World|work=The Meiji Restoration and Modernization|publisher=Columbia University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014131542/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/japan/japanworkbook/modernhist/meiji.html|archive-date=2012-10-14|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref>

In the Meiji period, leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[O-yatoi gaikokujin]]). The government also built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.

To promote industrialization, the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the private sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide the economic conditions in which business could flourish. In short, government was to be the guide, and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Government emerged as chief promoter of [[private enterprise]], enacting a series of pro-business policies.

The development of banking and reliance on bank funding have been at the centre of Japanese economic development at least since the Meiji era.<ref>Richard A. Werner (2003), Princes of the Yen, Armonk: M. E. Sharpe</ref>

==Early 20th century==

From 1918 to 1921, a wave of major industrial disputes marked the peak of organized labour power. A prolonged [[economic slump]] that followed brought cutbacks in employment in [[heavy industry]].<ref name="Weathers">Weathers, C. (2009). Business and Labor. In William M. Tsutsui, ed., ''A Companion to Japanese History'' (2009) pp. 493-510.</ref> By 1928, the GNP of Japan at current prices peaked at ¥16,506 million. In the mid-1930s, the Japanese nominal wage rates were a tenth of those in the United States (based on mid-1930s exchange rates), while the price level is estimated to have been about 44% that of the US.<ref name="davis">{{cite book|last=Fukao|first=Kyoji|title=Real GDP in Pre-War East Asia: A 1934–36 Benchmark Purchasing Power Parity Comparison with the US|year=2007|url=http://gpih.ucdavis.edu/files/Fukao_Ma_Yuan.pdf}}</ref>

===Militarism===
Before [[World War II]], Japan built an extensive empire that included [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]], [[Manchuria]], and parts of northern China. The Japanese regarded this sphere of influence as a political and economic necessity, preventing foreign states from strangling Japan by blocking its access to raw materials and crucial sea-lanes, as Japan possessed very few natural and mining resources of its own, although it imported large amounts of coal from [[Korea]], [[Manchukuo]], and some regions of occupied China. Japan's large military force was regarded as essential to the empire's defense.

Rapid growth and structural change characterized Japan's two periods of economic development since 1868. In the first period, the economy grew only moderately at first and relied heavily on traditional agriculture to finance modern industrial infrastructure. When the [[Russo-Japanese War]] began in 1904, 65% of employment and 38% of the gross domestic product (GDP) was still based on agriculture but the modern industry had begun to expand substantially. During [[World War I]], Japan used the absence of the war-torn European competitors on the world market to advance its economy, generating a [[trade surplus]] for the first time since the isolation in the [[Edo period]]. By the late 1920s, manufacturing and mining contributed 23% of GDP, compared with 21% for all of agriculture. Transportation and [[transport|communications]] had developed to sustain heavy industrial development.

In the 1930s, the Japanese economy suffered less from the [[Great Depression]] than most industrialized nations, its GDP expanding at a rapid rate of 5% per year. Manufacturing and mining came to account for more than 30% of GDP, more than twice the value for the agricultural sector. Most industrial growth, however, was geared toward expanding the nation's military power.

Beginning in 1937 with significant land seizures in China, and to a greater extent after 1941, when annexations and invasions across Southeast Asia and the Pacific created the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], the Japanese government sought to acquire and develop critical natural resources in order to secure economic independence. Among the natural resources that Japan seized and developed were: coal in China, sugarcane in the [[Philippines]], petroleum from the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[Burma]], and tin and [[bauxite]] from the Dutch East Indies and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. Japan also purchased the rice production of [[Thailand]], Burma, and [[Cochinchina]].

During the early stages of Japan's expansion, the Japanese economy expanded considerably. Steel production rose from 6,442,000 tons to 8,838,000 tons over the same time period. In 1941 Japanese aircraft industries had the capacity to manufacture 10,000 aircraft per year. Much of this economic expansion benefited the "[[zaibatsu]]", large industrial conglomerates.

Over the course of the [[Pacific War]], the economies of Japan and its occupied territories all suffered severely. Inflation was rampant; the Japanese heavy industry, forced to devote nearly all its production to meet military needs, was unable to meet the commercial requirements of Japan (which had previously relied on trade with Western countries for their manufactured goods). Local industries were unable to produce at high enough levels to avoid severe shortfalls. Furthermore, maritime trade, upon which the Empire depended greatly, was sharply curtailed by damage to the Japanese merchant fleet over the course of the war.

By the end of the war, what remained of the Japanese Empire was wracked by shortages, inflation, and currency devaluation. Transport was nearly impossible, and industrial production in Japan's shattered cities ground to a halt. The destruction wrought by the war eventually brought the Japanese economy to a virtual standstill.

According to a 2020 study, Japan used its imperial power to boost its industrialization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ayuso‐Díaz|first1=Alejandro|last2=Tena‐Junguito|first2=Antonio|title=Trade in the shadow of power: Japanese industrial exports in the interwar years|journal=The Economic History Review|year=2020|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|pages=815–843|doi=10.1111/ehr.12912|issn=1468-0289|url=http://www.ehes.org/EHES_153.pdf}}</ref>

==Post-World War II==
{{See also|Japanese post-war economic miracle}}
The war wiped out many of the gains which Japan had made since 1868. About 40% of the nation's industrial plants and infrastructure were destroyed, and production reverted to levels of about fifteen years earlier. The people were shocked by the devastation and swung into action. New factories were equipped with the best modern machines, giving Japan an initial competitive advantage over the victor states, who now had older factories. As Japan's second period of economic development began, millions of former soldiers joined a well-disciplined and highly educated work force to rebuild Japan. Japan's colonies were lost as a result of World War II, but since then the Japanese had extended their economic influence throughout Asia and beyond.

===Occupation===
After the [[Japanese surrender]] on 15 August 1945, allied forces, mostly American, rapidly began arriving in Japan. Almost immediately, the occupiers began an intensive program of legal changes designed to democratize Japan. One action was to ensure the creation of a Trade Union law to allow for the first time workers to organize, strike, and bargain collectively, which was passed by the Diet of Japan on 22 December 1945.<ref>Dower, John. 'Embracing Defeat''. Penguin, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-14-028551-2}}. Page 82.</ref> While the law was created while Japan was under occupation, the law itself was largely a Japanese work. It was put together by a large legal advisory commission headed by the legal scholar Suehiro Izutaro. The commission was quite large, consisting of "three Welfare ministry bureaucrats and two scholars, a steering committee of 30 members (including the communist firebrand [[Kyuichi Tokuda]]), and an overall membership of more than 130 members representing universities, corporations, political parties, the bureaucracy, social workers, and labor."<ref>Dower, John. 'Embracing Defeat''. Penguin, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-14-028551-2}}. Page 245.</ref> US assistance totaled about US$1.9 billion during the occupation, or about 15% of the nation's imports and 4% of GNP in that period. About 59% of this aid was in the form of food, 15% in industrial materials, and 12% in transportation equipment. US grant assistance, however, tapered off quickly in the mid-1950s. US military procurement from Japan peaked at a level equivalent to 7% of Japan's GNP in 1953 and fell below 1% after 1960. A variety of United States-sponsored measures during the occupation, such as land reform, contributed to the economy's later performance by increasing competition. In particular, the post-war purge of industrial leaders allowed new talent to rise in the management of the nation's rebuilt industries. Finally, the economy benefited from foreign trade because it was able to expand exports rapidly enough to pay for imports of equipment and technology without falling into debt, as had a number of developing nations in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first =Andrew|editor-last = Gordon|title =Postwar Japan as History|date =1993|pages = 99–188, 259–92|publisher = University of California Press|url = https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01984.0001.001}}</ref>

A 2018 study, using the [[synthetic control method]] whereby Japan is compared to "synthetic Japan" (a combination of which are similar to Japan but without the US alliance), found that the US alliance allowed Japan's GDP to "grow much faster" from 1958 to 1968.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Beckley|first1=Michael|last2=Horiuchi|first2=Yusaku|last3=Miller|first3=Jennifer M.|date=2018|journal=Journal of East Asian Studies|volume=18|pages=1–21|doi=10.1017/jea.2017.24|issn=1598-2408|title=America's Role in the Making of Japan's Economic Miracle|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== "Gifts From Heaven" ===
In the wake of WWII, the Japanese citizenry was suffering from widespread exhaustion and despair from the war, known as "[[wiktionary:kyodatsu|kyodatsu]]," causing large-scale dejection and despondency.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Embracing Defeat: Japan in the wake of World War II.|url=https://archive.org/details/embracingdefeatj00dowe_375|url-access=limited|last=Dower|first=John|publisher=WW Norton & Company|year=2000|pages=[https://archive.org/details/embracingdefeatj00dowe_375/page/n74 87]–89}}</ref> The term "gifts from Heaven" was coined by cartoonist Kato Etsuro in his first illustrations under US military occupation.

===Rebuilding===
The early post-war years were devoted to rebuilding lost industrial capacity: major investments were made in electric power, coal, steel, and chemicals. By the mid-1950s, production matched prewar levels. Released from the demands of military-dominated government, the economy not only recovered its lost momentum but also surpassed the growth rates of earlier periods. Between 1953 and 1965, GDP expanded by more than 9% per year, manufacturing and mining by 13%, construction by 11%, and infrastructure by 12%. In 1965 these sectors employed more than 41% of the labor force, whereas only 26% remained in agriculture.

Japan's highly acclaimed post-war [[Education in Japan|education system]] contributed strongly to the modernizing process. The world's highest literacy rate and high education standards were major reasons for Japan's success in achieving a technologically advanced economy. Japanese schools also encouraged discipline, another benefit in forming an effective work force.

The mid-1960s ushered in a new type of industrial development as the economy opened itself to international competition in some industries and developed heavy and chemical manufactures. Whereas textiles and light manufactures maintained their profitability internationally, other products, such as automobiles, electronics, ships, and machine tools assumed new importance. The value added to manufacturing and mining grew at the rate of 17% per year between 1965 and 1970. Growth rates moderated to about 8% and evened out between the industrial and service sectors between 1970 and 1973, as retail trade, finance, real estate, information technology, and other service industries streamlined their operations.

===Oil crisis===
Japan faced a severe economic challenge in the mid-1970s. The [[1973 oil crisis]] shocked an economy that had become dependent on imported petroleum. Japan experienced its first post-war decline in industrial production, together with severe price inflation. The recovery that followed the first oil crisis revived the optimism of most business leaders, but the maintenance of industrial growth in the face of high energy costs required shifts in the industrial structure.

Changing price conditions favored [[Energy conservation|conservation]] and alternative sources of industrial energy. Although the investment costs were high, many energy-intensive industries successfully reduced their dependence on oil during the late 1970s and 1980s and enhanced their productivity. Advances in microcircuitry and [[semiconductor]]s in the late 1970s and 1980s led to new growth industries in [[consumer electronics]] and computers, and to higher productivity in pre-established industries. The net result of these adjustments was to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing and to expand knowledge-intensive industries. The service industries expanded in an increasingly postindustrial economy.

Structural economic changes, however, were unable to check the slowing of economic growth as the economy matured in the late 1970s and 1980s, attaining annual growth rates at only 4–6%. But these rates were remarkable in a world of expensive petroleum and in a nation of few natural resources. Japan's average growth rate of 5% in the late 1980s, for example, was far higher than the 3.8% growth rate of the United States. Despite more petroleum price increases in 1979, the strength of the Japanese economy was apparent. It expanded without the double-digit inflation that afflicted other industrial nations (and that had bothered Japan itself after the first oil crisis in 1973). Japan experienced slower growth in the mid-1980s, but its [[demand]]-sustained [[economic boom]] of the late 1980s revived many troubled industries.

===Factors of growth===
Complex economic and institutional factors affected Japan's post-war growth. First, the nation's prewar experience provided several important legacies. The [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]] (1600–1867) bequeathed a ''vital commercial sector'' in burgeoning urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite (although one with limited knowledge of European science), a sophisticated government [[bureaucracy]], productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads. The buildup of industry during the Meiji period to the point where Japan could vie for world power was an important prelude to post-war growth from 1955 to 1973, and provided a pool of experienced labor.<ref>Richard Katz, ''Japanese Phoenix: the long road to economic revival'' (2002)</ref>

Second, and more important, was the level and quality of investment that persisted through the 1980s. Investment in capital equipment, which averaged more than 11% of GNP during the prewar period, rose to about 20% of GNP during the 1950s and to more than 30% in the late 1960s and 1970s. During the economic boom of the late 1980s, the rate still hovered around 20%. Japanese businesses imported the latest technologies to develop the industrial base. As a latecomer to [[Industrial Revolution|modernization]], Japan was able to avoid some of the trial and error earlier needed by other nations to develop industrial processes. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan improved its industrial base through licensing from the US, patent purchases, and imitation and improvement of foreign inventions. In the 1980s, industry stepped up its [[research and development]], and many firms became famous for their innovations and creativity.<ref>Yamamura Kozo and Yasuba Yasukichi, eds., ''The Political Economy of Japan: Volume 1 – The Domestic Transformation'' (1987)</ref>

Japan's [[labor force]] contributed significantly to economic growth, because of its availability and literacy, and also because of its reasonable wage demands. Before and immediately after World War II, the transfer of numerous agricultural workers to modern industry resulted in rising productivity and only moderate wage increases. As population growth slowed and the nation became increasingly industrialized in the mid-1960s, wages rose significantly. However, labor union cooperation generally kept salary increases within the range of gains in productivity.

High productivity growth played a key role in post-war economic growth. The highly skilled and educated labor force, extraordinary [[savings rate]]s and accompanying levels of investment, and the low growth of Japan's labor force were major factors in the high rate of productivity growth.

The nation also benefited from [[economies of scale]]. Although medium-sized and small enterprises generated much of the nation's employment, large facilities were the most productive. Many industrial enterprises consolidated to form larger, more efficient units. Before World War II, large holding companies formed wealth groups, or [[zaibatsu]], which dominated most industry. The zaibatsu were dissolved after the war, but [[keiretsu]]—large, modern industrial enterprise groupings—emerged. The coordination of activities within these groupings and the integration of smaller [[subcontractor]]s into the groups enhanced industrial efficiency.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mikio Sumiya|title=A History of Japanese Trade and Industry Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVN_OTa_KCYC&pg=PA158|year=2000|publisher=Oxford UP|page=158|isbn=9780191584022}}</ref>

Japanese corporations developed strategies that contributed to their immense growth. Growth-oriented corporations that took chances competed successfully. ''Product diversification'' became an essential ingredient of the growth patterns of many keiretsu. Japanese companies added plant and human capacity ahead of demand. Seeking market share rather than quick profit was another powerful strategy.

Finally, circumstances beyond Japan's direct control contributed to its success. International conflicts tended to stimulate the Japanese economy until the devastation at the end of World War II. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), [[World War I]] (1914–18), the [[Korean War]] (1950–53), and the [[Vietnam War|Second Indochina War]] (1954–75) brought economic booms to Japan. In addition, benign treatment from the United States after World War II facilitated the nation's reconstruction and growth.

===The changing occupational structure===
As late as 1955, some 40% of the labor force still worked in agriculture, but this figure had declined to 17% by 1970 and to 7.2% by 1990 and under 5% in the 21st century as Japan imported more and more of its food and small family farms disappeared.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gary D. Allinson|title=Japan's Postwar History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yWAqHe-TO8C&pg=PA84|year=2004|publisher=Cornell UP|pages=84ff|isbn=0801489121}}</ref>

Japan's economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s was based on the rapid expansion of heavy manufacturing in such areas as automobiles, steel, shipbuilding, chemicals, and electronics. The secondary sector (manufacturing, construction, and mining) expanded to 35.6% of the work force by 1970. By the late 1970s, however, the Japanese economy began to move away from heavy manufacturing toward a more service-oriented (tertiary sector) base. During the 1980s, jobs in wholesaling, retailing, finance, insurance, real estate, transportation, communications, and government grew rapidly, while secondary-sector employment remained stable. The tertiary sector grew from 47% of the work force in 1970 to 59.2% in 1990.

===1980s===
Throughout the 1970s, Japan had the world's third largest gross national product ([[Measures of national income and output|GNP]])—just behind the United States and Soviet Union—and ranked first among major industrial nations in 1990 in per capita GNP at US$23,801, up sharply from US$9,068 in 1980. After a mild economic slump in the mid-1980s, Japan's economy began a period of expansion in 1986 that continued until it again entered a [[recession|recessionary period]] in 1992. Economic growth averaging 5% between 1987 and 1989 revived industries, such as steel and construction, which had been relatively dormant in the mid-1980s, and brought record salaries and employment. In 1992, however, Japan's [[real dollars|real]] GNP growth slowed to 1.7%. Even industries such as automobiles and electronics that had experienced phenomenal growth in the 1980s entered a recessionary period in 1992. The domestic market for Japanese automobiles shrank at the same time that Japan's share of the United States' market declined. Foreign and domestic demand for Japanese electronics also declined, and Japan seemed on the way to losing its leadership in the world [[semiconductor]] market to the United States, Korea and Taiwan.

Unlike the economic booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the key role in economic expansion, domestic [[demand]] propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental economic restructuring, moving from dependence on exports to reliance on domestic demand. The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private plant and equipment spending and of consumers to go on a buying spree. Japan's imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese post-war technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened domestic demand for high-technology products such as electronics, and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better medical care and more welfare; expanded leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.<ref>Jeffrey Kingston, ''Japan in Transformation, 1952–2000'' (2001), pp. 36–44</ref>

During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its emphasis from primary and secondary activities (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information became an important resource and product, central to wealth and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, home to some of the world's major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world's largest [[stock exchange]], the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll. In 1992, the [[Nikkei 225]] stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 by the end of the year.

===Since the end of the Cold War===

====1989 Economic Bubble====
{{Further|Japanese asset price bubble}}
In the decades following World War II, Japan implemented stringent [[tariff]]s and policies to encourage the people to save their income. With more money in banks, loans and credit became easier to obtain, and with Japan running large [[balance of trade|trade surpluses]], the [[Japanese yen|yen]] appreciated against foreign currencies. This allowed local companies to invest in capital resources more easily than their overseas competitors, which reduced the price of Japanese-made goods and widened the trade surplus further. And, with the yen appreciating, financial assets became lucrative.

With so much money readily available for investment, speculation was inevitable, particularly in the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] and the real estate market. The [[Nikkei 225|Nikkei stock index]] hit its all-time high on 29 December 1989 when it reached an intra-day high of 38,957.44 before closing at 38,915.87. The rates for housing, stocks, and bonds rose so much that at one point the government issued 100-year bonds. Additionally, banks granted increasingly risky loans.

At the height of the bubble, real estate was extremely over-valued. Prices were highest in Tokyo's [[Ginza]] district in 1989, with choice properties fetching over US$1.5 million per square metre ($139,000 per square foot). Prices were only slightly less in other areas of Tokyo. By 2004, prime "A" property in Tokyo's financial districts had slumped and Tokyo's residential homes were a fraction of their peak, but still managed to be listed as the most expensive real estate in the world. Trillions were wiped out with the combined collapse of the Tokyo stock and real estate markets.

With Japan's economy driven by its high rates of reinvestment, this crash hit particularly hard. Investments were increasingly directed out of the country, and Japanese manufacturing firms lost some degree of their technological edge. As Japanese products became less competitive overseas, some people argue that the low consumption rate began to bear on the economy, causing a [[deflation]]ary spiral.

The easily obtainable credit that had helped create and engorge the real-estate bubble continued to be a problem for several years to come, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low guarantee of being repaid. Loan Officers and Investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to put their money under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called "zombie businesses". Eventually a [[carry trade]] developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere and then the Japanese were paid back, with a nice profit for the trader.

The time after the {{nihongo|bubble's collapse|崩壊|hōkai}}, which occurred gradually rather than catastrophically, is known as the {{nihongo|"lost decade or end of the 20th century"|失われた10年|ushinawareta jūnen}} in Japan. The [[Nikkei 225]] stock index eventually bottomed out at 7603.76 in April 2003, moved upward to a new peak of 18,138 in June 2007, before resuming a downward trend. The downward movement in the Nikkei is likely due to global as well as national economic problems.

====Deflation from the 1990s to present====
{{See also|Lost Decade (Japan)}}
{{expand section|date=August 2013}}
Deflation in Japan started in the early 1990s. On 19 March 2001, the [[Bank of Japan]] and the Japanese government tried to eliminate deflation in the economy by reducing interest rates (part of their '[[quantitative easing]]' policy). Despite having interest rates near zero for a long period, this strategy did not succeed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Spiegel|first=Mark|title=Did Quantitative Easing by the Bank of Japan "Work"?|date=20 October 2006|url=http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2006/el2006-28.html}}</ref> Once the near-zero interest rates failed to stop deflation, some economists, such as [[Paul Krugman]], and some Japanese politicians spoke of deliberately causing (or at least creating the fear of) inflation.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/jpage.html See, as one example, Paul Krugman's website]</ref> In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the lowest interest rates in the developed world and deflation continued.<ref>{{cite news|title=Economic survey of Japan 2008: Bringing an end to deflation under the new monetary policy framework|date=7 April 2008|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/12/0,3343,en_2649_34115_40363340_1_1_1_1,00.html}}</ref>

Systemic reasons for deflation in Japan can be said to include:
* Fallen asset prices. There was a large [[price bubble]] in both [[equities]] and real estate in Japan in the 1980s (peaking in late 1989).
* Insolvent companies: Banks lent to companies and individuals that invested in real estate. When real estate values dropped, many loans went unpaid. The banks could try to collect on the collateral (land), but due to reduced real estate values, this would not pay off the loan. Banks have delayed the decision to collect on the collateral, hoping asset prices would improve. These delays were allowed by national banking regulators. Some banks make even more loans to these companies that are used to service the debt they already have. This continuing process is known as maintaining an "unrealized loss", and until the assets are completely revalued and/or sold off (and the loss realized), it will continue to be a deflationary force in the economy.
* Insolvent banks: Banks with a large percentage of their loans which are "non-performing" (loans for which payments are not being made), but have not yet written them off. These banks cannot lend more money until they increase their cash reserves to cover the bad loans. Thus the number of loans is reduced sooner and less funds are available for economic growth.
* Fear of insolvent banks: Japanese people are afraid that banks will collapse so they prefer to buy gold or (United States or Japanese) Treasury bonds instead of saving their money in a bank account. People also save by investing in real estate.

''[[The Economist]]'' has suggested that improvements to bankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax law will aid Japan's economy. In October 2009 the Japanese government announced plans to increase [[tobacco tax|tobacco]] and [[green tax]]es while reducing rates for small and medium-sized companies, according to [[NHK]].

In 2011 Japan under [[Yoshihiko Noda]] decided to consider joining the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]].

The [[Late-2000s recession|global economic recession]] of the late 2000s significantly harmed the economy of Japan. The nation suffered a 0.7% loss in [[Real gross domestic product|real GDP]] in 2008 followed by a severe 5.2% loss in 2009. In contrast, the data for world real GDP growth was a 3.1% hike in 2008 followed by a 0.7% loss in 2009.<ref>[http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=66&c=ja&c=xx&l=en] mundi index</ref>

Economic policy over the past several quarters in Japan has been influenced by the '[[Abenomics]]' debate, with the government pursuing aggressive government infrastructure spending hikes and significant yen devaluations.
