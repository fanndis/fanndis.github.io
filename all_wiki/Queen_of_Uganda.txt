'''Queen of Uganda''' was a title used by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] while [[Uganda (1962–1963)|Uganda]] was an independent [[constitutional monarchy]] between 9 October 1962 and 9 October 1963. She was also the Sovereign of many other countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[Uganda Independence Act]], passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in 1962, transformed the British [[Uganda Protectorate]] into an independent [[sovereign state]] on 9 October 1962. The Queen was ceremonial [[head of state]] with her constitutional roles delegated to the [[List of Governors-General of Uganda|Governor-General of Uganda]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Uganda Constitution, April 1966|author=

The [[Parliament of Uganda]] amended the [[Constitution of Uganda|constitution]] in 1963,<ref>Constitution of Uganda (First Amendment) Act, Act No. 61 of 1963</ref> and on 9 October that year Uganda became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]] with a [[President of Uganda|president]] as its head of state.
