{{short description|Series of investigative press reports that focused on then-President Bill Clinton}}
The '''Arkansas Project''' was a series of investigative press reports, funded primarily by conservative businessman [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], that focused on criticism of then-President [[Bill Clinton]] and his administration. Scaife spent nearly $2 million on the project.<ref>Neil A. Lewis. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F16FF3D580C768DDDAD0894D0494D81 "Almost $2 Million Spent in Magazine's Anti-Clinton Project, but on What?"]. ''The New York Times''. April 15, 1998</ref>

The investigations included the investigation of the 1970s' real estate investment that Bill and [[Hillary Clinton]] had made in a development known as [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]], re-opening of allegations that then Governor Bill Clinton had sexually harassed an Arkansas state employee, and a reexamination of the death of White House aide [[Vincent Foster]] which multiple official investigations had [[Suicide of Vince Foster|found to be a suicide]].

==Background==
In the 1980s and 1990s, the politically conservative ''[[American Spectator]]'' magazine received donations from conservative benefactors. The Arkansas project began shortly after Richard Mellon Scaife, one of the largest donors to the magazine, directed that his donations be used for stories aimed at investigating potentially scandalous material regarding the Clintons. According to R. [[Emmett Tyrrell]] Jr., editor-in-chief of the ''Spectator'', the idea for the Arkansas Project was hatched on a fishing trip on the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the fall of 1993. The "Arkansas Project" name that later became famous was conceived as a joke; the actual name used within the ''Spectator'' and the Scaife foundation was the "Editorial Improvement Project."

Project reporter/investigators were hired, including [[David Brock]], who later described his role at that of as a Republican "hitman",<ref name="legacy" /> and [[Rex Armistead]], a former police officer who was reportedly paid $350,000 for his efforts.<ref name="Blinded">David Brock. ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded by the Right:The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative]]''. Three Rivers Press. (p. 228). Brock refers to his part of the project and the wider scope of [[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]].</ref>{{Better source|reason=Secondary source needed for material involving Brock, plus Brock's credibility is questionable.|date=August 2017}} Also assisting the project was Parker Dozhier, a bait shop owner who was reportedly obsessed with bringing down Bill Clinton.<ref name="wapo2">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife092998.htm Anti-Clinton Billionaire Goes Before Grand Jury], ''Washington Post, September 29, 1998</ref> They were tasked with investigating the Clintons and uncovering stories tying the Clintons to murders and drug smuggling as well as adultery.<ref>[[Murray Waas]], [http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/26news.html Behind the Clinton cocaine smear]. ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2000.</ref>

According to Brock, Armistead and Brock met at an airport hotel in Miami, Florida, in late 1993. There, Armistead laid out an elaborate "Vince Foster murder scenario",  a scenario that Brock later claimed was implausible.<ref name="blinded">David Brock. ''[[Blinded by the Right]].

A24,<!--access date 2006-05-03--></ref> Regardless, by the end of 1993, Brock was writing stories for the Spectator that made him "a lead figure in the drive to" expose Clinton.<ref name="legacy">[http://old.mediatransparency.org/issue.php?issueID=4 David Brock & the Watergate Legacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725110417/http://old.mediatransparency.org/issue.php?issueID=4 |date=2011-07-25 }} ''Media Transparency.''</ref>

[[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]], who would later represent [[George W. Bush]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' and be named [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]], was a Board Member of the American Spectator Educational Foundation, and is thought to have known about or played some role in the Arkansas Project.<ref name="salon">Tapper, Jake [http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/11/19/lawyers/index.html "Boies vs. Olson"], [[Salon.com]]|, November 19, 2000 <!--access date 2009-04-27--></ref> His firm [[Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher]] provided $14,000 worth of legal services, and he himself wrote or co-authored several articles that were paid for with Project funds. During Olson's Senate [[advise and consent|confirmation hearing]] for Solicitor General, majority Republicans blocked Senator [[Patrick Leahy]]'s call for further committee inquiries on the subject of Olson's ties to the Arkansas Project.<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/05/14/archive/index.html], Salon.com, May 14, 2001</ref><ref>[http://archive.salon.com/news/1998/08/cov_13news.html]</ref>

==News stories==
The investigations funded by Scaife money mostly concentrated on the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]] investments, which extended to a conspiracy theory surrounding the death of [[Vincent Foster|Vince Foster]], a Clinton aide with connections to Whitewater. [[Christopher W. Ruddy]], a reporter for the Scaife-owned ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', published a series of articles claiming Clinton was behind Foster's suicide.<ref>Trudy Lieberman. [http://archives.cjr.org/year/96/2/foster.asp The Vincent Foster Factory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002233558/http://archives.cjr.org/year/96/2/foster.asp |date=October 2, 2006 }}. [[Columbia Journalism Review]], April 1996.</ref> Although Clinton was never found to have broken the law by [[Ken Starr]], Ruddy published his book, ''[[The Strange Death of Vincent Foster]]'', regardless. His conspiracy theories about Foster have since been dismissed even by some more outspoken conservatives like [[Ann Coulter]].<ref>"Even if Christopher Ruddy's ''The Strange Death of Vince Foster'' was considered a conservative hoax book, it was also conservatives who discredited it." Chapter Six Endnote 105, pp. 224–25, ''[[Slander (book)|Slander]]'', [[Ann Coulter]].</ref> The ''Spectator'' stopped receiving Scaife funding when "it ran a scathing review of [the] book ..."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife092998.htm Anti-Clinton Billionaire Goes Before Grand Jury]''The Washington Post'', September 29, 1998</ref>

In late November 1997 after Jeff Corry's review of Ruddy's book was published, [[Reed Irvine]] of [[Accuracy in Media]] (who has received about $2 million from Scaife since 1977<ref name="wapo3">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifeside050299.htm Scaifes Side], ''The Washington Post'', May 2, 1999</ref>) "reported in his newsletter that Scaife had called Tyrrell to say he was cutting him off."<ref name="wapo3" /> In fact, "Tyrrell confirmed in an interview that the call occurred but said he couldn't remember details of the conversation that ended all support from the man who had been his principal benefactor for nearly 30 years."<ref name="wapo3" />

In 1999, [[Joseph Farah]]'s [[Western Journalism Center]] "placed some 50 ads reprinting Ruddy's ''Tribune-Review'' stories in ''[[The Washington Times]]'', then repackaged the articles as a packet titled 'The Ruddy Investigation,' which sold for $12."<ref name="WJC">[http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.html Western Journalism Center – Joseph Farah], PublicEye.org</ref> Shortly thereafter, the Western Journalism Center "circulated a video featuring Ruddy's claims, 'Unanswered-The Death of Vincent Foster,' that was produced by author [[James Dale Davidson|James Davidson]], chairman of the [[National Taxpayers Union]] (NTU) and co-editor of the Strategic Investment newsletter."<ref name="WJC" />

In the late 1990s, Ruddy and Farah turned their focus to the internet with help from Scaife. Ruddy founded [[NewsMax]] and Farah started [[WorldNetDaily]] which report news from a conservative perspective. Eventually, Scaife became an investor and the third-largest stockholder of NewsMax.<ref name="SEC">[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167574/000095014402002242/g74688a1sb-2a.txt NewsMax Media, Inc.

==Paula Jones==
As an early part of the [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]] matter, writer David Brock published an article, ''His Cheating Heart''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brock|first1=David|title=His Cheatin’ Heart|url=http://spectator.org/print/49976|website=The American Spectator|accessdate=10 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425150421/http://spectator.org/print/49976|archive-date=25 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> that refers to a liaison between Clinton and woman named Paula. This led to the [[Paula Jones]] affair<ref name="redemption">[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/dont_quote_me/multi-page/documents/04855837.asp David Brock: Redemption tale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127210002/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/dont_quote_me/multi-page/documents/04855837.asp |date=2005-11-27 }} [[The Boston Phoenix]].</ref> and later led Jones to sue Clinton, successfully obtaining an out-of-court settlement in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brock continued his conspiracy theorizing until a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article titled "I Was a Conservative Hit Man" in which he recanted some of his claims. In 1998 he went further and personally apologized to Clinton. Brock was let go from the ''Spectator'' and published his 2002 book ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative]]''."<ref name="redemption" />
