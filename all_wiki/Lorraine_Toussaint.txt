==Early life==
Toussaint was born in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. In an interview she said: "I grew up under the British system, which I think is horrific for children -- very, very strict -- a system that did not recognize children as being individuals. You were small animals earning the right to be human. Childhood for me then felt extraordinarily powerless, and as an artistic child who learned in alternative ways, it was hell. I was beaten regularly... A good child was a fearful child, and I was a very, very, good little girl, which meant I lived in a world of silent, dark terror most of the time."<ref name=thps/> Her mother was a teacher, and brought Toussaint to live in Brooklyn in the late 1960s.<ref name="Gale">{{cite web | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/lorraine-toussaint | title = Lorraine Toussaint | work = Gale Contemporary Black Biography | publisher = Answers.com | accessdate = April 2, 2012}}</ref>
