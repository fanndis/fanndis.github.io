A '''parliamentary election''' was held in [[Norway]] on 11 September 2017 to elect all 169 members of the unicameral Norwegian Parliament, the [[Storting]]. The non-socialist parties retained a reduced majority of 88 seats, allowing [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Erna Solberg]]'s [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]]-[[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress]] coalition to remain in government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://valgresultat.no/?type=st&year=2017 |title=Valgresultat.no |publisher=Valgresultat.no |access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/valg/2017/resultat/ |title=Valgresultat for Norge – Valg 2017 |publisher=Nrk.no |access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref> The [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberal Party]] joined the coalition in January 2018 but it remained a [[minority cabinet]] until the [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian Democratic Party]] joined the coalition in 2019. The three largest centre-left parties won 79 seats. The [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]] retained its single seat, while the [[Red Party (Norway)|Red Party]] won its first ever seat.

==Previous election==
The [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|last parliamentary elections]] in Norway were held on 9 September 2013. The outcome was a victory for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservatives]] and their populist right-wing allies. The Conservative Party, led by [[Erna Solberg]], and the right-wing populist [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] formed a two-party minority government, with Solberg as [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]]. The two parties received [[confidence and supply]] from two centrist parties, the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/article6891959.ece |title=Drømmen om en bred borgerlig regjering er knust &#124; BA |publisher=Ba.no |date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The election used [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]] [[proportional representation]] in nineteen [[Voting systems#Multiple-winner methods|multi-member]] constituencies, one for each of the [[counties of Norway]].

The number of members to be returned from each constituency varies between 4 and 19. To determine the apportionment of the 169 seats amongst the 19 counties, a two-tier formula is used, based on population and geographic size. Each inhabitant counts one point, while each square kilometer counts 1.8 points.<ref name="Regjeringenno">{{cite news|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/krd/kampanjer/election_portal/the-norwegian-electoral-system.html?id=456636 | title = The main features of the Norwegian electoral system | work = [[Dagbladet]] |access-date=November 29, 2009 }}</ref>

150 of the seats are regular district seats. These are awarded based on the election results in each county, and are unaffected by results in other counties. Nineteen of the seats (one for each county) are [[leveling seat]]s, awarded to parties who win fewer seats than their share of the national popular vote otherwise entitles them to. A modification of the [[Sainte-Lague]] method, where the first quotient for each party is calculated using a divisor of 1.4 instead of 1, is used to allocate both the constituency and leveling seats. A party must win 4% of the popular vote in order to win compensation seats, but may still win district seats even if it fails to reach this threshold. The system for apportioning seats is biased in favour of rural areas since the area of the county is a factor, but the system of compensation seats reduces the effect this has on final party strength.<ref>{{cite news | title = Rødgrønt flertall uansett valgordning | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = September 28, 2009  | language = no }}</ref>

===Date===
According to the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]], parliamentary elections must be held every four years. The Norwegian parliament may not [[dissolution of parliament|be dissolved]] before such a four-year term has ended, a rather rare trait of a political system found in few, if any democracies besides Norway and the [[United States of America|USA]].

On 22 April 2016, the Norwegian government announced that the date of the election is set to be Monday, 11 September 2017.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/valgdagen-blir-11.-september-2017/id2485486/|title=Valgdagen blir 11. september 2017|first=Kommunal- og|last=moderniseringsdepartementet|date=22 April 2016|website=Regjeringen.no}}</ref> Additionally, each [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipal council]] may vote to extend voting by one day, by also opening the polling stations on Sunday, 10 September.

==Participating parties==
[[List of political parties in Norway|Eight political parties]] were represented in the Norwegian parliament prior to the election, all of whom went on to contest the 2017 election.
*The '''[[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]''' (Ap) is with its 55 seats in parliament the largest party of the 2013-2017 parliament. Labour describes itself as a [[social-democratic]] party of the [[centre-left]]. The party is led by former minister of foreign affairs [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], who has served as party leader and [[leader of the opposition]] since June 2014.
*The '''[[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]''' (H) is the largest party of the incumbent government. Currently, the Conservatives hold 48 seats, after having garnered close to 27 percent of the vote in the previous election. The Conservatives' party leader is Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]]. The Conservative Party is considered to be a moderate [[centre-right]] party in the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian political spectrum]], and it officially subscribes to the [[liberal conservative]] ideology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoyre.no/H%C3%B8yre+og+konservatismen.d25-SwtjI3Q.ips |title=Høyre og konservatismen - Høyre |publisher=Hoyre.no |date=2008-11-25 |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203042443/http://www.hoyre.no/H%C3%B8yre+og+konservatismen.d25-SwtjI3Q.ips |archive-date=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
*The '''[[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]''' (FrP) is led by [[Siv Jensen]] and currently serves as the junior partner in the [[Solberg's Cabinet|Solberg cabinet]]. The party identifies as [[classical liberal]] and [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]]. Political scientists broadly consider it a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] party,{{Sfn|Allern|2010|p=26: "The Norwegian Progress Party is...traditionally characterised as a borderline case of the extreme or radical right (Ignazi 1992: 13–15; Kitschelt 1995: 121; Ignazi 2003: 157), and Mudde (2007:19) characterises FrP as a non-radical populist party"; see also: p.212}}{{Sfn|Widfeldt|2014|p=83: "The academic literature is not unanimous in classifying FrP as an extreme right party. Cas Mudde, in his book from 2007, argues that FrP does not belong to the populist radical right family... Instead, he classifies FrP as a "neoliberal populist party". Other writers, however, do place FrP in the same category...even if they in some cases do so with qualifications"; see also: p.16}}<ref>[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/forskere-frp-er-hoeyrepopulistisk/a/10126475/ "Forskere: Frp er høyrepopulistisk"], ''Verdens Gang'' (NTB), 14.09.2013. "- Ja, de er høyrepopulister. Men sammenlignet med andre slike partier i Europa er de en moderat utgave og har sterkere innslag av liberalkonservative strømninger, sier Jupskås." ("Yes, they are right-wing populists. But compared to similar parties in Europe, they are a moderate version, and have stronger elements of liberal-conservative currents, Jupskås (Anders Ravik Jupskås, lecturer Department of Political Science, University of Oslo) says.")</ref> a label the party denies.
*The '''[[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]]''' (KrF) is a [[centrism|centre]] to [[centre-right]] party, based on [[Christian democratic]] values. The party is led by [[Knut Arild Hareide]], and participated in the 2013 election as a proponent of the centre-right coalition led by the Conservatives.
*The '''[[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]]''' (Sp) is the fifth largest party in the Norwegian legislature, with 10 seats. Between 2005 and 2013 the party served as a junior partner in the [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|Red-Green government]]. The party is led by [[Trygve Slagsvold Vedum]]. The party is centrist and primarily [[Agrarianism|agrarian]], with some conservative and some [[Liberalism|liberal]] factions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Hoyre-og-Frp-frir-til-konservativt-Sp-7165391.html |title=Høyre og Frp frir til konservativt Sp - Aftenposten |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date=2013-04-05 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>
*The '''[[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]''' (V) of [[Trine Skei Grande]] currently holds 9 seats in the Norwegian parliament. It claims to be the sole [[social-liberal]] party in the country, and positions itself in the centre of Norwegian politics. The Liberals have a close relationship with the Christian Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venstre.no/artikkel/48116 |title=KrF og Venstre må holde sammen - Venstre |publisher=Venstre.no |date=2013-03-09 |access-date=2015-05-14}}</ref>
*The '''[[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]]''' (SV) is the second smallest party in parliament, and campaigned for a third term as a part of the Red-Green coalition government in 2013. The party sees itself as [[democratic socialist]] and environmentalist. Since 2012, [[Audun Lysbakken]] has chaired the party.
*The '''[[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]]''' (MDG) made its debut in the Norwegian parliament in the 2013 election, gaining a single seat from the [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]] district. The Greens have no official party leader, but rather two national spokespersons. Currently, these spokespersons are [[Une Aina Bastholm]] and [[Rasmus Hansson]]. The party distances itself from the [[Left-wing|left]]-[[Right-wing|right]] axis, and identifies as an [[environmentalist]] party.

Additionally, the far-left '''[[Red Party (Norway)|Red Party]]''' led by [[Bjørnar Moxnes]] secured its first seat via a direct mandate in Oslo district. It had failed to secure representation in previous elections. The party is officially Communist in orientation and is a successor to the [[Red Electoral Alliance]], which had previously won a seat in the [[1993 Norwegian parliamentary election|1993 election]].

==Government formation and aftermath==
Prime Minister Solberg set out to form a governing coalition between the Conservative Party, Progress Party, Liberal Party, and the Christian Democrats. In late-September 2017, the Christian Democrats left coalition talks due to the inclusion of the Progress Party.<ref>{{cite web | title=Norway's Christian Democrats Quit Government Negotiations | url=https://www.thelocal.no/20170928/norways-christian-democrats-leave-government-negotiations | date=28 September 2017 | publisher=[[The Local]] | access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>

On 14 January 2018, [[Solberg's Cabinet|a government]] was formed by the Conservative Party, the Progress Party and the Liberal Party.<ref>[https://www.nrk.no/norge/erna-solberg_-her-er-den-blagronne-regjeringens-plattform-1.13866045 Erna Solberg: Her er den blågrønne regjeringens plattform] NRK, 14 January 2018</ref>

The Christian Democrats voted at a party conference to join Solberg's government on 2 November 2018 and on 16 January 2019, Solberg's Conservatives struck a deal with the Christian Democratic Party.  This marked the first time since 1985 that Norway would be getting a majority government representing right-wing parties in the Storting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schaart |first1=Eline |title=Norwegian government safe after Christian party votes to join its ranks |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/norwegian-government-safe-after-christian-party-votes-to-join-its-ranks-erna-solberg/ |website=Politico Europe |access-date=29 January 2019|date=2018-11-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Henry |first1=Galaxy |title=Norway: PM Solberg strikes deal to form center-right majority |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/norway-pm-erna-solberg-strikes-deal-to-form-centre-right-majority/ |website=Politico Europe |access-date=29 January 2019|date=2019-01-18 }}</ref>

On 20 January 2020, the Progress Party decided to withdraw from the government due to a decision by Solberg to repatriate a woman linked to Islamic State and her children back to Norway.  Solberg said that she would continue to head a minority government and the other parties in the coalition (Liberal Party, Christian Democrats) said they would also continue to serve in it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tjernshaugen |first1=Karen |last2=Ole Ask |first2=Alf |last3=Ruud |first3=Solveig |last4=Magne |first4=Kjetil |title=Frp går ut av regjeringen.
