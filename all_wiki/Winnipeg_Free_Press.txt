The '''''Winnipeg Free Press''''' (or '''WFP'''; founded as the '''''Manitoba Free Press''''') is a daily (excluding Sunday) [[broadsheet]] [[newspaper]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada. It provides coverage of local, provincial, national, and international news, as well as current events in sports, business, and entertainment, while various consumer-oriented features such as homes and automobiles appear on a weekly basis. 

The WFP was founded in 1872, only two years after Manitoba joined [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] (1870), predating Winnipeg's own incorporation (1873).<ref name=History /><ref name="MBAct">{{cite web|title=Manitoba Act 1870|url=http://www.canadahistoryproject.ca/1870/1870-08-manitoba-act.html|publisher=Canadahistoryproject.ca|access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1874 Winnipeg's First Council Meeting|url=https://winnipeg.ca/History/Council1874.stm|publisher=City of Winnipeg|access-date=December 28, 2019}}</ref> The ''Winnipeg Free Press'' has since become the oldest newspaper in [[Western Canada]] that is still active. Though there is competition, primarily with the print daily [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Winnipeg Sun]]'', the WFP has the largest readership of any newspaper in the province and is regarded as the [[newspaper of record]] for Winnipeg and Manitoba.

'''1900''': The paper moved to a new address on McDermot Avenue, at Albert Street.<ref name="MHS" />

== Strike ==

In 2008, at noon on [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving Day]] (Monday, October 13), about 1,000 members of the [[Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada|Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union]]—representing editorial, advertising, circulation, and press staff, as well as [[Paperboy|newspaper carriers]]—launched a [[strike action]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Winnipeg Free Press strike continues|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-free-press-strike-continues-1.704057|publisher=[[CBC News]]|access-date=December 28, 2019|date=October 14, 2008}}</ref> The strike ended 16 days later, when the Union ratified the final offer on Tuesday, October 28.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Press strike ends|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/33509554.html|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=December 28, 2019|date=October 29, 2008}}</ref> The contract was ratified by 67% of newspaper carriers, 75% of the pressmen, and 91% of the inside workers, including journalists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winnipeg Free Press strike ends|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-free-press-strike-ends-1.727499|publisher=[[CBC News]]|access-date=December 28, 2019|date=October 28, 2008}}</ref> The recent five-year contract was negotiated, ratified, and signed in 2013, with no threat of a strike. Workers and managers negotiated directly with great success, without the need of a lawyer as previous contracts required.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/free-press-workers-ratify-new-contract-202967461.html|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=December 28, 2019|date=April 15, 2013|title=Free Press workers ratify new contract}}</ref>

== Circulation ==

As of November 1, 2009, the ''WFP'' ceased publishing a regular Sunday edition. In its place, a Sunday-only [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] called ''On 7'' was launched, but has since been discontinued. 

On March 27, 2011, due to the impending arrival of [[Metro International|Metro]] in the Winnipeg market, the Sunday newspaper was retooled as a [[broadsheet]] format titled ''Winnipeg Free Press SundayXtra''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/sunday-free-press-is-bigger-better-118700704.html|work=Winnipeg Free Press|title=Sunday Free Press is bigger, better|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> The Sunday edition is now exclusively available online.

According to figures via [[Canadian Newspaper Association]], the ''Free Press''<nowiki/>' average weekday circulation for 2013 was 108,583, while on Saturdays it was 144,278.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newspaperscanada.ca/sites/default/files/2013-Daily-Newspapers-Circulation-Report-FINAL.pdf|title=2013 Daily Newspapers Circulation Report|publisher=Newspapers Canada|access-date=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Because of the relatively-small population of Manitoba, this meant that over 10% of the population would be looking at the paper and advertisements. Like most [[List of newspapers in Canada#Daily newspapers|Canadian daily newspapers]], the ''Free Press'' has seen a decline in [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]], dropping its total by {{formatnum: {{#expr: abs(100 - (106473 / 127903 * 100)) round 0}}}}%  to 106,473 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.<ref name="Circulation Chart">{{cite web|url=https://nmc-mic.ca/about-newspapers/circulation/daily-newspapers/|title=Daily Newspaper Circulation Data|work=News Media Canada|access-date=December 16, 2017}} Figures refer to the total circulation (print and digital combined), which includes paid and unpaid copies.</ref>
