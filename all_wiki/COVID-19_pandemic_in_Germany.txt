The '''COVID-19 pandemic in Germany''' is part of the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic|worldwide pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] ({{nowrap|COVID-19}}) caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&nbsp;2]] ({{nowrap|SARS-CoV-2}}).

On 25 and 26 February, multiple cases related to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Italy|Italian outbreak]] were detected in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. A large cluster linked to a carnival event was formed in [[Heinsberg (district)|Heinsberg]], North Rhine-Westphalia, with the first death reported on 9{{nbsp}}March 2020.<ref name="KreisHeinsberg">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kreis-heinsberg.de/aktuelles/aktuelles/?pid=5136|title=Kreis Heinsberg|date=|website=Kreis Heinsberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.abendblatt.de/vermischtes/article228637475/Coronavirus-Corona-News-Live-Ticker-Covid-19-Tote-in-Deutschland-1164-Infektionen.html |title=Coronavirus: Zwei Tote in Deutschland – Italien sperrt das ganze Land |last=Hamburg |first=Hamburger Abendblatt- |date=9 March 2020 |website=abendblatt.de |access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref> New clusters were introduced in other regions via Heinsberg as well as via people arriving from China, Iran and Italy,<ref>{{cite web |title=SARS-CoV-2: Fallzahlen in Deutschland, China und weltweit |website=Robert Koch Institut |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303083152/https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html |access-date=2 March 2020 |archive-date=3 March 2020 |language=de |url-status=live }}</ref> from where non-Germans could arrive by plane until <!-- needs full link to work when transcluded elsewhere -->[[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany#15–21 March|17–18 March]].

Initially, the German government and several health officials stated the country was well-prepared and did not implement specific measures. From 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the ''protection stage'' as per the RKI plan, with [[States of Germany|German states]] mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland were closed.<ref>Starting 16 March 8:00, only persons with a specific reason were granted entry.</ref>
By 22 March, [[Curfews and lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic|curfews]] were imposed in six German states while other states prohibited physical contact with more than one person from outside one's household. 

On 15 April, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of "fragile intermediate success" that had been achieved in the fight against the pandemic. Gradually, and not always synchronous due to the federal system, the German states and the federal level eased restrictions and warnings, including on foreign travel. Substantial local outbreaks in meat processing plants drew public attention beyond the epidemiological context to poor working conditions. From July, reported infection numbers began to rise again throughout the country. By mid October, a second wave of the pandemic was believed by experts to be inevitable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/19/germany-covid-second-wave-virus|title=Will Germany's effective Covid strategy work again as it enters a second wave?|first=Karl|last=Lauterbach|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 October 2020|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref> Due to a further sharp rise in reported cases, a partial lockdown – in which schools and kindergartens would remain open – was imposed on 2 November for the rest of the month. In view of stabilizing but not significantly decreasing daily infection numbers, it was extended on 25 November until the end of the year, with a tightening of social distancing rules which avoided the Christmas period.  

As of 22 November 2020, the RKI has officially reported 918,269 cases, 14,022 deaths, and approximately 603,800 recoveries.<ref name="rki_dailyreports"/> The country's low fatality rate, compared to fatality rates in Italy and Spain, has generated a discussion and explanations that cite the country's higher number of tests performed, higher number of available intensive care beds with respiratory support and higher proportion of positive cases among younger people.}}</onlyinclude>

Germany has a common National Pandemic Plan,<ref name="NatPanPlan" /> which describes the responsibilities and measures of the health care system actors in case of a huge epidemic. Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Ergänzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan – COVID-19 – neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:<ref name="NatPanPlan" />
* Reduce morbidity and mortality
* Ensure treatment of infected persons
* Upkeep of essential public services
* Reliable and accurate information for decision-makers, medical professionals, media and public

The plan has three stages, which might eventually overlap due to regional differences in the evolution of the pandemic:<ref name="NatPanPlan" />
* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)
* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)
* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)

In the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.<ref name="NatPanPlan" />

===Criticism over slow procurement of protective materials===

As early as January 2020, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that "children [...] have [...] minor disease progressions" and that the risk of death of "over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%". It further stated that a "vaccine" is "unavailable", so all the more important is the "use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves". But until 24 March, the {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) had never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation, was the criticism of some experts.<ref name="frontal">{{Cite news |title=Versäumte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=Münten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>

== Government reactions ==
===January===

On 22 January 2020, the German government considered the spread of COVID-19 as a "very low health risk" for Germans and the virus in general as "far less dangerous" than [[SARS]]. New travel advisories would not be necessary.<ref name=rp-online_48488333>{{Cite news |url=https://rp-online.de/panorama/ausland/bundesregierung-coronavirus-nur-geringes-gesundheitsrisiko-in-deutschland_aid-48488333 |title=Neues Virus kein Grund für Alarmismus |date=22 January 2020 |access-date=5 March 2020 |publisher=RP Online |agency=c-st/dpa}}</ref>

On 27 January, after the first infections in Germany, the government continued to regard the probability of a spread as "very low". Even if individual cases emerged, authorities would be able to treat them.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rheinpfalz.de/nachrichten/zeitgeschehen/artikel/corona-virus-bundesregierung-haelt-risiko-fuer-deutschland-sehr-gering/ |title=Corona-Virus: Bundesregierung hält Risiko für Deutschland sehr gering |date=27 January 2020 |access-date=5 March 2020 |publisher=Die Rheinpfalz |agency=dpa/rtr}}</ref>

At a press conference on 28 January, the Federal Minister of Health, [[Jens Spahn]], stated that he was only worrying about conspiracy theories that were circulating on the Internet, and that the Federal Government would counter this problem through full transparency. Hotlines were established to calm down worried callers. After a case was suspected in a [[Lufthansa]] plane, the company suspended all flights to China.<ref name="welt2901">{{Cite news |last1=Ettel |first1=Anja |url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article205424021/Coronavirus-Behoerden-bereiten-sich-auf-hunderte-Infizierte-vor.html |title=So gut ist Deutschland auf eine Epidemie vorbereitet |date=29 January 2020 |access-date=5 March 2020 |last2=Turzer |first2=Caroline |website=Die Welt}}</ref><ref name="hna3001">{{Cite news |last=Naumann |first=Florian |url=https://www.hna.de/politik/coronavirus-massnahmen-politik-bundesregierung-deutschland-lufthansa-ikea-fluege-jens-spahn-zr-13505568.html |title=Spahn zum Coronavirus: "Eilverordnung" und neue Flug-Regel kommen – Minister ruft zu Gelassenheit auf |date=30 January 2020 |access-date=5 March 2020 |publisher=Hessische/Niedersächsische Allgemeine}}</ref>

On 29 January, reports surged that masks were sold out. The government ordered pilots of flights from China to describe the health status of their passengers and ordered passengers to fill in a contact document. The government and health authorities expected more isolated cases but were confident to prevent further spread.<ref name="welt2901" /><ref name="hna3001" />

===February===

On 1 February, German Health Minister Spahn warned that people infected with the Coronavirus and their contacts might be stigmatised and be socially excluded. He emphasised that the Germans evacuated from China would all be healthy.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/coronavirus-jens-spahn-warnt-vor-ausgrenzung-von-infizierten-und-kontaktpersonen-a-ae723b77-6619-4d87-9896-0d5956b31ef5 |title=Bundesregierung warnt vor Ausgrenzung von Infizierten und Kontaktpersonen |date=1 February 2020 |access-date=21 March 2020 |work=[[Der Spiegel]]}}</ref>

On 13 February, at a meeting of EU Health Ministers, German Health Minister Spahn dismissed travel restrictions from or to China by single member states. He decidedly rejected measuring the temperature of inbound travellers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ueberbach |first=Stephan |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/eu-coronavirus-101.html |title=Alles unter Kontrolle? |date=13 February 2020 |access-date=17 March 2020 |publisher=ARD}}</ref>

On 18 February, Foreign Minister [[Heiko Maas]] had 8.4 tons of protective gear and clothing as well as disinfectants sent to China. This was the second shipment after Germany had sent 5.4 tons of it to China during the evacuation of the Germans.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2020-02/coronavirus-china-deutschland-hilfslieferung-bundesregierung-epidemie-desinfektionsmittel-schutzkleidung |title=Bundesregierung schickt weitere Hilfslieferung nach China |date=18 February 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020 |work=Die Zeit |agency=AFP, AP, dpa}}</ref>

The Finance Minister, [[Olaf Scholz]], stated that the government was prepared for a [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus]] package to mitigate the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|economical impact]].

On 7 April, the Robert Koch Institute, in partnership with healthtech startup Thryve, launched the app ''Corona-Datenspende'' (''Corona Data Donation'') for voluntary consensual use by the German public to help monitor the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the effectiveness of measures taken against the pandemic. The app was designed to be used with a range of smartwatches and fitness trackers to share anonymised health data for scientific purposes.

On 13 April, the German National Academy of Sciences, [[German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Leopoldina]], published its third ad hoc statement on the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The statement, which supplements its two predecessors, described strategies for a stepwise lifting or modification of measures against the pandemic, taking into account psychological, social, legal, pedagogic and economic aspects.

On 15 April, after a video conference with the Minister Presidents of the 16 Federal states, Chancellor Merkel stated that Germany had achieved "fragile intermediate success" in slowing the spread of the virus, but restrictions of public life remained key to preventing the spread of the virus from accelerating again. Shops with a retail space of up to 800 square metres, as well as bookshops, bike stores and car dealerships, would be allowed to reopen to the public on 20 April, providing they followed specified conditions of distancing and hygiene. Schools would start opening on 4{{nbsp}}May, as well as hair salons, the latter under particularly strict conditions. It was agreed that large cultural events would not be allowed before 31 August. Other restrictions on social life, which had been imposed on 22 March{{snd}}including the ban on gatherings of more than two people{{snd}}were extended until at least 3{{nbsp}}May.

In the public debate on the question of whether and when the social distancing measures enacted in the previous weeks could be relaxed, the [[basic reproduction number|effective reproduction number]] ''R''   continued to play a major role. In its daily bulletins of 26–28 April, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) estimated the value of ''R'' as 0.9, 1.0, and 0.9 respectively; it had been as low as 0.7 in mid-April. On 28 April, RKI president Wieler clarified that the 27 April value had been rounded up from a value of 0.96.<ref name="guardian_28042020">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/germans-urged-to-stay-home-amid-covid-19-infection-rate-fears|title=Germans urged to stay at home amid fears Covid-19 infection rate is rising again |date=28 April 2020|access-date=28 April 2020|first=Philip|last=Oltermann|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> The respective upper end-points of the [[confidence intervals]] (at the 95 per cent level) for the estimates of ''R'' were 1.1, 1.1, and 1.0.<ref name="rki_dailyreports"/>

On 7 May, a test of 200 employees at the Coesfeld meat processing plant, where cases had first been reported on 4 May, revealed 151 were positive for COVID-19. North Rhine-Westphalia State Health Minister [[Karl-Josef Laumann]] stated that the shared accommodation of workers in tight quarters was a possible reason for the outbreak. He also stated that the number of new infections in Coesfeld district had been 61 per 100,000 people over the previous week. The plant was closed until further notice, while schools and day care facilities in the district were allowed to open as planned on 11 May.<ref name=dw_53374478>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus outbreak closes German meat-packing plant|url=https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-outbreak-closes-german-meat-packing-plant/a-53374478 |access-date=11 May 2020 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=8 May 2020}}</ref> On 9 May, the RKI gave the number of infections in the Coesfeld district in the past week as 76 cases per 100,000, while all other districts in North Rhine-Westphalia were reported to have remained considerably below the government-set threshold of 50 cases per 100,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Corona-Neuinfektionen im Kreis Coesfeld weit über Obergrenze|url=https://www.rnd.de/panorama/corona-neuinfektionen-im-kreis-coesfeld-weit-uber-obergrenze-YQ3TGSX432JM6OR5Y244S5ICQY.html|access-date=11 May 2020 |publisher=Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland |date=9 May 2020}}</ref>

On 14 May, the German government tabled a law aimed in particular at improving the protection of risk groups and enabling a better understanding of the progress of the pandemic. It came into effect the following day. Regular contacts of persons at risk, such as in nursing homes, are to be subject to more thorough coronavirus testing, to recognise outbreaks early and to break transmission chains. Laboratories are now required to report negative test results, and to provide the probable place of infection if available; data will be reported to RKI in anonymised form. Carers in facilities for the aged, including volunteers and trainees, will be entitled to a one-off tax-free payment of up to 1,500 euros. The costs of intensive care treatment of COVID-19 patients from other European countries will be borne by Germany if the patients are unable to be treated in their home countries due to lack of
capacity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zweites Gesetz zum Schutz der Bevölkerung bei einer epidemischen Lage von nationaler Tragweite|url=https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/covid-19-bevoelkerungsschutz-2.html|publisher=[[Bundesministerium für Gesundheit]] (Federal Ministry of Health) |date=14 May 2020|access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref>

On 20 May, in response to the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 at several meat processing plants, the German government agreed on a new framework of regulations for the industry, including an effective ban on subcontracting at meat packing plants, as well as tighter supervision of any living quarters provided by the employers. The draft was to be put into a law which still required parliamentary approval.<ref name=dw_53510078>{{cite news |title=Germany agrees stricter meat industry regulations following coronavirus outbreaks|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-agrees-stricter-meat-industry-regulations-following-coronavirus-outbreaks/a-53510078|first=Rebecca|last=Staudenmaier|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=20 May 2020|access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref>

New outbreaks at initial reception facilities (called ''Ankerzentren'' in several German states) and other housing for refugees continued to be reported in several parts of Germany. On 21 May 137 out of 580 residents at an ''Ankerzentrum'' in [[Geldersheim]], Bavaria, were reported to have been infected. Several dozen residents had angrily demanded on 18 May that the quarantine, which by then had been in place for over seven weeks, be lifted.

===June===

On 3 June, the German federal cabinet agreed to allow travels to all 26 EU countries, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein starting 15 June, subject to the pandemic being sufficiently under control in the destination country. Travel warnings would still be maintained with regard to countries where large-scale curfews or entry restrictions remain in place. Foreign Minister [[Heiko Maas]] stated that he anticipated Spain to open its borders to travellers on 21 June, rather than the currently set date of 1 July. Norway stated that it would consider to allow entry from certain neighbouring countries, which would include Germany.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bundesregierung hebt Reisewarnung ab 15.

On 9 June, the state cabinet of Thuringia agreed to lift most contact restrictions starting 13 June. In the new ''Grundverordnung'' (basic regulation), citizens are encouraged to strive to keep physical social contact with others at a low level, and to keep the group of people who they have such contact with steady. The minimum physical distance requirement of 1.5 metres is dropped for groups from at most two households. The use of face masks in public transport and in shops continues to be required. Folk festival and sports event organizers may apply for an exemption from the general prohibition of such events.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thüringer Verordnung zur Neuordnung der erforderlichen Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Ausbreitung des Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 |url=https://corona.thueringen.de/behoerden/ausgewaehlte-verordnungen#c15825|publisher=corona.thueringen.de|date=9 June 2020|access-date=9 June 2020 }}</ref>

On 17 June, German authorities announced that a total of 657 people had tested positive at a slaughterhouse run by meat processing firm [[Tönnies Holding|Tönnies]] in the city of [[Gütersloh]], out of 983 completed tests. Numbers were expected to rise once the total number of just over 1,000 tests had been completed. As a consequence, schools in the districts were closed until the start of the summer holidays on 29 June. Tönnies apologized for the outbreak.<ref name=dw_20200617>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: Over 600 people test positive at German slaughterhouse|url=https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-over-600-people-test-positive-at-german-slaughterhouse/a-53846038|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=17 June 2020|access-date=18 June 2020 }}</ref> The company announced later that over 5,000 further members of the workforce would be tested, with the production staff ordered to stay inside their living quarters when not at work until the remaining meat products had finished processing. Virologist [[Isabella Eckerle]] stated that she considered it "extremely unlikely" that the spate of infections had been the result of workers returning to their home countries in Eastern Europe over the preceding long weekend, and that a [[Superspreader|superspreading]] event was more likely to have been the cause of the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Tönnies fordert Rücktritt seines Onkels Clemens|url=https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/2020-06/guetersloh-schlachtbetrieb-forderung-ruecktritt-clemens-toennies-geschaeftsleitung-corona-ausbruch|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=18 June 2020|access-date=18 June 2020 }}</ref>

Schools in Gütersloh would also close until the summer break. In the meantime, wide testing of the local population would be carried out to establish the extent of the outbreak; to that date, merely 24 positive tests had been returned from those who did not work at Tönnies.

On midnight from 1 July to 2 July, in the course of implementing a recommendation of the [[Council of the European Union]] from 30 June on phasing out temporary entry restrictions, Germany allowed unrestricted entry from eleven countries outside the European Union. Extended entry possibilities from all such countries were created, with the list of "important reasons" including: healthcare workers, health researchers and geriatric care workers; skilled and highly qualified foreign workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and requires presence in Germany; and foreign students whose course of study is not fully possible from abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gradual phasing out of restrictions on travel from third countries|url=https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/pressemitteilungen/EN/2020/07/aufhebung-einreisebeschraenkung-en.html|work=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]] (Press Release)|date=1 July 2020|access-date=11 July 2020|language=en}}</ref>

A preprint on the origins of the Tönnies meat factory outbreak, authored by researchers from   the [[:de:Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung|Helmholtz Center for Infection Research]], the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf|Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]], and the [[Heinrich Pette Institute]], was uploaded on [[SSRN]] on 23 July. The researchers reconstructed the origins of the outbreak, and found that a single [[superspreader]] had transmitted the virus within a radius of over eight metres to co-workers. They suggested that transmission of the virus may have been facilitated by the low temperatures in the factory, its limited fresh air supply, and the strenuous nature of the work. On the other hand, the living conditions in the dormitories appeared to not have played a major role in the evolution of the outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/de/aktuelles/news/news-detail/article/complete/sars-cov-2-ausbruch-in-deutschem-fleischzerlegebetrieb-uebertragungen-erfolgten-ueber-weite-distanze/|title=SARS-CoV-2-Ausbruch in deutschem Fleischzerlegebetrieb: Übertragungen erfolgten über weite Distanzen in klimatisierten Arbeitsbereichen|work=Helmholtz Center for Infection Research (Press Release)|date=23 July 2020|access-date=24 July 2020}}</ref>

===August===
On 1 August, some 20,000 people protested in Berlin against the anti-pandemic measures. A large majority of participants ignored the mask and physical distancing requirements. In the late afternoon, police ordered demonstrators to leave the scene, on the grounds that organizers had failed to enforce coronavirus hygiene rules. The assembly leader was charged by police for this offence. Several local and federal politicians severely criticized the flouting of coronavirus rules, and considered the protesters' demands to be starkly at odds with the severity of the crisis. Germany had recently logged an uptick in daily coronavirus cases.

On 19 September, it was reported that Health Minister Spahn pushed for enactment of regulations for the distribution of future COVID-19 vaccines in Germany. Medical doctors, ethics experts and social scientists would participate in drafting such regulations, targeted to be completed by the end of October. Spahn had previously expressed his view that those with co-morbidities, the aged, and employees in the health sector should be offered prioritized access to such vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/covid-19-spahn-will-impfstoffverteilung-bis-ende-oktober.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=1174361|title=Spahn will Impfstoffverteilung bis Ende Oktober regeln|work=[[deutschlandfunk.de]]|date=19 September 2020|access-date=19 September 2020}}</ref>

On 29 September, the German chancellor Angela Merkel explained that the government's guidelines to tackle the virus, encapsulated in the acronym AHA, which stands for distancing, hygiene and masks, will be extended to become AHACL.

===October===
Early in the month, there was a sharp upturn in daily reported cases. On 8 October, 4,096 new cases were reported by the Robert Koch Institute, compared to 2,828 the day before. RKI President Lothar Wieler warned of the possibility of the number of daily cases exceeding 10,000 in the coming weeks, or of an uncontrolled spread occurring, but expressed his hopes that this could be averted. He said that experts saw larger outbreaks as well as numerous smaller ones throughout the country as contributing to the surge of cases. Health Minister Spahn urged Germans to assiduously follow the AHACL formula. He said that many of the recent cases were due to youths who were socially active without giving sufficient regard to the higher risks that the virus posed to the aged.<ref name="france24_082020">{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20201008-germany-experiencing-worrying-jump-in-covid-19-cases|title=Germany sees 'worrying jump' in Covid-19 cases|work=[[France 24]]|date=8 October 2020|access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/08/germany-fears-spiralling-covid-spread-as-cases-rise-suddenly|title=Europe struggles to stem rapid resurgence of coronavirus|first1=Jon|last1=Henley|first2=Kate|last2=Connolly|first3=Sam|last3=Jones|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 October 2020|access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref>

On 1 November, Spahn called for the public to prepare for "months of restrictions and abstinence". At a press conference on 2 November, Merkel also spoke of the need to "limit private contacts", saying that the measures were intended to create conditions for a "tolerable December".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/02/global-coronavirus-report-who-chief-tedros-in-isolation-after-contact-with-positive-case|title=Global coronavirus report: WHO chief self-isolates as Germany starts 'wave breaker' lockdown|first=Martin|last=Farrer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 November 2020|access-date=2 November 2020}}</ref>

On 18 November, a reform of the German Infection Protection Act which had been proposed by the ruling Grand Coalition of [[CDU/CSU]] and [[SPD]] was passed in the [[Bundestag]] with 415 votes in favour, 236 against, and eight abstentions. The regulations of the law include a specification of the scope of measures which may be taken by individual states in order to combat a health emergency such as the current pandemic, with regard to social restrictions, the requirement to wear a nose-mouth covering, the temporary closure of shops, and the cancellation of mass events. The purpose of the law was to put measures that had been previously enacted by decree on a more firm legal basis that would prevent legal challenges. It also addressed complaints from across the political spectrum who had criticized the diminished role of the parliament in the preceding months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-can-germanys-infection-protectionlaw-be-compared-to-the-nazis-enabling-act/a-55649748|title=Coronavirus: Can Germany's infection protection law be compared to the Nazis' 'Enabling Act?' |work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|first=Peter|last=Hille|date=18 November 2020|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/de/bundestag-beschlie%C3%9Ft-neues-infektionsschutzgesetz/a-55641005|title=Bundestag beschließt neues Infektionsschutzgesetz|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=18 November 2020|access-date=18 November 2020|language=de}}</ref>

On 25 November, as it emerged that the lockdown had to date served to stabilize daily infection numbers but not reduced them, Chancellor Merkel and the leaders of the federal states agreed to an extension of the partial lockdown until at least 20 December. From 1 December, social gathering restrictions will be tightened to allow only private gatherings of at most five people from at most two different households, down from a previous limit of ten people, not counting children up to 14 years of age.

On 8 July 2020, Economy Minister [[Peter Altmaier]] announced the release of non-repayable bridging funds for medium-sized companies with annual turnover not exceeding €750 million which have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The amount of aid depends on revenue lost, and on the number of employees. Companies have to apply for the funds through their tax advisors or auditors, a step that was intended to safeguard from abuse of the scheme, also in view of evidence that aid that had been made available at the beginning of the crisis had been misused. On occasion of presenting the scheme, Altmaier stated that he expected some sectors of the economy to return to a phase of growth from October 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/coronakrise-bis-zu-150-000-euro-fuer-mittelstaendler-erste-ueberbrueckungshilfen-fliessen-noch-im-juli/25986364.html?ticket=ST-1342500-6suIeNuZYpCkrgpN1lfM-ap4|title=Bis zu 150.000 Euro für Mittelständler: Erste Überbrückungshilfen fließen noch im Juli|first=Klaus|last=Stratmann|work=[[Handelsblatt]]|date=8 July 2020|access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref>

In late August 2020, the Federal Statistical Office reported a decrease in gross domestic product of 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first. This was attributed to the collapse in exports as well as health protection measures during the pandemic; the latter had shut down whole industries such as those related to conferences and concerts. Economists expected a rebounding of the economy in the third quarter due to the easing of coronavirus related restrictions, but saw the possibility of a second wave of infections hanging as a threat over those predictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/corona-konjunktur-deutschland-1.5009399|title=Deutsche Wirtschaft bricht weniger stark ein als befürchtet|work=[[sueddeutsche.de]]|date=25 August 2020|access-date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

German chancellor Merkel and state governors first gave "strong advice" to wear face masks in public starting 20 April. [[Saxony]] made it mandatory from that day, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] followed starting 23 April and (the rest of) Thurinigia starting 24 April, then finally the governors agreed to make it mandatory, so most other states followed starting 27 April, except [[Schleswig-Holstein]], which introduced requirements starting 29 April, and Berlin, where shops were initially excluded but were then included starting 29 April.<ref name="de_jena"/>

As of 24 April, most German states had no penalties for not wearing a mask. However, not wearing masks in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania can result in a €25 fine, in Hesse a €50 fine, and in Bavaria, not wearing a face mask while on public transportation or in a store can result in a €150 fine for first-time offenders. There are exceptions for mask wearing for young children, severely disabled persons, or with those with respiratory diseases such as [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Staudenmaier |first=Rebecca |date=27 April 2020 |title=Coronavirus: Germany's new face mask regulations explained |url=https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germanys-new-face-mask-regulations-explained/a-53260732 |url-status=live |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |location= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528232225/https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germanys-new-face-mask-regulations-explained/a-53260732 |archive-date=28 May 2020 |access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref>

== Protests against governmental corona restrictions ==
{{Main|Protests over COVID-19 policies in Germany}}
Since April 2020, several protests have been held in Germany against governmental measures in response to the spreading of COVID-19. Until now, the largest protest was in Berlin on 29 August, organized by the group ''Querdenken 711'' which drew 38,000 demonstrators. ''Querdenken 711'' is mostly concerned about what it sees as violations of the German Constitution as result of the governmental measures to counter the pandemic.
