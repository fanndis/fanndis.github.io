==Early life and career==
Edgardo Angara was born in [[Baler, Aurora]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-190098462 |title=GMA stresses rehabilitation; Baler radar to be upgraded |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=Manila Bulletin }}</ref> He earned his Bachelor of Laws degree from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1958.<ref name="martin">{{cite web |url=http://www.martindale.com/Edgardo-J-Angara/1256127-lawyer.htm |title=Edgardo J.

In May 1972, Angara together with classmates (and fraternity brothers from Sigma Rho) from the UP College of Law and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], founded the ACCRA Law Offices,<ref name="fullbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/angara_bio.asp |title=Senator Edgardo J. Angara biography |publisher=Senate of the Philippines official website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209014637/http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/sen_bio/angara_bio.asp |archivedate=2010-02-09 }}</ref> which became the country's most recognized and prestigious law firm in less than a decade. From 1981 to 1987, Angara became president of the [[University of the Philippines System|University of the Philippines]].<ref name="resume"/> He rallied alumni in the country and abroad to pool their resources for various projects to mark UP's diamond jubilee in 1983, including the creation of additional professorial chairs and faculty grants. Through his efforts, the liberal arts curriculum was strengthened, a seven-year honors medical curriculum installed, humanities and science were energized, and a multi-campus university organization was instituted.

He defended the state university's tradition of dissent and fiscal autonomy, while maintaining its reputation for academic excellence. He established stronger links with the business community and alumni organizations, raising the biggest faculty endowment in the university.

==Senator of the Philippines (1987−1998)==
Angara's achievements brought him into politics. He first served as senator from 1987 until 1992. By this time, he had established a reputation as a resolute reformer and firm leader, winning praise for his non-confrontational stance on contentious domestic and international issues, while building consensus at the same time.

===Senate Presidency (1993−1995)===
He was Senate President from 1993 to 1995. As a Senate Chief, Angara, with his aggressive and consensus-building approach leadership style, rallied the Upper Chamber to pass bills and resolutions for an Executive-Legislative cooperation in economic reforms, which resulted in the Economic Summit of August 1993.  It was likewise during his term that the Senate adopted a policy to reimpose the death penalty for heinous crimes and saw the ratification of the " Earth Summit " treaty, along with five pro-environment treaties, many of which have already been enacted into law.<ref name="martin"/> He made a difference in the lives of millions of Filipinos by pushing for the passage of laws on arts and culture, agriculture, education, good governance, health and social welfare.

In August, 1995, he resigned from the Senate Presidency and was elected as the new
Minority Leader of the Senate.

===Educational and economic initiatives===
As chairman of the Congressional Commission on Education, Angara sponsored laws that resulted in the creation of the Commission on Higher Education and the Technical Education and Skill Development Authority, both of which enabled the Department of Education to focus on its main concern - basic education.

He authored the Free High School Act that ensured secondary education even for the poorest; the Senior Citizens Act (or The Angara Law) that allowed the elderly to avail of substantial discounts when buying medicine or riding public transport; the National Health Insurance Act, or PHILHEALTH, that provided insurance to every citizen; and the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE), the biggest scholarship program.

Under his [[Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997|Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act]] (AFMA), farmers and fisher folk benefited from improved seeds and plant materials, better irrigation, better financing and market access.

He authored the Magna Carta for Public Health Workers and was the principal author of the laws that created the new National Museum and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts.

===1998 Vice-Presidential bid===
Angara prepared to run for president in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 Philippine election]], but decided against it when it became clear that he could not win over the popular vice president [[Joseph Estrada]]. He accepted a deal offered by Estrada to run as his vice presidential candidate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/business/worldbusiness/09iht-manila.t.html |first=Don |last=Kirk |work=New York Times |date=9 May 1998 |title=As Presidential Election Nears, Business Community Ponders Popularity of Estrada }}</ref> Although Estrada overwhelmingly won the presidential race, Angara placed second in a field of 9 candidates, losing to Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]]. Macapagal-Arroyo won 12.6 million votes compared to Angara's 5.6 million.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/30/world/philippine-congress-affirms-ex-actor-as-new-president.html |date=20 May 1998 |title=Philippine Congress Affirms Ex-Actor As New President |work=New York Times }}</ref>

==Estrada administration (1998−2001)==

===Chairman of the Philippine National Bank (1998–1999)===
Upon the inauguration of Estrada as president on June 30, 1998, Angara was named
by him to be the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[Philippine National Bank]],
then a wholly government-owned bank. During his tenure, major policy reforms as well
as innovations were introduced by him at the said bank.

===Agriculture Secretary (1999−2001)===
In 1999, Angara was appointed Secretary of the Department of Agriculture by Estrada.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-67754964 |title=LDP urges reforms at Manila Hotel meet |date=10 December 2000 |first=Rico |last=Navarro |publisher=Manila News }}</ref> During his term as Secretary of Agriculture (1999–2001), he had the opportunity to implement his own creation, AFMA. He oversaw an improvement of food production programs and support services that led to a bigger harvest of rice, a development that underscored the drive to attain food security. Overall, the agricultural sector saw a growth rate of 3.6 percent a year since 2000, compared with a 1.2 percent growth over the past two decades.<ref>[http://www.edangara.com/?q=node/4 Know Ed|edangara.com]</ref>

===Executive Secretary (2001)===
On January 6, 2001, as Estrada's presidency was crippled by an impeachment trial and widespread allegations of corruption, Angara was appointed Executive Secretary following the resignation of [[Ronaldo Zamora]], who was running for Congress.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18350066.html |date=5 January 2001 |agency=[[Xinhua]] |title=President Estrada Appoints Angara As New Executive Secretary }}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He only served for 14 days, as Estrada was toppled by the [[EDSA II Revolution]] on January 20. Angara remained loyal to Estrada until the end of his presidency, though he later asserted that his support for Estrada was contingent on the latter's undertaking to pass reforms.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/07/news/07iht-phil.2.t_3.html |date=7 November 2000 |work=New York Times |title=Philippine House Panel Clears Impeachment of Estrada |first=Thomas |last=Fuller }}</ref>

He was re-elected to a fourth term in 2007,<ref name="martin"/> making him the longest-serving senator in the post-EDSA revolution legislature, matching Senator [[Lorenzo Tañada|Lorenzo Tanada]] who served four consecutive terms from 1947 to 1972.<ref name="fullbio"/>  Angara authored or sponsored many laws including the Free High School Education Act, the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education or GASTPE Law, the Generics Act, the law which created Philhealth, the original Senior Citizens Act, Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act, Government Procurement Act, the Renewable Energy Act, among several others.<ref name="fullbio"/>
