== History ==
On August 10, 2015, [[Google|Google Inc.]] announced plans to create a new public [[holding company]], Alphabet Inc. Google CEO [[Larry Page]] made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/10/technology/alphabet-google/index.html|title=Meet Google Alphabet â€“ Google's new parent company|last=Kelly|first=Heather|date=August 10, 2015|website=CNNMoney|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> Alphabet would be created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope.

In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:<ref name="gIsForGoogle" /><ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=Google's Larry Page explains the new Alphabet |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-larry-page-explains-the-new-alphabet/ |publisher=CNET |accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref>
{{quote|Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. ... Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.}}

Page says the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google "cleaner and more accountable and better". He also said he wanted to improve "the transparency and oversight of what we're doing", and to allow greater control of unrelated companies.<ref name="gIsForGoogle" /><ref name="wire-2015-new-company" />

Former executive Eric Schmidt (now Technical Advisor) revealed in the conference in 2017 the inspiration for this structure came from [[Warren Buffett]] and his management structure of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] a decade ago.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/google-founders-modeled-alphabet-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2019-12-1028737463|title=Google's founders came up with the Alphabet model after meeting Warren Buffett {{!}} Markets Insider|last=GmbH|first=finanzen net|website=Business Insider|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> Schmidt said it was he who encouraged Page and Brin to meet with Buffett in Omaha to see how Berkshire Hathaway was a holding company made of subsidiaries with strong CEOs who were trusted to run their businesses.<ref name=":1" />

Before it became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet. The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google's stock was then converted to Alphabet's stock. Under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.<ref name="SEC">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000128877615000039/a20150810form8-k.htm|title=Google Inc. filing with the SEC, Form 8-K|date=August 10, 2015|publisher=[[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref> The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.<ref name="sec" /> Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols "GOOG" and "GOOGL"; both classes of stock are components of major [[stock market index|stock market indices]] such as the [[S&P 500]] and [[NASDAQ-100]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/|title=GOOGL : Summary for Alphabet Inc.|publisher=Yahoo!

On December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. [[Sundar Pichai]], the CEO of Google, is to assume the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/larry-page-steps-down-as-ceo-of-alphabet.html|title=Larry Page steps down as CEO of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai to take over|last=Feiner|first=Lauren|date=December 3, 2019|publisher=CNBC|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>
