'''''Ladies' Home Journal''''' was an American [[magazine]] published by the [[Meredith Corporation]]. It was first published on February 16, 1883,<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|work=PSA Research Center|accessdate=February 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115225953/http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and eventually became one of the leading [[women's magazines]] of the 20th century in the United States. From 1891 it was published in Philadelphia by the [[Curtis Publishing Company]]. In 1903, it was the first American magazine to reach one million subscribers.<ref name="santana">{{cite news |author= Marco Santana |date= April 24, 2014 |title= Ladies' Home Journal to Cease Monthly Publication |url= http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2014/04/24/meredith-earnings-fall-37-percent/8089633/ |work= Des Moines Register |accessdate= April 24, 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20140424235014/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2014/04/24/meredith-earnings-fall-37-percent/8089633/ |archivedate= April 24, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

In the late 20th century, changing tastes and competition from television caused it to lose circulation. Sales of the magazine ensued as the publishing company struggled. On April 24, 2014, Meredith announced it would stop publishing the magazine as a monthly with the July issue, stating it was "transitioning ''Ladies' Home Journal'' to a special interest publication".<ref>{{cite press release |date= April 24, 2014 |title= Meredith Reports Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter And Nine Month Results: Local Media Group Delivers Record Revenues and Operating Profit for a Fiscal Third Quarter |url= http://ir.meredith.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=842343 |publisher= Meredith Corporation |via= PRNewswire |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140424212135/http://ir.meredith.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=842343 |archivedate= April 24, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> It was then available quarterly on newsstands only, though its website remains in operation.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/media/ladies-home-journal-to-become-a-quarterly.html|title=''Ladies’ Home Journal'' to Become a Quarterly|last=Cohen|first=Noam|newspaper=New York Times|date=2014-04-25}}</ref> The last issue was published in 2016.

''Ladies' Home Journal'' was one of the [[Seven Sisters (magazines)|Seven Sisters]], as a group of women's service magazines were known. The name was derived from the Greek myth of the "seven sisters", also known as the [[Pleiades]].

==History==
[[File:Ladies' Home Journal Vol.8 No.06 (May, 1891).pdf|left|thumb|1891 edition of Ladies Home Journal]]
''The Ladies' Home Journal'' was developed from a popular double-page supplement in the American magazine ''Tribune and Farmer'' titled ''Women at Home''.  ''Women at Home'' was written by [[Louisa Knapp Curtis]], wife of the magazine's publisher [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis|Cyrus H. K. Curtis]].{{When|date=December 2016}}<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url= http://www.scripophily.net/curpubcom.html|work=Curtis Publishing Company|title=Saturday Evening Post & Ladies Home Journal}}</ref> After a year it became an independent publication, with Knapp as editor for the first six years. Its original name was ''The Ladies Home Journal and Practical Housekeeper'', but Knapp dropped the last three words in 1886.<!-- reference came up as 404, unknown --> It rapidly became the leading American magazine of its type, reaching a subscribed circulation of more than one million copies by 1903, the first American magazine to do so.<ref name="santana"/> <!-- Where published? obviously a Midwest magazine -->

[[Edward W. Bok]] took over the editorship in late 1889, serving until 1919.  Among features he introduced was the popular "Ruth Ashmore advice column" written by [[Isabel Mallon]].<ref name="ruth1">{{cite news|date= December 28, 1898|url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/12/28/102530031.pdf|title=Ruth Ashmore" Dead: A Well-Known Writer Succumbs to Pneumonia, Following Grip|work= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  At the turn of the 20th century, the magazine published the work of [[muckraker]]s and social reformers such as [[Jane Addams]]. In 1901 it published two articles highlighting the early architectural designs of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Home in a Prairie Town|date= February 1901|journal= Ladies' Home Journal}}{{full citation needed|date=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= A Small Home with 'Lots of Room in It'|journal=Ladies' Home Journal|date=July 1901}}{{full citation needed|date= April 2014}}</ref>

Bok introduced business practices at the ''Ladies' Home Journal'' that contributed to its success: low subscription rates, inclusion of advertising to off-set costs, and reliance on popular content. This operating structure was adopted by men's magazines like ''[[McClure's]]'' and [[Munsey's Magazine|''Munsey's'']] roughly a decade after it had become the standard practice of American women's magazines.  Scholars argue that women's magazines, like the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', pioneered these strategies "[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2536601594.html magazine revolution]".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Waller-Zuckerman |first= Mary Ellen |title= 'Old Homes, in a City of Perpetual Change': Women's Magazines, 1890-1916 |journal= The Business History Review |volume= 63 |issue= 4 |date= Winter 1989 |pages= 715–756 |doi=10.2307/3115961}}</ref>

During World War II, the ''Ladies Home Journal'' was a particularly favored venue of the government to place articles intended for homemakers, in an effort to keep up morale and support.<ref>{{cite book |author= Emily Yellin |year= 2004 |title= Our Mothers' War |location= New York |publisher= Free Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/ourmotherswarame00yell/page/23 23] |isbn= 0-7432-4514-8 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/ourmotherswarame00yell }}</ref>

The annual subscription price paid for the production of the magazine and its mailing. The profits came from heavy advertising, pitched to families with above-average incomes of $1000 to $3000 dollars in 1900.  In the 1910s it carried about a third of the advertising in all women's magazines. By 1929 it had nearly twice as much advertising as any other publication except for the ''Saturday Evening Post,'' which was also published by the Curtis family. The ''Ladies Home Journal''  was sold to 2 million subscribers in the mid-1920s, grew a little during the depression years, and surged again during post-World War II prosperity. By the 1955, each issue sold 4.6 million copies and there were probably 11 million readers.<ref>Ward, "The Geography of the Ladies' Home Journal"</ref>

==Recent history==
In March 1970, feminists held an 11-hour sit-in at the ''Ladies' Home Journal''{{'}}s office. As a result, they were allowed to produce a section of the magazine that August. They wanted the magazine to recognize a wider variety of choices for women's lives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Megan |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087966,00.html |title=The ''Ladies' Home Journal'' Sit-In - A Brief History of Women's Protests|work=Time|date=August 12, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}</ref>

The ''Journal'', along with its major rivals, ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'', ''[[Family Circle]]'', ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'' and ''[[Woman's Day]]'', were long known as the "seven sisters", after the prestigious women's colleges in the Northeast.<ref>{{cite news |last= Carmody |first= D. |title= Identity Crisis for 'Seven Sisters' |work= The New York Times |date= August 6, 1990 |page=D1}}</ref>  For decades, the ''Journal'' had the greatest circulation of this group, but it fell behind ''McCall's'' in 1961.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Revolt at Curtis |work= Time |date= October 16, 1964 |pages=93–94}}</ref>  By 1968, its circulation was 6.8 million compared to ''McCall's'' 8.5 million. Society was changing and this was reflected in persons' magazine choices.

That year, Curtis Publishing sold the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', along with the magazine ''[[The American Home]]'', to Downe Communications for $5.4 million in stock.<ref>{{cite news |last= Bedingfield |first= R.

In 1986, the Meredith Corporation acquired the magazine from Family Media for $96 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meredith.com/aboutmeredith/history.html |title=History of Meredith Corporation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703091813/http://www.meredith.com/aboutmeredith/history.html |archivedate=July 3, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Meredith Won't Tinker with Added Magazines |work= The New York Times |date= November 25, 1985 |edition= Late City Final |at= p.

The magazine debuted an extensive visual and editorial redesign in its March 2012 issue. Photographer [[Brigitte Lacombe]] was hired to shoot cover photos, with [[Kate Winslet]] appearing on the first revamped issue. The ''Journal'' announced that portions of its editorial content would be [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] from readers, who would be fairly compensated for their work.<ref>{{cite news |first= Stefanie |last= Botelho |date= January 10, 2012 |title= Ladies’ Home Journal to Move to Reader-Produced Content Model |url= http://www.foliomag.com/2012/ladies-home-journal-move-reader-produced-content-model |work= Folio}}</ref> The arrangement was one of the first of its kind among major consumer magazines.<ref>{{cite news |first= Nat |last= Ives |date= January 9, 2012|title=Ladies' Home Journal Lets Readers Write the Magazine |url= http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/ladies-home-journal-lets-readers-write-magazine/231966/|work= AdvertisingAge}}</ref>

Although the magazine remained very popular, it ran into increasing difficulty attracting advertising. Despite its high subscriber base (3.2 million), it was not a leader in the women's service category. These factors prompted the decision to end monthly publication.<ref name="emb">{{cite news|author=Emma Bazilian|title=Ladies' Home Journal to Cease Monthly Publication|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/ladies-home-journal-shuts-down-157233|accessdate=February 6, 2016|work=AdWeek|date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> The magazine was relaunched as a quarterly.<ref name="emb"/> At the same time, the headquarters of the magazine moved from New York City<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kathleen L.

Knapp continued as the magazine's editor till [[Edward William Bok]] succeeded her as ''LHJ'' editor in 1889. However, she remained involved with the magazine's management, and she also wrote a column for each issue. In 1892, the ''LHJ'' became the first magazine to refuse patent medicine advertisements.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://www.bartleby.com/197/30.html |chapter= 30.

The most famous cooking teacher of her time, [[Sarah Tyson Rorer]], served as ''LHJ's'' first food editor from 1897 to 1911,<ref>{{cite journal |year= 2008 |title= 125 Years of 'Ladies' Home Journal': Food |journal= Ladies' Home Journal |volume= 125 |issue= 8 |url= http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/125-years-of-ladies-home-journal-food/ |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413173848/http://www.lhj.com/style/covers/125-years-of-ladies-home-journal-food/ |archivedate= April 13, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> when she moved to ''[[Good Housekeeping]].''

In 1936, Mary Cookman, wife of ''[[New York Post]]'' editor [[Joseph Cookman]], began working at the ''Ladies' Home Journal.''

The magazine's trademark feature is '''“Can This Marriage Be Saved?”''' In this popular column, each person of a couple in a troubled marriage explains their view of the problem, a [[Relationship counseling|marriage counselor]] explains the solutions offered in counseling,<ref>Traditionally, the wife's side of the story is told first, followed by the husband's side.</ref> and the outcome is published.
