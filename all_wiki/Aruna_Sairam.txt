==Critical reception==
Aruna Sairam is the darling of Carnatic vocal music and the first ever from her tradition to sing at the BBC Proms...'''Pulse, London, England, 2011'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arunasairam.org/blogs/pulse-london-1st-october-2011/|title=Pulse, London. 1st October 2011 â€“ Aruna Says|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>

M S Subbulakshmi is no more. But if there is any singer who comes close to matching such purity of voice, diction, impeccable sruti alignment and frill-free singing, it is Aruna Sairam ...

Hail a New Queen of Soul... 
The mesmerising star of this concert at the Royal Albert Hall was South Indian singer Aruna Sairam. She is a soul singer up there with Aretha Franklin. I was trying, and failing, to think of a classical singer with the same status and artistry â€“ Jesse Norman, Cecilia Bartoli? I'm afraid not. Aruna Sairam has the universal power to take you to another world...
