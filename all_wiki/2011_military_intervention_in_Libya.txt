On 19 March 2011, a multi-state [[NATO]]-led coalition began a '''military intervention in Libya''', to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], in response to events during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. The United Nations' intent and voting was to have "an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute crimes against humanity ... imposing a ban on all flights in the country's airspace – a no-fly zone – and tightened sanctions on the [[Muammar Gaddafi|[Muammar] Gaddafi]] regime and its supporters."<ref name="UN-AllNecessaryMeasures"/>

The US had the air assets necessary to enforce a no-fly zone, but was cautious about supporting such an action prior to obtaining a legal basis for violating Libya's sovereignty. Furthermore, due to the sensitive nature of military action by the US against an Arab nation, the US sought Arab participation in the enforcement of a no-fly zone.

At a [[congressional hearing]], United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] explained that "a no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defences ... and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down. But that's the way it starts."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-02/us/libya.military.options_1_gadhafi-government-arab-league-libyan-people?_s=PM:U.S. |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707091209/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-02/us/libya.military.options_1_gadhafi-government-arab-league-libyan-people?_s=PM:U.S. |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=U.S. Mulling Military Options in Libya |publisher=CNN |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

Despite its stated opposition to NATO intervention, Russia abstained from voting on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|Resolution 1973]] instead of exercising its veto power as a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]; four other powerful nations also abstained from the vote—[[India]], China, Germany, and [[Brazil]]—but of that group only China has the same veto power.<ref>"[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201131720311168561.html UN authorizes no-fly zone over Libya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318102654/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/201131720311168561.html |date=18 March 2011 }}."

Moreover, criticisms have been made on the way the operation was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent political guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear political guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues.<ref>{{cite web|first1= Michael|last1= Kometer|first2= Stephen|last2= Wright|title= Winning in Libya: By Default or Design?|work= Focus stratégique, No. 41|date= January 2013|url= http://ifri.org/downloads/fs41kometerwright.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

In 2015 through 2016 the British parliament's [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of [[regime change]]. However that new policy did not include proper support for a new government, leading to a [[Failed state|political]] and [[economic collapse]] in Libya and the growth of [[ISIL]] in North Africa. The [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] saw no evidence that the UK Government carried out a proper analysis of the nature of the rebellion in Libya and it "selectively took elements of Muammar Gaddafi's rhetoric at face value; and it failed to identify the militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion. UK strategy was founded on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the evidence". The former Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.<ref name="bbc-20160914">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37356873 |title=MPs attack Cameron over Libya 'collapse' |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914041944/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37356873 |archive-date=14 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="guardian-20160914">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention |title=MPs deliver damning verdict on Cameron's Libya intervention |author=Patrick Wintour |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914092412/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention |archive-date=14 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="hoc-libya">{{cite report |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf |title=Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK's future policy options |work=Foreign Affairs Committee (House of Commons) |publisher=UK Parliament |date=6 September 2016 |id=HC 119 |accessdate=14 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918152235/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf |archive-date=18 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A 2013 paper by Alan Kuperman argued that NATO went beyond its remit of providing protection for civilians and instead supported the rebels by engaging in regime change. It argued that NATO's intervention likely extended the length (and thus damage) of the civil war, which Kuperman argued could have ended in less than two months without NATO intervention. The paper argued that the intervention was based on a misperception of the danger Gadaffi's forces posed to the civilian population, which Kuperman suggests was caused by existing bias against Gadaffi due to his past actions (such as support for terrorism), sloppy and sensationalistic journalism during the early stages of the war and propaganda from anti-government forces. Kuperman suggests that this demonization of Gadaffi, which was used to justify the intervention, ended up discouraging efforts to accept a ceasefire and negotiated settlement, turning a humanitarian intervention into a dedicated regime change.<ref>Kuperman, Alan J.

US$48,000), so the cost of patrolling one sector of Libyan airspace would be £2M–3M (US$2.75M–4.13M) per day. Conventional airborne missiles would cost £800,000 each and Tomahawk cruise missiles £750,000 each. Professor Malcolm Charmers of the [[Royal United Services Institute]] similarly suggested that a single cruise missile would cost about £500,000, while a single Tornado sortie would cost about £30,000 in fuel alone. If a Tornado was downed the replacement cost would be upwards of £50m. By 22 March the US and UK had already fired more than 110 cruise missiles. [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|UK Chancellor]] [[George Osborne]] had said that the MoD estimate of the operation cost was "tens rather than hundreds of millions".

The total number of sorties flown by NATO numbered more than 26,000, an average of 120 sorties per day. 42% of the sorties were strike sorties, which damaged or destroyed approximately 6,000 military targets. At its peak, the operation involved more than 8,000 servicemen and women, 21 NATO ships in the Mediterranean and more than 250 aircraft of all types. By the end of the operation, NATO had conducted over 3,000 hailings at sea and almost 300 boardings for inspection, with 11 vessels denied transit to their next port of call.<ref>{{cite news |author =NATO |url =http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_71652.htm# |title =NATO and Libya (Archived) |accessdate =9 November 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150910114829/http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_71652.htm |archive-date =10 September 2015 |url-status =live }}</ref> Eight NATO and two non-NATO countries flew strike sorties.
