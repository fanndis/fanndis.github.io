During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], '''face masks''' have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of [[SARS-CoV-2]]. Their use is intended as personal protection to prevent infection and as [[Source control (respiratory disease)|source control]] to limit transmission of the virus in community and healthcare settings.

The use of face masks or coverings by the general public has been recommended by health officials to minimize the risk of transmissions, with authorities either requiring their use in certain settings, such as on public transport and in shops, or universally in public. Health officials have stated that medical-grade face masks, such as [[N95 mask|N95 respirators]], should be reserved for healthcare workers and caregivers due to concerns about shortages.  Early in the pandemic, public health messaging about masking often offered inconsistent and conflicting statements.  One recommendation was that only infected individuals should wear masks, though evidence suggested asymptomatic transmission, which led to public confusion and subsequent scrutiny.   Recommendations soon changed<ref name="mask_not_mask" /> and about 95% of the world's population live in countries that recommend or mandate the use of masks in public during the pandemic.

Face mask [[Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic|shortages]] also occurred, leading to use of uncertified and substandard masks with significantly reduced performance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lam |first1=Simon Ching |last2=Suen |first2=Lorna Kwai Ping |last3=Cheung |first3=Teris Cheuk Chi |title=Global risk to the community and clinical setting: Flocking of fake masks and protective gears during the COVID-19 pandemic |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |date=May 2020 |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=964–965 |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2020.05.008|pmid=32405127 |pmc=7219383 }}</ref>

Different types of face masks have been recommended throughout the COVID-19 pandemic including:
* [[cloth face mask]]s
* loose-fitting medical or [[surgical masks]]
* face-sealing [[filtering facepiece respirator|filtering facepiece mask]]s, including uncertified [[dust mask]]s as well as certified respirator masks (with [[mechanical filter respirator|respirator certifications]] such as [[N95 respirator]]s, N99 respirators, and [[FFP respirator]]s)
* other [[respirator]]s, including [[elastomeric respirator]]s, some of which may also be considered filtering facepieces.

Transparent [[face shield]]s, medical [[goggles]], and other types of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) are sometimes used in conjunction with face masks.

A [[cloth face mask]] is worn over the mouth and nose and made of commonly available textiles. They vary widely in effectiveness, depending on material, fit/seal, number of layers, and other factors.  Although they are usually less effective than medical-grade masks, many health authorities recommend their use by the general public when medical-grade masks are in short supply, as a low-cost and reusable option.<ref name="theglobeandmail.com">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-tam-offers-new-advice-wear-a-non-medical-mask-when-shopping-or-using/ Theresa Tam offers new advice: Wear a non-medical face mask when shopping or using public transit],''The Globe and Mail'', 6 April 2020.</ref><ref name="diy">{{cite web |title=Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=9 April 2020 |date=11 February 2020}}</ref> Unlike disposable masks, there are not yet legal standards for cloth masks.<ref name="scoping" />

The homemade mask also let a [[median]] average of three times as many microorganisms be expelled by the wearer.

A [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, [[Disposable product|disposable]] device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential [[Contamination|contaminants]] in the immediate environment. If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]], splashes, [[Spray (liquid drop)|sprays]], or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria, keeping it from reaching the wearer's mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of the wearer's [[saliva]] and respiratory secretions to others.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks|title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks)|date=11 March 2020|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|language=en|accessdate=28 March 2020}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

Certified medical masks are made of [[non-woven]] material. They are mostly multi-layer. Filter material may be made of [[microfibers]] with an electrostatic charge; that is, the fibers are [[electret]]s. An electret filter increases the chances that smaller particles will veer and hit a fiber, rather than going straight through (electrostatic capture).<ref name="PM03">{{cite web|last1=Wei|first1=Neo Kang|date=6 May 2019|title=What is PM0.3 and Why Is It Important?|url=https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/what-is-pm0-3-why-important/|website=Smart Air Filters}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|title=US 5496507 A – Method Of Charging Electret Filter Media The Lens – Free & Open Patent and Scholarly Search|url=https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/115-765-583-335-691/fulltext|website=The Lens – Free & Open Patent and Scholarly Search}}</ref><ref name="Australia">{{cite web|date=February 2020|title=Properties of Different Types of Masks |url=http://cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/567394/Properties-of-different-types-of-masks.pdf|publisher=Government of New South Wales Clinical Excellence Commission}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2020}}{{medcn|date=May 2020}} While there is some development work on making electret filtering materials that can stand  being washed and reused,<ref name="kaist">{{cite news|last=Jung|first=James|date=17 March 2020|title=KAIST Researchers Develop Highly Reusable Mask Filter|work=KoreaTechToday|url=https://www.koreatechtoday.com/kaist-researchers-develop-highly-reusable-mask-filter/}}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web |title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks {{!}} {{!}} Blogs {{!}} CDC |url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/ |publisher=CDC |language=en-us}}</ref>--> current commercially produced electret filters are ruined by many forms of disinfection, including washing with soap and water or alcohol, which destroys the electric charge.<ref name=CDC_guidelines/> During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities issued guidelines on [[Mechanical filter respirator#Disinfection and reuse|how to save, disinfect and reuse electret-filter masks]] without damaging the filtration efficiency.<ref name="paperbag">{{cite web |title=Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us |date=11 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="CDC_guidelines">{{cite web |title=Recommended Guidance for Extended Use and Limited Reuse of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html |website=cdc.gov |publisher=CDC |language=en-us |date=27 March 2020|series=NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic}}</ref> Standard disposable surgical masks are not designed to be washed.

A surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures.

For the COVID-19 response when supplies are short, the US CDC states that contingency and crisis strategies should be followed: Each elastomeric respirator is issued for the exclusive use of an individual healthcare provider, but must be cleaned and disinfected as often as necessary to remain unsoiled and sanitary. If there is no other option than to share a respirator between healthcare providers, the respirator must be cleaned and disinfected before it is worn by a different individual. Filters (except for unprotected disc types) may be used for an extended period, but the filter housing of cartridge types must be disinfected after each patient interaction.<ref name="elastomeric"/>

===Powered air-purifying respirators===

[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|Powered air-purifying respirators, including a waist pack and hose to blow air into the headpiece.]]
A [[powered air-purifying respirator]] (PAPR) is a  personal protective equipment in which a device with a filter and fan creates a highly filtered airflow towards the headpiece and a positive outflow of air from the headpiece.<ref name=how-agp/>

There is an increased risk for healthcare workers to become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 when they conduct [[aerosol-generating procedure]]s on COVID-19 patients, which is why it is argued that such situations may require enhanced personal protective equipment (i.e., higher than N95) such as PAPRs for healthcare workers.<ref name=how-agp>{{cite journal |last1=Howard |first1=Brittany E. |title=High-Risk Aerosol-Generating Procedures in COVID-19: Respiratory Protective Equipment Considerations |journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery |date=July 2020 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=98–103 |doi=10.1177/0194599820927335}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mick |first1=Paul |last2=Murphy |first2=Russell |title=Aerosol-generating otolaryngology procedures and the need for enhanced PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review |journal=Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery |date=December 2020 |volume=49 |doi=10.1186/s40463-020-00424-7}}</ref>

In a systematic review, Licina, Silvers, and Stuart (8 August 2020) stated that field studies indicate that there was equivalent rates of infection between healthcare workers, who performed airway procedures on critical COVID-19 patients, utilizing PAPRs or other appropriate respiratory equipment (such as N95 or FFP2), but remarked that there is a need to further collect field data about optimal respiratory protection during highly virulent pandemics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Licina |first1=Ana |last2=Silvers |first2=Andrew |last3=Stuart |first3=Rhonda L. |title=Use of powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) by healthcare workers for preventing highly infectious viral diseases—a systematic review of evidence |journal=Systematic Reviews |date=8 August 2020 |volume=9 |doi=10.1186/s13643-020-01431-5}}</ref>

Regarding the use of non-medical fabric masks in the general population, the WHO has stated that high-quality evidence for its widespread use is limited, but advises governments to encourage its use as physical distancing may not be possible in some settings, there is some evidence for asymptomatic transmission, and masks could be helpful to provide a barrier to limit the spread of potentially infectious droplets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A: Masks and COVID-19 |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks |website=World Health Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727235556/https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks |archivedate=27 July 2020 |date=7 June 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 10 November 2020 scientific brief, the CDC states that the community use of cloth masks serves two primary purposes: to reduce the emission of virus-laden droplets from exhalation into the environment ([[Source control (respiratory disease)|source control]]), which is especially relevant for asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected wearers who feel well and may be unaware of their infectiousness to others, and to reduce inhalation of these droplets through filtration for the wearer (personal protection).<ref name=cdc-sccom>{{cite web |title=Scientific Brief: Community Use of Cloth Masks to Control the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=10 November 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> They concluded that the benefit of masking for SARS-CoV-2 control is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection, which is likely complementary and possibly synergistic, so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use.<ref name=cdc-sccom/>

After emerging data documented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from persons without symptoms, the recommendation was expanded to the general community, with an emphasis on cloth face coverings that could be made more widely available in the community than surgical masks and to preserve personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators to the highest-risk exposures in health care settings.

===China and Asia===
[[COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China|China]] has specifically recommended the use of disposable [[surgical mask|medical masks]] by the public, including its healthy members,<ref name="nhc_masks" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /> particularly when coming into close contact ({{convert|1|m|ft|0}} or less) with other people.<ref name="sci_masks"/> [[COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or in crowded places.<ref name="chp_hk" /><ref name="time5799964" /> [[COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand|Thailand]]'s health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.<ref name="0azBR" /> The Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korean, and Japanese governments have also recommended the use of face masks in public.

In March 2020, when asked about the mistakes that other countries were making in the pandemic, the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] director-general [[George Fu Gao]] said: <blockquote>"The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren't wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role − you've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have [[asymptomatic]] or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=Jon |title=Not wearing masks to protect against coronavirus is a 'big mistake,' top Chinese scientist says |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says |website=Science |date=27 March 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[National Health Commission]] of China cited the following reasons for the wearing of masks by the public, including healthy individuals:

# Asymptomatic transmission. Many people can be infected without symptoms or only with mild symptoms.<ref name="nhc_why"/>
# Difficulty or impossibility of appropriate social distancing in many public places at all times.<ref name="nhc_why"/>
# Cost-benefit mismatch. If only infected individuals wear masks, they would possibly have a negative incentive to do so. An infected individual might get nothing positive, but only bear the costs such as inconvenience, purchasing expenses, and even prejudice.<ref name="nhc_why"/>
# There is no shortage of masks in China. The country has the production capacity to meet the demand on masks.<ref name="nhc_why"/>

<!-- SOURCE CONTROL/PROTECT OTHER -->In a comment to ''The Lancet'', Kar Keung Cheng, Tai Hing Lam, and Chi Chiu Leung argued that a public health rationale for mass masking is [[Source control (respiratory disease)|source control]] to protect others from respiratory droplets and underscored the importance of this approach due to asymptomatic transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cheng |first1=Kar Keung |last2=Lam |first2=Tai Hing |last3=Leung |first3=Chi Chiu |title=Wearing face masks in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic: altruism and solidarity |journal=The Lancet |date=16 April 2020 |pages=S0140673620309181 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30918-1|pmid=32305074 |pmc=7162638 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Wang Linfa, an infectious disease expert who heads a joint [[Duke University]] and [[National University of Singapore]] research team, stated that masking is about "preventing the [[Transmission (medicine)|spread of disease]] rather than preventing [[Infection|getting the disease]]", remarking that the point is to cover the faces of people who are infected but do not know it, so it is imperative for everyone to wear one in public.<ref name="pri.org"/>

<!-- SALIVA -->[[Yuen Kwok-yung]], a microbiologist from the [[University of Hong Kong]], cites a high [[viral load|amount of virus strands]] in [[saliva]] of infected people and transmission by asymptomatic carriers as the reasons why even seemingly healthy individuals should wear a mask.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Li|first1=Isabelle|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/exclusive-qa-with-hong-kong-microbiologist-yuen-kwok-yung-who-helped-confirm|title=Q&A with HK microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung who helped confirm coronavirus' human spread|date=10 March 2020|work=[[The Straits Times]]|last2=Zuoyan|first2=Zhao}}</ref> Kelvin Kai-Wang To ''et al.''

[[Jared Moskowitz]], the head of the [[Florida Division of Emergency Management]], accused 3M of selling N95 masks directly to foreign countries for cash, instead of the US. Moskowitz stated that 3M agreed to authorized distributors and brokers to represent they were selling the masks to Florida, but instead his team for the last several weeks "get to warehouses that are completely empty."

''[[Forbes]]'' reported that "roughly 280 million masks from warehouses around the US had been purchased by foreign buyers [on 30 March 2020] and were earmarked to leave the country, according to the broker—and that was in ''one'' day", causing massive critical shortages of masks in the US.<ref>{{Cite news|last=DiSalvo|first=David|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/|title=I Spent A Day In The Coronavirus-Driven Feeding Frenzy Of N95 Mask Sellers And Buyers And This Is What I Learned|date=30 March 2020|work=Forbes|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author1=Natasha Bertrand |author2=Gabby Orr |author3=Daneil Lippman |author4=Nahal Toosi|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/31/pence-task-force-coronavirus-aid-157806|title=Pence task force freezes coronavirus aid amid backlash|date=31 March 2020|work=Politico|accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Masks were still in short supply in late September, eight months into the pandemic. The [[Defense Production Act]] powers that averted a ventilator shortage were not used as extensively to increase N95 production, despite outcry from healthcare workers.

N95 manufacturers and other companies have been reluctant to invest more in domestic mask production because manufacturing in the United States is not profitable for them. There are some American companies who can shift production temporarily to meet the demand for masks but most of them have not received any funding through the DPA. Some have taken the initiative but there were problems with the fit of the masks and obtaining regulatory approvals. 3M and other N95 manufacturers have not entered into any corporate partnerships to share [[intellectual property]] or increase N95 production.<ref name=septshortage/>

Trump gave Rear Admiral John Polowczyk the responsibility for the logistics of PPE. Polowczyk said that he believed "hospital systems are making management decisions that might lead to an appearance that we still don't have masks, which is the farthest from the truth."<ref name=septshortage/>

===Germany===
In early April 2020, the Berlin politician [[Andreas Geisel]] alleged that a shipment of 200,000 N95 masks that it had ordered from American producer 3M's China facility were intercepted in [[Bangkok]] and diverted to the United States. 3M said they had no knowledge of the shipment, stating "We know nothing of an order from the Berlin police for 3M masks that come from China," and the US government denied that any confiscation had taken place and said that they use appropriate channels for all their purchases.<ref name=Betschka>{{cite news |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/usa-fangen-200-000-schutzmasken-ab-berlins-innensenator-spricht-von-moderner-piraterie/25712976.html |title=Berlins Innensenator spricht von 'moderner Piraterie' |first1=Julius |last1=Betschka |first2=Alexander |last2=Fröhlich |date=3 April 2020 |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Schutzmasken konfisziert?

This revelation outraged the Berlin opposition, whose [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] parliamentary group leader Burkard Dregger accused Geisel of "deliberately misleading Berliners" in order "to cover up its own inability to obtain protective equipment".

In the first five months of 2020, 70,802 new companies registered in China to make or trade face masks, a 1,256% increase compared to 2019, and 7,296 new companies registered to make or trade [[melt blowing|melt blown]] fabrics, a key component of face masks, a 2,277% rise from 2019.<ref name="prod12"/>

In April, however, the Chinese government stepped in with tighter regulations. 867 producers of the meltblown fabric were shut down in [[Yangzhong]] city alone.

The results from a study surveying people in Germany indicate that the act of wearing a mask, independent of the policy, is considered a [[social contract]] in which compliant people perceive each other more positively and noncompliance is negatively evaluated.<ref name=bets-pnas/> However, it also suggests that voluntary policies have the potential effect to increase [[social polarization|polarization]] and thus cause more stigmatization.<ref name=bets-pnas/> The authors recommended that countries and communities should adopt a mandatory policy along with explicit communication of the benefits of both masking (e.g., risk reduction, mutual protection, positive [[social signaling]]) and mandatory policies (e.g., fairness, less stigmatization, higher effectiveness) to encourage the public to wear masks.<ref name=bets-pnas/>

According to Moe Gelbart, Executive Director of the Thelma McMillen Recovery Center, anti-maskers' behaviors do not appear only from the facts they hear, but the problems also come from the meaning they give to those facts. He identifies several key psychological reasons that prompt them to not wear a mask: Firstly, denial is seen in some people who feel worried and anxious by masks as it interferes with their belief and desire that everything is alright. Secondly, another reason is a sense of invulnerability, as some people and especially younger individuals believe that nothing bad will happen to them and are thus are prone to risk-taking behaviors. Thirdly, behavioral drift is seen among some people who find it difficult to maintain behaviors intended for prevention rather than treatment. Fourthly, some people may have issues related to authority due to mistrust of science or tribe identification with powerful figures. Fifthly, the meaning of covering one's face is often associated with bad things that people want to hide or are ashamed of. Sixthly, some people do not want to admit fear and vulnerability, which they associate with the act of wearing a mask. Finally, some people have selfish and self-centered reasons, because the call to wear a mask for the protection of others seems to provide not enough motivation to do something that they do not want to do.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gelbart |first1=Moe |title=Unmasking the 'Wear a Mask' Dilemma |url=https://www.torrancememorial.org/News_Center/2020/July/Unmasking_the_Wear_a_Mask_Dilemma_Psychological_.aspx |website=Torrance Memorial |date=13 July 2020}}</ref>
