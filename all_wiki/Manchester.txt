The recorded [[history of Manchester]] began with the civilian settlement associated with the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[castra|fort]] of ''Mamucium'' or ''Mancunium'', which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers [[River Medlock|Medlock]] and [[River Irwell|Irwell]]. Although [[Historic counties of England|historically]] and traditionally a part of [[Lancashire]], areas of [[Cheshire]] south of the [[River Mersey]] were incorporated into Manchester in the 20th century. The first to be included, [[Wythenshawe]], was added to the city in 1931. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] Manchester remained a [[manorialism|manorial]] [[Township (England)|township]], but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]],<ref name="Cotton">{{cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/cottonindustry0000aspi/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/cottonindustry0000aspi/page/3}}</ref> and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.<ref name="Industrial city">{{cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|publisher=Carnegie Publishing| location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5}}<br />• {{cite book|title=Tradition in Action.

==Etymology==
The name ''Manchester'' originates from the [[Latin]] name ''Mamucium'' or its variant ''Mancunio'' and the citizens are still referred to as Mancunians ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|n|ˈ|k|juː|n|i|ə|n}}). These names are generally thought to represent a [[Latinization of names|Latinisation]] of an original [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] [[Celtic placenames|name]].

===Early history===
{{main|Mamucium}}
The [[Brigantes]] were the major [[Celtic tribes in Britain and Ireland|Celtic tribe]] in what is now known as [[Northern England]]; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which [[Manchester Cathedral]] now stands, opposite the bank of the  [[River Irwell]].<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book |first=Glynis |last=Cooper |title=Salford: An Illustrated History |publisher=The Breedon Books Publishing Company |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-455-8|page=19}}</ref> Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and [[Stretford]]. Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in the 1st century, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|General Agricola]] ordered the construction of a [[Castra|fort]] named [[Mamucium]] in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) and [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) were protected from the Brigantes.<ref name="Cooper"/> Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.<ref name="Roman">{{cite book| title=Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195168969.do#.UmOl33CVPp8| last=Rogers| first=Nicholas| year=2003| page=18| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=0-19-516896-8| accessdate=7 November 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021000106/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195168969.do#.UmOl33CVPp8| archive-date=21 October 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in [[Castlefield]].

During the [[English Civil War]] Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] granted it the right to elect its own [[Members of Parliament|MP]]. [[Charles Worsley]], who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the [[Rule of the Major Generals]]. He was a diligent [[puritan]], turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.<ref>{{cite book | title= Cromwell's major generals: godly government during the English Revolution | series= Politics, culture, and society in early modern Britain | author=Durston, Christopher | year= 2001 | publisher=Manchester University Press | location= Manchester | isbn= 0-7190-6065-6 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw622QZHTcYC&q=%22charles+worsley%22&pg=PA86 | accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton [[fustian]]s, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance.<ref name="Kidd"/> The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The [[Bridgewater Canal]], Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at [[Worsley]] to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at [[Runcorn]] by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton.<ref name="Kidd"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns.<ref name="Kidd"/> A [[commodities exchange]], opened in 1729,<ref name="Hylton"/> and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, [[Richard Arkwright]] began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.<ref name="Hylton"/><ref name="Hartwell"/> In the early 1800s, [[John Dalton]] formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.

===Industrial Revolution===
Manchester's history is concerned with [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. The great majority of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing.<ref name="GMArch">{{cite book|author=McNeil, Robina|author2=Michael Nevell|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref>

Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.{{multiple image

}} Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway—the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down.<ref name="Kidd"/> In 1878 the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] (the forerunner of [[BT Group|British Telecom]]) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1605to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173107/http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1605to1880/1878.htm|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was built between 1888 and 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running {{convert|36|mi|km|0}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.peelports.com/ports/manchester-ship-canal |title=Manchester Ship Canal |publisher=Peel Ports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520060954/https://www.peelports.com/ports/manchester-ship-canal |archive-date=20 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at [[Trafford Park]].<ref name="Kidd"/><!--1993, p103 --> Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.

A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 16 August 1819. The economic school of [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester Capitalism]] developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] from 1838 onward.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spall |first1=Richard Francis |title=Free Trade, Foreign Relations, and the Anti-Corn-Law League |journal=The International History Review |date=1988 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=405–432 |doi=10.1080/07075332.1988.9640484 |jstor=40105891 |issn=0707-5332}}</ref>

Manchester has a notable place in the history of [[Marxism]] and left-wing politics; being the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' work ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,<ref name="Engles">{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive – Biography of Engels|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430052112/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|archive-date=30 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> and when [[Karl Marx]] visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library.

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]], promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe.

Many of the great public buildings (including [[Manchester Town Hall]]) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy.

Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian [[Simon Schama]] noted that "Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw "wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Victoria and Her Sisters |series= A History of Britain |serieslink= A History of Britain (TV series) |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 4 June 2002 |number=13}}</ref>

The number of [[cotton mill]]s in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853.<ref name="GMArch"/> Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by [[Bolton]] in the 1850s and [[Oldham]] in the 1860s.<ref name="GMArch"/> However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region.<ref name="GMArch"/> Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area.<ref name="Kidd"/> The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===Blitz===
Like most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the [[Second World War]]. For example, casting and machining expertise at [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]]'s locomotive works in [[Gorton]] was switched to bomb making; [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]'s rubber works in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] made [[barrage balloon]]s; and just outside the city in [[Trafford Park]], engineers [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] made [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] built the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "[[Manchester Blitz|Christmas Blitz]]" on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated {{convert|467|long ton|t|order=flip}} of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hardy | first= Clive | title= Manchester at War | edition= 2nd | year= 2005 | location= Altrincham| isbn= 1-84547-096-6 | pages=75–99 | chapter= The blitz | publisher=First Edition Limited }}</ref> [[Manchester Cathedral]], [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange]] and [[Free Trade Hall]] were among the buildings seriously damaged; restoration of the cathedral took 20 years.<ref name="WWII">{{cite web | url= http://www.manchestercathedral.org/history/timeline | title= Timeline | accessdate= 5 May 2009 | publisher= Manchester Cathedral Online | year= 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160416153101/http://www.manchestercathedral.org/history/timeline | archive-date= 16 April 2016 | url-status= dead }}</ref>

On Saturday 15 June 1996, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out the [[1996 Manchester bombing]], the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50&nbsp;million, but this was quickly revised upwards.<ref name="1996 IRA costs">{{cite book |title=A History of Manchester |first=Stuart |last=Hylton |year=2003 |pages=227–230 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn= 1-86077-240-4}}</ref> The final insurance payout was over £400&nbsp;million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.<ref name="IRA business">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm | title=Panorama – The cost of terrorism | accessdate=5 May 2009 | publisher=BBC | date=15 May 2004 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415021411/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm | archive-date=15 April 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The City of Manchester is governed by the [[Manchester City Council]]. The [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]], with a [[Mayor of Greater Manchester|directly elected mayor]], has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English [[Core Cities Group]] since its inception in 1995.<ref name="Core city">{{cite web |url=http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html |title=About the Core Cities Group |accessdate=9 July 2007 |publisher=English [[Core Cities Group]] |year=2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919035621/http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html |archivedate=19 September 2007}}</ref>

The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of [[manorial court]]s, the last of which was dissolved in 1846.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211203737/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm |archivedate=11 February 2011 |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office |accessdate=9 July 2007 |at=Places names – M to N}}</ref>

Manchester later formed its own [[Poor Law Union]] using the name "Manchester".<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1792, Commissioners—usually known as "Police Commissioners"—were established for the social improvement of Manchester.

In 1885, [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a [[county borough]] as did many larger Lancashire towns, and therefore not governed by [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as [[Burnage]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Didsbury]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Levenshulme]], [[Longsight]], and [[Withington]]. In 1931, the [[Cheshire]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and [[Northen Etchells]] from the south of the [[River Mersey]] were added.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> In 1974, by way of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> That year, [[Ringway, Greater Manchester|Ringway]], the village where the [[Manchester Airport]] is located, was added to the city.

In November 2014, it was announced that Greater Manchester would receive a [[Mayor of Greater Manchester|new directly elected Mayor]].

At {{Coord|53|28|0|N|2|14|0|W|type:city}}, {{convert|160|mi|km|sigfig=2}} northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines]], an upland chain that runs the length of [[northern England]], and to the south by the [[Cheshire Plain]].

Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.<ref name="Coalfields">{{cite web |url=http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/159631/the%20manchester%20coalfields.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327122645/http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/159631/the%20manchester%20coalfields.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |title=The Manchester Coalfields |accessdate=5 May 2009 |publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] |year=2001 }}</ref>
[[File:Map of Manchester.png|thumb|left|upright|The City of Manchester. The [[land use]] is overwhelmingly urban]]
The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The "Manchester City Zone", "[[M postcode area|Manchester post town]]" and the "[[Manchester Congestion Charge]]" are all examples of this.

For purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There is a mix of high-density urban and suburban locations. The largest open space in the city, at around {{convert|260|ha|acre|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m2002.thecgf.com/venues/HPK/ |title=Heaton Park |accessdate=20 July 2009 |publisher=thecgf.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831032941/http://m2002.thecgf.com/venues/HPK/ |archive-date=31 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> is [[Heaton Park]]. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with [[Cheshire]]. The [[M60 motorway (Great Britain)|M60]] and [[M56 motorway]]s pass through [[Northenden]] and [[Wythenshawe]] respectively in the south of Manchester. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being [[Manchester Piccadilly station]].

===Climate===
Manchester experiences a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), like much of the British Isles, with warm summers and cool winters. Summer daytime temperatures regularly top 20 Celsius, quite often reaching 25 Celsius on sunny days during July and August in particular. In more recent years, temperatures have occasionally reached over 30 Celsius. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.

===Green belt===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Manchester lies at the centre of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region extending into the wider surrounding counties.

Manchester's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] to [[contemporary architecture]]. The widespread use of [[red brick]] characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade.<ref name="Hartwell"/> Just outside the immediate city centre are a large number of former [[cotton mill]]s, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure, while many have been redeveloped as apartment buildings and office space. [[Manchester Town Hall]], in [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]], was built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] style and is seen as one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=John Martin |date=1986 |title=The Architecture of Northern England |page=153 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780333373965}}</ref>

Manchester also has a number of [[Tallest Buildings of Manchester|skyscrapers]] built in the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest being the [[CIS Tower]] near [[Manchester Victoria station]] until the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] was completed in 2006. The latter exemplifies a new surge in high-rise building. It includes a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton hotel]], a restaurant and apartments. The largest skyscraper is now Deansgate Square South Tower, at 201 metres (659 feet).[[The Green Building]], opposite [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Oxford Road station]], is a pioneering eco-friendly housing project, while the recently completed [[One Angel Square]], is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=One Angel Square, Co-operative Group HQ |url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=598 |work=breeam.org |accessdate=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521150355/http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=598 |archivedate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Manchester is home to the largest group of [[consul (representative)|consuls]] in the UK outside London. The expansion of international trade links during the Industrial Revolution led to the introduction of the first consuls in the 1820s and since then over 800, from all parts of the world, have been based in Manchester. Manchester hosts consular services for most of the north of England.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fox, David |title=Manchester Consuls |year=2007 |publisher=Carnegie Publishing |location=Lancaster |isbn=978-1-85936-155-9 |pages=vii–ix}}<br />{{cite web |title=Manchester Consular Association |url=https://www.manchesterconsularassociation.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119230017/https://www.manchesterconsularassociation.com/ |archive-date=19 January 2019 |url-status=live}}<br />{{cite web |url=http://mca.group.shef.ac.uk/index_Page320.htm |title=List of Consulates, Consulate Generals and High Commissioners |publisher=MCA (subsidiary of Sheffield University) |accessdate=5 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212001011/http://mca.group.shef.ac.uk/index_Page320.htm |archivedate=12 December 2013}}</ref>
