<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] in which a person has [[intrusive thought|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions") or feels the need to perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "compulsions") to an extent which generates distress or impairs general functioning.<ref name=NIH2015 /><ref name="DSM5" /> The person is unable to control either the thoughts or activities for more than a short period of time.<ref name=NIH2015 /> Common compulsions include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.<ref name=NIH2015 /> These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected,<ref name=NIH2015>{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|access-date=24 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archive-date=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> often taking up more than an hour a day.<ref name=DSM5>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/237 237–242]|edition=5|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/237}}</ref> Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.<ref name=NIH2015 /> The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].<ref name=DSM5 /><ref name=Ang2015>{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.<ref name="Leckman">{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four-factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable. The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor". The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions. The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding-related obsessions and compulsions and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}</ref>

While OCD has been considered a homogeneous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders. Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response. Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions. On the other hand, subtype-dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}</ref>

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.<ref name="Osgood">{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|access-date=December 30, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}</ref> As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts.

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}</ref>

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}</ref>

=== Compulsions ===

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[Excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[Trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].<ref name=DSM5 /> Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.<ref name=DSM5 /><ref>{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|access-date=12 Apr 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 |doi=10.3109/01612849409074930 }}</ref> Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|s2cid=30858531|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually are not as complex and are not precipitated by obsessions.<ref name=DSM5 /> It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.<ref name=DSM5 /> About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.<ref>{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}</ref>

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering books for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a library, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |access-date=15 December 2009}}</ref>

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |access-date=26 March 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archive-date=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.

In [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], OCD patients are asked to overcome intrusive thoughts by not doing any compulsions. They are taught that rituals keep OCD strong, while not performing them causes the OCD to become weaker.<ref>https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/forms_ocd_cbt.html</ref>

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name="Sadock">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th}}</ref>

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].<ref>O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive–compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281–284</ref>

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.<ref name="comorbidity">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | s2cid = 14546782 | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}</ref>

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)<ref name="differential">[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012</ref> or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".<ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification| s2cid = 146592937 }}</ref><ref name="OCD and T">{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |access-date=30 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archive-date=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]]. Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences. Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes. OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders. Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}</ref>

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.<ref name=NIH2015 /> Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.<ref name=DSM5 />

=== Drug-induced OCD ===
Many different types of medication can create/induce pure OCD in patients that have never had symptoms before. A new chapter about OCD in the [[DSM-5]] (2013) now specifically includes drug-induced OCD.

[[Atypical antipsychotic]]s (second generation antipsychotics), such as [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), have been proven to induce de-novo OCD in patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Obsessive-compulsive symptoms with olanzapine|journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|date = 1 September 2004|issn = 1461-1457|pmid = 15231024|pages = 375–377|volume = 7|issue = 3|doi = 10.1017/S1461145704004456|first1 = Basil|last1 = Alevizos|first2 = Charalambos|last2 = Papageorgiou|first3 = George N.|last3 = Christodoulou|doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Olanzapine induced de-novo obsessive compulsive disorder in a patient with schizophrenia|journal = Indian Journal of Pharmacology|date = 1 January 2012|issn = 0253-7613|pmc = 3480803|pmid = 23112432|pages = 649–650|volume = 44|issue = 5|doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.100406|first1 = Gajanan|last1 = Kulkarni|first2 = Janardhanan C.|last2 = Narayanaswamy|first3 = Suresh Bada|last3 = Math}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Olanzapine and obsessive-compulsive symptoms|journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology|date = 1 September 2000|issn = 0924-977X|pmid = 10974610|pages = 385–387|volume = 10|issue = 5|first1 = L.|last1 = Lykouras|first2 = I.

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.<ref name=DSM5 /> Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.<ref name="pmid19665647">{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 | s2cid = 203833429 }}</ref> A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.<ref name="Menzies et al, 2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

It has been postulated by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages.

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control. The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, [[striatum]], and thalamus. The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}</ref>

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.<ref name="Wood">{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}</ref>

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196|s2cid=5528241}}</ref>

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}</ref> with compulsions. This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the ventral striatum when anticipating monetary reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC. Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-responsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli. Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.<ref name="Wood" />

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}</ref> Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs.

A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although [[antipsychotics]], which act by [[Dopamine antagonist|antagonizing dopamine receptors]] may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others. Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increase the release of dopamine in the [[prefrontal cortex]], through inhibiting [[autoreceptors]]. Further complicating things is the efficacy of [[Amphetamine|amphetamines]], decreased [[dopamine transporter]] activity observed in OCD,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Jesse|last2=Ahmari|first2=Susanne E.|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=17 December 2015|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmc=4681810|issn=1662-5137|pmid=26733823}}</ref> and low levels of [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2]] binding in the [[striatum]].<ref name="glutamate" /> Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graat|first1=I|last2=Figee|first2=M|last3=Denys|first3=D|editor1-last=Pittinger|editor1-first=C|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Phenomenology, Pathophysiology and Treatment|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in OCD}}</ref>

Abnormalities in [[glutamatergic]] neurotransmission have implicated in OCD. Findings such as increased cerebrospinal glutamate, less consistent abnormalities observed in neuroimaging studies and the efficacy of some glutamatergic drugs such as the glutamate-inhibiting [[riluzole]] have implicated glutamate in OCD.<ref name="glutamate">{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=Christopher|title=Glutamate abnormalities in obsessive compulsive disorder: Neurobiology, pathophysiology, and treatment|last2=Bloch|first2=Michael H.|last3=Williams|first3=Kyle|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|date=3 March 2017|volume=132|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.09.006|pmc=3205262|issn=0163-7258|pmid=21963369}}</ref> OCD has been associated with reduced [[N-Acetylaspartic acid]] in the mPFC, which is thought to reflect neuron density or functionality, although the exact interpretation has not been established.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=Y|last2=Aoki|first2=A|last3=Suwa|first3=H|title=Reduction of N-acetylaspartate in the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom severity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: meta-analyses of (1)H-MRS studies.|journal=Translational Psychiatry|date=14 August 2012|volume=2|issue=8|pages=e153|doi=10.1038/tp.2012.78|pmid=22892718|pmc=3432192}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name="Quick">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name="Quick" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name="Fenske_2009" />

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58|s2cid=41312244}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].<ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /><ref name=Aardema>{{cite journal |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy| volume = 17 | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270| last1 = Aardema | first1 = Frederick | last2 = o'Connor | first2 = Kieron | s2cid = 143040967 }}</ref> Because egodystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.<ref name="carter">Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.</ref> By contrast, people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.<ref name="carter" />

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.<ref name=NIH2015 /><ref name=NICE2005 /> Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".<ref name="APAguidelines">{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}</ref>

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school). That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[Habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<ref name="baojournal.com">Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).<ref name=NEJM2014 /> [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.<ref name=NEJM2014 />

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.<ref name=NICE2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|access-date=24 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archive-date=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2009|issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archive-date=13 April 2013 }}</ref> Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&nbsp;weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |access-date=30 January 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archive-date=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |access-date=30 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.<ref name="Ve2014" /> For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.<ref name="Barlow">Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.</ref> [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archive-date=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.<ref>[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M.

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.<ref name="pmid19378573">{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 }}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life (QoL) is reduced across all domains in OCD.
