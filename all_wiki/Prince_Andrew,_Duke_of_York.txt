{{British Royal Family}}

'''Prince Andrew, Duke of York''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG|GCVO|CD|ADC(P)}} (Andrew Albert Christian Edward, born 19 February 1960) is a member of the [[British royal family]]. He resigned from all public roles as a result of his association with the [[Jeffrey Epstein]] sex trafficking scandal.

He is the third child and second son of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. He was second in the line of [[succession to the British throne]] when he was born, and is eighth in line {{as of|2020|11|lc=y}}. Prince Andrew served in the [[Royal Navy]] as a helicopter pilot and instructor and as the captain of a warship. During the [[Falklands War]], he flew on multiple missions including [[anti-surface warfare]], [[Exocet missile]] decoy, and casualty evacuation. In 1986, Prince Andrew married [[Sarah Ferguson]] and was created [[Duke of York]]. They have two daughters, Princesses [[Princess Beatrice|Beatrice]] and [[Princess Eugenie|Eugenie]]. Their marriage, separation in 1992, and divorce in 1996 attracted much media coverage. He served as Britain's [[Special Representative for International Trade and Investment]] for ten years until July 2011.

On 20 November 2019, Prince Andrew suspended his public duties for the "foreseeable future" following intense negative reaction regarding a television interview for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme, aired on 16 November 2019, which was mainly concerned with allegations against him of [[sexual abuse]] and his connections to convicted [[sex offender]] Jeffrey Epstein.<ref name="Quinn201119">{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Ben|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future|title=Prince Andrew to step back from public duties 'for foreseeable future'|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=20 November 2019|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref> In May 2020, it was announced that Andrew would permanently resign from all public roles over his ties to Epstein.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|first=Roya|last=Nikkhah|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-didn-t-think-it-was-all-over-but-it-is-now-rhg2trxb7|title=Prince Andrew didn’t think it was all over, but it is now|work=[[The Times]]|date= 21 May 2020|access-date=20 July 2020}}</ref> The same year, it became known that Andrew was a person of interest in the criminal investigation into the Epstein affair and that U.S. authorities had filed a [[Mutual legal assistance treaty|mutual legal assistance]] request to the UK in order to formally interrogate Andrew.

==Military service==

===Royal Navy===
The Royal Household announced in November 1978 that Prince Andrew would join the [[Royal Navy]] the following year. In December, he underwent various sporting tests and examinations at the [[Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre|Aircrew Selection Centre]], at [[London Biggin Hill Airport|RAF Biggin Hill]], along with further tests and interviews at [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)|HMS ''Daedalus'']], and interviews at the [[Admiralty Interview Board]], [[HMS Sultan (establishment)|HMS ''Sultan'']]. During March and April 1979, the prince was enrolled at the Royal Naval College Flight, undergoing pilot training, until he was accepted as a trainee helicopter pilot and signed on for 12 years from 11 May 1979. On 1 September of the same year, Prince Andrew was appointed as a [[midshipman]], and entered [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], Dartmouth. During 1979 he also completed the [[Royal Marines]] [[All Arms Commando Course]] for which he received his Green Beret.<ref name=naval/> He was commissioned as a [[sub-lieutenant]] on 1 September 1981 and appointed to the Trained Strength on 22 October.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=49322|supp=y|page=5304|date=19 April 1983}}</ref>

After passing out from Dartmouth, the prince went on to elementary flying training with the [[Royal Air Force]] at [[RAF Leeming]], and later, basic flying training with the navy at [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|HMS ''Seahawk'']], where he learned to fly the [[Aérospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter.<ref name=naval/> After being awarded his wings, he moved onto more advanced training on the [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter, and conducted operational flying training until 1982. He joined carrier-based squadron, [[820 Naval Air Squadron]], serving aboard the [[aircraft carrier]], [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']].<ref name=naval/>

===Falklands War===
Argentina [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded]] the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British overseas territory]] claimed by [[Argentina]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Cahill | first = Kevin | title = Who Owns the World: The Surprising Truth About Every Piece of Land on the Planet | year = 2010 | publisher = Grand Central Publishing | location = New York City| isbn = 978-0-446-55139-7 }}</ref> on 2 April 1982, leading to the [[Falklands War]]. ''Invincible'' was one of the two operational aircraft carriers available at the time, and, as such, was to play a major role in the [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|Royal Navy task force]] assembled to sail south to retake the islands.

Prince Andrew's place on board and the possibility of the Queen's son being killed in action made the British government apprehensive, and the cabinet desired that Prince Andrew be moved to a desk job for the duration of the conflict. The Queen, though, insisted that her son be allowed to remain with his ship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal Family: A Glorious Illustrated History|date=15 September 2015 |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]]|location=London, England|isbn=9781465438003|page=217}}</ref> Prince Andrew remained on board ''Invincible'' to serve as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, flying on missions that included [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[Anti-Surface Warfare|anti-surface warfare]], [[Exocet missile]] decoy, casualty evacuation, transport, and search and air rescue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.mercopress.com/2001/06/12/prince-andrew-talks-of-his-dangerous-falklands-experiences|title =Prince Andrew Talks of His Dangerous Falklands Experiences.|work=MercoPress|date=12 June 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/06/19/Prince-Andrew-a-hero-of-the-Falklands-war/3976393307200/|title=Prince Andrew, a hero of the Falklands war|website=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=19 June 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/06/03/Helicopter-pilot-Prince-Andrew-is-flying-anti-submarine-patrols-in/4652391924800/|title=Helicopter pilot Prince Andrew is flying anti-submarine patrols in...|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=3 June 1982}}</ref> He witnessed the Argentinian attack on the [[SS Atlantic Conveyor|SS ''Atlantic Conveyor'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NPs9AAAAIBAJ&pg=4110,2766700|title=Prince Andrew talks of Falklands horror|work=Glasgow Herald|date=14 November 1983|page=2}}</ref>

At the end of the war, ''Invincible'' returned to [[Portsmouth]], where the Queen and Prince Philip joined other families of the crew in welcoming the vessel home.

===Marriage to Sarah Ferguson===
{{further|Wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson}}

Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 July 1986. The same day, the Queen created him [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]], and [[Baron Killyleagh]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50606 |date=23 July 1986 |page=1 |supp=y}}</ref> The first two of these titles were previously held by both his maternal [[George VI|grandfather]] and [[George V|great-grandfather]]. Prince Andrew had known Ferguson since childhood; they had met occasionally at [[polo]] matches, and became re-acquainted with each other at [[Royal Ascot]] in 1985.<ref name="WP-86">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/07/22/fergie-bedlam-over-the-bride/e0ddc0f5-6a78-444b-be1b-19b4494acf64/|title=Fergie: Bedlam Over the Bride|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=Karen|last=DeYoung|date=22 July 1986|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>

The couple appeared to have a happy marriage and had two daughters together, presenting a united outward appearance during the late 1980s. His wife's personal qualities were seen as refreshing in the context of the formal protocol surrounding the Royal Family. However, the Duke of York's frequent travel due to his military career, as well as relentless, often critical, media attention focused on the Duchess of York, led to fractures in the marriage. On 19 March 1992, the couple announced plans to separate and did so in an amicable way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/19/newsid_2543000/2543667.stm|title=1992: Fergie and Andrew split|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=19 March 1992}}</ref> Some months later, pictures appeared in the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] media of the Duchess in intimate association with John Bryan, her financial advisor at the time, which effectively ended any hopes of a reconciliation between the Duke and Duchess. The marriage was ended in divorce on 30 May 1996. The Duke of York spoke fondly of his former wife: "We have managed to work together to bring our children up in a way that few others have been able to and I am extremely grateful to be able to do that."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Castle| first=Stephen| title=From Prince Andrew, critical words for U.S. on Iraq| newspaper=The New York Times | date=4 February 2008| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/world/americas/04iht-andrew.4.9735778.html }}</ref>

[[File:The Duke of York.JPG|thumb|The Duke of York riding in the carriage procession at [[Trooping the Colour]], 16 June 2012]]
The couple agreed to share custody of their two daughters, and the Duchess continued to live at the Duke's home, [[Sunninghill Park]], until 2004, when he moved to the [[Royal Lodge]]. In 2007, Sarah, Duchess of York, purchased Dolphin House, a mansion directly beside the Royal Lodge. In 2008, a fire at Dolphin House resulted in Sarah moving into the Royal Lodge, again sharing a house with the Duke of York. Prince Andrew's lease of [[Royal Lodge]] is for 75 years, with the Crown Estate as landlord, and there is no annual tenancy charge.<ref>National Audit Office report, 2005. [http://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-crown-estate-property-leases-with-the-royal-family/ "The Crown Estate – Property Leases with the Royal Family"].</ref>

In May 2010, Sarah, Duchess of York, was filmed by a ''[[News of the World]]'' reporter claiming that her former husband had agreed that if she were to receive £500,000, he would meet the donor and pass on useful top-level business contacts. She was filmed receiving, in cash, $40,000 as a down payment. The Duke's entourage emphatically denied he knew of the situation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duchess of York 'wanted cash for Prince Andrew access'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8699139.stm|work=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2011|date=23 May 2010}}</ref> In July 2011, Sarah stated that her multi-million pound debts had been cleared due to the intervention of her former husband, whom she compared to a "knight on a white charger".<ref name=Teleg>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8658857/Duchess-of-York-clears-debts-thanks-to-knight-on-white-charger-Andrew.html|title=Duchess of York clears debts thanks to 'knight on white charger' Andrew|author=Collins, Nick|date=25 July 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref>

Prince Andrew also added that Giuffre's claims about dancing with him at a club in London while he was sweaty were false due to him temporarily losing the ability to sweat after an "[[adrenaline]] overdose" during the Falklands War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/11/prince-andrew-says-he-once-didnt-sweat-is-that-possible/602227/|title=The Man Who Did Not Sweat|publisher=The Atlantic|first=James|last=Hamblin|date=18 November 2019|accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref> "Several doctors" told ''[[The Times]]'' they did not believe this explanation, as adrenaline overdose typically causes excessive sweating in humans. <!-- (although Dorothy Bennett, director of the Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute at St George's, University of London said that she would keep an "open mind" regarding environmental factors, citing one 1983 study which linked adrenaline overdose to [[Hypohidrosis|anhidrosis]] in horses).--> It has been previously said that his mother the Queen has not been seen sweating in public, raising the possibility of inherited [[Hypohidrosis|anhidrosis]] (although this was not the explanation given by the Duke).<ref>{{cite news|last=Whipple|first=Tom|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-cant-prince-andrew-sweat-the-answer-is-anhidrosis-cld20rds0|title=Why can't Prince Andrew sweat?

Prince Andrew also admitted to staying in Epstein's mansion for three days in 2010, after Epstein's conviction for sex offences against a minor, describing the location as "a convenient place to stay". However, he said, "I kick myself on a daily basis" for the decision "because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family", adding that he "let the side down".<ref name="Mansoor" /> The Duke said that he met Epstein for the sole purpose of breaking off any future relationship with him, saying that it was "the honourable and right thing to do", adding that one of his flaws was that he was "too honourable" a person.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mohdin |first1=Aamna |title=Prince Andrew: I thought staying with Epstein was 'honourable thing' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-believed-staying-with-jeffrey-epstein-right-thing-to-do |accessdate=20 November 2019 |work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2019}}</ref> He also said that, if "push came to shove" (and after consultation with his legal teams), he would be willing to testify under oath regarding his associations with Epstein.<ref name="Mansoor" />

==Politics and other incidents==
===Libya Connections===
From 2001 until July 2011, the Duke of York worked with [[UK Trade & Investment]], part of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]], as the United Kingdom's [[Special Representative for International Trade and Investment]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14235330 "Prince Andrew to stand down as UK trade envoy"], BBC News, 21 July 2011</ref> The post, previously held by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], involved representing and promoting the UK at various trade fairs and conferences around the world.<ref name="Trade-ED"/> His suitability for the role was challenged in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by Shadow Justice Minister [[Chris Bryant]] in February 2011, at the time of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], on the grounds that he was "not only a very close friend of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], but also&nbsp;... a close friend of the convicted Libyan gun smuggler Tarek Kaituni".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12604190 "Duke of York must lose trade job, says Labour MP"], BBC News, 1 March 2011.</ref>

===Alleged comments on corruption and Kazakhstan===
As the United Kingdom's Special Trade Representative, the Duke of York travelled the world to promote British businesses. It was revealed in the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] that the Duke had been reported on by [[Tatiana Gfoeller]], the [[United States Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan]], discussing bribery in Kyrgyzstan and the investigation into the [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]]. The Duke, she explained, "was referencing an investigation, subsequently closed, into alleged kickbacks a senior Saudi royal had received in exchange for the multi-year, lucrative [[BAE Systems]] contract to provide equipment and training to Saudi security forces."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/11/cablegate-chronicles-prince-andrew-on-these-expletive-journalists/67383/|title=Cablegate Chronicles: Prince Andrew on 'These (Expletive) Journalists'|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref> The dispatch continued: "His mother's subjects seated around the table roared their approval. He then went on to 'these (expletive) journalists, especially from [[The Guardian|the National Guardian]] {{sic}}, who poke their noses everywhere' and (presumably) make it harder for British businessmen to do business. The crowd practically clapped!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-rude-prince-andrew|title=WikiLeaks cables: 'Rude' Prince Andrew shocks US ambassador|newspaper=The Guardian|first=David|last=Leigh|first2=Heather|last2=Brooke|first3=Rob|last3=Evans|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref>

Earlier in 2010, it was revealed that the [[Kazakhstan]] President's billionaire son-in-law [[Timur Kulibayev]] paid the Duke of York's representatives £15 million – £3 million over the asking price – via offshore companies, for the Duke's [[Surrey]] mansion, [[Sunninghill Park]]. Kulibayev frequently appears in US dispatches as one of the men who have accumulated millions in gas-rich Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-rude-prince-andrew |location=London |work=The Guardian| first1=David | last1=Leigh | first2=Rob | last2=Evans| first3=Heather | last3=Brooke | title=WikiLeaks cables: 'Rude' Prince Andrew shocks US ambassador | date=29 November 2010}}</ref>

In May 2012, it was reported that Swiss and Italian police investigating "a network of personal and business relationships" allegedly used for "international corruption" were looking at the activities of Enviro Pacific Investments which charges "multi-million pound fees" to energy companies wishing to deal with Kazakhstan.<ref name="sun">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9291896/Money-laundering-probe-puts-spotlight-on-the-15-million-sale-of-the-Duke-of-Yorks-home.html |title=Money laundering probe puts spotlight on the £15 million sale of the Duke of York's home |author=Lewis, Jason |work=The Sunday Telegraph|location=London |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526222822/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9291896/Money-laundering-probe-puts-spotlight-on-the-15-million-sale-of-the-Duke-of-Yorks-home.html |archivedate=26 May 2012 }}</ref> The trust is believed to have paid £6 million towards the purchase of Sunninghill which now appears derelict.<ref name="sun" /> In response, a Palace spokesman said "This was a private sale between two trusts. There was never any impropriety on the part of The Duke of York".<ref name="sun" />

[[Libby Purves]] wrote in ''[[The Times]]'' in January 2015: "Prince Andrew dazzles easily when confronted with immense wealth and apparent power. He has fallen for 'friendships' with bad, corrupt and clever men, not only in the US but in Libya, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tunisia, wherever."<ref name=RoyGreenslade/>

In May 2016, a fresh controversy broke out when the ''Daily Mail'' alleged that the Duke had brokered a deal to assist a Greek and Swiss consortium in securing a £385 million contract to build water and sewerage networks in two of Kazakhstan's largest cities, while working as British trade envoy, and had stood to gain a £4 million payment in commission. The newspaper published an email from the Duke to Kazakh oligarch Kenges Rakishev, (who had allegedly brokered sale of the Prince's Berkshire mansion Sunninghill Park), and claimed that Rakishev had arranged meetings for the consortium. After initially claiming the email was a forgery, Buckingham Palace sought to block its publication as a privacy breach.<ref name="Sawer">{{cite news|last=Sawer|first=Patrick |title=Prince Andrew brokered £385m deal with Kazakh regime while working as British trade envoy|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date= 21 May 2016|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/20/duke-brokered-385m-for-corrupt-regime-while-working-as-british-t/}}</ref> The Palace strongly denied the allegation that the Duke had acted as a "fixer" calling the article "untrue, defamatory and a breach of the editor's code of conduct."<ref name="Sawer" />

A former Foreign Office minister, MP [[Chris Bryant]] stated: "When I was at the Foreign Office it was very difficult to see in whose interests he [the Duke] was acting. He doesn't exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem."<ref name="Sawer" /> There were calls for an official enquiry, the head of campaign group Republic saying "this appears to represent abuse of Andrew's position as trade envoy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tominey|first= Camilla |title=Prince Andrew 'acted as a £4m fixer'|work=[[Sunday Express]]|date= 22 May 2016|url= http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/672567/Prince-Andrew-acted-4m-fixer}}</ref>

===Election to Royal Society===
Andrew's election to the [[Royal Society]] prompted "Britain's leading scientists" to "revolt" due to Andrew's lack of scientific background, with some noting he had only a secondary school level education.<ref name="sunday"/> In an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Humboldt Prize]] recipient [[David Colquhoun]] opined, in references to Andrew's qualifications, that "if I wanted a tip for the winner of the 14.30 at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]], I’d ask a royal.

===Arms sales===
In March 2011, Kaye Stearman of the [[Campaign Against the Arms Trade]] told [[Channel 4 News]] CAAT sees Prince Andrew as part of a bigger problem, "He is the front man for [[UK Trade & Investment|UKTI]]. Our concerns are not just Prince Andrew, it's the whole UKTI set up. They see arms as just another commodity but it has completely disproportionate resources. At the London office of UKTI the arms sector has more staff than all the others put together.  We are concerned that Prince Andrew is used to sell arms, and where you sell arms it is likely to be to despotic regimes. He is the cheerleader in chief for the arms industry, shaking hands and paving the way for the salesmen."<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/prince-andrew-cheerleader-in-chief-for-the-arms-industry "Prince Andrew: 'Cheerleader in chief for the arms industry'"]. Channel 4 News. 10 March 2011.</ref>

In January 2014, Prince Andrew took part in a delegation to [[Bahrain]], a close ally of the United Kingdom. Spokesman for CAAT, Andrew Smith said, "We are calling on Prince Andrew and the UK government to stop selling arms to Bahrain. By endorsing the [[Human rights in Bahrain|Bahraini dictatorship]] Prince Andrew is giving his implicit support to their oppressive practices.  When our government sells arms it is giving moral and practical support to an illegitimate and authoritarian regime and directly supporting their systematic crackdown on opposition groups. (...) We shouldn't allow our international image to be used as a PR tool for the violent and oppressive dictatorship in Bahrain."<ref>[https://www.caat.org.uk/media/press-releases/2014-01-15 "Campaigners call for UK to halt arms exports to Bahrain as Prince Andrew joins sales drive"]. Campaign Against Arms Trade. 15 January 2014.</ref>

Andrew Smith has also said, "The prince has consistently used his position to promote arms sales and boost some of the most unpleasant governments in the world, his arms sales haven’t just given military support to corrupt and repressive regimes. They've lent those regimes political and international legitimacy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/17/prince-andrew-britainelites.html|title=What Scandal Involving Prince Andrew Says – Al Jazeera America|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>
