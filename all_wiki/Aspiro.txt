==History==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2015}}
The company was founded in 1998 by Jörgen Adolfsson, Christer Månsson and Klas Hallqvist. The founders knew each other from working together at Europolitan, one of Sweden's three largest mobile phone operators at the time, which was partly owned by [[Vodafone]]. It was not until Adolfsson and Månsson moved to [[Oslo]], where they worked for [[Telenor|Telenor Mobil]]'s division for Value-Creating Services, they realized the changes that [[Wireless Application Protocol]] would mean for mobile communications, immediately they contacted Hallqvist, who remained in Sweden as head of quality at Europolitan, and founded Aspiro.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jan-Eric Öhman |url=http://www.sanden.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/BHM1-Enablers.pdf |title=Born Mobile |publisher=Enablers |date=2000-02-22 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>

In May 2000, Aspiro was listed on [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]]'s New Market and later, in June 2001, began trading on the main list. Between 2000 and 2008, Aspiro acquired at least 13 companies: Midab Data, InfoCreator, Mgage Systems, Picofun, Melody Interactive Solutions, Emode, Cellus, Inpoc, Boomi, Mobile Avenue, Rubberduck, Voolife and Mobile Entry. However, it wasn't until 2009 they developed their first music streaming service, which is the core business today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schibsted.com/Global/Financial%20documents/Aspiro_offer_120117_556519-9998.pdf |title=Schibsted's Offer to the Shareholders in Aspiro AB |publisher=Schibsted |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>

On January 30, 2015, it was announced that Aspiro had received a $56 million takeover bid from [[Project Panther Bidco|Project Panther Bidco Ltd.]], which is indirectly owned and controlled by rapper and businessman [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/media/jay-z-buys-the-music-streaming-firm-aspiro.html|title=Jay Z Buys the Music Streaming Firm, Aspiro|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=2015-03-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-05-28/why-jay-z-s-tidal-streaming-music-service-has-been-a-disaster|title=That’s Business, Man: Why Jay Z’s Tidal Is a Complete Disaster|first=Devin|last=Leonard|website=Bloomberg|date=2015-05-28|accessdate=2019-07-28}}</ref> Although some minority shareholders opposed the takeover and argued that Project Panther undervalued the growth potential in their bid, the acquisition was announced finalized on March 13 after being accepted by over 90 percent of the shareholders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schibsted.com/en/ir/Regulatory--and-pressreleases/Regulatory-and-Press-Releases-Archive1/2015/Schibsted-ASA-SCH---Schibsted-accepts-an-offer-from-Project-Panther-Bidco-to-acquire-Aspiro/ |title=Schibsted ASA (SCH) – Schibsted accepts an offer from Project Panther Bidco to acquire Aspiro |publisher=Schibsted |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6480435/jay-zs-56-million-bid-for-aspiro-undervalues-company |title=Jay Z's $56 Million Bid for Aspiro Undervalues Company, Say Shareholders |publisher=Billboard |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/media/jay-z-buys-the-music-streaming-firm-aspiro.html?_r=0 |title=Jay Z Buys the Music Streaming Firm, Aspiro |publisher=NY Times |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>
