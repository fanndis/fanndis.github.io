[[World War II]] military operations in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began on 6 April 1941, when the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|swiftly conquered by Axis forces]] and partitioned between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and client regimes. Subsequently, a guerrilla [[liberation war]] was fought against the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupying forces and their locally established [[Puppet state|puppet regimes]], including the fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Government of National Salvation]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]], by the [[KPJ|communist]]-led republican [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Simultaneously, a multi-side [[civil war]] was waged between the Yugoslav communist Partisans, the Serbian royalist [[Chetniks]], the Croatian fascist [[Ustashe]] and [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Home Guard]], [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and [[Serbian State Guard|State Guard]], as well as [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pages=145–155}}

Both the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italian occupation forces]] until the [[Italian capitulation]], and thereon also with [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=145–155}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=246}} The Axis mounted a [[Seven anti-Partisan offensives|series of offensives]] intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in the [[Battle of Neretva]] and [[Battle of Sutjeska]] in the spring and summer of 1943.

Despite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|their organisation]] gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the [[Tehran Conference#Results|Tehran Conference]] and laying the foundations for the [[SFRY|post-war Yugoslav state]]. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies, and [[Red Army|Soviet ground troops]] in the [[Belgrade Offensive]], the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of [[Trieste#World War II and aftermath|Trieste]] and [[Carinthia (state)#From 1920 to the Present|Carinthia]].

The [[World War II casualties|human cost of the war]] was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country's [[Jewish]] population, many of whom perished in [[concentration camp|concentration]] and [[extermination camp]]s (e.g. [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica]]) run by the client regimes.

The Ustashe regime (mostly [[Croats]], but also [[Bosniaks|Muslims]] and others) committed [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide against Serbs]], Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[anti-fascist]] [[Croats]]. The Chetniks (mostly [[Serbs]], but also [[Montenegrins]] and others) pursued [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|genocide]]<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtWycwryensC&q=chetnik+genocide&pg=PA430|isbn=978-0-203-89043-1|title=Century of genocide: critical essays and eyewitness accounts|page=430|author1=Samuel Totten|author2=William S.

The Wehrmacht carried out mass executions of civilians in retaliation for resistance activity e.g., the [[Kragujevac massacre]]. [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|SS Division "Prinz Eugen"]] massacred large numbers of civilians and prisoners of war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}} Hungarian occupation troops massacred civilians (mostly Serbs and Jews) during [[Novi Sad raid|a major raid in southern Bačka]], under the pretext of suppressing resistance activities.

Finally, during and after the final stages of the war, Yugoslav authorities and Partisan troops carried out reprisals, including the deportation of the [[Danube Swabian]] population, forced marches and executions tens of thousands of captured soldiers and civilians (predominantly Croats associated with the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], but also Slovenes and others) fleeing their advance (the [[Bleiburg repatriations]]), atrocities against the Italian population in [[Istria]] (the [[Foibe massacres]]) and [[Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45|purges against Serbs, Hungarians and Germans associated with the fascist forces]].

==Background==
Prior to the outbreak of war, the government of [[Milan Stojadinović]] (1935–1939) tried to navigate between the [[Axis Powers]] and the imperial powers by seeking neutral status, signing a non-aggression treaty with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and extending its treaty of friendship with [[Third French Republic|France]]. In the same time, the country was destabilized by internal tensions, as Croatian leaders demanded a greater level of autonomy. Stojadinović was sacked by the regent [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] in 1939 and replaced by [[Dragiša Cvetković]], who negotiated a compromise with Croatian leader [[Vladko Maček]] in 1939, resulting in the formation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]].

However, rather than reducing tensions, the agreement only reinforced the crisis in the country's governance.{{sfn|Trbovich |2008|pages=131–132}} Groups from both sides of the political spectrum were not satisfied: the pro-fascist [[Ustaše]] sought an independent Croatia allied with the [[Axis powers|Axis]], Serbian public and military circles preferred alliance with the Western European empires, while the then-banned [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] saw the [[Soviet Union]] as a natural ally.

After the [[fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940, the UK was the only empire in conflict with the Axis powers, and [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] and the government saw no way of saving [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] except through adopting policies of accommodation with the Axis powers. Although [[Hitler]] was not particularly interested in creating another front in the [[Balkans]], and Yugoslavia itself remained at peace during the first year of the war, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy had [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]] in April 1939 and launched the rather unsuccessful [[Italo-Greek War]] in October 1940. These events resulted in Yugoslavia's geographical isolation from potential [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] support. The government tried to negotiate with the Axis on cooperation with as few concessions as possible, while attempting secret negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Soviet Union]], but those moves would fail to keep the country out of the war.{{sfn|Lampe |2000|page=198}} A secret mission to the US, led by the influential Serbian-Jewish Captain [[David Albala]] with the purpose of obtaining funding to buy arms for the expected invasion went nowhere, while [[Stalin]] expelled Yugoslav Ambassador Gavrilovic just one month after agreeing a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Gorodetsky|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0hGHrq7d4C&pg=PA130 130–]}}

==1941==
Having steadily fallen within the orbit of the Axis during 1940 after events such as the [[Second Vienna Award]], Yugoslavia followed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and formally joined the Axis powers by signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941. Air force officers opposed to the move [[Yugoslav coup d'état|staged a coup d'état]] and took over in the following days. These events were viewed with great apprehension in Berlin, and as it was preparing to help its Italian ally in its war against Greece anyway, the plans were [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|modified to include Yugoslavia]] as well.

===Invasion===
{{Main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumbnail|left|Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia 1941.]]
On 6 April 1941 the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and [[Hungary during World War II|their ally Hungary]].
During the invasion, [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Belgrade was bombed]] by the German air force (''[[Luftwaffe]]''). The [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''), the Yugoslav army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available. Also, large numbers of the population refused to fight, instead welcoming the Germans as liberators from government oppression. However, as this meant each individual ethnic group would turn to movements opposed to the unity promoted by the South Slavic state, two different concepts of resistance emerged, the royalist [[Chetniks]], and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Roberts |1973|page=26}}

Two of the principal constituent national groups, Slovenes and Croats, were not prepared to fight in defense of a Yugoslav state with a continued [[Karađorđević dynasty|Serb monarchy]]. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from units wholly from Serbia itself.{{sfn|Shaw |1973|page=92}} The Serbian General Staff was united on the question of Yugoslavia as a "Greater Serbia" ruled, in one way or another, by Serbia. On the eve of the invasion, there were 165 generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, all but four were Serbs.{{sfn|Shaw |1973|page=89}}

The terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany annexed northern [[Slovenia]], while retaining [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|direct occupation over a rump Serbian state]], and considerable influence over its newly created [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which extended over much of today's [[Croatia]] and contained all of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Mussolini's Italy gained the remainder of Slovenia, [[Kosovo]], coastal and inland areas of the [[Croatian Littoral]] and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all of the [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands and the [[Bay of Kotor]]). It also gained control over the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it; although it did (alongside Germany) maintain a de facto zone of influence within the borders of the [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]]. [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]] dispatched the [[Hungarian Third Army]] to [[Occupation of Vojvodina, 1941-1944|occupy Vojvodina]] in northern Serbia, and later [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|forcibly annexed sections of Baranja, Bačka, Međimurje, and Prekmurje]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |title=Hungary |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070203003152/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/sfa/hungary.html |archive-date=3 February 2007 |url-status=dead |work=Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive |access-date=4 December 2015}}</ref>

[[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|The Bulgarian army]] moved in on 19 April 1941, occupying nearly all of modern-day [[North Macedonia]] and some districts of eastern Serbia which, with Greek western Thrace and eastern Macedonia (the Aegean Province), were annexed by Bulgaria on 14 May.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=24}}

The [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|government in exile]] was now only recognized by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].{{sfn|Talmon |1998|page=294}} The [[Axis powers|Axis]] had recognized the territorial acquisitions of their allied states.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}{{sfn|Lemkin|2008|pages=241–64}}

===Early resistance===
Various military formations more or less linked to the general liberation movement were involved in armed confrontations with Axis forces which erupted in various areas of Yugoslavia in the ensuing weeks. {{quote|In the beginning there had been two resistance movements in Yugoslavia, the Chetniks and the Partisans. The resistance of the Chetniks had lasted only until the autumn of 1941, their leaders then going over to the enemy or returning to passivity.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Introduction}}}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Maribor]], Yugoslavia in 1941. He later ordered his officials "to make these lands German again".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=85}}]]
From the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], a communist-led movement propagating pan-Yugoslav tolerance ("[[brotherhood and unity]]") and incorporating republican, left-wing and liberal elements of Yugoslav politics, on one hand, and the [[Chetniks]], a conservative royalist and nationalist force, enjoying support almost exclusively from the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in occupied Yugoslavia, on the other hand. Initially the Chetniks received recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], while the Partisans were supported by the [[Soviet Union]].

At the very beginning, the Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed, and without any infrastructure. But they had two major advantages over other military and [[paramilitary]] formations in former Yugoslavia:  the first and most immediate advantage was a small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans. Unlike some of the other military and paramilitary formations, these veterans had experience with a modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those found in World War II Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the Partisans likewise drew on the experienced [[TIGR]] members to train troops.

Their other major advantage, which became more apparent in later stages of War, was in the Partisans being founded on a communist ideology rather than [[ethnicity]]. Therefore, they won support that crossed national lines, meaning they could expect at least some levels of support in almost any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations limited to territories with Croat or Serb majority. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.

Although the activity of the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] Partisans were part of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, the specific conditions in Macedonia and Slovenia, due to the strong [[Autonomism (political doctrine)|autonomist]] tendencies of the local communists, led to the creation of separate sub-armies called the [[People's Liberation Army of Macedonia]], and [[Slovene Partisans]] led by [[Liberation Front of the Slovene People]], respectively.

The most numerous local force, besides the four second-line German Wehrmacht infantry divisions assigned to occupation duties was the [[Croatian Home Guard (World War II)|Croatian Home Guard]] (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo''), founded in April 1941, a few days after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) itself. It was done with the authorisation of German occupation authorities. The task of the new Croatian armed forces was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=419}}

The Croatian Home Guard was originally limited to 16 infantry [[battalion]]s and 2 cavalry [[Squadron (army)|squadrons]] – 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 enlisted men.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=12}} Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=420}} 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in [[Zagreb]] and an independent cavalry battalion at [[Sarajevo]]. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=13}} Several regiments of Ustaše militia were also formed at this time, which operated under a separate command structure to, and independently from, the Croatian Home Guard, until late 1944.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=17}} The Home Guard crushed the [[June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina|Serb revolt in Eastern Herzegovina]] in June 1941, and in July they fought in Eastern and Western Bosnia. They fought in Eastern Herzegovina again, when Croatian-Dalmatian and Slavonian battalions reinforced local units.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|page=13}}

The Italian High Command assigned 24 divisions and three coastal brigades to occupation duties in Yugoslavia from 1941. These units were located from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia through to Montenegro and Kosovo.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=10}}

From 1931 to 1939, the Soviet Union had prepared communists for a guerrilla war in Yugoslavia. On the eve of the war, hundreds of future prominent Yugoslav communist leaders completed special "partisan courses" organised by the Soviet military intelligence in the Soviet Union and Spain.{{sfn|Timofejev|2011}} [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Higgins |1966|pages=11–59, 98–151}} On the same day, Yugoslav Partisans formed the [[First Sisak Partisan Detachment|1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]], was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II.{{sfn|Pavličević|2007|pages=441–442}} Founded in the [[Brezovica Forest]] near [[Sisak]], Croatia, its creation marked the beginning of anti-Axis resistance in occupied Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Pavličević|2007|pages=441–442}}

After the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day – a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In the village of [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]], Spanish veteran [[Žikica Jovanović Španac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July 1941, a date that later became known as the "Day of Uprising of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]". On 10 August 1941 in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. Their liberated area, consisting of nearby villages and called the "Miners Republic", was the first in Yugoslavia, and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.

The [[Chetnik movement]] was organised after the surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] by some of the remaining Yugoslav soldiers. This force was organised in the [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] district of western Serbia under Colonel [[Draža Mihailović]]. However, unlike the Partisans, Mihailović's forces were almost entirely ethnic Serbs. He directed his units to arm themselves and await his orders for the final push. Mihailović avoided direct action against the Axis, which he judged were of low strategic importance.

The royalist [[Chetniks]] (officially the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, JVUO), under the command of General Draža Mihailović, drew primarily from the scattered remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, relying overwhelmingly on the ethnic Serbian population for support. They were formed soon after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the surrender of the government on 17 April 1941. The Chetniks were initially the only [[resistance movement]] recognized by the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]] and the Western Allies. The Partisans and Chetniks attempted to cooperate early during the conflict, but this quickly fell apart.

[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1941.png|thumb|Uprising in Yugoslavia, September 1941.]]
In September 1941, Partisans organised [[sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb]].
As the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also [[Seven anti-partisan offensives|seven major Axis operations]] specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].

The [[Operation Uzice|First Anti-Partisan Offensive]] was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the "[[Republic of Užice]]", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.

After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailović, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs.{{sfn|Bailey |1980|p=80}} This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailović advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the Užice attack (see [[First Anti-Partisan Offensive]]), but Britain continued to do so.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+yu0031) LCWeb2.loc.gov]</ref>

On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the [[1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (Yugoslav Partisans)|1st Proletarian Assault Brigade]] (''1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada'') – the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the "Day of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]".

On 15 January 1942, the Bulgarian 1st Army, with 3 infantry divisions, transferred to south-eastern Serbia. Headquartered at [[Niš]], it replaced German divisions needed in Croatia and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=32}}

The Chetniks initially enjoyed the support of the Western Allies (up to the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943). In 1942, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' featured an article which praised the "success" of Mihailović's Chetniks and heralded him as the sole defender of freedom in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Tito's Partisans fought the Germans more actively during this time. Tito and Mihailović had a bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]s offered by Germans for their heads. While "officially" remaining mortal enemies of the Germans and the [[Ustaše]], the Chetniks were known for making clandestine deals with the Italians. The [[Second Enemy Offensive]] was a coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over the [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].

The [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sandžak]] and [[Hercegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]]{{Which|date=June 2019}}, which took place in the summer of 1942.

The Partisans fought an increasingly successful [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the Axis occupiers and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Yugoslavia|local collaborators]], including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators). They enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. [[People's committees]] were organised to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited arms industries were set up.

To gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the decline of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, though supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. In November 1942, Partisan detachments were officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''NOV i POJ'').

==1943==

===Critical Axis offensives===
In the first half of 1943 two Axis offensives came close to defeating the Partisans.  They are known by their German code names [[Case White|Fall Weiss]] ''(Case White)'' and [[Case Black|Fall Schwarz]] ''(Case Black)'', as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav communist historiography.

On 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the [[Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive]] as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from [[Montenegro]] into [[Serbia]] and in the [[Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive]] in Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=32}}

[[German–Yugoslav Partisan negotiations|Negotiations between Germans and Partisans]] started on 11 March 1943 in [[Gornji Vakuf]], Bosnia. Tito's key officers [[Vladimir Velebit]], [[Koča Popović]] and [[Milovan Đilas]] brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions.{{sfn|Lekovic |1985|page=83}}  The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK.{{sfn|Lekovic |1985|page=86,87}} Somewhat later, Đilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations.{{sfn|Tomasevich |1975|page=245}}

In the [[Case White|Fourth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from [[Bihać Republic|western Bosnia]] to northern [[Herzegovina]], culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April, 1943.

[[File:Jugoslavija i Evropa maj 1943.jpg|thumb|Partisan liberated territory in Yugoslavia, May 1943.]]

The [[Case Black|Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (Case Black), immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.

{{quote|In that August of my arrival [1943] there were over 30 enemy divisions on the territory of Jugoslavia, as well as a large number of satellite and police formations of Ustashe and Domobrani (military formations of the puppet Croat State), German Sicherheitsdienst, chetniks, Neditch militia, Ljotitch militia, and others. The partisan movement may have counted up to 150,000 fighting men and women (perhaps five per cent women) in close and inextricable co-operation with several million peasants, the people of the country. Partisan numbers were liable to increase rapidly.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Contact}}}}

The Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske'', or ZNDH), the backbone of which was provided by 500 former [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft.{{sfn|Savić|Ciglić |2002|p=60}} By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=17}}

===Italian capitulation and Allied support for the Partisans===
[[File:Ustanak u Jugoslaviji 1943.png|thumb|Uprising in occupied Yugoslavia after [[capitulation of Italy]], September 1943.]]

On 8 September 1943, the Italians concluded [[armistice of Cassibile|an armistice with the Allies]], leaving 17 divisions stranded in Yugoslavia. All divisional commanders refused to join the Germans. Two Italian infantry divisions joined the Montenegrin Partisans as complete units, while another joined the Albanian Partisans. Other units surrendered to the Germans to face imprisonment in Germany or [[summary execution]]. Others surrendered themselves, arms, ammunition and equipment to Croatian forces or to the Partisans, simply disintegrated, or reached Italy on foot via Trieste or by ship across the Adriatic.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=12}} The Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] was disestablished and the country's possessions were subsequently divided between Germany, which established its [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], and the Independent State of Croatia, which established the new district of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari. The former Italian kingdoms [[Albania under Nazi Germany|of Albania]] and [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|of Montenegro]] were placed under German occupation.

The events which occurred in 1943 would bring about a change in the attitude of the Allies. The Germans were executing [[Case Black|Operation Schwarz]] (Battle of Sutjeska, the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when [[William Deakin|F.W.D. Deakin]] was sent by the British to gather information. His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had transited from the Soviet Union on rail lines through [[Chetniks|Chetnik]]-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. Even though today many circumstances, facts, and motivations remain unclear, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy.

The [[Operation Kugelblitz|Sixth Enemy Offensive]] was a series of operations undertaken by the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Ustaše]] after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in the autumn and winter of 1943/1944.

At this point the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Draža Mihailović]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration by many intelligence-gathering missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.

In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near [[Drvar]] to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.{{sfn|Martin |1946|p=34}}

When the [[AVNOJ]] (the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] wartime council in Yugoslavia) was eventually recognized by the Allies, by late 1943, the official recognition of the Partisan [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] soon followed. The [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]] was recognized by the major Allied powers at the [[Tehran Conference]], when United States agreed to the position of other Allied.<ref>Rendulić, Zlatko. ''Avioni domaće konstrukcije posle drugog svetskog rata'' (Domestic aircraft construction after World War II), Lola institute, Beograd, 1996, p 10. "At the [[Teheran Conference]] of 28 November to 1 December 1943, NOVJ is recognized as an allied army, this time by all three allied sides, and for the first time by the United States."</ref> The newly recognized Yugoslav government, headed by Prime Minister [[Josip Broz Tito]], was a joint body formed of AVNOJ members and the members of the former government-in-exile in London. The resolution of a fundamental question, whether the new state remained a monarchy or was to be a republic, was postponed until the end of the war, as was the status of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]].

Subsequent to switching their support to the Partisans, the Allies set-up the [[RAF Balkan Air Force]] (under the suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces.

==1944==

===Last Axis offensive===
In January 1944, Tito's forces unsuccessfully attacked [[Banja Luka]]. But, while Tito was forced to withdraw, Mihajlović and his forces were also noted by the Western press for their lack of activity.<ref>{{cite journal| date =17 January 1944| title = While Tito Fights| journal = Time Magazine |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796332,00.html| accessdate =14 September 2007 }}</ref>

The [[Seventh Enemy Offensive]] was the final Axis attack in western Bosnia in the spring of 1944, which included ''Operation Rösselsprung'' (Knight's Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate Josip Broz Tito personally and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.

===Partisan growth to domination===

Allied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH ([[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]) and [[Luftwaffe]] bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the [[Operation Rösselsprung (1944)|Seventh Offensive]], including ''Operation Rösselsprung'' in late May 1944. Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will, as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during ''Rösselsprung'' as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full [[Air supremacy|aerial superiority]]. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.{{sfn|Ciglić|Savić|2007|p=113}}

The Yugoslav Partisan movement grew to become the largest resistance force in occupied Europe, with 800,000 men organised in 4 [[field army|field armies]]. Eventually the Partisans prevailed against all of their opponents as the official army of the newly founded [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

In 1944, the Macedonian and Serbian commands made contact in southern Serbia and formed a joint command, which consequently placed the Macedonian Partisans under the direct command of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].<ref>Narodnooslobodilačka Vojska Jugoslavije. Beograd. 1982.</ref> The Slovene Partisans also merged with Tito's forces in 1944.<ref name="McQueen2006">{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=James |editor=Linda McQueen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwBUkHaz76QC |title=Slovenia |publisher=New Holland Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-86011-336-9 |page=15}}</ref>{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|pp=167–168}}

On 16 June 1944, the [[Tito-Šubašić agreement]] between the Partisans and the Yugoslav Government in exile of King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was signed on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. This agreement was an attempt to form a new Yugoslav government which would include both the communists and the [[Monarchism|royalists]]. It called for a merge of the Partisan [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (''Antifašističko V(ij)eće Narodnog Oslobođenja Jugoslavije'', AVNOJ) and the Government in exile. The Tito-Šubašić agreement also called on all Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs to join the Partisans. The Partisans were recognized by the Royal Government as Yugoslavia's regular army. Mihajlović and many Chetniks refused to answer the call. The Chetniks were, however, praised for [[Operation Halyard|saving 500 downed Allied pilots]] in 1944; United States President Harry S. Truman posthumously awarded Mihailović the [[Legion of Merit]] for his contribution to the Allied victory.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ambassador in Yugoslavia (Cannon) to the Secretary of State |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute, United States Department of State |url= https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1948v04/d691}}</ref>

===Allied advances in Romania and Bulgaria===
[[File:Balkanfront 19440831-19441130.png|thumb|Map of German retreat in autumn 1944 (week by week)]]
In August 1944 after the [[Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]] overwhelmed the front line of Germany's [[Army Group South Ukraine]], [[King Michael's Coup|King Michael I of Romania staged a coup]], Romania quit the war, and the Romanian army was placed under the command of the [[Red Army]]. Romanian forces, fighting against Germany, participated in the [[Prague Offensive]]. [[Bulgaria]] quit as well and, on 10 September, declared war on Germany and its remaining allies. The weak divisions sent by the [[Axis powers]] to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In late September 1944 three Bulgarian armies, some 455,000 strong in total led by General Georgi Marinov Mandjev from the village of Goliamo Sharkovo – Elhovo, entered Yugoslavia with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within two months and the 130,000-strong [[Bulgarian First Army]] continued to Hungary.

On 10 September 1944, Bulgaria changed sides and declared war on Germany as an Allied Power. The Germans swiftly disarmed the 1st Occupation Corps of 5 divisions and the 5th Army, despite short-lived resistance by the latter. Survivors retreated to the old borders of Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organised, resulting in a military alliance between them. The new Bulgarian People's Army and the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the old Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 8 October, they entered Yugoslavia. The First and Fourth Bulgarian Armies invaded [[Vardar Macedonia]], and the Second Army south-eastern Serbia. The First Army then swung north with the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front, through eastern Yugoslavia and south-western Hungary, before linking up with the British 8th Army in Austria in May 1945.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=33}}

===Liberation of Belgrade and eastern Yugoslavia===
[[File:1944 Yugoslavia liberated territories.jpg|thumb|right|Territories under Partisan control, September 1944]]
Concurrently, with Allied air support and assistance from the Red Army, the Partisans turned their attention to [[Central Serbia]]. The chief objective was to disrupt railroad communications in the valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers, and prevent Germans from withdrawing their 300,000+ forces from Greece.

The Allied air forces sent 1,973 aircraft (mostly from the US 15th Air Force) over Yugoslavia, which discharged over 3,000 tons of bombs. On 17 August 1944 Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] offered an amnesty to all collaborators. On 12 September, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] broadcast a message from London, calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to "join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito".  The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many of them switched sides to the Partisans.

In September under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, four Bulgarian armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilized. By the end of September, the Red Army ([[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) troops were concentrated at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. In the early October 1944 three Bulgarian armies, consisting of around 340,000-man,<ref name="p. 134">''The Oxford companion to World War II'', Ian Dear, Michael Richard Daniell Foot, Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-860446-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qC0OgOHAHVkC&pg=PA133 p. 134].</ref> together with the [[Red Army]] reentered occupied Yugoslavia and moved from Sofia to [[Niš]], [[Skopje]] and [[Pristina]] to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece.<ref>''Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941–45'', Nigel Thomas, K.

At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia—Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro—as well as most of the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. The Wehrmacht and the forces of the Ustaše-controlled [[Independent State of Croatia]] fortified a [[Syrmian Front|front in Syrmia]] that held through the winter of 1944–45 in order to aid the evacuation of German [[Army Group E]] from the Balkans. To raise the number of Partisan troops Tito again offered the amnesty on 21 November 1944. In November 1944, the units of the Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard were reorganised and combined to form the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=17}}

==1945==
{{quote|Every German unit which could safely evacuate from Yugoslavia might count itself lucky.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=Rules and Reasons}}}}
The Germans continued their retreat. Having lost the easier withdrawal route through Serbia, they fought to hold the Syrmian front in order to secure the more difficult passage through Kosovo, Sandzak and Bosnia. They even scored a series of temporary successes against the People's Liberation Army. They left Mostar on 12 February 1945. They did not leave Sarajevo until 15 April. Sarajevo had assumed a last-moment strategic position as the only remaining withdrawal route and was held at substantial cost. In early March the Germans moved troops from southern Bosnia to support an unsuccessful counter-offensive in Hungary, which enabled the NOV to score some successes by attacking the Germans' weakened positions. Although strengthened by Allied aid, a secure rear and mass conscription in areas under their control, the one-time partisans found it difficult to switch to conventional warfare, particularly in the open country west of Belgrade, where the Germans held their own until mid-April in spite of all of the raw and untrained conscripts the NOV hurled in a bloody war of attrition against the Syrmian Front.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=258}}

On 8 March 1945, a coalition Yugoslav government was formed in Belgrade with Tito as Premier and [[Ivan Šubašić]] as Foreign Minister.

===Partisan general offensive===
On 20 March 1945, the Partisans launched a general offensive in the [[Mostar]]-[[Višegrad]]-[[Drina River|Drina]] sector. With large swaths of Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian countryside already under Partisan guerrilla control, the final operations consisted in connecting these territories and capturing major cities and roads. For the general offensive Marshal Josip Broz Tito commanded a Partisan force of about 800,000 men organised into four [[field army|armies]]: the

* [[2nd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|2nd Army]] commanded by [[Koča Popović]], 
* [[3rd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Army]] commanded by [[Kosta Nađ]],  
* [[4th Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|4th Army]] commanded by [[Petar Drapšin]]. 
In addition, the Yugoslav Partisans had eight independent army corps (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th).

Set against the Yugoslav Partisans was German General [[Alexander Löhr]] of [[Army Group E]] (''[[Army Group E|Heeresgruppe E]]''). This Army Group had seven army corps : 
* [[XV Mountain Corps (Germany)|XV Mountain Corps]], 
* [[XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps|XV Cossack Corps]], 
* [[XXI Mountain Corps (Germany)|XXI Mountain Corps]], 
* [[XXXIV Corps (Germany)|XXXIV Infantry Corps]], 
* [[LXIX Corps (Germany)|LXIX Infantry Corps]], 
* [[LXXXXVII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXXXXVII Infantry Corps]]. 
These corps included seventeen weakened divisions ([[1st Cossack Division|1st Cossack]], 2nd Cossack, [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS]], [[11th Luftwaffe Field Division|11th]] [[Luftwaffe Field Division]], 22nd, [[41st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|41st]], 104th, 117th, 138th, [[181st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|181st]], 188th, 237th, [[297th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|297th]], [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Croat]], [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd Croat]], [[392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|392nd Croat]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Ukrainian)|14th SS Ukrainian Division]]). In addition to the seven corps, the Axis had remnant naval and [[Luftwaffe]] forces, under constant attack by the British [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=9}}

The army of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was at the time composed of eighteen divisions: 13 infantry, two mountain, two assault and one replacement Croatian Divisions, each with its own [[Organic unit|organic]] artillery and other support units. There were also several armoured units. From early 1945, the Croatian Divisions were allocated to various German corps and by March 1945 were holding the Southern Front.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|page=17}} Securing the rear areas were some 32,000 men of the Croatian [[gendarmerie]] (''Hrvatsko Oruznistvo''), organised into 5 Police Volunteer Regiments plus 15 independent battalions, equipped with standard light infantry weapons, including mortars.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=30}}

The [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (''Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske'', or ZNDH) and the units of the [[Croatian Air Force Legion]] (''Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija'', or HZL), returned from service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]]. Although 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH, with aircraft losses amounting to 234, primarily on the ground, it entered 1945 with 196 machines. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. By 10 March, the ZNDH had 23 [[Messerschmitt 109]] G&Ks, three [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]], six [[Fiat G.50]], and two [[Messerschmitt 110]] G fighters.  The final deliveries of up-to-date German [[Messerschmitt 109]] G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in March 1945.{{sfn|Savić|Ciglić|2002|p=70}} and the ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945.{{sfn|Ciglić|Savić|2007|p=150}}

Between 30 March and 8 April 1945, General Mihailović's Chetniks mounted a final attempt to establish themselves as a credible force fighting the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Chetniks under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Pavle Đurišić]] fought a combination of Ustaša and Croatian Home Guard forces in the [[Battle on Lijevča field]]. In late March 1945 elite NDH Army units were withdrawn from the Syrmian front to destroy Djurisic's Chetniks trying to make their way across the northern NDH.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=256}} The battle was fought near Banja Luka in what was then the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and ended in a decisive victory for the Independent State of Croatia forces.

Serbian units included the remnants of the [[Serbian State Guard]] and the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] from the [[Serbian Military Administration]]. There were even some units of the [[Slovene Home Guard]] (''Slovensko domobranstvo'', SD) still intact in [[Slovenia]].{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan |1995|page=22}}

By the end of March, 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy.{{sfn|Shaw |1973|page=101}} The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ambrose, S.|title=The Victors – The Men of World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/victorseisenhowe00step |url-access=registration|location=London|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-684-85629-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/victorseisenhowe00step/page/335 335]}}</ref>

[[Bihać]] was liberated by the Partisans the same day that the general offensive was launched. The 4th Army, under the command of [[Petar Drapšin]], broke through the defences of the [[XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]]. By 20 April, Drapšin liberated [[Lika]] and the [[Croatian Littoral]], including the islands, and reached the old Yugoslav border with Italy. On 1 May, after capturing the Italian territories of [[Rijeka]] and [[Istria]] from the German LXXXXVII Corps, the Yugoslav 4th Army beat the western Allies to [[Trieste]] by one day.

The Yugoslav 2nd Army, under the command of [[Koča Popović]], forced a crossing of the [[Bosna River]] on 5 April, capturing [[Doboj]], and reached the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]].  On 6 April, the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans took [[Sarajevo]] from the German XXI Corps. On 12 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army, under the command of [[Kosta Nađ]], forced a crossing of the [[Drava]] river. The 3rd Army then fanned out through [[Podravina]], reached a point north of Zagreb, and crossed the old Austrian border with Yugoslavia in the [[Dravograd]] sector. The 3rd Army closed the ring around the enemy forces when its advanced motorized detachments linked up with detachments of the 4th Army in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].

Also, on 12 April, the Yugoslav 1st Army, under the command of [[Peko Dapčević]] penetrated the fortified front of the German XXXIV Corps in Syrmia. By 22 April, the 1st Army had smashed the fortifications and was advancing towards Zagreb.

The long-drawn out liberation of western Yugoslavia caused more victims among the population. The breakthrough of the Syrmian front on 12 April was, in [[Milovan Đilas]]'s words, "the greatest and bloodiest battle our army had ever fought", and it would not have been possible had it not been for Soviet instructors and arms.{{sfn|Đilas |1977|page=440}}
By the time General [[Peko Dapčević]]'s NOV units had reached Zagreb, on 9 May 1945, they had perhaps lost as many as 36,000 dead. There were by then over 400,000 refugees in Zagreb.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|page=259}} After entering Zagreb with the Yugoslav 2nd Army, both armies advanced in Slovenia.

===Final operations===
[[File:1945-05-01GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|right| Front lines in Europe 1 May 1945.]]
On 2 May, the German capital city, [[battle of Berlin|Berlin, fell to]] the [[Red Army]]. On 8 May 1945, the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germans surrendered unconditionally]] and the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe officially ended]]. The Italians had quit the war in 1943, the Bulgarians in 1944, and the Hungarians earlier in 1945. Despite the German capitulation, however, sporadic fighting still took place in Yugoslavia. On 7 May, [[Zagreb]] was evacuated, on 9 May, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] were captured by the Partisans, and General [[Alexander Löhr]], Commander-in-Chief of [[Army Group E]] was forced to sign the total surrender of the forces under his command at Topolšica, near [[Velenje]], Slovenia, on Wednesday 9 May 1945. Only the Croatian and other anti-Partisan forces remained.

From 10 to 15 May, the Yugoslav Partisans continued to face resistance from Croatian, and other anti-Partisan forces throughout the rest of Croatia and Slovenia. The [[Battle of Poljana]] started on 14 May, ending on 15 May 1945 at Poljana, near [[Prevalje]] in Slovenia. It was the culmination and last of a series of battles between Yugoslav Partisans and a large (in excess of 30,000) mixed column of German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'') soldiers together with Croatian Ustaše, Croatian Home Guard, Slovenian Home Guard, and other anti-Partisan forces who were attempting to retreat to Austria. [[Battle of Odžak]] was the last World War II battle in Europe.{{sfn|Bušić|Lasić |1983|p=277}} The battle began on 19 April 1945 and lasted until 25 May 1945,{{sfn|Đorić |1996|p=169}} 17 days after the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]].

===Aftermath===
On 5 May, in the town of [[Palmanova]] (50&nbsp;km northwest of Trieste), between 2,400 and 2,800 members of the Serbian Volunteer Corps surrendered to the British.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=451–452}} On 12 May, about 2,500 additional Serbian Volunteer Corps members surrendered to the British at Unterbergen on the [[Drava]] River.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=451–452}} On 11 and 12 May, British troops in [[Klagenfurt]], Austria, were harassed by arriving forces of the Yugoslav Partisans.{{Why|date=December 2015}} In Belgrade, the British ambassador to the Yugoslav coalition government handed Tito a note demanding that the Yugoslav troops withdraw from Austria.

On 15 May 1945 a large column of the Croatian Home Guard, the Ustaše, the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps and the remnants of the Serbian State Guard, and the Serbian Volunteer Corps, arrived at the southern Austrian border near the town of [[Bleiburg]]. The representatives of the Independent State of Croatia attempted to negotiate a surrender to the British under the terms of the [[Geneva Convention]] that they had joined in 1943, and were recognised by it as a "belligerent", but were ignored.{{sfn|Shaw |1973|page=101}} Most of the people in the column were turned over to the Yugoslav government as part of what is sometimes referred to as [[Operation Keelhaul]]. Following the [[Bleiburg repatriations]], the Partisans proceeded to brutalize the [[POW]]s. The Partisans' actions were partly done for revenge as well as to suppress the potential continuation of armed struggle within Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=766}}

On 15 May, Tito had placed Partisan forces in Austria under Allied control. A few days later he agreed to withdraw them. By 20 May, Yugoslav troops in Austria had begun to withdraw. On 8 June, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia agreed on the control of Trieste. On 11 November, [[1945 Yugoslav parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] were held in Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Andrew |title=The Balkans and the West: Constructing the European Other, 1945–2003 |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-351-89422-7 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuJADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT22}}</ref> In these elections the communists had an important advantage because they controlled the police, judiciary and media.

The [[Ustaše]], a Croatian ultranationalist and fascist movement which operated from 1929 to 1945 and was led by [[Ante Pavelić]], gained control of the newly formed [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) that was set up by the Germans after the invasion of Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zander |first1=Patrick G. |title=Fascism through History: Culture, Ideology, and Daily Life [2 volumes] |date=2020 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-440-86194-9 |page=498 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBAFEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA498}}</ref> The Ustaše sought an ethnically pure Croatian state by exterminating [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] from its territory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Redžić |first1=Enver |last2=Donia |first2=Robert |title=Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War |date=2004 |publisher=Routlege |isbn=978-1-135-76736-5 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcqPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11}}</ref> Their main focus were Serbs, who numbered about two million.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wachtel |first1=Andrew |title=Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation: Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia |date=1998 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-804-73181-2 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnISZNM6X6EC&pg=PA128}}</ref> The strategy to achieve their goal was purportedly to kill one-third of Serbs, expel one-third and forcibly convert the remaining one-third.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crnobrnja |first1=Mihailo |title=The Yugoslav Drama |date=1996 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-773-51429-4 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZnagDP3gO4C&pg=PA65}}</ref> The first massacre of Serbs took place on 28 April 1941 in the village of [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]] where nearly 200 Serbs were rounded up and executed.

The Ustaše also set up camps throughout the NDH. Some of them were used to detain political opponents and those regarded as enemies of the state, some were transit and resettlement camps for the deportation and transfers of populations while others were used for the purpose of mass murder.

In April 1941, Italy invaded Yugoslavia, occupying large portions of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia, while directly annexing to Italy the [[Province of Ljubljana|Ljubljana Province]], [[Gorski Kotar]] and Central Dalmatia, along with most Croatian islands. To suppress the mounting resistance led by the [[Slovene partisans|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian Partisans|Croatian]] Partisans, the Italians adopted tactics of "[[summary execution]]s, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments and the burning of houses and villages." <ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rmis/2004/00000009/00000003/art00005 General Roatta's War against the Partisans in Yugoslavia: 1942, IngentaConnect <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

Kočović's research into human losses in Yugoslavia during World War Two was considered to be the first objective examination of the issue.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Danchev |first1=Alex |last2=Halverson |first2=Thomas |title=International Perspectives on the Yugoslav Conflict |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-34924-541-3 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhW_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA133}}</ref> Shortly after Kočović published his findings in ''Žrtve drugog svetskog rata u Jugoslaviji'', Vladeta Vučković, a U.S. based college professor, claimed in a London-based émigré magazine that he had participated in the calculation of the number of victims in Yugoslavia in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sindbaek |first1=Tina |title=Usable History?: Representations of Yugoslavia's Difficult Past from 1945 to 2002 |date=2012 |publisher=ISD LLC |isbn=978-8-77124-107-5 |page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLhYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA188}}</ref> Vučković claimed that the figure of 1,700,000 originated with him, explaining that as an employee of the Yugoslav Federal Statistical Office, he was ordered to estimate the nuber of casualties suffered by Yugoslavia during the war, using appropriate statistical tools.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} He came up with an estimated demographic (not real) population loss of 1.7 million.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} He did not intend for his estimate to be used as a calculation of actual losses.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|page=161}} However, Foreign Minister [[Edvard Kardelj]] took this figure as the real loss in his negotiations with the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} This figure had also already been used by Marshal Tito in May 1945, and the figure of 1,685,000 was used by [[Mitar Bakić]], secretary general of the Presidium of the Yugoslav government in an address to foreign correspondents in August 1945.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} The Yugoslav Reparations Commission had also already communicated the figure of 1,706,000 to the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency in Paris in late 1945.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} This suggests that subsequent estimates had to conform to the predetermined figure.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=723}} Tito's figure of 1.7 million was aimed at both maximizing war compensation from Germany and demonstratting to the world that the heroism and suffering of Yugoslavs during the Second World War surpassed that of all other peoples save only the Soviets and perhaps the Poles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Christopher |title=Yugoslavia's Bloody Collapse: Causes, Course and Consequences |date=1997 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0-81471-288-7 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mQVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45}}</ref>

The reasons for the high human toll in Yugoslavia were as follows:
# Military operations of five main armies (Germans, Italians, [[Ustaše]], [[Yugoslav partisans]] and [[Chetniks]]).{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=744}}
# German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs, who were considered [[Untermensch]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=744}} One of the worst massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the [[Kragujevac massacre]].
# Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war Ustaše collaborators were killed after the [[Bleiburg repatriations]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pages=744–745}}
# The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons. The most numerous victims were Serbs killed by the Ustaše. Croats and Muslims were also killed by the Chetniks. 
# The reduced food supply caused famine and disease.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=748}}
# Allied bombing of German supply lines caused civilian casualties. The hardest hit localities were [[Podgorica]], [[Leskovac]], [[Zadar]] and [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=749}}
# The demographic losses due to a 335,000 reduction in the number of births and emigration of about 660,000 are not included with war casualties.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|page=749}}

;Slovenia
In Slovenia, the [[Institute for Contemporary History, Ljubljana]] launched a comprehensive research on the exact number of victims of World War II in Slovenia in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ds-rs.si/?q=publikacije/zborniki/Zrtve_vojne |title=DS-RS.si |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102638/http://www.ds-rs.si/?q=publikacije%2Fzborniki%2FZrtve_vojne |archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> After more than a decade of research, the final report was published in 2005, which included a list of names. The number of victims was set at 89,404.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ds-rs.si/dokumenti/publikacije/Zbornik_05-1.pdf |title=DS-RS.si |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102550/http://www.ds-rs.si/dokumenti/publikacije/Zbornik_05-1.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> The figure also includes the victims of [[Extrajudicial killing|summary killings]] by the Communist regime immediately after the war (around 13,500 people). The results of the research came as a shock for the public, since the actual figures were more than 30% higher than the highest estimates during the Yugoslav period.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/89-000-zrtev-vojne-in-revolucije/25226 |title=RTVSLO.si}}</ref> Even counting only the number of deaths up to May 1945 (thus excluding the military prisoners killed by the Yugoslav Army between May and July 1945), the number remains considerably higher than the highest previous estimates (around 75,000 deaths versus a previous estimate of 60,000).

There are several reasons for such a difference. The new comprehensive research also included Slovenes killed by the Partisan resistance, both in battle (members of collaborationist and anti-Communist units), and civilians (around 4,000 between 1941 and 1945). Furthermore, the new estimates includes all the Slovenians from Nazi-occupied Slovenia who were drafted in the Wehrmacht and died either in battle or in prisoner camps during the war. The figure also includes the Slovenes from the [[Julian March]] who died in the Italian Army (1940–43), those from [[Prekmurje]] who died in the Hungarian Army, and those who fought and died in various Allied (mostly British) units. The figure does not include victims from [[Venetian Slovenia]] (except of those who joined the Slovenian Partisan units), nor does it include the victims among [[Carinthian Slovenes]] (again with the exception of those fighting in the Partisan units) and [[Hungarian Slovenes]]. 47% percent of casualties during the war were partisans, 33% were civilians (of which 82% were killed by Axis powers or Slovene home guard), and 20% were members of the Slovene home guard.<ref>Delo, ''Sobotna priloga'', 30 October 2010.</ref>

;Territory of the NDH
According to Žerjavić's research on the losses of the Serbs in the NDH, 82,000 died as members of the Yugoslav Partisans, and 23,000 as Chetniks and Axis collaborators. Of the civilian casualties, 78,000 were killed by the Ustaše in direct terror and in camps, 45,000 by German forces, 15,000 by Italian forces, 34,000 in battles between the Ustaše, the Chetniks, and the Partisans, and 25,000 died of typhoid. A further 20,000 died in the [[Sajmište concentration camp]].{{sfn|Žerjavić |1993}} According to [[Ivo Goldstein]], on NDH territory 45,000 of Croats are killed as Partisans while 19,000 perishing in prisons or camps.<ref>Bideleux, Robert; Jeffries, Ian (2017) ''The Balkans: A Post-Communist History'' p. 191; Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-13458-328-7}}</ref>

Žerjavić estimated the structure of the actual war and post-war losses of Croats and Bosniaks. According to his research, 69–71,000 Croats died as members of the NDH armed forces, 43–46,000 as members of the Yugoslav Partisans, and 60–64,000 as civilians, in direct terror and in camps.{{sfn|Geiger|2012|p=116}} Outside of the NDH, a further 14,000 Croats died abroad; 4,000 as Partisans and 10,000 civilian victims of terror or in camps. Regarding Bosniaks, including [[Islam in Croatia|Muslims of Croatia]], he estimated that 29,000 died as members of the NDH armed forces, 11,000 as members of the Yugoslav Partisans, while 37,000 were civilians and a further 3,000 Bosniaks were killed abroad; 1,000 Partisans and 2,000 civilians. Of the total Croat and Bosniak civilian casualties in the NDH, his research showed that 41,000 civilian deaths (18,000+ Croats and 20,000+ Bosniaks) were caused by the Chetniks, 24,000 by the Ustaše (17,000 Croats and 7,000 Bosniaks), 16,000 by the Partisans (14,000 Croats and 2,000 Bosniaks), 11,000 by German forces (7,000 Croats and 4,000 Bosniaks), 8,000 by Italian forces (5,000 Croats and 3,000 Bosniaks), while 12,000 died abroad (10,000 Croats and 2,000 Bosniaks).{{sfn|Geiger|2012|pp=117–118}}

Individual researchers who assert the inevitability of using identification of casualties and fatalities by individual names have raised serious objections to Žerjavić's calculations/estimates of human losses by using standard statistical methods and consolidation of data from various sources, pointing out that such an approach is insufficient and unreliable in determining the number and character of casualties and fatalities, as well as the affiliation of the perpetrators of the crimes.{{sfn|Geiger|2012|p=103}}

In Croatia, the Commission for the Identification of War and Post-War Victims of the Second World War was active from 1991 until the Seventh Government of the republic, under Prime Minister [[Ivica Račan]] ended the commission in 2002.<ref>[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/308886.html 66 7.6.2002 Zakon o prestanku važenja Zakona o utvrđivanju ratnih i poratnih žrtava II. svjetskog rata], narodne-novine.nn.hr</ref> In the 2000s, concealed mass grave commissions were established in both [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia|Serbia]] to document and excavate mass graves from the Second World War.

===German casualties===
According to German casualty lists quoted by [[The Times]] for 30 July 1945, from documents found amongst the personal effects of General [[Hermann Reinecke]], head of the Public Relations Department of the German High Command, total German casualties in the Balkans amounted to 24,000 killed and 12,000 missing, no figure being mentioned for wounded. A majority of these casualties suffered in the Balkans were inflicted in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Davidson|loc=The sixth offensive}} According to German researcher [[Rüdiger Overmans]], German losses in the Balkans were more than three times higher – 103,693 during the course of the war, and some 11,000 who died as Yugoslav prisoners of war.{{sfn|Overmans|2000|p=336}}

===Italian casualties===
The Italians incurred 30,531 casualties during their occupation of Yugoslavia (9,065 killed, 15,160 wounded, 6,306 missing). The ratio of dead/missing men to wounded men was uncommonly high, as Yugoslav partisans would often murder prisoners. Their highest losses were in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 12,394. In Croatia the total was 10,472 and in Montenegro 4,999. Dalmatia was less bellicose: 1,773. The quietest area was Slovenia, where the Italians incurred 893 casualties.<ref>The South Slav Journal. Volume 6. 1983. Page 117</ref> An additional [[Military history of Italy during World War II#Casualties|10,090 Italians died]] post-armistice, either killed during [[Operation Achse]] or after joining Yugoslav partisans.
