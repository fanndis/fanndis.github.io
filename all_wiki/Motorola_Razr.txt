The V3 was the first phone released in the series and was introduced in July 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/018358/more-motorola-razr-v3-pics|title=More Motorola RAZR V3 Pics|last=Joel|date=|website=gizmodo.com}}</ref> and released in the market in the third quarter of 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title = Motorola embraces the ethos of cool |work = NBC News |date=  April 11, 2006 |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7432916 |accessdate = December 22, 2006 }}</ref> The V3 model was followed soon thereafter by the improved V3i, including a collaboration with [[Apple Inc.]] for [[iTunes]] to be built-in. It was launched in 2005.

Because of its unique appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone. However, within a year, its price was lowered and as a result, it sold over 50 million units by July 2006. Leading up to the release, Motorola's cell phone division sales were stagnant and losing money. The success of the Razr made the division profitable again.<ref>{{cite pressrelease | url=https://www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail.jsp?globalObjectId=7031_6980_23 | title=Motorola Ships 50 Millionth MotoRazr | date=July 18, 2006}}</ref> Over the Razr's four-year run, the V3 model sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/picture-galleries/9818080/The-20-bestselling-mobile-phones-of-all-time.html?frame=2458999 The 20 bestselling mobile phones of all time].

The series was marketed until 2013.

On November 14, 2019, Motorola again revived the Razr brand, this time for an Android-based foldable smartphone styled after the original Razr, which carried the [[Motorola Razr (2020)|same name]].<ref name="Gartenberg">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963294/motorola-razr-new-foldable-smartphone-android-hands-on-flip-phone-photos-video|title=Motorola resurrects the Razr as a foldable Android smartphone|last=Gartenberg|first=Chaim|date=2019-11-13|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref><ref name="engadget.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019/|title=Motorola's revived RAZR is a fashion-forward foldable|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>

==V3==
[[File:Black-RAZRV3-closed.jpg|thumbnail|right|Black RAZR V3]]

The '''V3''' was first released in Q3 2004. The team of the V3 put together a number of design choices that set the device apart from the competition. The phone had the thinnest profile at the time on a clamshell set, sported an [[electroluminescent]] keypad made out of a single metal wafer and used an industry-standard [[USB hardware#Connector types|mini-USB]] port for data, battery charger and headphones, housed in an [[aluminum]] body with an external glass screen. It sold 130 million units during its lifespan, being the [[list of best-selling mobile phones|best selling clamshell phone]] to date.<ref>{{cite news| work=CNN | date=May 31, 2006 | title=Razr edge | first=Adam | last=Lashinsky}}</ref>

Some owners complained about dust accumulating between the V3's plastic screen and LCD glass, possibly through an external side button.  Access to the dust requires peeling off the plastic cover, usually followed by a replacement cover.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modding the Motorola Razr V3 &#124; razr mods &#124; Razr Software Upgrading&nbsp;— Cleaning the Dust from the LCD |publisher=Themotoguide.com |date= }}</ref>

===Matte Black version===
A black version was produced for distribution in the [[77th Academy Awards]] gift bags,<ref>{{cite news

  | first = Margaret
  | title = Oscar goody bags looking Razr sharp
  | work = [[CNET|CNET News.com]]
  | date=  January 31, 2006
  }}</ref> and was released in early May 2005. While distribution was initially limited to specific carriers in North America, the black V3 was widely available elsewhere.

===Hot pink versions===
The first pink version was released in October 2005, and as of June 2006, was available in the United States from T-Mobile (as Razr V3 Magenta, after the [[T-Mobile]]—and its parent, [[Deutsche Telekom]]'s—corporate color, but called Razr V3 Pink in other countries, including other T-Mobile networks), Verizon, Cingular Wireless, [[Suncom Wireless]], Cellular One from Dobson Cellular Systems (each in a different shade). It was available in Canada from [[Bell Canada|Bell]], [[Rogers Wireless]] and [[Telus Mobility|Telus]], and in the United Kingdom from [[T-Mobile UK|T-Mobile]] and [[Carphone Warehouse]]. $25 of sales from the Rogers-branded pink V3 went to Rethink Breast Cancer. It was also available in all [[Movistar]]-serviced countries and [[Claro Americas|Claro]] ([[Telcel]]).

===MS500===
Another version of this phone was released in [[South Korea]] on June 1, 2005. This version has a similar physical appearance as the original V3 but instead of using the [[GSM]] standard, it uses [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]] to operate on [[SK Telecom]]. It is the first CDMA version of the Razr without the expandable memory, Bluetooth, and SIM card, since Motorola Korea's system was able to produce its own model before worldwide GSM format release. It has a 1.3-megapixel camera, video recording, 80&nbsp;MB of internal memory, and a variety of UI features, such as a mobile blog, Yoga graphic book, Diet diary, and [[lottery]] number generator for Wellness theme. It also comes in colors other than those mentioned above. Black, pink, and lime models are seen around Korea. On February 8, 2006 [[Motorola]] [[Korea]] released its own slide-phone model for the Razr named Z model name MS600.  Unlike most other versions, the MS500 version is packaged with a charging dock and has three metal terminals on the backside immediately under the battery cover.

Also, as the add-on to the MS600, MS500 Lime Razr has been in circulation in South Korea since October 2006 along with the Motorola KRZR Black and [[Motorola KRZR]] Fire (Red).

===V3re===
The Razr V3re (also known as V3_06) is a GSM model that has been updated to support EDGE and Crystal Talk technology. It is nearly identical to the original V3, having no memory card slot and including a VGA 4x zoom camera. It can be identified by a slightly larger notch under the Motorola logo when closed,<ref>{{cite web |title=About the V3re |publisher=Hack The Razr |url=https:// |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> a black matte Motorola logo in the battery cover instead the metallic silver logo in the V3 and a software version starting with R3442A. It is available in North America from [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] in the US, Rogers/Fido in Canada and [[Vivo (telecommunications)|Vivo]] in Brazil (using both 850&nbsp;MHz frequency and 1800&nbsp;MHz). It was available in three colors: Orchid Pink, Silver, and Stone Grey.

==V3r/V3t==
The V3r and V3t are models sold by [[T-Mobile]], [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T (formerly Cingular)]], and Canadian cellular services such as Rogers Wireless. These models are virtually identical to the V3 and V3i, except they use [[Motorola]]'s Digital Audio Player instead of iTunes k. T-Mobile's V3r offers a Voice Notes feature which permits forwarding audio recordings to voicemail as the only storage method. However, a publicly available SEEM edit permits users to enable the hidden Voice Records feature. Voice Records allows users to save voice recordings locally to phone memory. Currently, Voice Records is limited to less than two minutes of audio recording and stores the resulting records as .avr format files on the partition within phone memory. In contrast, currently available SEEM edits can expand the maximum size of video recordings.

T-Mobile V3t phone memory is 10.0&nbsp;MB total, including all system files. This space is divided unevenly into a and c partitions. Memory on partition a is larger than 2&nbsp;MB and contains system files, including some of the branding images for the phone carrier. {{not a typo|Partition a}} also contains the avr structure for the hidden Voice Records feature. Partition c is larger than 5.5&nbsp;MB and stores user data, including images, sounds, videos, text notes, calendar entries, phone book entries, Java applets, and web cache. V3r and V3t phones sold by T-Mobile come equipped with Java-based software that supports T-Mobile's "MyFaves" rate plan. Publicly available third-party tools can remove this Java software and other system or locked files to free memory for other uses.

Canada's Rogers Wireless also carries them for a reduced price compared to the original Razrs.

The '''V3i''' was announced in November 2005 and addresses some of the faults of the original Razr V3, including a better (1.23-megapixel) camera with 8x digital zoom, an improved external and internal display, also support for [[microSD]] cards of up to 512&nbsp;Mb maximum. V3i is functionally very close to [[Motorola]] [[V635]] model. The V3i comes in two versions: one with iTunes and one with Motorola's Digital Audio Player (DAP).<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Motorola]] | title = Motorola Razr V3i | year = 2006 | url = https://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=130 | accessdate = January 20, 2007 }}</ref> The [[iTunes]] version of the phone has a 50 or 100 song limit restriction ("cap") depending on where the phone model was made.<ref>{{cite news

It was announced on December 8, 2005, that Motorola had teamed up with [[Dolce & Gabbana]] to produce a Special Edition Gold Razr V3t. Only 1,000 of these have been made and sold for a premium price. The launch of the V3i phone comes with the supplied battery a "BR50". Technology has since evolved; Motorola has launched a much improved and longer-lasting battery, the "BR56". A recommended initial charge of the "BR56" for over eight hours to obtain its benefits.

On June 1, 2006, Motorola and Dolce & Gabbana once again released their limited edition gold phone. This model includes a D&G cell phone holder, a signature leather pouch, [[Bluetooth]] headphones, and FM earphones. It was available from all major [[Motorola]] retailers and select D&G boutiques.

The V3i is available in the following colors:
* Silver Quartz (main color)
* Gunmetal Grey
* Gold Plate (special edition DG version only, see above)
* Dark Blue
* Maroon
* Violet
* Orchid
* Black for (PRODUCT)<sup>RED</sup> (special edition to tie in with the [[(PRODUCT) RED]] initiative)
* Platinum
* Red
* Chrome Green
* Chrome Purple
* Celery (some companies call it Lime Green instead)
The [[Motorola]] Razr V3i was released to most worldwide markets in the Q4 of 2005–2006. In the U.S. the phone was released through Cingular Wireless on September 6, 2006, with a new activation price of $299, while T-Mobile released the Dolce & Gabbana V3i exclusively in the United States.

===V3im===
The V3im is the [[iTunes]] version of the Razr V3i available in the UK market with a 100-song cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://direct.motorola.com/eng/web_producthome.asp?Country=GBR&language=ENG&productid=30519 |title=Motorola United Kingdom&nbsp;— Razr V3im&nbsp;— Cell Phones |publisher=Direct.motorola.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2009}}</ref>

==V3c==
On November 21, 2005, a [[CDMA2000]] version of the Razr, known as the Razr V3c, became available to Alltel and SaskTel users. [[Verizon Wireless]] followed suit on December 7, 2005. Unlike models for Alltel and other carriers, Verizon's V3c features a proprietary user interface and disables, in software, Bluetooth file transfer capabilities (called [[OBEX]]). (Although OBEX is supported in Verizon's V3c firmware version .02, and version .04 if flash-upgraded directly from .02, skipping any install of .03.)

In January 2006, Canadian [[Telus]], [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Aliant Mobility]], Venezuelan carriers [[Movistar]] and [[CANTV|Movilnet]], and Brazilian [[Vivo (mobile phone network)|Vivo]] began carrying the V3c. In April 2006 [[Cricket Communications]] began selling the V3c.  The handset was also made available for Metro PCS.  The Razr V3c supports CDMA 2000 1xRTT and 1xEV-DO third-generation wireless technologies. This is the technology Verizon Wireless uses to provide its [[V CAST]] multimedia service.

The coverage of this feature, however, may not be available everywhere. [[US Cellular]] and [[Alaska Communications Systems]], Alaska's CDMA provider, also carry the V3c. It also has approximately 41.2 MB of internal memory, although only about 36 MB is available for use. The V3c does not support expansion with a memory card.

The original version of the V3c was charcoal gray, and a light pink version called Satin Pink (different from the GSM Magenta/Pink and the AT&T Cotton Candy versions) was released by Verizon Wireless in January 2006. Telus Mobility, Bell, Aliant, and Vivo also carry pink versions of the V3c.

==V3m==
V3m is a [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] version of the Razr. As an upgrade to the V3c, it features a [[microSD]] card slot for up to 2 [[Gigabytes|GB]] of memory expansion, a longer-lasting battery, and 40&nbsp;MB of internal memory. The V3m came in silver, pink, and red although the original release, as well as models that used to be available on the Sprint CDMA network, featured the gunmetal gray color of the V3c.  For a limited time Alltel and US Cellular offered a Fire Red color.  This model is not available in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as they use GSM, not CDMA, although the [[Motorola Razr V3x|V3x]] is on sale there.

Due to many Sprint customers complaining about less than expected battery life, Motorola offered free high-capacity batteries to Sprint customers who contacted Motorola's customer service line with battery life complaints.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Verizon Wireless version===
[[File:Razor2000ppx.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Verizon Wireless version of the Razr]]
[[Verizon Wireless]] disabled certain features on the V3m including the ability to transfer data files to and from the phone via [[Bluetooth]] (a specific protocol called [[OBEX]]). [[Verizon]] has also blocked the transfer of most data over [[USB]], such as ringtones. These phones also run [[Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless]] (BREW), which signs each application to the phones [[Electronic Serial Number]], or ESN, thus preventing the use of free applications (including Back-Up Assistant). The equivalent models offered by competitors (such as the V3t by [[T-Mobile]]) still retain these features.

The V3m on [[Verizon]] will play .WMA formatted music files placed in the my_music directory of the removable memory chip, but although the telephone will accept a 2 GB memory chip, only a portion ( ~ 600 Mbytes) can be accessed by the music player.  Stereo headphone playback can be achieved with a miniature USB to 3.5&nbsp;mm phone jack adapter containing the appropriate interface circuitry; adapters designed for hands-free handset operation may not work.

[[Verizon]] also installs their own user interface instead of the default [[Motorola]] interface that they used to use in the past. This has led to many [[Verizon Wireless]] users to resort to using their own artificial means of reverting their phones back to an original [[Motorola]] condition, or to that of a Verizon phone that has some of the disabled features enabled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mark.cdmaforums.com/Monster2.htm |title=Mark_Venture's Verizon Phone Info Page |publisher=Mark.cdmaforums.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 2, 2009}}</ref> A newer Verizon version of the phone has been upgraded and features limitless video capture, easier laid out menu system and the ability to customize the external screen. The phone is still unable to sync to a computer via USB cable for anything other than charging, unless software such as [[Bitpim]] is used to access files.

===Red V3m===
Partnering with Motorola, US Cellular and Sprint released a special [[Product Red]] Razr and [[Bluetooth]] H500 headset to help support [[Global Fund]] programs which positively impact the lives of women and children affected by [[HIV/AIDS]] in [[Africa]]. Also in the UK there is a [[Product Red]] V3i, Slvr, and [[Bluetooth]] H3 headset.

Announced in March 2005, the '''V3x''' was formerly known as the Motorola V1150. Externally, it appears to be a larger V3, albeit with enhancements such as a 2.0-megapixel camera. Internally, it is quite different, utilizing a different microprocessor, chipset, an [[Nvidia]] GoForce 4200 GPU, and radio ICs. As a 3G product, its feature set is closer to that of phones such as the [[Motorola V980]], e.g., two cameras instead of the single camera typical on GSM or CDMA products.

However one of the main attractions of the Razr V3, the fact that it is very thin, is no longer present in the V3x; although it was the smallest phone available in the UK on the [[Hutchison 3G|3]] network at the time of release, compared to other contemporary phones, it was only average-sized. It won the "Best 3GSM handset" at the 2006 [[3GSM World Congress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/mobilephones/ontheradar/0,39050922,39311054,00.htm |title=Motorola's Razr V3x gets "Best 3GSM Handset" award&nbsp;— Mobile Phones&nbsp;— Crave&nbsp;— CNET Asia |publisher=Asia.cnet.com |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227032343/http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/mobilephones/ontheradar/0,39050922,39311054,00.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In [[Japan]], a 3G(W-CDMA) [[NTT DoCoMo]] version of the V3x was released in late August 2006. This version has [[IrDA]].

==V3xx==
Announced in July 2006, the V3xx is a 3G Category 5/6 (3.6 Mbit/s) [[HSDPA]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] supported handset. It is extremely similar in appearance to the compact V3i design, but incorporates an improved feature set with a 1.3-megapixel camera in place of the 1.23-megapixel, 50 MB of internal memory, support for [[microSD]] and [[Bluetooth]] [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|A2DP]]. Like the V3x, it is also equipped with a secondary screen and a higher resolution 240x320 pixel ([[Quarter VGA|QVGA]]) main screen.<ref>{{cite news | title = Motorola Razr V3xx | work = GSM Arena | date=  December 20, 2006 | url = http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_v3xx-1648.php | accessdate = September 10, 2006 }}</ref>
The V3xx was made available for purchase internationally on the [[Hutchison 3G|3]] network in November 2006 and is now available on AT&T (formerly Cingular) for free with a new 2-year contract. The secondary camera is not available in the United States.  The built-in [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], manufactured by [[Nvidia]] (model [[GoForce]] 4800) is capable of rendering 3D images through [[OpenGL ES]]. The phone includes a much faster CPU as well, making the performance of all features, including 3G/Data much more real-time. Menuing delays common to the slower V3 platform are gone. With the new CPU, the V3xx Phone also includes a fast USB V2.0 for rapid ringtone/image/mp3 file downloads. Older V3's were limited to USB V1.1.

Unlike with the V3 and V3i which were both quad-band GSM, and thus worked equally well on any GSM network in the world, the V3xx comes in different variants depending on the local frequency bands used for GSM and UMTS/HSDPA. The North American V3xx is Tri-band (850&nbsp;MHz/1800&nbsp;MHz/1900&nbsp;MHz) GSM and dual-band  (850&nbsp;MHz/1900&nbsp;MHz) UMTS/HSDPA, whereas the version sold in Europe and Asia is tri band (900&nbsp;MHz/1800&nbsp;MHz/1900&nbsp;MHz) GSM and single-band (2.1&nbsp;GHz) UMTS/HSDPA. This is likely due to the need to fit the internal components of the V3xx into a small casing; as of early 2007 global phones that support quad-band GSM and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA are considerably bulkier than the V3xx.

The '''M702iS''' version was released as the NTT DoCoMo version of the V3xx which does not have GSM, HSDPA but rather IrDA.<ref>[http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/product/foma/702i/m702is/index.html NTT DoCoMo FOMA M702iS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627064743/http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/product/foma/702i/m702is/index.html |date=June 27, 2007 }}</ref>

====AT&T Wireless====
The Razr maxx V6 (European Version) will not work with [[AT&T]]'s HSDPA network for it lacks the 850/1900&nbsp;MHz [[W-CDMA]] bands. Alternately, prototype versions of the maxx are [[quadband]] phones featuring the 850/900/1800/1900&nbsp;MHz bands.

====Telstra Australia====
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
{{outdated section|date=October 2014}}
This handset has been released on [[Telstra]]'s [[NextG]] network under the original name "Motorola Razr maxx V6". This phone features compatibility with both the original 2100&nbsp;MHz band and the newer [[NextG]] band, 850&nbsp;MHz. It should therefore also be capable of roaming to the AT&T 850&nbsp;MHz HSDPA network. The front of the phone is branded with the Telstra logo and on-screen presentation graphics have a Telstra theme. The phone was released by Telstra for outright purchase in late 2006 at a price of about A$800.  However, the phone has been plagued with hardware and software reliability problems that are well documented in Australian phone discussion forums.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} It has not sold well and Telstra now{{when|date=October 2014}} owns a large inventory of unsold stock.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The phone was repackaged late in 2007 and sold with a prepaid plan for $250, locked for use only with Telstra SIM cards. Many of the post-paid phones sold by Telstra in 2007 were inadvertently locked.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

====Hutchison 3====
This handset has been released on [[Hutchison Whampoa|Hutchison]]'s [[Hutchison 3G|3]] network under the original name "Motorola Razr maxx V6". The back of the phone is branded with the 3 logo, also have the customized home screen, internal memory is increased to 60 MB, the phone startup screen is modified, and on-screen presentation graphics have a 3 theme.

===maxx Ve===

====Verizon Wireless====
The Razr maxx Ve is available exclusively in the United States for Verizon Wireless customers. The maxx Ve features EV-DO instead of HSDPA and CDMA2000 1x instead of GSM/UMTS.

Additionally [[Motorola]] had released pictures on its website of the Verizon version. The original version has a 2.0-megapixel camera with [[LED]] flash, a large {{convert|2.2|in|mm|adj=on}} screen with 240x320 [[Quarter VGA|QVGA]] display (like the V3xx) and 50 megabytes of internal storage.<ref>{{cite news

This phone was available in Australia from [[Telstra]] on their 850&nbsp;MHz Next G network.

The Verizon Wireless version became available on April 24, 2007.

The Verizon Wireless version, the Razr maxx Ve, did not have the second camera on the inside of the phone. Instead, there was a shutter button for focusing and picture taking. The Ve featured Verizon's menu system but is said to support OBEX profiles, unlike Verizon's current Razr V3m.

Some versions feature Motorola's [[MotoMagx]] operational platform, based on the MontaVista [[Linux]] OS. The Razr2 was made available on every US carrier, and EVDO, GSM and HSDPA versions of it were released by late 2007. The Razr2 line consisted of 4 models: V8, V9, V9m, and V9x.
The phone improved picture quality, speed, and multimedia capabilities over the original Razr. It also featured an external screen with touch-sensitive buttons which allowed users to use some of the phone features without opening the flip, and Motorola's CrystalTalk technology to improve call quality and help reduce background noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/crystaltalk/|title=motorola US - unlocked cell phones & modular smartphones|author=|date=|website=direct.motorola.com}}</ref> Different color variants were released, including a Luxury Edition and a [[Ferrari]] Edition.

==Droid Razr==
The Razr brand returned in 2011 with the introduction of the Motorola [[Droid Razr]] smartphone (the "Droid" name only used by [[Verizon]] in the USA), featuring a striking thin body like the original Razr V3 had. The line included:

==Cultural impact==
Being the slimmest phone during its release in 2004, the Razr easily stood out amongst other phone models. It was one of the most popular mobile phones since its first release, having been spotted in the hands of celebrities and business people alike until the advent of [[smartphones]], and it is frequently seen in reruns of movies and TV shows.

It was also a token piece in the popular modernized board game ''[[Monopoly Here & Now]]''.

===In popular culture===
The Razr became identified as a "fashion" product and an iconic cell phone in the mid-2000s.<ref name="icon">{{citation |date=June 26, 2006 |title=The World's Most Iconic Cell Phones |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/06/26/mobile-razr-brick_cx_df_0626cellicon.html |first=Dan |last=Frommer |work=Forbes |accessdate=January 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120916094702/http://www.forbes.com/2006/06/26/mobile-razr-brick_cx_df_0626cellicon.html |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Razr was used in several television shows and featured in several movies. In the 2006 film ''[[A Good Year]]'', Russell Crowe's character Max Skinner used a BlackBerry whilst working as a high-flying London financier, but chose a black Razr to accompany his later laid-back life in rural Provence. Notable TV occasions were the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|season three finale]] of the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in which [[Jack Shephard]] used a Razr (an important plot point which anchors the episode's chronology), the HBO hit sitcom [[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]] had characters specifically Ari Gold using it, and the US hit series ''[[Burn Notice (TV series)|Burn Notice]]'' in which [[Michael Westen]] used a Razr until 2009. In Season 5 of 24, President Charles Logan used a Razr as his personal cell phone.  Contestants on the NBC adventure reality show "Treasure Hunters" were given Razrs for communication with the host and each other throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web| date = July 11, 2006| url =https://www.today.com/popculture/treasure-hunters-copying-amazing-race-wbna13689218| title = Is 'Treasure Hunters' copying 'Amazing Race'? | publisher = Today.com| accessdate =August 21, 2007}}</ref> The [[Product Red]] edition of the Razr was launched by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Bono]] for charity.<ref>{{cite web| date = October 12, 2006| url =http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/10/12/red.razr.and.ipod.nano/| title = iPod nano, Motorola Razr to go Red for charity | publisher =MacNN| accessdate =August 21, 2007}}</ref> A grey-coloured V3 was also used by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' during outtakes when he got a call at the start of the show. Even in 2012, the Razr was used as CIA-special agent [[Rex Matheson]]'s phone in the 4th season of ''[[Torchwood]]''.
It was popularised in South [[India]] through the movie ''[[Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006 film)|Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu]]'', in which [[Kamal Haasan]] was seen using the phone. In the computer game [[Counter-Strike: Source]], the character Leet can be seen holding one. In ''[[Prison Break]]'' Series, [[Alexander Mahone]] used the Motorola V3. Also, in the 2006 film '' [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', characters played by [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] used Moto Razr phones.

In the 2017 Square Enix game [[Life is Strange: Before the Storm]], the main character's phone is a Motorola RAZR, decorated with stickers. Also the flip-phone Motorola in general was mentioned by Kevin Bacon in the funny parody song Lola by the Kinks he sang with Jimmy Fallon in the latters Tonight show.
