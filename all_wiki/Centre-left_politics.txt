{{Party politics}}
'''Centre-left politics''' ([[British English]]) or '''center-left politics''' ([[American English]]), also referred to as '''moderate-left politics''', are political views that lean to the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] on the [[left–right political spectrum]], but closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] than other left-wing politics. Those on the centre-left believe in working within the established systems to improve [[social justice]].<ref>[[Oliver H. Woshinsky]]. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 146.</ref> The centre-left promotes a degree of social equality that it believes is achievable through promoting [[equal opportunity]].<ref name="Oliver">Oliver H. Woshinsky. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 143.</ref> The centre-left emphasizes that the achievement of equality requires personal responsibility in areas in control by the individual person through their abilities and talents as well as social responsibility in areas outside control by the person in their abilities or talents.<ref>Chris Armstrong. ''Rethinking Equality: The Challenge of Equal Citizenship''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 89.</ref>

The centre-left opposes a wide gap between the rich and the poor and supports moderate measures to reduce the economic gap, such as a [[progressive income tax]], laws prohibiting [[child labour]], [[minimum wage]] laws, laws regulating working conditions, limits on working hours and laws to ensure the workers' right to organize.<ref name="Oliver"/> The centre-left typically claims that complete [[equality of outcome]] is not possible, but instead that equal opportunity improves a degree of equality of outcome in society.<ref name="Oliver"/>

In [[Europe]], the centre-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]], [[Green politics|greens]] and the [[Christian left]]. Some [[Social liberalism|social liberals]] are described as centre-left, but many social liberals are in the centre of the [[political spectrum]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.columbia.edu/pub/papers/CioffiHopner.pdf|title=Interests, Preferences, and Center-Left Party Politics in Corporate Governance Reform|author=John W.

== Positions associated with the centre-left ==
The main ideologies of the centre-left are [[social democracy]], [[social liberalism]] (sometimes, when paired with other ideologies; can also be considered [[Centrism|centrist]]), [[progressivism]], [[democratic socialism]] (moderate forms) and [[green politics]] (also can take place under a [[red–green alliance]] when cooperating with other parties on the left).
 
Throughout the world, centre-left groups generally support:
* A [[mixed economy]] consisting of both publicly owned or subsidized programmes of education, universal health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.
* A system of [[social security]], with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the general public against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement (national Insurance contributions)
* Government bodies that regulate [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labour rights (eg. supporting worker access to [[trade unions]], [[Co-determination|workers participation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer protections]] and fair market competition).
* A system of [[progressive taxation]] that includes [[tax breaks]] and [[subsidies]] for those under poverty extended from government.
* A [[value-added tax]] (or occasionally a [[wealth tax]]) to fund government expenditures.
* Government investments and spending, for example in [[public works]], and [[Keynesian economics]].

The term may be used to imply positions on the [[environmentalism|environment]], religion, public morality, etc., but these are usually not the defining characteristics, since centre-right parties may sometimes take similar positions on these issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c6d8bdc0-af89-11de-ba1c-00144feabdc0.html|title=Europe's centre-left suffers in the squeezed middle|author=John Lloyd|date=2 October 2009|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref> A centre-left party may or may not be more concerned with reducing industrial emissions than a centre-right party<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workerspower.com/index.php?id=161,1608,0,0,1,0|title=Spotlight on pollution and the environment|date=8 May 2008|publisher=Workers Power|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2009/pizarchik-11-06-2009.html|title=Dirty Coal Czar Confirmed by Senate|date=6 November 2009|author=Tierra Curry|publisher=Center for Biological Diversity|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref> if not explicitly adhering to a green ideology.

The term "centre-left" appeared during the French "[[July Monarchy]]" in 1830s,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BS2z3iGPCigC&q=centre-left+adolphe+thiers&pg=PA742|title=The Transformation of European Politics, 1763-1848|author=[[Paul W. Schroeder]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Claredon]]|date=1996|page=742|isbn=9780198206545}}</ref> a political-historical phase during the [[Kingdom of France]] when the [[House of Orléans]] reigned under an almost [[parliamentary system]]. The centre-left was distinct from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], composed of [[Republicanism in France|republicans]], as well as the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], composed of the Third Party and the liberal-conservative [[Doctrinaires]].

During this time, the centre-left was led by [[Adolphe Thiers]] (head of the liberal-nationalist [[Movement Party (France)|Movement Party]]) and [[Odilon Barrot]], who headed the [[populist]] "Dynastic Opposition".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTZaCwAAQBAJ&q=centre-left+adolphe+thiers&pg=PA14|title=Tocqueville, Democracy and Social Reform|author=Michael Drolet|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|date=11 August 2003|page=14|isbn=9780230509641}}</ref> The centre-left was [[Orléanist]], but supported a liberal interpretation of the [[Charter of 1830]], more power to the [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], [[manhood suffrage]] and support to [[Nationalism#19th century|rising European nationalisms]]. Adolphe Thiers served as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] for King [[Louis Philippe I]] twice (in 1836 and 1840), but he then lost the King's favour, and the centre-left rapidly fell.<ref>{{cite book|title=100 fiches d'histoire du XIXe siècle|author1=Alice Primi|author2= Sophie Kerignard|author3=Véronique Fau-Vincenti|publisher=Bréal|date=2004}}</ref>

In France, during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] the centre-left was not strong or organised, but became commonly associated with the [[Moderate Republicans (France)|moderate republicans]]' group in Parliament. Finally, in 1871 the Second Empire fell as consequence of the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and Adolphe Thiers re-established the centre-left after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This time the centre-left was constituted of moderate republicans, then called "[[Opportunist Republicans|Opportunists]]", anti-royalist [[liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] and radicals from the [[Republican Union (France)|Republican Union]]. During the Third Republic, the centre-left was led by political and intellectual figures like [[Jules Dufaure]], [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]], [[Charles de Rémusat]], [[Léon Say]], [[William Waddington]], [[Jean Casimir-Perier]], [[Edmond Henri Adolphe Schérer]] and [[Georges Picot]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Léon Say et le centre gauche: 1871-1896 : la grande bourgeoisie libérale dans les débuts de la Troisième République|author=Unknown|date=1993|page=196}}</ref>

Elsewhere in Europe, centre-left movements appeared from the 1860s, mainly in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. In Italy, the centre-left was born as coalition between the liberal [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]] and the progressive [[Urbano Rattazzi]], the heads respectively of the [[Historical Right|Right]] and [[Historical Left|Left]] groupings in Parliament. This alliance was called "''connubio''" ("marriage") for its opportunist characteristics.<ref>{{cite book|title=Histoire de l'Europe contemporaine: le XIXe siècle (1815-1919)|author1=Serge Berstein|author2=Pierre Milza|publisher=[[Hatier]]|date=1992}}</ref> In the 1900s, centre-left positions were expressed by people and parties who believed in [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], but also some liberals or [[Christian democracy|Christian-democrat]]s were associated with the centre-left. Currently, the centre-left parties in Europe are united in the social democratic [[Party of European Socialists]] and ecologist [[European Green Party]].

Despite the rise of centre-left politics in continental Europe, Britain and its colonies, along with the United States, only saw the rise of the centre-left in the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The prevalence of the position occurred mainly due to the rise of [[socialism]] caused Liberals to move away from ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies to more [[Interventionism (economics)|interventionist]] policies, which created the [[Social Liberalism#History|New Liberal]] movement.
