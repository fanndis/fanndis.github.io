A '''sobriquet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|b|r|ᵻ|k|eɪ}} {{respell|SOH|bri-kay}}), or '''soubriquet''', is a [[nickname]], sometimes assumed, but often given by another, that is descriptive in nature. Distinct from a [[pseudonym]], a sobriquet is typically a familiar name used in place of a real name, without the need of explanation, often becoming more familiar than the original name.

The term ''sobriquet'' may apply to the nickname for a specific person, group of people, or place. Examples are "Emiye Menelik", a name of Emperor [[Menelik II]] of [[Ethiopia]], who was popularly and affectionately recognized for his kindness ("emiye" means "mother" in [[Amharic]]); "[[Genghis Khan]]", who now is rarely recognized by his original name Temüjin; and "Mohandas Gandhi", who is better known as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] ("mahatma" means "great soul" in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]]). Well-known places often have sobriquets, such as [[New York City]], often referred to as the "[[Big Apple]]".

== Etymology ==

The modern [[French language|French]] spelling is {{lang|fr|sobriquet}}. Two early variants of the term are found: {{lang|fr|soubriquet}} and {{lang|fr|sotbriquet}}. The first early spelling variant, "soubriquet", remains in use and is considered the likely origin. 

The second early spelling variant suggests derivation from the initial form {{lang|fr|sot}}, foolish, and the second part, {{lang|fr|briquet}}, is a French adaptation of Italian {{lang|it|brichetto}}, diminutive of {{lang|it|bricco}}, knave, possibly connected with {{lang|it|briccone}}, rogue, which is supposed to be a derivative of the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|brechen}}, to break; but the [[philologist]] [[Walter William Skeat]] considers this spelling to be an example of [[false etymology]]. The real origin is to be sought in the form {{lang|fr|soubriquet}}.

[[Émile Littré]] gives an early-fourteenth-century ''soubsbriquet'' as meaning a chuck under the chin, and this would be derived from ''soubs'', mod. ''sous'' ({{lang-la|sub}}), under, and ''briquet'' or ''bruchel'', the brisket, or lower part of the throat.

== Use ==

Sobriquets often are found in music, sports, comedy and politics. Candidates and political figures often are branded with sobriquets, either while living or posthumously. For example, [[president of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] came to be known as "Honest Abe".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/honest-abe-wasnt-always-quite-so-honest-180962194/ |title=When Lincoln Was More a Politician Than an "Honest Abe" |last=Mansky |first=Jackie |work=Smithsonian |access-date=2017-09-26}}</ref> Sobriquets are also combined with [[epithet]]s and descriptive names to illuminate the defining traits of a character in the literature of the Bible.<ref>[[James L. Resseguie]], ''Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary'', (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2009), 173.</ref> For example, Satan's description in Revelation 12:9 uses sobriquets and epithets: "That great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world...was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."

In the ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) [[Henry Watson Fowler]] warned: "Now the sobriquet habit is not a thing to be acquired, but a thing to be avoided; & the selection that follows is compiled for the purpose not of assisting but of discouraging it." He included the sobriquet among what he termed the "battered ornaments" of the language, but opinion on their use varies. Sobriquets remain a common feature of speech today.
