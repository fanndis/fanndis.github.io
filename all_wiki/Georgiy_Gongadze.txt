==Biography==
===Early years and fall of the Soviet Union===
[[File:Kiew gedenktafel journalisten.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|A memorial plate in Kyiv listing journalists who were killed while reporting.]]
Born in [[Tbilisi]], at the time the capital of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Gongadze was the son of a Georgian architect Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian dentist Olesya Korchak (a native of [[Lviv]]).<ref name=fwtj>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161116171137/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2003/09/16/2995436/ From a warrior to a journalist (Від бійця до журналіста)].

During his school years, Giya was an outstanding athlete and was part of the Soviet reserve Olympic team in sprint on 100 and 200 meters.<ref name=fwtj/> In his childhood Giya was growing up in multi-language environment speaking in Russian, Georgian, and English in school and Ukrainian at home.<ref name=fwtj/> In 1986 Giya enrolled in the Foreign Languages Institute in [[Tbilisi]] with specialization in [[English language]], but in 1987 he was already drafted in the [[Soviet Army]] serving in [[Turkmenistan]] on the border with [[Iran]].<ref name=fwtj/> His mother said that she had to pay to avoid for Georgiy to be sent to [[Afghanistan]] ([[Soviet–Afghan War]]).<ref name=fwtj/> During that time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] started his reforms [[perestroika]] along with liberalization of censorship ([[glasnost]]).<ref name=fwtj/> The process only sped up the process of [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=fwtj/> Trying to stop the process and preserve the Soviet state, several armed and civil conflicts arose in the [[Soviet Union]] among which was the [[April 9 tragedy]] (Soviet troops killed 20 unarmed civilians)<ref name=fwtj/> which radicalized many Georgians including Georgiy Gongadze.<ref name=fwtj/>

In May 1989 Giya returned from the army.<ref name=fwtj/> Both Ruslan Gongadze and his son Georgiy Gongadze joined the National Movement "For free Georgia" where Georgiy was its spokesperson, while Ruslan Gongadze became the leader.<ref name=fwtj/> In 1989-90 Georgiy traveled to the [[Baltic states]] and [[Ukraine]] trying to find extra public support and rally more allies in the struggle to free Georgia from the Soviet Union.<ref name=fwtj/> As part of his tour, in September 1989 Georgiy attended the first congress of the [[National Movement of Ukraine]] ([[People's Movement of Ukraine]]) in [[Kyiv]] where he represented the Georgian organization.<ref name=fwtj/> Georgiy also attended the first non-communist music and youth festival [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] that in September 1989 was taking place in [[Chernivtsi]].<ref name=fwtj/> At the festival he met with Mariana Stetsko whom he married in 1990 and settled in [[Lviv]].<ref name=fwtj/> There Georgiy found a job as a teacher of [[English language]] and physical culture (fitness instructor).<ref name=fwtj/> While working, Gongadze also studied at the Romano-Germanic languages Faculty of [[Lviv University|Ivan Franko National University]].<ref name=fwtj/> On 24 August 1991 the [[Ukrainian parliament]] announced that all residents of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] are considered to be citizens of Ukraine ([[Ukrainian citizenship]]).<ref name=fwtj/>

{{see also|Georgian Civil War|War in Abkhazia (1992–93)}}
In 1991 the first [[President of Georgia]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] announced several of his former allies as "enemies of people" among which was the father of Georgiy Gongadze.<ref name=fwtj/> Ruslan Gongadze was forced to hide in a basement of a building next to the parliament in [[Tbilisi]].<ref name=fwtj/> In December 1991 a civil war ensued when government forces opened fire upon anti-Gamsakhurdia protestors in [[Tbilisi]], while a militia armed by the oppositional parties counter-attacked.<ref name=fwtj/> At the end of 1991 during the ongoing war Georgiy Gongadze returned to his mother in [[Tbilisi]] along with "Kalashnikov" saying, "Mom, I arrived to protect the name and honor of my father".<ref name=fwtj/> Giya was not using the rifle and led a team of medical emergency services transferring wounded to a hospital until snipers opened fire on medics.<ref name=fwtj/> On 14 January 1992 [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] fled [[Tbilisi]] and struggle ended.<ref name=fwtj/> The power was taken by the opposition and a new president was elected.<ref name=fwtj/> It was [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], the former Soviet Foreign Minister<ref name=fwtj/> and Communist leader of Soviet Georgia. On 15 January 1992 Georgiy Gongadze returned to [[Lviv]] where he found out that his wife left him.<ref name=fwtj/>

In 1992 Gongadze founded a Georgian Culture Association in Lviv which was named after the Georgian Prince [[Bagrationi]] and served as an informational center.<ref name=fwtj/> During the registration of the organization in government offices, Gongadze met Myroslava Petryshyn his future second wife.<ref name=fwtj/> Both of them wrote an article "Tragedy of leaders" ({{lang-uk|Трагедія лідерів}}) about the Georgian Civil War that was published in the Lviv newspaper "Post-Postup" in 1992.<ref name=fwtj/> Later in 1992 Gongadze returned to Tbilisi again to visit his mother who continued to work in a hospital as a nurse.<ref name=fwtj/> At the time he had intentions to leave active politics and started an own business.<ref name=fwtj/> But after speaking with several people changed his mind, while his mother was encouraging him to write about the victims of the civil war in Georgia.<ref name=fwtj/> Gongadze received a camera from his mother and filmed a documentary about the civil war in Georgia "The pain of my land" ({{lang-uk|Біль моєї землі}}).<ref name=fwtj/> In February 1993 the film was shown on the Ukrainian channel UT-3.<ref name=fwtj/> During that period in 1992 Abkhazia and South Osetia proclaimed their independence and Georgia accused Russia in instigating conflicts in those regions.<ref name=fwtj/> Soon new conflicts started.<ref name=fwtj/>

===Russian intervention to Georgia and journalism in Ukraine===
Gongadze volunteered to war in [[Abkhazia]], but was refused to be admitted to military service by the government authorities and offered for being a son of Ruslan Gongadze and a Ukrainian citizen to provide propaganda agitation in Ukraine.<ref name=fwtj/> Georgiy returned to [[Lviv]] to perform his "diplomatic mission" in an active support of Georgia in inter-ethnic conflict.<ref name=fwtj/> At that time in Ukraine he only was able to find a marginal group of UNA-UNSO that were ready to dedicate itself to the Georgian cause.<ref name=fwtj/> Gongadze was visiting UNA-UNSO gatherings to find recruits for fighting in Georgia.<ref name=fwtj/> UNA-UNSO that had for its goal "to exile communists and criminals from Ukraine and overpower the Russian expansionism" seemed to be coinciding with Georgian nationalists.<ref name=fwtj/> In July 1993 the UNA-UNSO battalion "Argo" led by [[Dmytro Korchynsky]] arrived to [[Tbilisi]] and was ready for fight in [[Abkhazia]].<ref name=fwtj/>

{{see also|UNA-UNSO}}

Gongadze did not return to Georgia with UNA-UNSO, but rather stayed back in Ukraine as his father Ruslan Gongadze became ill with cancer and in March 1993 the government of Georgia send him to [[Ukraine]] for recovery.<ref name=fwtj/> Georgiy moved to [[Kyiv]] and stayed with his father.<ref name=fwtj/> Ruslan Gongadze did not survive and died on 5 August 1993 at age 49.<ref name=fwtj/> With the body of his father, Georgiy Gongadze returned to [[Tbilisi]].<ref name=fwtj/> After burying his father, Gongadze started to film a new documentary about the Ukrainian fighters in Abkhazia, funds for which he obtained from selling his "Kalashnikov" rifle.<ref name=fwtj/> With the ongoing war that started in August 1992, the separatist forces supported by Russia took over most of Abkhazia and surrounded administrative center of Abkhazia, [[Sukhumi]].<ref name=fwtj/> In September 1993 in exchange for a cease fire, the government of Georgia agreed to pull its troops and heavy armament from Sukhumi.<ref name=fwtj/> However, instead of cease fire the separatists started to assault the city.<ref name=fwtj/> The city was protected by an army of irregular detachments.<ref name=fwtj/> The president of Georgia [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] who also was present during the siege appealed to the [[President of Russia]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to stop the attack, but Yeltsin chose to ignore it.<ref name=fwtj/>

On 17 September 1993 Gongadze left Tbilisi for Sukhumi to film the events.<ref name=fwtj/> Upon arrival, he was mobilized later that night and the following morning was at the frontlines along the [[Gumista River]] where the enemy was conducting the main assault.<ref name=fwtj/> Gongadze was in a trench when over his head blew up an artillery shell.<ref name=fwtj/> Shrapnel hit him in 26 places including his right hand.<ref name=fwtj/> From imminent death he was saved by a steel helmet.<ref name=fwtj/> Two other people that stood next to him perished.<ref name=fwtj/> Those shards of shell forever were left inside of his body; and later were used to identify his dead body.<ref name=fwtj/> About him being wounded, it was mentioned in a report from Sukhumi that was published in a Russophone Tbilisi newspaper "Svobodnaya Gruzia" on 21 September 1993.<ref name=fwtj/> Gongadze was right away taken to a field hospital where he turn attention to himself by requesting to return from the battlefield his bag with [[video cassette]]s.<ref name=fwtj/> That fact recalled the local militant Konstantin Alania also known as Koba who later became his friend for life.<ref name=fwtj/> The cassettes were recovered by volunteers.<ref name=fwtj/> The same Saturday night Gongadze and several other seriously wounded were sent to Tbilisi on a plane not long before the separatists occupied the city.<ref name=fwtj/> Koba was left behind continue fighting and later managed to escape with some other militants withdrawing through mountain corridors.<ref name=fwtj/> In 1995 he left Georgia for [[Lviv]] where by an accident met again with Georgiy.<ref name=fwtj/>

In Tbilisi Gongadze continued with a treatment in a military hospital tended by his mother.<ref name=fwtj/> However the worst situation was with food due to the situation in the country.<ref name=fwtj/> His mother tried to send her son away from Georgia, but did not have enough money as the government did not pay the hospital staff since December 1991.<ref name=fwtj/> Olesya Gongadze managed to raise some funds through friends and relatives and after spending two weeks in the hospital Georgiy flew away to [[Lviv]] in October 1993.<ref name=fwtj/> Olesya Gongandze stayed behind.<ref name=fwtj/> In Ukraine Georgiy created a new documentary out of his video cassettes that was shown on the Ukrainian television "Shadows of war".<ref name=fwtj/> He married Myroslava and in 1997 the couple had two daughter-twins.<ref name=fwtj/>

In 1996-1997 Gongadze worked for the Ukrainian television channel [[STB (TV channel)|STB]]. He worked for the [[Kyiv]]-based radio station Kontynent, on which he had his own show called ''First round with Heorhiy Gongadze''. His strongly independent line soon attracted hostility from the increasingly authoritarian government of Leonid Kuchma; during the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|October 1999 presidential election]], his commentaries prompted a call from Kuchma's headquarters to say "that he had been blacklisted to be dealt with after the election." In 1999 he was a spokesman for the [[Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine]] [[Nataliya Vitrenko]]. Visiting New York in January 2000 with other Ukrainian journalists, he warned of "the strangulation of the freedom of speech and information in our state."

In April 2000, Gongadze co-founded a news website, ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' (''Ukrainian Truth''), as a means of sidestepping the government's increasing influence over the mainstream media. He observed that following the muzzling of a prominent pro-opposition newspaper after the election, "today there is practically no objective information available about Ukraine". The website specialized in political news and commentary, focusing particularly on President Kuchma, the country's wealthy "oligarchs" and the official media.

In June 2000, Gongadze wrote an open letter to Ukraine's chief prosecutor about harassment from the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]], the Ukrainian secret police, directed towards himself and his ''Ukrayinska Pravda'' colleagues and apparently related to an investigation into a murder case in the southern port of [[Odessa]]. He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, that he said he and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/932310.stm|work=BBC News | title=Outspoken Ukraine journalist missing|date=19 September 2000|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Georgiy's mother died in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rudenko|first=Olga|title=Gongadze's mother dies at 69|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gongadzes-mother-dies-at-69-332695.html|accessdate=30 November 2013|newspaper=Kiyv Post|date=30 November 2013}}</ref>

==Disappearance and investigations==
Gongadze disappeared on 16 September 2000, after failing to return home. Foul play was suspected from the outset. The matter immediately attracted widespread public attention and media interest. Eighty journalists signed an open letter to President Kuchma urging an investigation and complaining that "during the years of Ukrainian independence, not a single high-profile crime against journalists has been fully resolved." Kuchma responded by ordering an immediate inquiry. This was, however, viewed with some skepticism. Opposition politician Hryhoriy Omelchenko reported that the disappearance had coincided with Gongadze receiving documents on corruption within the president's own entourage. The Ukrainian Parliament set up a parallel inquiry run by a special commission. Neither investigation produced any results.

Two months later, on 3 November 2000, a body was found in a forest in the [[Taraschanskyi Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]) of the [[Kyiv Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), some {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside Kyiv near the city of [[Tarashcha]]. The corpse had been decapitated and doused in [[dioxine]], apparently to make identification more difficult; forensic investigations found that the dioxine bath and decapitation had occurred while the victim was still alive. The Russian-edited, Russian-language Ukrainian newspaper ''[[Sevodnya]]'' ("Today") reported that Gongadze had been abducted by policemen and accidentally shot in the head while seated in a vehicle, necessitating his decapitation (to avoid the bullet being recovered and matched to a police weapon). His body had been doused in petrol which had failed to burn properly, and had then been dumped.<ref>[http://eng.for-ua.com/news/?id=197 ForUm: Breaking Ukrainian News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321103304/http://eng.for-ua.com/news/?id=197 |date=21 March 2005 }}</ref> A group of journalists first identified it as being that of Gongadze, a finding confirmed a few weeks later by his wife Myroslava. In a bizarre twist, the corpse was then confiscated by the [[militsiya|police]] and resurfaced in a morgue in Kyiv. The authorities did not officially acknowledge that the body was that of Gongadze until the following February and did not definitively confirm it until as late as March 2003. The body was eventually identified and was to be returned to Gongadze's family to be buried two years after his disappearance. However, the funeral never took place. As of 23 June 2006 Gongadze's mother refused to accept the remains offered as it was not the body of her son.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://www.ostro.org/shownews_ks.php?id=27076&lang=ru Мать Гонгадзе отказывается хоронить выданное ей тело и «устраивать похороны чужих останков»]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} // Остров – Новости.</ref> While visiting Kyiv in July 2006, Gongadze's widow Myroslava emphasized that the funeral had now become a solemn family issue and the date of the funeral would soon be appointed.

On 28 November 2000, opposition politician [[Oleksandr Moroz]] publicized secret tape recordings which he claimed implicated President Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. The recordings were said to be of discussions between Kuchma, presidential chief of staff [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]], and [[MVS (Ukraine)|Interior Minister]] [[Yuriy Kravchenko]], and were claimed to have been provided by an unnamed [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] officer (later named as Major [[Mykola Mel'nychenko]], Kuchma's bodyguard). The conversations included comments expressing annoyance at Gongadze's writings as well as discussions of ways to shut him up, such as deporting him and arranging from him to be kidnapped and taken to [[Chechnya]]. Killing him was, however, not mentioned and doubt was cast on the tapes' authenticity, as the quality of the recordings was poor. Moroz told the Ukrainian [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament) that "the professionally organized disappearance, a slow-moving investigation, disregard for the most essential elements of investigation and incoherent comments by police officials suggest that the case was put together."

In September 2001, the American [[Private investigator|detective agency]] [[Kroll Inc.]], contracted by the pro-Kuchma political party [[Labor Ukraine]], had  carried out a six-month investigation and concluded that then-President Leonid Kuchma had nothing to do with the murder of Gongadze.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/66589/ Cabinet involves U.S. Trout Cacheris in auditing activity of previous Cabinet], [[Kyiv Post]] (13 May 2010)</ref><ref>[https://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/8152/print/ Private eyes could probe corpse case], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 March 2001)</ref>

The affair became a major political scandal (referred to in Ukraine as the "[[Cassette Scandal]]" or "Tapegate"). Kuchma strongly denied Moroz's accusations and threatened a [[libel]] suit, blaming the tapes on foreign agents. He later acknowledged that his voice was indeed one of those on the tapes, but claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NI1G_9j1AhcC&pg=PA504#v=onepage&q=Kuchma%20edited Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004] ([[Europa Publications]]), [[Routledge]], 12 December 2003, {{ISBN|1-85743-187-1}} (page 504)</ref>

In November 2005, upon complaint of Gongadze's widow, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found Ukraine to violate right to life, right to effective remedy and prohibition of degrading treatment.<ref>[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=788827&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR jugdgment on application No. 34056/02]</ref>

==Crises and controversy==
The affair became an international crisis for the Ukrainian government during 2001, with the [[European Union]] expressing dissatisfaction at the official investigation, rumors of Ukrainian suspension from the [[Council of Europe]], and censure from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], which described Gongadze's death as a case of "censorship by killing" and castigated the "extremely unprofessional" investigation.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1169896.stm |work=BBC News|title=Ukraine's 'censorship killing'|date=14 February 2001|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> [[Ukraine without Kuchma|Mass demonstrations]] erupted in Kyiv in February 2001, calling for the resignation of Kuchma and the dismissal of other key officials. He did sack the head of the SBU, [[Leonid Derkach]], and the chief of the presidential bodyguard, Volodymyr Shepel, but refused to step down.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The government invited the US [[FBI]] to investigate, though it does not appear that this offer was ever taken up. The protests were eventually forcibly broken up by the police.

In May 2001, interior minister [[Yuriy Smirnov (minister)|Yuriy Smirnov]] announced that the murder had been solved—it was attributed to a random act of violence committed by two "[[hooligans]]" with links to a gangster called "Cyclops". Both of the killers were said to now be dead. The claim was dismissed by the opposition and by the government's own prosecutor-general, whose office issued a statement denying Smirnov's claims.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1336002.stm |work=BBC|title=Judge denies journalist's murder solved|date=17 May 2001|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Mass protests again broke out in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities in September 2002 to mark the second anniversary of Gongadze's death. The demonstrators again called for Kuchma's resignation but the protests again failed to achieve their goal, with police breaking up the protesters' camp.

The prosecutor of the Tarascha district, where Gongadze's body was found, was convicted in May 2003 for abuse of office and falsification of evidence. Serhiy Obozov was found guilty of forging documents and negligence in the investigation and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. However, he was immediately released due to a provision of Ukraine's amnesty laws.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3007275.stm|work=BBC|title=Ukraine official sentenced over journalist murder|date=7 May 2003|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

In June 2004, the government claimed that a convicted gangster identified only as "K" had confessed to Gongadze's murder, although there was no independent confirmation of the claim. The ongoing investigation received a setback when a key witness died of spinal injuries apparently sustained while in police custody.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3827859.stm|work=BBC News|title='Killer admits' Gongadze murder|date=21 June 2004|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Gongadze's death became a major issue in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]], in which the opposition candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] pledged to solve the case if he became president. Yushchenko did become president following the subsequent [[Orange Revolution]] and immediately launched a new investigation, replacing the country's prosecutor-general.

The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] adopted on 27 January 2009 Resolution 1645 on the investigation of crimes allegedly committed by high officials during the [[Kuchma]] rule in Ukraine – the Gongadze case as an emblematic example. This Resolution calls on the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office to use all possible avenues of investigation to identify those who instigated and organised the murder of Giorgiy Gongadze.<ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta09/ERES1645.htm  PACE Resolution 1645 (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220205507/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta09%2FERES1645.htm |date=20 February 2009 }}</ref>

==Arrests and trials==
{{see also|Myroslava Gongadze v. Ukraine}}

===Arrest and trial of three former policemen and death of Kravchenko===
On 1 March 2005, Yushchenko announced that the journalist's suspected killers had been arrested.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4308681.stm|work=BBC|title='Gongadze killers' held by police|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> Prosecutor-General [[Svyatoslav Piskun]] announced the following day that the case had been solved, telling Ukrainian television that Gongadze had been strangled by employees of the Interior Ministry. Two of the alleged killers were said to be senior policemen working for the Interior Ministry's criminal investigations directorate (CID).<ref>http://www.rferl.org/reports/corruptionwatch/2005/03/2-040305.asp</ref> Former Interior Minister [[Yuri Kravchenko]], one of those recorded with Leonid Kuchma in the [[Cassette Scandal]], was also said to be under investigation. The two police colonels accused of the killing have been detained and a third senior policeman, identified as CID commander Oleksiy Pukach, was being sought on an international arrest warrant.

On 4 March, Yuri Kravchenko was found dead in a [[dacha]] in the elite residential area of Koncha-Zaspa, outside Kyiv. He had died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though some speculated that he might have been assassinated to prevent him from testifying as a witness. Hryhory Omelchenko, who chaired the parliamentary committee that investigated the Gongadze case, told the ''New York Times'' that Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to abduct Gongadze on President Kuchma's orders. Kuchma himself has denied this allegation but has since been interviewed by investigators. Kravchenko left an alleged suicide note: “My dear ones, I am not guilty of anything. Forgive me, for I became a victim of the political intrigues of President Kuchma and his entourage. I am leaving you with a clear conscious, farewell."<ref name=KP/>

In April/May 2005, Piskun released more details of the ongoing investigation. He told the press that after Gongadze was murdered, a second group disinterred him and re-buried him where he was eventually found, in the constituency of Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz. According to Piskun, the aim was to undermine the government (led by Viktor Yushchenko when he was still Prime Minister). The second group was part of or allied with the [[United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine]] (SDPUo), a pro-oligarch grouping which had been hit hard by Yushchenko's crackdown on corruption and therefore wanted to see his government toppled. According to the journal ''Ukrayina moloda'' (14 April 2005), the SDPUo moved Gongadze in order to discredit President Leonid Kuchma and force early elections, which could have led to party leader Medvedchuk succeeding Kuchma.

The trial against the three former policemen charged with the killing of Georgiy Gongadze started on 9 January 2006. The other main suspect, ex-police officer, Oleksiy Pukach was believed to have fled abroad and therefore charged but not on trial. No-one had been [[indictment|charged]] for ordering the murder. On the day the trial started Gongadze's [[widow]] [[Myroslava Gongadze]] commented on the fact that no-one has been charged for the killing: "They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today".

In mid March 2008, the three former police officers were sentenced to prison for the actual act of murder of Gongadze. Mykola Protasov was given a sentence of 13 years, while Valeriy Kostenko and Oleksandr Popovych were each handed 12-year terms. But so far the investigations have failed to show who ordered the murder.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7298422.stm|work=BBC| title=Ukraine journalist killers jailed|date=15 March 2008|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

===Charges against Leonid Kuchma===

On 24 March 2011 Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder.<ref name="econ1">{{Cite journal|title=Ukraine's ex-president: Catching Kuchma|journal=The Economist|volume=399|issue=8727|page=25|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|date=2–8 April 2011|url=http://www.economist.com}}</ref> The decision prompted mixed reaction among the public. Former [[Ukrainian prime-minister|Prime Minister]] and the leader of the main [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc|opposition party]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] argued that Kuchma's arrest was no more than a PR stunt designed to distract people from their economic woes and prop up President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s sagging popularity.<ref name="econ1"/> Another theory was that Yanukovych was driven by the desire for revenge on Kuchma, who often humiliated Yanukovych and refused to use force to stop the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004.<ref name="econ1"/> Political analysts suggested that Yanukovych's "display of justice" could also be aimed at winning credit from the West, which has criticised him for usurping power and squeezing out democracy.<ref name="econ1"/>

A literary token of respect for the work and courage of Gongadze is to be found in the novel for young adults, "Fair Game: The Steps of Odessa" (Spire Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1-897312-72-5}}) by James Watson. The book is dedicated to Giya Gongadze, but the theme, of a persecuted journalist and the impact of his revelations about government corruption on his football-playing daughter, Natasha, and his son Lonya, has strong similarities to Gongadze's own fate.

In [[Kyiv]] and [[Lviv]] ceremonies marking the disappearance of Gongadze were held on 16 September 2010 (ten years after his disappearance).<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/82591/ Residents of Kyiv, Lviv to mark Gongadze murder on 16 Sept.], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 September 2010)</ref>
