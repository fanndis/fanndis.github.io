"'''G.U.Y.'''" (an acronym for "Girl Under You") is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). She co-wrote and co-produced the song with [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]]. It debuted on Italian radio as the album's third single on March 28, 2014. "G.U.Y." was developed while Gaga was touring with [[Born This Way Ball]], and was recorded a number of times for the final version. It is an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] track containing elements of [[industrial music|industrial]], [[contemporary R&B]], and [[house music]] whose lyrics address a number of subjects like sexual dominance, submission, and gender roles.

"G.U.Y." received mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who complimented the composition of the track and Gaga's vocals, but criticized its lyrics and production. The song debuted on the record charts of a few countries, but failed to enter the top ten in most of them. In the United States, "G.U.Y." became one of Gaga's lowest charting singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], peaking at number 76. It reached the top ten on Bulgarian airplay chart, the ''Billboard'' Greek Digital Songs chart, and the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart.

The music video for the song was shot at [[Hearst Castle]], located near [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]]. The video featured reality TV show stars like ''[[The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', and works of artist Nathan Sawaya and ''[[Minecraft]]'' [[YouTuber]] SkyDoesMinecraft. Running for over 11 minutes, the video shows Gaga as a wounded [[fallen angel]] who is revived by her followers in a pool. Once rejuvenated, she takes revenge on the men who hunted her and replaces them with clones known as G.U.Y. The video received positive reviews for its visuals and its references to [[Greek mythology]]. Gaga has performed "G.U.Y." at her [[Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom|seven-day concert residency]] at [[Roseland Ballroom]] in March 2014 and on her [[ArtRave: The Artpop Ball]] tour; in both places she emulated the choreography from the music video on stage, and received positive critical response. Gaga also performed the song on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] on April 2 of the same year.

==Background and development==
[[File:Zedd 2014 Divergent Premiere (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] ''(pictured)'' co-wrote and produced "G.U.Y."]]
Development of Gaga's third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'', began shortly after the release of her second one, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011), and by the following year, the record was already being recorded.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=Shewey|first=Don|date=July 30, 2013|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|title=Lady Gaga's 'ARTPOP': What We Know So Far|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127124958/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|archive-date=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="albumname">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Says Next Album Is 'Beginning to Flourish'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=December 6, 2011|access-date=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012002950/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2013}}</ref> "G.U.Y." was confirmed in an interview with ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'' magazine where Joanna McGarry asked Gaga about her views on [[feminism]]. Gaga told McGarry that the song is about new-age feminism, which she wanted to explore, where being subordinate to a man is the transfer of strength:
<blockquote>
"I actually wrote a song about it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they have every right to feel that way as well."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/the-passion-of-lady-gaga#image-rotator-1|title=The Passion of Lady Gaga|last=McGarry|first=Joanna|date=November 9, 2012|access-date=March 22, 2014|magazine=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406122541/http://www.stylist.co.uk/beauty/the-passion-of-lady-gaga#image-rotator-1|archive-date=April 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
</blockquote>
On her social media website Littlemonsters.com, Gaga later corrected the song title, saying that it is actually "G.U.Y.", an acronym for "Girl Under You". She also revealed that the song was written and produced with musician [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]], who had been touring with Gaga for her [[Born This Way Ball]]. Zedd had previously done a remix of her single "[[Marry the Night]]" for her remix album, ''[[Born This Way: The Remix]]'', and Gaga had contributed vocals on an alternate version of Zedd's track, "Stache". The musician told [[MTV News]] that they "both love nothing more than making music, so it was just kind of natural for us to just work on music". He also confirmed that around ten songs were composed with Gaga and was almost finished, although he was not sure which would be available on the final track list for ''Artpop''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady GaGa talks "new-age feminist" track 'G.U.Y (Girl Under You)'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a434990/lady-gaga-talks-new-age-feminist-track-guy-girl-under-you.html|last=Corner|first=Lewis|date=November 11, 2012|access-date=March 22, 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082543/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a434990/lady-gaga-talks-new-age-feminist-track-guy-girl-under-you.html|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695778/lady-gaga-zedd-artpop.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga, Zedd 'Made Songs And Songs And Songs' For ARTPOP|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=October 8, 2012|access-date=March 21, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023014324/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695778/lady-gaga-zedd-artpop.jhtml|archive-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>

By January 2013, Zedd clarified that due to their busy schedules it was difficult to complete the project and work progressed mainly during the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1700630/lady-gaga-zedd-artpop-album-update.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Has 'A Lot Of Work Left' On ARTPOP Songs|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=January 22, 2013|access-date=March 21, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325061958/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1700630/lady-gaga-zedd-artpop-album-update.jhtml/|archive-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> Talking to [[Sirius XM Radio]] in December 2013, where she gave an in-depth analysis of each song from the album, Gaga further expanded on the concept of [[Third-wave feminism|new-wave feminism]]: "The record's all about being comfortable underneath, because you are strong enough to know that you don't have to be on top to know you're worth it," she concluded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://junkee.com/listen-to-lady-gaga-offer-a-track-by-track-explanation-of-every-song-from-artpop-cause-maybe-you-just-didnt-get-it/24708|title=Listen to Lady Gaga's Track-by-Track Explanation of Artpop, 'Cause Maybe You Just Didn't Get It|last=Moran|first=Rob|date=December 4, 2013|access-date=March 3, 2014|publisher=Junkee.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210092848/http://junkee.com/listen-to-lady-gaga-offer-a-track-by-track-explanation-of-every-song-from-artpop-cause-maybe-you-just-didnt-get-it/24708|archive-date=December 10, 2013}}</ref>

==Recording and composition==
Initial recording sessions for ''Artpop'' coincided with the Born This Way Ball.<ref name="freealbum">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671501/lady-gaga-born-this-way-follow-up.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga 'Already Working' on Born This Way Follow-Up|last=Montogomery|first=James|date=September 26, 2011|access-date=January 17, 2012|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012022610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671501/lady-gaga-born-this-way-follow-up.jhtml|archive-date=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Zedd was not happy with the initial outcome of the recordings and so he suggested Gaga to re-do the whole process. Gaga's idea of recording the songs with Zedd was to not limit themselves with the intention of creating a staple radio hit, instead be creative in whichever way they wanted. He explained to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that they did not "try to make an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] album – but, at the same time, we didn't try not to make an EDM album. I've done a lot of stuff that's really outside of what I usually do. There was one song that started from her just giving me, like, 10 words to describe an emotion, and then I had to make this into music. It's been a very experimental way of approaching music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1710460/lady-gaga-artpop.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP: What We Know So Far|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=June 12, 2013|access-date=March 22, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211944/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1710460/lady-gaga-artpop.jhtml|archive-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>

==Music video==

===Background and production===
[[File:Hearst Castle pool.jpg|thumb|[[Hearst Castle]], where the music video was filmed]]
In February 2014, it was announced that Gaga had been allowed to shoot for a musical project at [[Hearst Castle]], located near [[San Simeon, California]]. The shooting took place from February 11–13, at locations including the 84,000 square feet area of the Castle's main terrace, the [[Neptune Pool]] and the indoor Roman Pool. The cast from [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] channel's reality show ''[[The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'' (RHOBH) was also seen around the shoot. The news attracted media attention as it was the first time since 1960 that a video project was shot there, the last being for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s epic film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''; the [[Deed of gift]] mandate by the Hearst Corporation prohibited any commercial filming at the location.<ref name="hreporter">{{cite journal|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lady-gaga-shoots-guy-music-679947|title=Lady Gaga Shoots 'G.U.Y' Music Video at Hearst Castle|last=Lal|first=Kanika|date=February 13, 2014|access-date=March 24, 2014|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302014855/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lady-gaga-shoots-guy-music-679947|archive-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref>

Among the accessories shown, the wings worn in the video were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows. Gaga told ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/johnny-weir-gets-guy-details-from-lady-gaga-exclusive_article_9198|title=Johnny Weir Gets 'G.U.Y.'

The cast from RHOBH featured included [[Lisa Vanderpump]], [[Yolanda Foster]], [[Carlton Gebbia]], [[Kyle Richards]], and [[Kim Richards]], who acted as instrument players in the video. Kyle Richards and Vanderpump also accompany Gaga on a different sequence in the video, showing the trio taking revenge against a corporation. Vanderpump explained that they were contacted by [[Andy Cohen (television personality)|Andy Cohen]]—who himself has a cameo appearance in "G.U.Y."—from Bravo and were signed for side-roles in the video. Richards noticed that Gaga was a perfectionist on the set, with Vanderpump saying that the singer took charge of every detail of the production. They explained to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that Gaga wanted the housewives to "feel and look beautiful and fierce" and during one of the homicide scenes she explained: "I want you to whip that ponytail even more. Go back and really exaggerate your head-flipping'. I was like, 'Whatever you say'. [''Vanderpump''] To get me into a lace bodysuit, there's not many people I'd do that for. I'm 53 years old, for God's sake. She said, 'This is what you're wearing'." Richards personally wanted to play the guitar since she had been taking lessons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/lady-gagas-guy-lisa-vanderpump-691483|title=Lady Gaga's 'G.U.Y.': Lisa Vanderpump, Kyle Richards on How Real Housewives Got Cast|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|date=March 26, 2014|access-date=March 28, 2014|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328090112/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/lady-gagas-guy-lisa-vanderpump-691483|archive-date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

Gaga also used the 3D game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in a sequence and enlisted ''Minecraft'' YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft in a sequence which depicts the singer reviving famous men who have been dead. The artist had been a fan of the game since Martyn Littlewood of [[The Yogscast]] used it to create a parody of her 2011 single, "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]", which she appreciated. ''Minecraft'' and Lego were also used to create little items like fruits and chairs in the video. The 3D theme also expanded onto using artist Nathan Sawaya's [[Lego]] sculpture ''Yellow''—which showed a man ripping his chest out—in a sequence showing Gaga's head being transposed on the artpiece.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2014/03/minecraft-makes-its-way-into-latest-lady-gaga-video|title="Minecraft", Makes Its Way into Latest, Lady Gaga, Video|magazine=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|access-date=April 2, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502050257/http://www.complex.com/video-games/2014/03/minecraft-makes-its-way-into-latest-lady-gaga-video|archive-date=May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-minecraft/|title=Lady Gaga uses 'Minecraft' to resurrect Jesus in new music video|last=Cook|first=James|date=March 24, 2014|access-date=March 28, 2014|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214314/http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-minecraft/|archive-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> Sawaya recalled that Gaga had contacted him for collaborating on the music video.

The video debuted in full on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' a day later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-teases-new-video-g-u-y-today-2D79413667|title=Lady Gaga teases new video 'G.U.Y.' on TODAY|access-date=March 21, 2014|date=March 21, 2014|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|last=Dawn|first=Randee|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321152555/http://www.today.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-teases-new-video-g-u-y-today-2D79413667|archive-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref> To coincide with the release of the video, The Out NYC hotel changed their name temporarily to The G.U.Y. Hotel and would keep it till April 10, 2014. Located in Midtown New York, the hotel also opened a Gaga Gallery which started from March 28 (Gaga's birthday) and showcased the props and dresses included in the music video.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/the-out-nyc-toasts-lady-gagas-birthday-7624622?module=Fashion-Fashion%20Scoops-main|title=The Out NYC Toasts Lady Gaga's Birthday|last=Feitelberg|first=Rosemary|date=March 28, 2014|access-date=March 28, 2014|work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411092222/http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/the-out-nyc-toasts-lady-gagas-birthday-7624622?module=Fashion-Fashion%20Scoops-main|archive-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref>

Running for nearly twelve minutes, the video features the four songs [[Artpop (song)|"Artpop"]], [[Venus (Lady Gaga song)|"Venus"]], "G.U.Y" and "Manicure" from ''Artpop'' and features the central video for "G.U.Y." The video opens with corporate business men fighting each other over money. Nearby, a [[fallen angel]] (played by Gaga) has been shot out of the sky with an arrow. The instrumental of her song "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]" plays in the background. The men run off and Gaga crawls to safety, removing the arrow from her chest. Gaga makes it to her feet and travels to a palace, where she collapses at the front door and is scraped up by the guards. "Venus" begins as she is carried down to the pool, where people cover her in flowers and put her into the water to heal her.

"G.U.Y." begins as Gaga rises again in a white dress, reborn as a Greek goddess of sorts and the song begins to play. Shots of Gaga in different outfits, including a blue dress and white bikini are shown with dance sequences. [[Andy Cohen (television personality)|Andy Cohen]] and the stars of ''[[The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'' make cameos in the video. A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit, dancing in a gold leotard with arrows, and floating on a bed in a pool is shown throughout the song. With the help of YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft (also making his cameo appearance), [[Michael Jackson]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John Lennon]], and [[Jesus]] are resurrected using the game [[Minecraft]] and their blood is used to create clones known as "G.U.Y." Gaga, Vanderpump, and Richards are seen coming out of a car in black outfits, shooting money cannons, and walking down the hallway to kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones. The video ends with thousands of these clones marching out of the castle. The credits section of the video then features "Manicure" playing.

===Reception and analysis===
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote="It's really up for interpretation by anyone that watches it. There's some artistic images and just some really pop images and I think the trick is to kind of watch it a few times and you'll catch something different each time.

MuuMuse's Bradley Stern described the video as "an eye-popping 7-minute deep dive into astonishing new levels of self-importance and certifiable insanity."

Negative reviews came from Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani, who found the plot to be "muddled", ultimately deducing that the final output was "unsexy" for a song talking about sexual submissiveness.

Gaga accessorized the dress with a pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from ''[[The Fame]]'' era.<ref name="mtvdress">{{cite web|url=http://style.mtv.com/2014/05/05/lady-gaga-artrave-tour-wardrobe/|title=Lady Gaga's artRave Tour Wardrobe: Latex, Tentacles, Sequins, And More|last=Keirans|first=Maeve|date=May 6, 2014|access-date=May 6, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511044424/http://style.mtv.com/2014/05/05/lady-gaga-artrave-tour-wardrobe/|archive-date=May 11, 2014}}</ref> Following the performance of the album title song, "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]", Gaga loosened the wings and was joined by her dancers on the ramp to perform "G.U.Y."

The performance ended with the singer and the dancers reaching the main stage and dancing energetically. <!-- WP:PLOT, IT DOES ''not'' REQUIRE REFERENCE -->It received positive review from Ross Raihala of ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' who said that the song sounded "terrific" in its live rendition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/entertainment/ci_25805119/review-back-at-x-lady-gaga-does-solid|title=Back at the X, Lady Gaga does a solid for her fans|last=Raihala|first=Ross|date=May 21, 2014|access-date=May 22, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524124030/http://www.twincities.com/entertainment/ci_25805119/review-back-at-x-lady-gaga-does-solid|archive-date=May 24, 2014}}</ref> Chuck Yarborough from ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' noticed that Gaga sang with a backing track during the performance of "G.U.Y.", but concluded that "she and a gifted crew of dancers kept up a manic pace that matched the frenzy of the evening".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/05/lady_gaga_is_so_unusual_--_and.html|title=Lady Gaga is so unusual—and fun!—in a marathon Quicken Loans Arena dance party (Review)|last=Yarborough|first=Chuck|date=May 21, 2014|access-date=May 22, 2014|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523100457/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/05/lady_gaga_is_so_unusual_--_and.html|archive-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref>
