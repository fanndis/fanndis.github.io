'''Josephine Baker''' (born '''Freda Josephine McDonald''', naturalised French '''Joséphine Baker'''; 3 June 1906 – 12 April 1975) was an American-born  French entertainer, [[French Resistance]] agent, freemason<ref>She was initiated in 1960 at Nouvelle Jerusalem Lodge of the Women's Grand Lodge Of France (Dictionnaire universelle de la Franc-maçonnerie - Larousse 2011 - p.110)</ref> and [[civil rights]] activist. Her career was centered primarily in Europe, mostly in her adopted France. She was the first Black woman to star in a major motion picture, the 1927 silent film ''[[Siren of the Tropics]]'', directed by {{lang|fr|Mario Nalpas|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|[[Henri Étiévant]]|italic=no}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Atwood |first=Kathryn |title=Women Heroes of World War II |work=Chicago Review Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1556529610 |page=77 }}</ref>

During her early career Baker was renowned as a dancer, and was among the most celebrated performers to headline the revues of the {{lang|fr|[[Folies Bergère]]|italic=no}} in [[Paris]]. Her performance in the revue {{lang|fr|Un vent de folie|italic=yes}} in 1927 caused a sensation in Paris. Her costume, consisting of only a short skirt of artificial bananas and a beaded necklace, became an iconic image and a symbol of the [[Jazz Age]] and the [[Roaring Twenties]].

Baker was celebrated by artists and intellectuals of the era, who variously dubbed her the "Black Venus", the "Black Pearl", the "Bronze Venus", and the "Creole Goddess". Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], she renounced her U.S. citizenship and became a French national after her marriage to French industrialist Jean Lion in 1937.<ref name="Kelleher">{{cite web |last1=Kelleher |first1=Katy |title=She'll Always Have Paris |url=https://jezebel.com/5502673/shell-always-have-paris |website=Jezebel |access-date=13 October 2016 |date=26 March 2010 }}</ref> She raised her children in France.

She was known for aiding the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="QR"/> After the war, she was awarded the {{lang|fr|[[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]|italic=no}} by the [[Military of France|French military]], and was named a [[Légion d'honneur|Chevalier of the {{lang|fr|Légion d'honneur|nocat=y}}]] by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref name="Remembering Josephine Baker">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Kimberly |title=Remembering Josephine Baker |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Tribune]] |date=8 April 2011 }}</ref>

Baker refused to perform for [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] audiences in the United States and is noted for her contributions to the [[civil rights movement]]. In 1968, she was offered unofficial leadership in the movement in the United States by [[Coretta Scott King]], following [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]]. After thinking it over, Baker declined the offer out of concern for the welfare of her children.<ref name="jeanclaude2a">{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Jean-Claude |title=Josephine: The Hungry Heart |edition=First |publisher=Random House |year=1993 |isbn=978-0679409151 |url=https://archive.org/details/josephinehungryh00bake }}</ref><ref name="Bouillon">{{cite book |last=Bouillon |first=Joe |title=Josephine |edition=First |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1977 |isbn=978-0060102128 |url=https://archive.org/details/josephine00bake }}</ref>

Jean-Claude Baker did an exhaustive amount of research into the life of Josephine Baker, including the identity of her biological father. In the book, he discusses at length the circumstances surrounding Josephine Baker's birth:

{{quote|The records of the city of St. Louis tell an almost unbelievable story. They show that (Josephine Baker's mother) Carrie McDonald ... was admitted to the (exclusively white) Female Hospital on May 3, 1906, diagnosed as pregnant. She was discharged on June 17, her baby, Freda J. McDonald having been born two weeks earlier. Why six weeks in the hospital? Especially for a black woman (of that time) who would customarily have had her baby at home with the help of a midwife? Obviously, there had been complications with the pregnancy, but Carrie's chart reveals no details. The father was identified (on the birth certificate) simply as "Edw"... I think Josephine's father was white&nbsp;– so did Josephine, so did her family ... people in St. Louis say that (Baker's mother) had worked for a German family (around the time she became pregnant). He's the one who must have got her into that hospital and paid to keep her there all those weeks. Also, her baby's birth was registered by the head of the hospital at a time when most black births were not. I have unraveled many mysteries associated with Josephine Baker, but the most painful mystery of her life, the mystery of her father's identity, I could not solve. The secret died with Carrie, who refused to the end to talk about it. She let people think Eddie Carson was the father, and Carson played along, (but) Josephine knew better.<ref name="jeanclaude2a"/>}}

Josephine spent her early life at 212 Targee Street (known by some St. Louis residents as Johnson Street) in the Mill Creek Valley neighborhood of St. Louis, a racially mixed low-income neighborhood near Union Station, consisting mainly of rooming houses, brothels, and apartments without indoor plumbing.<ref name="jeanclaude2a"/> Josephine was always poorly dressed and hungry as a child, and developed street smarts playing in the railroad yards of [[St. Louis Union Station|Union Station]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Ian|title=The Josephine Baker Story|year=2000|publisher=MPG Books|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1860742866|pages=[https://archive.org/details/josephinebakerst0000wood/page/241 241–318]|url=https://archive.org/details/josephinebakerst0000wood/page/241}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early years===
Baker's consistent badgering of a show manager in her hometown led to her being recruited for the St. Louis Chorus [[vaudeville]] show. At the age of 15, she headed to New York City during the [[Harlem Renaissance]], performing at the Plantation Club, Florence Mills' old stomping ground, and in the [[chorus line]]s of the groundbreaking and hugely successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revues ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' (1921)<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Jazz|editor=Kirchner, Bill|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00kirc/page/700 700]|isbn=978-0195125108|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00kirc/page/700}}</ref> with [[Adelaide Hall]]<ref>Williams, Iain Cameron.

Baker performed as the last dancer on the end of the chorus line, where her act was to perform in a comic manner, as if she were unable to remember the dance, until the [[encore]], at which point she would perform it not only correctly but with additional complexity. A term of the time describes this part of the cast as "The Pony".  Baker was billed at the time as "the highest-paid chorus girl in vaudeville".<ref name="jeanclaude2a"/>

Her career began with blackface comedy at local clubs; this was the "entertainment" of which her mother had disapproved; however, these performances landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris, which would become the place she called home until her final days.<ref>{{Cite film|title=Josephine Baker: The First Black Superstar|last=Broughton|first=Sarah|year=2009}}</ref>

===Paris and rise to fame===
[[File:Aankomst Josephine Baker-524881.ogv|thumb|Arrival of Baker in The Hague in 1928]]
Baker sailed to Paris for a new venture, and opened in ''La Revue Nègre'' on 2 October 1925, aged 19, at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]].<ref name=JBwebsite>{{cite web|title=About Josephine Baker: Biography|work=Official Josephine Baker website|publisher=The Josephine Baker Estate|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|year=2008|access-date=12 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109063301/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|archive-date=9 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>"''Le Jazz-Hot'': The Roaring Twenties", in William Alfred Shack's ''Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars'', University of California Press, 2001, p. 35. {{ISBN?}}</ref>

In a 1974 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Baker explained that she obtained her first [[breakthrough role|big break]] in the bustling city. "No, I didn't get my first break on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. I was only in the chorus in 'Shuffle Along' and 'Chocolate Dandies'. I became famous first in France in the twenties. I just couldn't stand America and I was one of the first [[colored]] Americans to move to Paris. Oh yes, [[Ada "Bricktop" Smith|Bricktop]] was there as well. Me and her were the only two, and we had a marvellous time. Of course, everyone who was anyone knew Bricky. And they got to know Miss Baker as well."<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/26/josephine-baker-interview-1974|title=From the archive, 26 August 1974: An interview with Josephine Baker|journal=The Guardian|date=2015-08-26}}</ref>

In Paris, she became an instant success for her [[burlesque|erotic dancing]], and for appearing practically nude onstage. After a successful tour of Europe, she broke her contract and returned to France in 1926 to star at the [[Folies Bergère]], setting the standard for her future acts.<ref name="jeanclaude2a"/>

[[File:Baker Banana.jpg|thumb|upright|Baker in her banana costume]]

[[File:JosephineBakerBurlesque crop.JPG|thumb|upright|Baker [[Toplessness#Entertainment|topless]] (1927)]]

Baker performed the "Danse Sauvage" wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Her success coincided (1925) with the [[Exposition des Arts Décoratifs]], which gave birth to the term "[[Art Deco]]", and also with a renewal of interest in non-Western forms of art, including [[African art|African]]. Baker represented one aspect of this fashion. In later shows in Paris, she was often accompanied on stage by her pet [[cheetah]], "Chiquita", who was adorned with a [[diamond]] collar. The cheetah frequently escaped into the [[orchestra pit]], where it terrorized the musicians, adding another element of excitement to the show.<ref name="jeanclaude2a"/>

After a while, Baker was the most successful American entertainer working in France. [[Ernest Hemingway]] called her "the most sensational woman anyone ever saw."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/quotes2.html|title="Quotes": the official Josephine Baker website|publisher=Cmgww.com|access-date=5 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017051325/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/quotes2.html|archive-date=17 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Lahs-Gonzales, Olivia.[http://www.jazzreview.com/book/review-380.html ''Josephine Baker: Image & Icon'' (excerpt in ''Jazz Book Review'', 2006).<!-- publishing info needed -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025094658/http://www.jazzreview.com/book/review-380.html|date=25 October 2009}}</ref> The author spent hours talking with her in Paris bars.

In 1929, Baker became the first African-American star to visit [[Yugoslavia]], while on tour in [[Central Europe]] via the [[Orient Express]]. In [[Belgrade]], she performed at [[Luxor Balkanska]], the most luxurious venue in the city at the time. She included [[Pirot carpet|Pirot kilim]] into her routine, as a nod to the local culture, and she donated some of the show's proceeds to poor children of [[Serbia]]. In [[Zagreb]], she was received by adoring fans at the train station. However, some of her shows were cancelled, due to opposition from the local [[clergy]] and morality police.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Esha|title=Josephine Baker in Yugoslavia|url=https://historicly.substack.com/p/josephine-baker-in-yugoslavia|access-date=2020-07-05|website=historicly.substack.com}}</ref>

During her travels in Yugoslavia, Baker was accompanied by "Count" Giuseppe Pepito Abatino.<ref name=":3" /> At the start of her career in France, Baker had Abatino, a [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] former [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] who passed himself off as a [[count]], and who persuaded her to let him manage her.<ref name=":1" /> Abatino was not only Baker's management, but her lover as well. The two could not marry because Baker was still married to her second husband, Willie Baker.<ref name=":0" />

During this period, she scored her most successful song, "J'ai deux amours" (1931).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asante|first=Molefi Kete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLY6-CsAE68C&pg=PA277|title=The African American People: A Global History|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136506772|page=277}}</ref> Baker starred in three films which found success only in Europe: the [[silent film]] ''[[Siren of the Tropics]]'' (1927), ''[[Zouzou (film)|Zouzou]]'' (1934) and ''[[Princesse Tam Tam]]'' (1935). She starred in ''[[Fausse Alerte]]'' in 1940.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />
[[File:Louis Gaudin - Casino de Paris - Josephine Baker 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction, drawn by Louis Gaudin, of Baker being presented a [[flower bouquet]] by a cheetah]]
Under the management of Abatino, Baker's stage and public persona, as well as her singing voice, were transformed. In 1934, she took the lead in a revival of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s opera ''[[La créole]]'', which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the Théâtre Marigny on the [[Champs-Élysées]] of Paris. In preparation for her performances, she went through months of training with a vocal coach. In the words of [[Shirley Bassey]], who has cited Baker as her primary influence, "...&nbsp;she went from a 'petite danseuse sauvage' with a decent voice to 'la grande diva magnifique' ...&nbsp;I swear in all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer."<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=Josephine Baker: The First Black Super Star|url=http://www.allblackwoman.com/josephine-baker-the-first-black-super-star|work=Allblackwoman.com|date=4 June 2012|access-date=18 June 2012}}</ref>
Despite her popularity in France, Baker never attained the equivalent reputation in America. Her star turn in a 1936 revival of ''[[Ziegfeld Follies of 1936|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on Broadway generated less than impressive box office numbers, and later in the run, she was replaced by [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].<ref name="Schroeder">{{cite book|last=Schroeder|first=Alan and Heather Lehr Wagner|title=Josephine Baker: Entertainer|year=2006|publisher=Chelsea House Publications|isbn=978-0791092125|pages=51–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pelF1O7b2xwC&pg=PA51}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=Frank|title=Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, 2 volumes|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415938532|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&pg=PA235}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine referred to her as a "Negro wench ... whose dancing and singing might be topped anywhere outside of Paris", while other critics said her voice was "too thin" and "dwarf-like" to fill the [[Winter Garden Theatre]].<ref name="Schroeder" /> She returned to Europe heartbroken.<ref name="JBwebsite" /> This contributed to Baker's becoming a legal citizen of France and giving up her American citizenship.<ref name="jeanclaude2a" />

Baker returned to Paris in 1937, married the French industrialist Jean Lion, and became a French citizen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibbsmagazine.com/Josephine%20Baker.htm|title=Josephine Baker|author=Susan Robinson|publisher=Gibbs Magazine|date=3 June 1906|access-date=5 December 2013}}</ref> They were married in the French town of [[Crèvecœur-le-Grand]], in a wedding presided over by the mayor, Jammy Schmidt.

===Work during World War II===
In September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, Baker was recruited by the [[Deuxième Bureau]], French military intelligence, as an "honorable correspondent". Baker collected what information she could about German troop locations from officials she met at parties. She specialized in gatherings at embassies and ministries, charming people as she had always done, while gathering information. Her café-society fame enabled her to rub shoulders with those in the know, from high-ranking Japanese officials to Italian bureaucrats, and to report back what she heard. She attended parties and gathered information at the Italian embassy without raising suspicion.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra">{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Phyllis|title=Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in her time|year=1989|publisher=Doubleday|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0385248914|url=https://archive.org/details/jazzcleopatrajos00rose_0}}</ref>{{rp|182–269}}

[[File:Baker Harcourt 1940.jpg|thumb|Baker in 1940.]]
When the Germans invaded France, Baker left Paris and went to the [[Château des Milandes]], her home in the [[Dordogne]] ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' in the south of France. She housed people who were eager to help the [[Free French]] effort led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] and supplied them with visas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Female Spies in World War I and World War II|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/spies/a/women_spies_ww_3.htm|work=About.com|access-date=3 June 2017}}</ref> As an entertainer, Baker had an excuse for moving around Europe, visiting neutral nations such as Portugal, as well as some in South America. She carried information for transmission to England, about airfields, harbors, and German troop concentrations in the West of France. Notes were written in invisible ink on Baker's sheet music.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>{{rp|232–269}} As written in ''Jazz Age Cleopatra'', "She specialized in gatherings at [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] and ministries, charming people as she had always done, but at the same time trying to remember interesting items to transmit".<ref name=":3" />

Later in 1941, she and her entourage went to the [[French colonies]] in North Africa. The stated reason was Baker's health (since she was recovering from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid a strip search). She met the [[Thami El Glaoui|Pasha of Marrakech]], whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a [[hysterectomy]]. The infection spread and she developed [[peritonitis]] and then [[sepsis]]. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French, and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her entourage managed for the most part on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>

After the war, Baker received the [[Croix de guerre]] and the [[Médaille de la Résistance|Rosette de la Résistance]]. She was made a [[Légion d'honneur|Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur]] by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ann Shaffer|title=Review of Josephine Baker: A Centenary Tribute|url=http://blackgrooves.org/?p=116|work=blackgrooves|date=4 October 2006|access-date=8 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002105449/http://blackgrooves.org/?p=116|archive-date=2 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Baker's last marriage, to French composer and conductor [[Jo Bouillon]], ended around the time Baker opted to adopt her 11th child.<ref name=":0"/>

In 1949, a reinvented Baker returned in triumph to the Folies Bergere. Bolstered by recognition of her wartime heroics, Baker the performer assumed a new gravitas, unafraid to take on serious music or subject matter. The engagement was a rousing success and reestablished Baker as one of Paris' preeminent entertainers. In 1951 Baker was invited back to the United States for a nightclub engagement in Miami. After winning a public battle over desegregating the club's audience, Baker followed up her sold-out run at the club with a national tour. Rave reviews and enthusiastic audiences accompanied her everywhere, climaxed by a parade in front of 100,000 people in Harlem in honor of her new title: [[NAACP]]'s "Woman of the Year".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Joyce|first=Dr Robin|date=2017-03-05|title=Josephine Baker, 1906 – 1975|url=https://womenshistorynetwork.org/josephine-baker-1906-1975/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Women's History Network|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=May 25, 2014|title=Josephine Baker hero {{!}} Heroes: What They Do & Why We Need Them|url=https://blog.richmond.edu/heroes/tag/josephine-baker-hero/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=[[University of Richmond ]]}}</ref>

In 1952 Baker was hired to crown the Queen of the Cavalcade of Jazz for the famed eighth [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert held at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] in Los Angeles which was produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.]] on 1 June.

An incident at the [[Stork Club]] interrupted and overturned her plans. Baker criticized the club's unwritten policy of discouraging Black patrons, then scolded columnist [[Walter Winchell]], an old ally, for not rising to her defense. Winchell responded swiftly with a series of harsh public rebukes, including accusations of [[Communist]] sympathies (a serious charge at the time). The ensuing publicity resulted in the termination of Baker's work visa, forcing her to cancel all her engagements and return to France. It was almost a decade before U.S. officials allowed her back into the country.<ref name=firestorm/>
[[File:Josephine Baker 1950.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baker in Havana, Cuba]]
In January 1966, [[Fidel Castro]] invited Baker to perform at the Teatro Musical de La Habana in Havana, Cuba, at the 7th-anniversary celebrations of his revolution. Her spectacular show in April broke attendance records. In 1968, Baker visited [[Yugoslavia]] and made appearances in [[Belgrade]] and in [[Skopje]]. In her later career, Baker faced financial troubles. She commented, "Nobody wants me, they've forgotten me"; but family members encouraged her to continue performing. In 1973 she performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] to a standing ovation.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>

The following year, she appeared in a [[Royal Variety Performance]] at the [[London Palladium]], and then at the [[Red Cross of Monaco|Monacan Red Cross Gala]], celebrating her 50 years in French show business. Advancing years and exhaustion began to take their toll; she sometimes had trouble remembering lyrics, and her speeches between songs tended to ramble. She still continued to captivate audiences of all ages.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>

== Civil rights activism ==
Although based in France, Baker supported the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1950s. When she arrived in New York with her husband Jo, they were refused reservations at 36 hotels because of racial discrimination. She was so upset by this treatment that she wrote articles about the segregation in the United States. She also began traveling into the South. She gave a talk at [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college|historically Black college]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on "France, North Africa and the Equality of the Races in France".<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>

She refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, although she was offered $10,000 by a Miami club.<ref name="QR">{{cite journal|last=Bostock|first=William W.|title=Collective Mental State and Individual Agency: Qualitative Factors in Social Science Explanation|journal=Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung|volume=3|issue=3|year=2002|issn=1438-5627|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs020317|access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref> (The club eventually met her demands).

In 1951, Baker made charges of racism against [[Sherman Billingsley]]'s [[Stork Club]] in Manhattan, where she had been refused service.<ref name=firestorm>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/firestorm-incident-stork-club-1951-article-1.571278|title=Firestorm Incident At The Stork Club, 1951|author=Hinckley, David|date=9 November 2004 |newspaper=New York Daily News|access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4TgoAAAAIBAJ&pg=6956,1502149&dq=stork+club+baker&hl=en|title=Stork Club Refused to Serve Her, Josephine Baker Claims|date=19 October 1951|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|access-date=29 August 2010}}</ref>
Actress [[Grace Kelly]], who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party, vowing never to return (although she returned on 3 January 1956 with Prince Rainier of Monaco). The two women became close friends after the incident.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

When Baker was near bankruptcy, Kelly offered her a villa and financial assistance (Kelly by then was [[princess consort]] of [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III of Monaco]]). (However, during his work on the ''Stork Club'' book, author and ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by [[Jean-Claude Baker]], one of Baker's sons. Having read a Blumenthal-written story about [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s [[FBI]] file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and, using comparison of the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.)<ref name="Society">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/stork-club-special-delivery-exhibit-new-york-historical-society-recalls-glamour-wind-article-1.873537|title=Stork Club Special Delivery Exhibit at the New York Historical Society recalls a glamour gone with the wind|author=Kissel, Howard|date=3 May 2000|access-date=23 April 2018|work=Daily News}}</ref>)

Baker worked with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]].<ref name="QR"/> Her reputation as a crusader grew to such an extent that the NAACP had Sunday, 20 May 1951 declared "Josephine Baker Day". She was presented with life membership with the NAACP by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Dr. Ralph Bunche]]. The honor she was paid spurred her to further her crusading efforts with the "[[Willie McGee (convict)|Save Willie McGee]]" rally. McGee was a Black man in Mississippi convicted of raping a white woman in 1945 on the basis of dubious evidence, and sentenced to death.{{sfn|Dittmer|1994|p=21}} Baker attended rallies for McGee and wrote letters to [[Fielding Wright]], the governor of Mississippi, asking him to spare McGee's life.{{sfn|Dittmer|1994|p=21}} Despite her efforts, McGee was executed in 1951.{{sfn|Dittmer|1994|p=21}} As the decorated war hero who was bolstered by the racial equality she experienced in Europe, Baker became increasingly regarded as controversial; some Black people even began to shun her, fearing that her outspokenness and racy reputation from her earlier years would hurt the cause.<ref name="Jazz Cleopatra"/>

In 1963, she spoke at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] at the side of Rev.

In her powerful speech, one of the things Baker notably said was:

<blockquote>I have walked into the palaces of kings and queens and into the houses of presidents. And much more. But I could not walk into a hotel in America and get a cup of coffee, and that made me mad. And when I get mad, you know that I open my big mouth.

After King's assassination, his widow [[Coretta Scott King]] approached Baker in the Netherlands to ask if she would take her husband's place as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, Baker declined, saying her children were "too young to lose their mother".<ref name="Baker">{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Josephine|author2=Bouillon, Joe|title=Josephine|edition=First|location=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1977|isbn=978-0060102128|url=https://archive.org/details/josephine00bake}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
[[File:JosephineBaker1964NL.jpg|thumb|Baker with ten of her adopted children, 1964]]
Her first marriage was to American [[Pullman porter]] Willie Wells when she was only 13 years old. The marriage was reportedly very unhappy and the couple divorced a short time later. Another short-lived marriage followed to Willie Baker in 1921; she retained Baker's last name because her career began taking off during that time, and it was the name by which she became best known. While she had four marriages to men, Jean-Claude Baker writes that Josephine also had several relationships with women.<ref name=Garber/> Josephine Baker was [[Bisexual community|bisexual]].<ref name=Garber>Garber, Marjorie.

During Baker's work with the Civil Rights Movement, she began adopting children, forming a family she often referred to as "The Rainbow Tribe". Baker wanted to prove that "children of different ethnicities and religions could still be brothers." She often took the children with her cross-country, and when they were at [[Château des Milandes]], she arranged tours so visitors could walk the grounds and see how natural and happy the children in "The Rainbow Tribe" were.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|publisher=Josephine Baker Estate|access-date=16 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109063301/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|archive-date=9 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Her estate featured hotels, a farm, rides, and the children singing and dancing for the audience.

Baker was back on stage at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in [[Paris]] in 1968, in [[Belgrade]] and at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1973, and at the Royal Variety Performance at the [[London Palladium]] and at the ''Gala du Cirque'' in Paris in 1974. On 8 April 1975, Baker starred in a retrospective revue at the [[Bobino]] in Paris, ''Joséphine à Bobino 1975'', celebrating her 50 years in show business. The revue, financed notably by [[Prince Rainier]], [[Princess Grace]], and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], opened to rave reviews. Demand for seating was such that fold-out chairs had to be added to accommodate spectators. The opening night audience included [[Sophia Loren]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Liza Minnelli]].<ref name="AABaker">{{cite web|title=African American Celebrity Josephine Baker, Dancer and Singer|url=http://www.africanamericans.com/JosephineBaker.htm|work=AfricanAmericans.com|year=2008|access-date=12 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102041450/http://www.africanamericans.com/JosephineBaker.htm|archive-date=2 January 2009}}</ref>
