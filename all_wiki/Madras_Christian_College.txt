'''Madras Christian College (MCC)''' is a liberal arts and sciences college in Chennai, India. Founded in 1837, MCC is one of [[Asia]]'s oldest extant colleges. The college is affiliated to the [[University of Madras]] but functions as an autonomous institution from its main campus in [[Tambaram]], Chennai. 

Established originally as a school for boys in the place where [[Anderson Church, Chennai|Anderson Church]] is located, the institution evolved into one of the pioneering modern colleges for higher education in India by mid-nineteenth century.<ref name="newindianexpress">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/The-Hotbed-of-Student-Protests/2015/08/18/article2979317.ece|title=The Hotbed of Student Protests|website=The New Indian Express|accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref> From its origins as a missionary endeavor of the [[Church of Scotland]], MCC's alumni and professors include several civil servants, administrators, educators, business people and political leaders, around the world.<ref name="thehindu">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-colleges-100-and-counting/article6273124.ece|title=100, and counting|website=The Hindu|accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref>

==History==

===Beginnings===
MCC has its roots in a small school for boys established in 1835 when two chaplains of the Church of Scotland in Madras, Rev. George James Laurie and Rev. Matthew Bowie founded the St. Andrew's School on Randalls Road in Egmore, [[Madras]]. At their request, the Church of Scotland sent a missionary to India to govern it. Missionary Rev. [[John Anderson (missionary)|John Anderson]], set up the institution as the General Assembly's School, conducting classes in a rented house on the east side of Armenian Street in Georgetown, [[Madras]]. The headmaster and 59 boys from St. Andrew's School moved to this institution. It was named after the supreme governing body of the Church of Scotland and aimed at attracting students from the Hindu higher castes with the aim of "conveying as great as an amount of truth as possible through the channel of a good education especially of Bible truth". The college grew from the school into a {{convert|275|acre|km2|adj=on}} wooded campus under the leadership of educationalist [[William Miller (missionary)|Dr. William Miller]], who created hostels and several academic and cultural associations, which shaped MCC into a premier educational institution in South Asia.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Pathfinders of the World Missionary Crusade|author=Eddy, S.|date=1945|publisher=Abingdon-Cokesbury Press|isbn=9780836911275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_PyVMElYr0C&pg=PA95|page=95|accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref>

The rapid expansion of the college and the paucity of the space necessitated moving the campus to a more spacious location. Accordingly, the college under the leadership of Rev. William Skinner (principal 1909–1921) initiated the Tambaram Project in 1919. Rev. Gordon Matthew as the town planning secretary negotiated with the government, which set aside {{convert|390|acre|km2}} of the former Selaiyur forest land in [[Tambaram]].<ref name=Arbours>[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/article3442298.ece "Arbours of Academia"], ''The Hindu'', by Prince Frederick, CHENNAI, 21 May 2012</ref> While Mrs. and Prof. Edward Barnes meticulously planted rare trees and worked out the physical landscape,<ref name=Arbours/> the Swiss architect Henry Schaetti, then based in Kodaikanal, India, designed the buildings. After 100 years in the heart of the city, the college moved to the sprawling, green campus in Tambaram on the outskirts of Madras in 1937.

On 30 January 1937, the governor of Madras, [[John Erskine, Lord Erskine|Lord John Erskine]] declared open the first campus buildings. The hostel gave way to three halls of residence — Selaiyur, Thomas' and Heber — active today as semi-autonomous student communities. Women students were admitted on a regular basis from 1939, and a hostel for them came up in [[Guindy]], [[Madras]] in 1950. This too evolved into an on-campus hall of residence for women, Martin Hall, named after Agnes Martin, in 1968, Margaret Hall in 2008 and Barnes Hall in 2016.

===Tambaram Conference 1938===
[[File:William Miller (missionary).jpg|thumb|[[William Miller (missionary)|William Miller]] was chiefly notable for transforming Madras Christian College.]]
In 1938 MCC hosted the Tambaram Conference (also called The Madras Conference or Tambaram 1938), the third [[1910 World Missionary Conference|World Missionary Conference]] which eventually created the [[World Council of Churches]]. The same buildings were used again in 1988 (Tambaram 1988) to commemorate this landmark event which focused on contemporary thought into ecumenism, Christianity's engagement with world religions and traditions. In the words of Bishop [[Stephen Neill]], this event was "the most international gathering held up to that point in the entire history of the Christian Church."<ref name="books.google.com">[https://books.google.com/books?id=14_D50nU7R8C&lpg=PA151&ots=c3abflKyGi&dq=%22tambaram%20conference%22%20%22madras%20christian%20college%22&pg=PA151#v=onepage&q=%22tambaram%20conference%22%20%22madras%20christian%20college%22&f=false Bishop Stephen Neill (American University Studies.

===Governance and leadership===
The [[Rev. Dr. A.J. Boyd]] led the college for 18 years (1938–56). General [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji]]'s autobiography reveals that Boyd knew each student personally. Sundarji relates in his book that when he expressed his intention to join the army, discontinuing his studies, Boyd advised him against it as he believed Sundarji would make a good doctor rather than a good soldier.

Alfred Boyd, Prof Macphail became principal, who was then succeeded by the first Indian principal of the college, Dr. [[Chandran Devanesan]] in 1962. A man of Gandhian principles, Devanesen involved the faculty and students in working with the neighbouring community in Tambaram. This period (1962–72) is affectionately referred to by MCCians as "The Devanesan Decade". Recently, the birth centenary of Dr Chandran Devanesen was celebrated in November 2017, and a compilation in his honour was brought out (see Dayalan Devanesen and Joshua Kalapati (ed.) Dr.Chandran D.S. Devanesen" A Life of Love and Service, Roofs for the Roofless Publication, 2017

The college was one of the first in India to be granted Autonomy in 1978 and the first batch of Autonomous graduates passed out in 1981. The year 2006 marked the Silver Jubilee of Autonomy for Madras Christian College. The 175th year celebrations were organized in the year 2012.

==Cultural festival==
Madras Christian College has hosted DeepWoods, an inter-collegiate cultural festival, since 1980. It is typically held each year in February.

The three-day event sees participation by various colleges from Chennai and all over India with attendance touching almost 30,000. MCC, as the host college, does not participate in the festival.

The highlight of the second day of the event is a light music show, aimed at integrating youth of different ethnic backgrounds through multi-lingual music.

==Campus==
The {{convert|365|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus is known for its flora and fauna, notably deer and rare trees.<ref name=Arbours/> The college is distinguished by a lake on campus. The campus curator maintains these natural resources and ensures that no damage is done through the unauthorized cutting of plants or grass. The first curator of the campus was Prof. Edward Barnes.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2540446.ece "Madras Miscellany"], by S Muthiah, ''The Hindu'', 16 October 2011</ref> Several faculty members from the Department of Botany and Zoology have since served as curators of the campus. They are Dr. K.R. Venkattasubban, Mr. Giles Lal, Dr. D.E.P. Jeyasingh, Dr. P. Dayanandan, C.Livingstone, Dr. G.Ebenezer, and Dr. Manu Thomas. Dr.Selva Singh Richard from Botany Department is the current Curator of MCC.

It is the second-largest scrub jungle in Asia, actively used by departments like [http://mccbotbio.yolasite.com Botany] and Zoology for their practical work.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-18/chennai/29555837_1_mcc-college-activities-campus | work=The Times Of India | title=Madras Christian College is a living lab for students zoology, botany and just anything | date=18 May 2011}}</ref>

The Scrub Society at Madras Christian College, along with other departments and units on the campus, strives for the development, preservation, and protection of this campus for future generations. It was headed by [[C.Livingstone|Prof. Dr. C. Livingstone]] from inception to his superannuation in the year 2007. The college is well known for encouraging student leadership and governance among students through the College Union Society in which, all students are members.

The most recognizable building is the 'Main Building' to which the main entrance leads. It houses administrative offices and some departments as well as lecture rooms. The Miller Memorial Library is another landmark building, built in anticipation of then-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit in 1987.

===Biodiversity===
MCC has actively supported the diversity of flora and fauna on campus. Several eminent staff from various departments have contributed to the development and the upkeep of campus diversity. Professor Edward Barnes (Department of Chemistry), the first curator of MCC Campus (along with his wife) began this process. Dr. K.R. Venkatasubban (Professor and Head, Department of Botany), Dr. P. Sanjeeva Raj (Retired Professor and Head, Department of Zoology), Dr. Gift Siromony (Professor and Head, Department of Statistics), Mr. Giles Lal (Department of Botany) and Dr. C. Livingstone (Department of Botany) have documented the Biodiversity of the campus as well as other areas in the region.

==Residential Halls==
The college has six residential halls for students - Selaiyur hall, St.Thomas's hall, Bishop Heber Hall, Martin Hall (earlier known as the Women's Hostel), Margaret Hall and Barnes Hall.

===St. Thomas's Hall===
[[File:ThomasHall logo.jpg|frame|top|right|alt=The emblem of St. Thomas's Hall|Hall emblem]]St. Thomas's hall was built in 1937, named after St. Thomas who brought Christianity into India. The first warden of St. Thomas's Hall was Rev. J.R. Macphail and the first general secretary was A. Mohammed Nabi. The Hall constitution was drafted in 1950–51 on the basis of the Indian Constitutional and Parliamentary system, administered by resident students (called the 'general body') who elect representative leaders holding eight ministerial positions and the post of the Speaker. The hall's current ‘E' block was earlier a campus school known as St. Thomas's Annexe. The Hall Emblem is represented using various elements that describe foundational and philosophical bases of the Hall: in the top portion, a lamp signifying enlightenment, divided by a cross signifying the Christian foundation of the college. On the top left: the crucified palm of Jesus Christ. On the top right: An elephant reaching out to a palm branch, signifying striving for higher ambition. On the bottom left: Maize, signifying India's reliance on agriculture. On the bottom right: A dove, signifying peace. The hall organizes an annual dance competition, named Utsav. Hall publications include ''USHA'', the hall magazine and ''Tribune'', the Hall newsletter. The hall has Table Tennis tables, Basketball grounds gymnasium, library, and entertainment room. The hall motto is '' "For God and Country." ''

''Bharathi Mandram'' organizes debates, lectures, seminars to promote Tamil culture while ''Jatra'' is the theatre society. The St. Thomas's Hall's Literary Programme organizes debates and distributes donations for various charitable causes. The Nature Club prepares the hall for ''Vatika'', Martin Hall's biennial gardening competition. It also has an active Tennis club that organizes and facilitates games. The Current Serving Warden is Dr.S.D.Christopher Chandran.

===Selaiyur Hall===
Selaiyur Hall, the oldest one on the college campus, was founded in 1937 and was named after the Selaiyur forest reserve, a part of which was set aside for the college.

The Hall's coat of arms consists of a shield incorporated with an anchor and held together by a rope. Above the emblem are images of a lotus, a pair of laurel leaves and a torch, which stand for purity, victory, and truth respectively. The Latin motto at the base reads ''Esse Quam Videri'' which means "Sincerity not sham" and alternatively "To be rather than to seem".

The Selaiyur Constitution is derived from the British constitution. The governing body, or the Cabinet, is headed by the nominal-executive President (Hall Warden), the Chairman and The General Secretary and his cabinet consisting of six Secretaries. Finance, Appraisal, and Jury committees are appointed by the Chairman in consultation with the General Secretary and the President. Four general body sessions are held through the academic year in the presence of at least 2/3rd of the residents to pass budgets and coordinate planning.

It is the only hall on campus that hosts an annual alumni meeting organised by the Selaiyur Hall Old Boys Association (SHOBA). An annual magazine called ''Thots'' is published at the end of each academic year. Discussion sessions are held through ''Parnassus'' meetings while a social initiative called ''STEPS'' is used to bring Selaiyur's mess workers into the academic fold.

The Tamil society, ''Kamban Mandram'', regularly conducts events of literary and cultural significance. It hosts the ''Kathir'' event annually on the eve of the ''Pongal'' festival. The Annual Hall Day is held around the end of the academic year and is an occasion for the residents to invite friends and family to partake in the celebrations.

The most eagerly awaited event during the academic year is the ''Moonshadow'' cultural festival which sees all the Halls competing in literary and debating (L&D) and performing arts events. Traditionally, a rock band is invited to play at the end of the festival and numerous Indian bands have graced the Selaiyur stage over the years, including [[Galeej Gurus]], [[The Circus]], [[Kryptos]], [[Parousia]] and Slain.

Since 2009, Selaiyur Hall has an in-house Integrated Knowledge Centre (IKC) named after Dr. Bennet Albert, one of the Hall's former and most celebrated wardens. It is based in the library for the residents to avail of Internet and printing facilities, books, videos, and music. The Current Serving Warden is Dr.Johanan Christian Prasana.

===Bishop Heber Hall===
While the history of Madras Christian College dates back to 1837 , the history of Bishop Heber Hall could be traced back to 1762 when a German Christian missionary set up a school at Trichy in 1762.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/edu/2004/11/29/stories/2004112900580200.htm "Academic Haven"], ''The Hindu'', S Ganesan, 29 November 2004</ref> The school eventually evolved into Bishop Heber College in 1878. It was named after [[Reginald Heber|Bishop Reginald Heber]] (1783–1826) the hymn writer and erstwhile [[Anglican Diocese of Calcutta|Bishop of Calcutta]]. In 1934 this college was dissolved and merged with Madras Christian College.<ref name=miscellany>{{cite news|title=Madras Miscellany - A Teaching University|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2308483.ece|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=31 July 2011|first=S.|last=Muthiah}}</ref>  The teachers and students who shifted to Madras formed the Bishop Heber Hostel at Vepery. After a short stay at Vepery and later at Royapettah, the hostel moved out with the rest of Madras Christian College to Tambaram in 1937.<ref>Madras miscellany: A host of anniversaries S. MUTHIAH, the Hindu 1 April 2012, http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3265832.ece</ref> The Bishop Heber Hall Chapel, the Bishop Heber Hall Library (Second Largest Library in Tambaram ) and the Coat of Arms are reminders of the transformation of Bishop Heber College at Trichy to the Bishop Heber Hall at Tambaram. Bishop Heber Hall, has several features that are unique to it- a natural pond in its courtyard, the Bishop Heber Hall Chapel and the bridge across the facade of the chapel.

John Anderson, who laboured for the institution from 1845-1887. She was instrumental in starting the first on-campus women's hostel at her own home.  Hence it was a natural choice for the Hall to be named after her.

The Hall Emblem depicts a cross in the shape of an anchor which stands for strong faith and foundation. A lady holding a pearl stands on the cross representing every margarita, as Margaret means ‘pearl’.  At the top left, there soars an eagle which highlights the Hall Motto "Auf Fluegeln Wie Adler", which in German means "On Wings Like Eagles". The flowers at the lower left hand side symbolize the Hall theme, fragrance.

The room now serves the entire college community as a classroom for overseas students, a viva-voce exam centre, an alternative chapel and a venue for various celebrations.

The Hall Magazine, Saisei (Japanese for ‘A New Beginning’), was introduced during the third year of the Hall by the then Literary and Debating Secretary, Ms Nikhila Sudharma Ajeer.
The Hall Library was inaugurated by Pastor Charles during the third year of the Hall. It is a customary tradition for all first years of the hall to donate a book to the library.

==Controversies==

===Sport for All===
Following the death of J. Mahima, first-year BSc Chemistry Student, the students staged a protest against the compulsory Sport for All initiative launched a year ago by then college Principal, Mr. [[R. W. Alexander Jesudasan]] on December 12, 2018. In one day's peaceful sit-in protest, students demanded that Sport for All must be made optional.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reporter |first1=Staff |title=Protest at MCC after death of girl during sports session |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/protest-at-mcc-after-death-of-girl-during-sports-session/article25720918.ece |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=The Hindu |publisher=The Hindu |date=12 December 2018 |language=en-IN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Times News Network |first1=The |title=Students protest as teen dies of cardiac arrest on campus {{!}} Chennai News - Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/students-protest-as-teen-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-on-campus/articleshow/67051628.cms |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=The Times of India |agency=The Times of India |language=en}}</ref> The protest gathered attention on social media and newspapers as the principal failed to respond swiftly. Students dissolved after Principal assured later in the evening that the issue will be solved by a committee including student representatives. Students also raised concerns about the absence of medical official on spot, which led to delay in treatment for Mahima, and how organizers were insensitive to the medical condition of participating students.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Merigala |first1=Samuel |title=Students, alumni distraught as MCC student dies after being made to jog during sports hour |url=https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/dec/11/madras-christian-college-student-dies-after-collapsing-at-the-mandatory-sports-class-4690.html |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=The New Indian Express}}</ref>
