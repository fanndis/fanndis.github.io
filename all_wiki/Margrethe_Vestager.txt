'''Margrethe Vestager''' ({{IPA-da|mɑˈkʁeˀtə ˈvestˌɛˀjɐ}}; born 13 April 1968) is a Danish [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|social liberal]] politician serving in the [[Von der Leyen Commission]] as [[Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age]] since 1 December 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/vestager_en|title=Margrethe Vestager|date=2019-11-19|website=European Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> and [[European Commissioner for Competition]] since 2014.

Vestager was a member of the [[Folketing]] from 20 November 2001 until 2 September 2014, representing the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] ({{lang|da|Radikale Venstre}}). She was the political leader of her party from 2007 to 2014, and served as [[Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Minister of Economic Affairs and the Interior]] from 2011 to 2014. She has been described as "the rich world’s most powerful trustbuster".<ref name="veconomist1" >{{cite news|title=Is Margrethe Vestager championing consumers or her political career|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728979-she-rich-worlds-most-powerful-trustbuster-margrethe-vestager-championing-consumers-or|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

==Political career==
Vestager has been a professional politician since the age of 21, when she was appointed to the central board and executive committee of the SLP and its European Affairs Committee, and shortly afterwards as National [[Chairwoman]] of the Party.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2001, Vestager was elected to the Danish Parliament, becoming Chairwoman of its Parliamentary Group in 2007. She was appointed Minister of [[Education]] and [[Ecclesiastical]] Affairs in 1998.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 15 June 2007 Vestager secured election as her Party's [[parliamentary group leader]] in the [[Folketing]], replacing [[Marianne Jelved]].<ref name="ft" /> When Denmark's [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] called an [[2011 Danish general election|early election]] in 2011 after failing to secure majority lawmaker backing for his economic stimulus package, Vestager's Social Liberals and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] formed a political alliance, pledging to work together no matter which political bloc would win the election.<ref>Josiane Kremer (August 28, 2011), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-08-28/danish-conservatives-social-liberals-form-pact-berlingske-says Danish Conservatives, Social Liberals Form Pact, Berlingske Says] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

===Minister for Economic and Interior Affairs of Denmark, 2011–2014===
From 2011 until 2014 Vestager served as Minister for Economic and Interior Affairs in the three-party Social Democrat-led [[Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet|coalition government]] of [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]]. Having forced through deep cuts in unemployment benefits of Denmark's generous [[Nordic model|social welfare system]] after the country's economy narrowly escaped [[recession]] in 2012,<ref>Mette Fraende and Erik Matzen (December 13, 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/13/denmark-economy-idUSL5E8ND35G20121213 Denmark sees painful recovery as economy stalls] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> she was at one point considered by Danish media and pollsters as the most powerful person in government, even above Thorning-Schmidt.<ref>Foo Yun Chee and Julia Fioretti (September 10, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/eu-commisssion-competition-telecoms-idUSL5N0RB25420140910 Danish reformer gets EU antitrust stick; German to police the Internet] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Between 2011 and 2014, Vestager led Denmark's campaign against [[Basel III]] liquidity rules, arguing in favor of allowing banks to use 75 percent more in [[covered bond]]s to fill liquidity buffers than allowed under Basel III rules; at the time Denmark's $550 billion mortgage-backed covered bond market, part of the country's two-century-old mortgage system,<ref>Frances Schwartzkopff (December 6, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/soros-venture-urges-denmark-to-ignore-covered-bond-plan-from-eba Soros Venture Urges Denmark to Ignore EBA Covered Bond Plan] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref> was the world's largest per capita.<ref>Frances Schwartzkopff, Jim Brunsden and Peter Levring (June 13, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/eu-commission-document-backs-danish-statements-on-covered-bonds Basel’s Liquidity Rules Ignored as EU Sides With Denmark] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref> In 2013 she ruled out slowing down steps toward stricter requirements for [[Systemically important financial institution|systemically important lenders]] and reiterated her stance that banks won't get [[tax break]]s to help them through the transition caused by regulatory reform.<ref>Peter Levring (May 28, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-27/banks-rebuked-for-spin-tactics-as-denmark-rejects-capital-pleas Banks Rebuked for Spin Tactics as Denmark Slams Sifi Pleas] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

In May 2014, Vestager presented a growth package designed to drag Denmark's economy – at the time Scandinavia's weakest – out of its crisis, raising the country's structural output by 6 billion kroner ($1.1 billion) and cut costs for companies by 4 billion kroner in 2020 through 89 measures to improve the business climate and boost employment.<ref>Peter Levring (May 8, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-07/denmark-set-to-unveil-growth-plan-to-drag-economy-out-of-crisis Danish Government Unveils Plan to Help Economy Exit Crisis] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

===European Commissioner for Competition, 2014–2019===
On 31 August 2014, [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] Thorning-Schmidt nominated Vestager as Denmark's [[EU Commissioner]] in the [[Juncker Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2014/08/31/003912.htm|title=Vestager træder ud af regeringen og bliver EU-kommissær|publisher=Danmarks Radio|date=31 August 2014 |language=da}}</ref> Despite her repeated denials of campaigning for the [[European Commissioner for the Environment|Environment portfolio]],<ref>{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: The Juncker team revealed|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-priorities-2020/exclusive-juncker-team-revealed-308203|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vestager afviser rygter: Jeg skal ikke være miljøkommissær|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/politik/article5002361.ece|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref> eventually she was designated the [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition dossier]] in the [[Juncker Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The new structure of the Juncker Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/about/juncker-commission/structure/index_en.htm|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> On 3 October 2014, she won the [[European Parliament]]'s backing following her confirmation hearing.<ref>Robin Emmott (October 3, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/eu-commission-competition-idUSL6N0RY0TD20141003 Denmark's Vestager wins backing as new EU antitrust head] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Paul Taylor (October 5, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/05/us-eu-commission-analysis-idUSKCN0HU05020141005 Juncker's team likely to survive EU power struggle] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In her confirmation hearings, Vestager said she favored settlement of cases before they come to a final executive judgment, for reduced fines or negotiated concessions from the companies.<ref>Foo Yun Chee and Alastair Macdonald (September 23, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-eu-antitrust-vestager-idUSKCN0HI26L20140923 New EU antitrust head not swayed by anti-Americanism, bullies] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Like her predecessor, [[Joaquín Almunia]], Vestager has since been focusing on [[state aid]] cases.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Within a few months in the office, she brought antitrust charges against [[Google]]; Almunia had initially opened the investigation into Google in 2010, and had reached a settlement deal with Google by 2014 but was unable to convince the European Commission to accept it before his term ended. Vestager inherited Almunia's case but has shown greater desire to continue pursuing Google/Alphabet over the alleged antitrust violations.<ref name="auto1"/> Also, she initiated investigations into the tax affairs of [[Fiat]], [[Starbucks]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Apple Inc.]] under competition rules.<ref name="auto2"/> In 2014, she launched proceedings against [[Gazprom]], one of Europe's main gas suppliers, over allegations of breaching EU antitrust rules by putting in place artificial barriers to trade with eight European countries: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-15-4834_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Statement by Commissioner Vestager on sending a Statement of Objections to Gazprom|website=europa.eu}}</ref>

In January 2015, Vestager ordered [[Cyprus Airways]] to pay back over 65 million euros in illegal [[state aid]] received in 2012 and 2013 as part of a restructuring package; as a consequence, Cyprus suspended operations at its [[flag carrier]] resulting in 550 job losses and reduced competition.<ref>Foo Yun Chee and Alastair Macdonald (January 9, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/09/us-cyprus-airlines-suspension-idUSKBN0KI1R920150109 Cyprus Airways closed down after EU state aid ruling] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Times of Malta (January 10, 2015), [http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150110/world/cyprus-airways-closed-down-after-eu-state-aid-ruling.551223 Cyprus Airways closed down after EU state aid ruling] ''[[Times of Malta]]''.</ref>

In August 2016, after a two–year investigation, Vestager announced [[Apple Inc.]] received illegal tax benefits from [[Ireland]]. The Commission ordered Apple to pay [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|a fine of €13 billion, plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes for 2004–2014]];<ref name="eu1">{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases/253200/253200_1851004_674_2.pdf#page=24|title=EU Commission Decision on State Aid by Ireland to Apple|date=30 August 2016|website=Apple (Ireland)|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>  the largest tax fine in history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4472500/apple-eu-irish-tax-bill/|title=Apple vs. the E.U.

As a result of the EU investigation, Apple agreed to re-structure out of its 2004–2014 Irish [[BEPS]] tool, the [[Double Irish]] in Q1 2015; Apple's replacement Irish [[BEPS]] tool, the [[CAIA arrangement]] caused Irish 2015 GDP to rise by 34.4 per cent,<ref name="patrick.smyth">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/explainer-apple-s-13bn-tax-appeal-has-huge-implications-1.4017044|title=Explainer: Apple's €13bn tax appeal has huge implications|author=Patrick Syth, European Editor|newspaper=[[Irish Times]]|date=13 September 2019|access-date=15 October 2019|quote=Apple has changed its own corporate structure, restructured a new Irish Beps tool called Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA), also nicknamed the “Green Jersey”.

==Political positions==
In 2013, Vestager held that “[in] our experience it’s impossible to pursue Danish interests without being close to the core of Europe.

==Personal life==
Vestager's husband is a [[gymnasium (Denmark)|gymnasium]] maths-and-philosophy teacher. They have three daughters, Maria, Rebecca, and Ella.
