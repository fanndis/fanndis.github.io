'''Rock music''' is a broad genre of [[popular music]] that originated as "[[rock and roll]]" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name=studwell>W.E. Studwell and D.F. Lonergan, ''The Classic Rock and Roll Reader: Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), {{ISBN|0-7890-0151-9}}</ref><ref>{{allmusic|explore|genre/pop-rock-d20|Pop/Rock}}</ref> It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily from the genres of [[blues]], [[rhythm and blues]], and from [[country music]]. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as [[electric blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]], classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with [[Bass guitar|electric bass]], drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a [[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time signature]] using a [[verse–chorus form]], but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.

By the late 1960s "[[Classic_rock|classic rock]]"<ref name=studwell/> period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like [[blues rock]], [[folk rock]], [[country rock]], [[southern rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[jazz rock]], many of which contributed to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which was influenced by the [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] [[psychedelia|psychedelic and hippie scene]]. New genres that emerged included [[progressive rock]], which extended the artistic elements, [[glam rock]], which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, [[punk rock]] reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and eventually [[alternative rock]]. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[indie rock]]. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including [[pop punk]], [[electronic rock]], [[rap rock]], and [[rap metal]], as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the [[garage rock]]/[[post-punk revival|post-punk]] and [[techno-pop]] revivals in the early 2000s. The late 2000s and 2010s saw a slow decline in rock music's mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with [[hip hop music|hip hop]] surpassing it as the most popular genre in the United States.

Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including [[mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[rocker (subculture)|rockers]] in the UK and the [[hippie]] counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s [[punk culture]] spawned the [[goth subculture|goth]], [[Punk subculture|punk]], and [[emo]] subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the [[protest song]], rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult [[consumerism]] and [[conformity]].{{toclimit|3}}

Since the term "rock" started being used in preference to "rock and roll" from the late-1960s, it has usually been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics, but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre's history and development.<ref name=Warner2003>T. Warner, ''Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3132-X}}, pp.&nbsp;3–4.</ref> According to [[Simon Frith]], rock was "something more than pop, something more than rock and roll" and "[r]ock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere".<ref name=Warner2003/>

In the new millennium, the term ''rock'' has occasionally been used as a [[blanket term]] including forms like pop music, [[reggae music]], [[soul music]], and even [[hip hop]], which it has been influenced with but often contrasted through much of its history.<ref>R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook and B. Saunders, "Introduction" in R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook, B. Saunders, eds, ''Rock Over the Edge: Transformations in Popular Music Culture'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-8223-2900-X}}, p. 7.</ref> Christgau has used the term broadly to refer to popular and [[semipopular music]] that cater to his sensibility as "a rock-and-roller", including a fondness for a good beat, a meaningful lyric with some wit, and the theme of youth, which holds an "eternal attraction" so objective "that all youth music partakes of sociology and the [[field research|field report]]." Writing in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s]]'' (1990), he said this sensibility is evident in the music of folk singer-songwriter [[Michelle Shocked]], rapper [[LL Cool J]], and synth-pop duo [[Pet Shop Boys]]—"all kids working out their identities"—as much as it is in the music of [[Chuck Berry]], [[the Ramones]], and [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]].<ref name="CG80s">{{cite book|first= Robert |last= Christgau |author-link= Robert Christgau |year= 1990 |title= [[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s]] |publisher= [[Pantheon Books]] |isbn= 0-679-73015-X |chapter= Introduction: Canons and Listening Lists|chapter-url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg80/in_canons.php |access-date= 6 April 2019}}</ref>

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various [[African-American music|black musical]] genres of the time, including [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music]], with [[country music|country and western]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002BrithofR&R">R.

Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as [[Carl Perkins]], Jerry Lee Lewis, [[Buddy Holly]] and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.<ref name=AllmusicRbilly>{{Citation|title=Rockabilly |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d187|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQb3jHWo?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d187 |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref> [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] movements in rock and roll, which would eventually lead to the success of [[Latin rock]] and [[Chicano rock]] within the US, began to rise in [[Southwestern United States|the Southwest]]; with rock and roll standard musician [[Ritchie Valens]] and even those within other heritage genres, such as [[Al Hurricane]] along with his brothers Tiny Morrie and Baby Gaby as they began combining rock and roll with country-[[Western music (North America)|western]] within traditional [[New Mexico music]].<ref name="Lucero">{{cite web | last=Lucero | first=Mario J. | title=The problem with how the music streaming industry handles data | website=Quartz | url=https://qz.com/1773480/the-problem-with-how-the-music-streaming-industry-handles-data/ | access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Other styles like [[doo wop]] placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 1940s African American vocal groups.<ref name="R.

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, [[The Big Bopper]] and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the [[payola]] scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2008|p=99}}</ref>

The British Invasion greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many (often [[Surf rock|surf]] or [[hot rod]] groups) to adopt a British influence, and encouraging many more groups to form.<ref name=AllmusicGarage/> Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits.<ref name=AllmusicGarage>R.

Although the first impact of the [[British Invasion]] on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American [[blues]], including [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]].<ref>H.S.

The other key focus for British blues was [[John Mayall]]; his band, [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|the Bluesbreakers]], included [[Eric Clapton]] (after Clapton's departure from the Yardbirds) and later [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Particularly significant was the release of ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton]] (Beano)'' album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States.<ref>T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C.

Many of the songs on their first three albums, and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs.<ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/>

In America, blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist [[Lonnie Mack]],<ref>P. Prown, H.P. Newquist and J.F. Eiche, ''Legends of Rock Guitar: the Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists'' (Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997), {{ISBN|0-7935-4042-9}}, p. 25.</ref> but the genre began to take off in the mid-1960s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included [[Paul Butterfield]] (whose band acted like Mayall's Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), [[Canned Heat]], the early [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[the J. Geils Band]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] with his [[power trios]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] (which included two British members, and was founded in Britain), and [[Band of Gypsys]], whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade.<ref name="Bogdanov2003BluesRock" /> Blues rock bands from the southern states, like the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], and [[ZZ Top]], incorporated [[Country music|country]] elements into their style to produce the distinctive genre [[Southern rock]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002SouthernRock>R. Unterberger, "Southern Rock", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&nbsp;1332–33.</ref>

Early blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock. From about 1967 bands like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience had moved away from purely blues-based music into [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]].<ref name="amg" /> By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and [[Deep Purple]], and the lines between blues rock and [[hard rock]] "were barely visible",<ref name="amg" /> as bands began recording rock-style albums.<ref name="amg">{{Citation|title=Blues-rock |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d50|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wR7EB7K0?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d50 |archive-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref> The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as [[George Thorogood]] and [[Pat Travers]],<ref name=Bogdanov2003BluesRock/> but, particularly on the British scene (except perhaps for the advent of groups such as [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] and [[Foghat]] who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive [[boogie rock]]), bands became focused on [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] innovation, and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.<ref>P.

These acts directly influenced British performers like Donovan and [[Fairport Convention]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002FolkRock/> In 1969 Fairport Convention abandoned their mixture of American covers and Dylan-influenced songs to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments.<ref>M.

Larkin, ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' (London: Guinness, 1992), {{ISBN|1-882267-04-4}}, p. 869.</ref>

In the late 1960s, jazz-rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues-rock, psychedelic, and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. [[AllMusic]] states that the term jazz-rock "may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation." Jazz-rock "...generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s", including the [[singer-songwriter]] movement.<ref name="AMJazzRock" /> Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Jack Bruce]] of the [[Eric Clapton]]-fronted band [[Cream (band)|Cream]], had emerged from the [[British jazz]] scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York-based [[the Free Spirits]] with ''Out of Sight and Sound'' (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like [[Electric Flag]], Blood, Sweat & Tears and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and the early 1970s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/>

British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]]<ref>I. Carr, D. Fairweather and B. Priestley, ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|1-84353-256-5}}, p. iii.</ref> and the [[Graham Bond]] and John Mayall spin-off [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]]. From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine, who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with [[Miles Davis]], particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Weather Report]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/> The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience,<ref name=AMJazzRock>{{Citation|title=Jazz-Rock Music Genre Overview |journal=Allmusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110216015609/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archive-date =16 February 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> but acts like [[Steely Dan]],<ref name=AMJazzRock/> Frank Zappa and [[Joni Mitchell]] recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock>R.

==Early 1970s==
Reflecting on developments in rock music at the start of the 1970s, [[Robert Christgau]] later wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981):<ref name="CG"/>

{{quote|The decade is, of course, an arbitrary schema itself—time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts—money, say—the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. "The '60s are over," a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].}}

Rock saw greater commodification during this decade, turning into a multibillion-dollar industry and doubling its [[Market (economics)|market]] while, as Christgau noted, suffering a significant "loss of cultural prestige". "Maybe the [[Bee Gees]] became more popular than the Beatles, but they were never [[more popular than Jesus]]", he said. "Insofar as the music retained any mythic power, the myth was [[self-referential]] — there were lots of songs about the rock and roll life but very few about how rock could change the world, except as a new brand of painkiller ... In the '70s the powerful took over, as rock [[industrialist]]s capitalized on the national mood to reduce potent music to an often reactionary species of entertainment—and to transmute rock's popular base from the audience to market."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0-89919-025-1|chapter=The Decade|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php|via=robertchristgau.com|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref>

The origins of glam rock are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo to [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the BBC music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), "[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]".<ref>Mark Paytress, ''Bolan – The Rise And Fall of a 20th Century Superstar'' ([[Omnibus Press]] 2002) {{ISBN|0-7119-9293-2}}, pp. 180–181.</ref> From 1971, already a minor star, [[David Bowie]] developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.<ref name=Auslander2006p72>P.

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.<ref name=BogdanovPunk>J. Dougan, "Punk Music", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], pp.&nbsp;1335–36.</ref> They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic|DIY (do it yourself) ethic]], with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.<ref>A. Rodel, "Extreme Noise Terror: Punk Rock and the Aesthetics of Badness", in C. Washburne and M. Derno, eds, ''Bad Music: The Music We Love to Hate'' (New York: Routledge), {{ISBN|0-415-94365-5}}, pp. 235–56.</ref>

By late 1976, acts such as the [[Ramones]] and [[Patti Smith]], in New York City, and the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]], in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement.<ref name=BogdanovPunk/> The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated [[punk subculture]] emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|clothing styles]] and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].<ref>R.

By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and [[Oi!]] had become the predominant mode of punk rock.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skott-Myhre |first=Hans A. |title=Youth and Subculture as Creative Force: Creating New Spaces for Radical Youth Work |year=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto, Canada |isbn=978-1-4426-0992-1 |page=xi}}</ref> This has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk, such as [[D-beat]] (a distortion-heavy subgenre influenced by the UK band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]), [[anarcho-punk]] (such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]]), [[grindcore]] (such as [[Napalm Death]]), and [[crust punk]].<ref>T.

Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales (being distributed by small specialty labels such as [[Stiff Records]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Waksman|2009|p=157}}</ref> or American radio airplay (as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as [[disco]] and [[album-oriented rock]]).<ref>E.

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 1980s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were [[the Velvet Underground]], Frank Zappa and [[Captain Beefheart]], and the New York-based [[no wave]] scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as [[James Chance and the Contortions]], [[DNA (American band)|DNA]] and [[Sonic Youth]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk">S.T.

The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Pop Group]], [[the Mekons]], [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and the [[Teardrop Explodes]], tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.<ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/> Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland's [[U2]], who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.<ref>F.W.

American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, [[blue-collar]] American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe [[American Midwest|Midwestern]] [[arena rock]] groups like [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirkpatrick |first=Rob |title=The Words and Music of Bruce Springsteen |year=2007 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |isbn=978-0-275-98938-5 |page=51}}</ref> It has been seen as an American Midwest and [[Rust Belt]] counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=138}}</ref> Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and New Wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and [[Van Morrison]], and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the Rolling Stones.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland>{{Citation|title=Heartland Rock |journal=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d7710|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2uWL5o?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d7710 |archive-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref>

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Tom Petty]], along with less widely known acts such as [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]] and [[Joe Grushecky|Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers]], it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's ''[[Born in the USA]]'' (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steve Earle]] and more gentle singer-songwriters such as [[Bruce Hornsby]].<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as [[Billy Joel]],<ref>{{Citation|last=J.A.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue-collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labeled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri's [[The Bottle Rockets|Bottle Rockets]] and Illinois' [[Uncle Tupelo]], often find themselves labeled [[alt-country]].<ref>{{Citation|last=S.

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music.

Few of these early bands achieved mainstream success, although exceptions to this rule include R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Cure. Despite a general lack of spectacular album sales, the original alternative rock bands exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the US during the 1980s included [[jangle pop]], associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as [[10,000 Maniacs]] and [[the Feelies]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> In the UK Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade indie or dream pop<ref>{{Citation|title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |last=N.

The term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and subsequent hiatus of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound.<ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/> Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, pop-punk, [[alternative metal]] or hard rock.<ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/> The term post-grunge originally was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an "authentic" rock movement.<ref name=Grierson/> Originally, grunge bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and were suspected of emulating the grunge sound were pejoratively labelled as post-grunge.<ref name=Grierson/> From 1994, former Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]]'s new band, the [[Foo Fighters]], helped popularize the genre and define its parameters.<ref name=Bogdanov2002FooFighters>S.T. Erlewine, "Foo Fighters", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], p. 423.</ref>

Some post-grunge bands, like [[Candlebox]], were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like Los Angeles' [[Audioslave]], and Georgia's [[Collective Soul]] and beyond the US to Australia's [[Silverchair]] and Britain's [[Bush (band)|Bush]], who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the late 1990s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/><ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/> Although male bands predominated post-grunge, female solo artist [[Alanis Morissette]]'s 1995 album ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'', labelled as post-grunge, also became a multi-platinum hit.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Alanis>S.T. Erlewine, "Alanis Morissette", in [[#CITEREFBogdanovWoodstraErlewine2002|Bogdanov et al., 2002]], p. 761.</ref> Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands like [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Nickelback]] emerged.<ref name=Grierson/> Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including [[Shinedown]], [[Seether]], [[3 Doors Down]] and [[Puddle of Mudd]].<ref name=Grierson>{{Citation|last=T.

The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like [[Buzzcocks]] and [[the Clash]], commercially successful new wave acts such as [[the Jam]] and [[the Undertones]], and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s.<ref name=LambPunkPop>{{Citation

Post-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in the Chicago and Washington, DC areas, in the early to mid-1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.<ref name=AMPost-Hardcore>{{Citation|title=Post-hardcore |journal=Allmusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505171528/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archive-date=5 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Role of women===

[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal although bands such as [[Within Temptation]] have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments. According to Schaap and Berkers, "playing in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based ... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.<ref>J. Schaap and P. Berkers, "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', vol.4(1) (2014), pp. 101–02.</ref> They note that rock music "is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture."<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p102">J. Schaap and P. Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', Vol.4 (1), (2014), p. 102,</ref> (The theory of "bedroom culture" argues that society influences girls to not engage in crime and deviance by virtually trapping them in their bedroom; it was developed by a sociologist named [[Angela McRobbie]].) In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p102"/> "Several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities".<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104">J. Schaap and P. Berkers, "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music'', Vol.4(1), (2014), p. 104.</ref> "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated{{snd}}hence, inferior{{snd}}pop music ..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians".<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104"/> One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity{{snd}}social bonds between people of the same sex ... {{snd}}plays a crucial role".<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104"/> In the 1960s rock music scene, "singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument ... simply wasn't done".<ref name="rebeatmag.com">{{cite web|first=Erika|last=White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=28 January 2015 |access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref>

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women{{snd}}often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens{{snd}}in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends ...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".<ref name="Auslander2004">{{cite journal | last = Auslander | first = Philip | date = 28 January 2004 | title = I Wanna Be Your Man: Suzi Quatro's musical androgyny | journal = Popular Music | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | location = United Kingdom | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/S0261143004000030 | access-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130524032035/http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date = 24 May 2013 }}</ref> In relation to the gender composition of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal bands]], it has been said that "[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male"<ref name="Brake 1990 87–91">{{cite book |last=Brake |first=Mike |editor1-last=Frith |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Goodwin |editor2-first=Andrew  |title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word |publisher=Routledge |date=1990  |pages=87–91 |chapter=Heavy Metal Culture, Masculinity and Iconography }}</ref> "...at least until the mid-1980s"<ref>{{cite book |last=Walser |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=Running with the Devil:Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=76 }}</ref> apart from "...exceptions such as [[Girlschool]]".<ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"/> However, "...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Chuck |date=1 July 2011 |title=Women of Metal |journal=Spin |publisher=SpinMedia Group}}</ref> "carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kim |date=17 January 2013 |title=Queens of noise: heavy metal encourages heavy-hitting women |journal=The Telegraph}}</ref> When [[Suzi Quatro]] emerged in 1973, "no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader".<ref name="Auslander2004"/> According to Auslander, she was "kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female ''musician''&nbsp;... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about&nbsp;... could play as well if not better than the boys".<ref name="Auslander2004"/>

An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in genres such as rock and blues which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.<ref>For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101120717/http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud |date=1 November 2012 }} and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [https://archive.today/20120728103723/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].</ref>
