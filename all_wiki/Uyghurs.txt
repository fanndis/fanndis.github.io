The Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a series of [[oasis|oases]] scattered across the [[Taklamakan Desert]] within the [[Tarim Basin]]. These oases have historically existed as independent states or were controlled by many [[civilization]]s including [[History of China|China]], the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetans]] and various [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic polities]]. The Uyghurs gradually started to become Islamized in the 10th century and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the 16th century. Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity.

An estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin.{{sfn|Dillon|2004|p=24}} The rest of Xinjiang's Uyghurs mostly live in [[Ürümqi]], the capital city of Xinjiang UAR, which is located in the historical region of [[Dzungaria]].

The Uyghurs also appear in Chinese records under other names. The earliest record of a Uyghur tribe appears in accounts from the [[Northern Wei]] (4th–6th century A.D.). They are described as the {{lang|zh|{{linktext|高车}} / {{linktext|高車}}}} (<small>lit.</small> "High Carts"), read as ''Gāochē'' in [[Mandarin Chinese]] but originally with the reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation *[kɑutɕʰĭa]. This in turn has been connected to the [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''Qangqil'' ({{lang|ug|قاڭقىل}} or Қаңқил). They were later known as the ''[[Tiele people|Tiele]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|铁勒}} / {{linktext|鐵勒}}}}, ''Tiělè'').{{sfn|Mair|2006|pp=137–8}}

Throughout its history the term ''Uyghur'' has had an increasingly expansive definition. Initially signifying only a small coalition of [[Tiele people|Tiele]] tribes in Northern China, Mongolia and the [[Altai Mountains]], it later denoted citizenship in the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. Finally, it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842, causing Uyghur migration from [[Mongolia]] into the Tarim Basin.

This migration assimilated and replaced the various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers of the region to create a distinct identity because the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo-European influences. This fluid definition of ''Uyghur'' and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion as to what constitutes true Uyghur [[ethnography]] and [[ethnogenesis]]. Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of peoples, including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia migrating into the Tarim Basin after the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate, Iranic [[Saka]] tribes and other Indo-European peoples inhabiting the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Turkic Uyghurs.<ref name="xinjiang">{{cite book |author1=James A.

{{quote|The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travelers called "[[Sart]]" (a name they used for sedentary, Turkish-speaking Central Asians in general), while Western travelers called them Turki, in recognition of their language. The Chinese used to call them "Ch'an-t'ou" ('Turbaned Heads') but this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified themselves with the oasis they came from, such as Kashgar or Turfan.|Owen Lattimore, "Return to China's Northern Frontier."

Rian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]] (the native Uyghur name for Eastern Turkestan or Southern Xinjiang) before the adoption of the name "Uyghur" in the 1930s, referring to them by the name "Altishahri" in his article ''Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism''. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq and the Han Chinese [[Khitan people|Khitay]] before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used for their identity; various native names Altishahris used for identify were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki and Musulmān (Muslim); the term Musulmān in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz while identifying themselves as Musulmān.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=6 August 2012 |title=Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/1558522 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=627–653 |doi=10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904025819/http://www.academia.edu/1558522/Modular_History_Identity_Maintenance_before_Uyghur_Nationalism |archive-date=4 September 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Thum2014">{{cite book|author=Rian Thum|title=The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqOmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|date=13 October 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-96702-1|pages=149–|access-date=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109085622/https://books.google.com/books?id=QqOmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=9 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Dr. Laura J Newby says the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people considered themselves separate  from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Empire And the Khanate: A Political History of Qing Relations With Khoqand c.1760-1860 |first=L.

According to the paper by Li ''et al.'':

{{Quotation|... the western East Asians are more closely related to Uyghurs than the eastern East Asians. ... STRUCTURE cannot distinguish recent admixture from a cline of other origin, and these analyses cannot prove admixture in the Uyghurs; however, historical records indicate that the present Uyghurs were formed by admixture between [[Tocharians]] from the west and Orkhon Uyghurs (Wugusi-Huihu, according to present Chinese pronunciation) from the east in the 8th century AD. The Uyghur Empire was originally located in Mongolia and conquered the Tocharian tribes in Xinjiang. Tocharians such as [[Kroran]] have been shown by archaeological findings to appear phenotypically similar to northern Europeans, whereas the Orkhon Uyghur people were clearly Mongolians. The two groups of people subsequently mixed in Xinjiang to become one population, the present Uyghurs. We do not know the genetic constitution of the Tocharians, but if they were similar to western Siberians, such as the Khanty, admixture would already be biased toward similarity with East Asian populations.|<ref name="cite journal|pmc=2790568">{{cite journal|pmc=2790568|title=Genetic Landscape of Eurasia and "Admixture" in Uyghurs|year=2009|volume=85|issue=6|pmid=20004770|last1=Li|first1=H|last2=Cho|first2=K|last3=Kidd|first3=JR|last4=Kidd|first4=KK|pages=934–7; author reply 937–9|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.024|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics}}</ref>}}

A 2017 genetic analysis of 951 samples of Uyghurs from 14 geographical subpopulations in Xinjiang observes a southwest and northeast differentiation in the population caused by the [[Tianshan Mountains]], which form a natural barrier, with gene flow from the east and west into these separated groups of people.  The study identifies four major ancestral components that may have arisen from two earlier admixed groups: one from the West with European (25–37%) and South West Asian ancestries (12–20%); another from the East with Siberian (15–17%) and East Asian ancestries (29–47%). It identifies an ancient wave of settlers that arrived around 3,750 years ago, dating that corresponds with the [[Tarim mummies]] of 4,000–2,000 years ago of a people with European features, and a more recent wave that occurred around 750 years ago.  The analysis suggests the Uyghurs are most closely related to Central Asian populations such as the  [[Hazaras]] of [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Uzbeks]], followed by the East Asian and West Eurasian populations. While the Uyghur populations show significant diversity, the differences between them are smaller than those between Uyghurs and non-Uyghurs.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic History of Xinjiang's Uyghurs Suggests Bronze Age Multiple-Way Contacts in Eurasia |author1=Qidi Feng |author2=Yan Lu |author3=Xumin Ni |author4=Kai Yuan |author5=Yajun Yang |author6=Xiong Yang |author7=Chang Liu |author8=Haiyi Lou |author9=Zhilin Ning |author10=Yuchen Wang |author11=Dongsheng Lu |author12=Chao Zhang |author13=Ying Zhou |author14=Meng Shi |author15=Lei Tian |author16=Xiaoji Wang |author17=Xi Zhang |author18=Jing Li |author19=Asifullah Khan |author20=Yaqun Guan |author21=Kun Tang |author22=Sijia Wang |author23=Shuhua Xu |display-authors=3 |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume =34| issue= 10|date= October 2017|pages =2572–2582|doi=10.1093/molbev/msx177 |pmid= 28595347 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Early history===
Discovery of well-preserved [[Tarim mummies]] of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of a European-looking people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1800 BCE. These people may have been of [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] origin, and some have suggested them to be the [[Yuezhi]] mentioned in ancient Chinese texts.<ref>{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=14|isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia |author=A.

Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the [[Dingling]] as well as the [[Xiongnu]] who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years. Some Uyghur nationalists also claimed descent from the Xiongnu (according to the Chinese historical text the ''[[Book of Wei]]'', the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler),{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=155}} but the view is contested by modern Chinese scholars.<ref name="Tursun"/>

The Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu but founded the [[Kushan Empire]], which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin, where [[Kharosthi]] texts have been found in [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], [[Niya (Tarim Basin)|Niya]] and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]]. Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the [[Han Dynasty]]; others include [[Kucha]], [[Turfan]], [[Karasahr]] and [[Kashgar]].

[[File:Uighur Prince.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 8th-century Uyghur Khagan]]

The Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the [[Tiele people|Tiele]],{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=157}} who lived in the valleys south of [[Lake Baikal]] and around the [[Yenisei River]]. They overthrew the [[First Turkic Khaganate]] and established the [[Uyghur Khaganate]].

The Uyghur Khaganate stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]] and lasted from 744 to 840.<ref name="xinjiang"/> It was administered from the imperial capital [[Ordu-Baliq]], one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]], another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.

According to the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', the Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate, to live among the [[Karluks]] and to places such as [[Gansu]].{{NoteTag|"Soon the great chief Julumohe and the Kirghiz gathered a hundred thousand riders to attack the Uyghur city; they killed the Kaghan, executed Jueluowu, and burnt the royal camp. All the tribes were scattered – its ministers Sazhi and Pang Tele with fifteen clans fled to the Karluks, the remaining multitude went to Tibet and [[Guazhou County|Anxi]]."

The modern [[Yugur]]s are believed to be descendants of these Uyghurs. Ganzhou was absorbed by the [[Western Xia]] in 1036.

The second Uyghur kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Qocho]], also known as ''Uyghuristan'' in its later period, was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in Qocho (modern [[Gaochang]]) and [[Jimsar County|Beshbalik]]. The Kingdom of Qocho lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century and proved to be longer-lasting than any power in the region, before or since.<ref name="xinjiang"/> The Uyghurs were originally [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but converted to Buddhism during this period. Qocho accepted the [[Qara Khitai]] as its overlord in the 1130s, and in 1209 submitted voluntarily to the rising [[Mongol Empire]]. The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the [[Mongol Empire]], but was finally destroyed by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] by the end of the 14th century.<ref name="xinjiang"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rLUbuZLiaIC&pg=PA480|title=Dust in the Wind: Retracing Dharma Master Xuanzang's Western Pilgrimage |page=480 |isbn=9789868141988 |publisher=Rhythms Monthly |date=2006}}</ref>

===Islamization===
{{Main|Islamization and Turkification of Xinjiang}}
{{Islam and China|groups}}

In the tenth century, the [[Karluks]], [[Yagma]]s, [[Chigils]] and other Turkic tribes founded the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in [[Semirechye]], Western [[Tian Shan]], and [[Kashgaria]] and later conquered [[Transoxiana]]. The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the [[Toquz Oghuz]] and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=69}}

The Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century beginning with [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]], the first Turkic dynasty to do so.<ref name="sinor">{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter.

The Indo-Iranian [[Sakas|Saka]] Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] was conquered by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early 11th century, but Uyghur Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the 15th century, and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the 17th century.

[[File:Chagatai Khanate (1490).png|thumb|left|[[Chagatai Khanate]] ([[Moghulistan]]) in 1490]]

The 12th and 13th century saw the domination by non-Muslim powers: first the [[Kara-Khitans]] in the 12th century, followed by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the 13th century. After the death of [[Genghis Khan]] in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, [[Chagatai Khan]]. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of [[Moghulistan]], which meant "land of the Mongols". In the 14th century, a Chagatayid khan [[Tughlugh Timur|Tughluq Temür]] converted to Islam, [[Genghisid]] [[Mongolian nobility|Mongol nobilities]] also followed him to convert to Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/477955/Uyghur-History-in-Britanica|title=Uyghur-History-in-Britanica|website=www.scribd.com|access-date=20 February 2013|archive-date=4 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104151748/https://www.scribd.com/document/477955/Uyghur-History-in-Britanica|url-status=dead}}</ref> His son [[Khizr Khoja]] conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century.<ref name="Millward2007">{{cite book|author=James A.

From the late 14th through 17th centuries the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north, [[Altishahr]] (Kashgar and the Tarim Basin), and the Turfan area, each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants, the [[Dughlats]], and later the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]].{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=69}}

Islam was also spread by the [[Sufis]], and branches of its [[Naqshbandi]] order were the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]] who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the 17th century. The Khojas however split into two rival factions, the Aqtaghlik Khojas (also called the Afaqiyya) and the Qarataghlik Khojas (the Ishaqiyya). The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the 19th century. The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate, forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile.

===Qing rule===
In the 17th century, the Buddhist [[Dzungar Khanate]] grew in power in [[Dzungaria]]. The [[Dzungar conquest of Altishahr]] ended the last independent Chagatai Khanate, the [[Yarkent Khanate]], after the Aqtaghlik [[Afaq Khoja]] attempt to gain aid from the [[5th Dalai Lama]] and his Dzungar Buddhist followers to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas. The Aqtaghlik Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the Dzungars.

The expansion of the Dzungars into [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha Mongol]] territory in [[Mongolia]] brought them into direct conflict with [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] in the late 17th century, and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after Tang China lost control of the [[Western Regions]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Wild West China: The Taming of Xinjiang |author=Christian Tyler|page=55 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0813535333 }}</ref>

The [[Dzungar–Qing War]] lasted a decade. During the Dzungar conflict, two Aqtaghlik brothers, the so-called "Younger Khoja" ({{zh|c=霍集佔}}), also known as Khwāja-i Jahān, and his sibling, the Elder Khoja ({{zh|c=波羅尼都}}), also known as Burhān al-Dīn, after being appointed as vassals in the Tarim Basin by the Dzungars, first joined the Qing and rebelled against Dzungar rule until the final Qing victory over the Dzungars, then they rebelled against the Qing, an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in 1759. The Uyghurs of Turfan and Hami such as [[Emin Khoja]] were allies of the Qing in this conflict, and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.<ref>{{cite book |author = Millward, James A. |year=2007 |title= Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |publisher= Columbia University Press, New York |page=101 |isbn= 978-0-231-13924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA101 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3107653|title=The Begs of Xinjiang: Between Two Worlds|last=Newby|first=L.

In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. By 1920, Pan-Turkic [[Jadidist]]s had become a challenge to Chinese warlord [[Yang Zengxin]] who controlled Xinjiang. Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. Twice, in 1933 and 1944, the Uyghurs successfully gained their independence (backed by the Soviet Communist leader [[Joseph Stalin]]): the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] was a short-lived attempt at independence around [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashghar]], and it was destroyed during the [[Kumul Rebellion]] by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army under General [[Ma Zhancang]] and [[Ma Fuyuan]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]]. The [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] was a Soviet puppet Communist state that existed from 1944 to 1949 in the three districts of what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]] during the [[Ili Rebellion]] while the majority of Xinjiang was under the control of the Republic of China. Religious Uyghur separatists from the First East Turkestan Republic like [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]] opposed the Soviet Communist backed Uyghur separatists of the Second East Turkestan Republic under Ehmetjan Qasim and they supported the Republic of China during the Ili Rebellion.

Mao declared the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949. He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], and appointed [[Saifuddin Azizi]] as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Uyghurs are the largest ethnicity, mostly concentrated in the south-western Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite book |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:2000年人口普查中國民族人口資料 |publisher={{lang|zh|民族出版社}} |year=2003 |isbn=978-7-105-05425-1}}</ref>
The Xinjiang conflict is an ongoing separatist conflict in China's far-west province of Xinjiang, whose northern region is known as Dzungaria and whose southern region (the Tarim Basin) is known as East Turkestan. Uyghur separatists and independence movements claim that the Second East Turkestan Republic was illegally incorporated by China in 1949 and has since been under Chinese occupation.

The Uyghur troops led by Hala were ordered by the Ming Emperor to crush [[Miao people|Miao]] rebellions and were given titles by him.

In addition to eating pork, the Uyghurs of [[Changde]] Hunan practice other Han Chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves. Some Uyghurs from Xinjiang visit the Hunan Uyghurs out of curiosity or interest. Also, the Uyghurs of Hunan do not speak the [[Uyghur language]], instead, they speak Chinese{{clarify|reason=What Chinese language?|date=December 2019}} as their native language and Arabic for religious reasons at the mosque.<ref name="Shih" />

The ancient Uyghurs believed in many local deities. These practices gave rise to [[Shamanism]] and [[Tengrism]]. Uighurs also practiced aspects of [[Zoroastrianism]]. The strong dichotomy between good and evil was often represented symbolically by fire and darkness. The Uyghur had [[Fire altar|fire altars]] like those that existed in regions of Iran, and they were also useful in daily life as a constant source of fire. The exact date that the Uigur people adapted [[Manichaeism]] as a state religion has been contested by many academics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moriyasu|first=Takao|date=2015-10-13|title=New Developments in the History of East Uighur Manichaeism|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/opth/open-issue/article-10.1515-opth-2015-0016/article-10.1515-opth-2015-0016.xml|journal=Open Theology|language=en|volume=-1|issue=open-issue|doi=10.1515/opth-2015-0016|doi-access=free}}</ref> However, the leading theory is that the Uighur King Moyou Qayan facilitated this process in the year 762 or 763 when a Manichean cleric named Ruixi helped Moyou Qayan establish Manichaeism as the state religion for the Uighur people.

The ancient people of the Tarim Basin originally spoke different languages such as [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], [[Saka language|Saka]] (Khotanese), and [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]]. The Turkic people who moved into the region in the 9th century brought with them their languages, which slowly supplanted the original tongues of the local inhabitants. In the 11th century [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] noted that the Uyghurs (of Qocho) spoke a pure Turkic language, but they also still spoke another language among themselves and had two different scripts. He also noted that the people of Khotan did not know Turkic well and had their own language and script ([[Saka language|Khotanese]]).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&pg=PA72 |title=slamic Central Asia: An Anthology of Historical Sources |author1=Scott Cameron Levi |author2=Ron Sela |page=72 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0253353856 |access-date=2015-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=SAX5ohFkcVgC&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=2016-01-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> Writers of the Karakhanid period, Al-Kashgari and [[Yusuf Balasagun]], referred to their Turkic language as ''Khāqāniyya'' (meaning royal) or the "language of Kashgar" or simply Turkic.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mehmet Fuat Köprülü|author2=Gary Leiser|author3=Robert Dankoff|title=Early Mystics in Turkish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v6IWkCLnEwC&pg=PA158|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-36686-1|pages=158–|access-date=2015-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=_v6IWkCLnEwC&pg=PA158#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund Herzig|title=The Age of the Seljuqs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML2bBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|date=30 November 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-947-9|pages=23–|access-date=22 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=ML2bBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The modern Uyghur language is classified under the [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. It is closely related to [[Äynu language|Äynu]], [[Lop language|Lop]], [[Ili Turki language|Ili Turki]] and [[Chagatay language|Chagatay]] (the East Karluk languages) and slightly less closely to [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] (which is West Karluk). The Uyghur language is an [[agglutinative language]] and has a [[subject-object-verb]] word order. It has [[vowel harmony]] like other Turkic languages and has noun and verb [[Grammatical case|cases]] but lacks distinction of gender forms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/pamphlets/Uyghur.pdf |title=Uyghur |work=Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region |publisher=Indiana University |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607223811/http://www.indiana.edu/~celcar/pamphlets/uyghur.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-07 }}</ref>

Modern Uyghurs have adopted a number of scripts for their language. The [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], known as the [[Chagatay alphabet]], was adopted along with Islam. This alphabet is known as Kona Yëziq (old script). Political changes in the 20th century led to numerous reforms of the scripts, for example the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]-based [[Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet]], a Latin [[Uyghur New Script]] and later a reformed [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]], which represents all vowels, unlike Kona Yëziq. A new Latin version, the [[Uyghur Latin alphabet]], was also devised in the 21st century.

In the 1990s many Uyghurs in parts of Xinjiang could not speak [[Mandarin Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/china00pete/page/304|title=China the Silk Routes|author=Peter Neville-Hadley|series=[[Cadogan Guides]]|publisher=[[Globe Pequot Press]]|page=304|year=1997|quote=Travelling east from Khotan{...}Many Uighurs speak no Chinese at all, and most hotels are even less likely to have English speakers than those elsewhere in China.}}</ref>

The literary works of the ancient Uyghurs were mostly translations of Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hk.plm.org.cn/e_book/xz-11348.pdf |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:西域、 敦煌文獻所見回鵲之佛經翻譯 |website=hk.plm.org.cn }}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> but there were also narrative, poetic and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs. However it is the literature of the Kara-Khanid period that is considered by modern Uyghurs to be the important part of their literary traditions. Amongst these are Islamic religious texts and histories of [[Turkic peoples]], and important works surviving from that era are ''[[Kutadgu Bilig]]'', "Wisdom of Royal Glory" by [[Yusuf Khass Hajib]] (1069–70), [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s ''Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk'', "A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects" (1072) and Ehmed Yükneki's ''Etebetulheqayiq''.

{{Listen|filename=Chirayliq.ogg|title=Uyghur folk music with modern influence|description=An example of modern Uyghur music}}

[[Muqam]] is the classical musical style. The '''12 Muqams''' are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system was developed among the Uyghur in North-West [[China]] and Central Asia over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic [[maqama]]t [[Mode (music)|modal]] system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]]. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of [[Xinjiang]], such as [[Dolan people|Dolan]], [[Yining|Ili]], [[Hami|Kumul]] and [[Turpan]]. The most fully developed at this point is the Western [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded by the traditional performers [[Turdi Akhun]] and [[Omar Akhun]] among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs, as in Turkish [[Taqsim|taksim]] performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.

The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by [[UNESCO]] as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2011-08-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514084005/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=21 |archive-date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>

[[Amannisa Khan]], sometimes called Amanni Shahan (1526–1560), is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |title=Kashgar Welcome You! |publisher=Kashi.gov.cn |accessdate=2011-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721181818/http://www.kashi.gov.cn/English/Tourism/Customs/12muqams.htm |archive-date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments; they had 62 different kinds of musical instrument and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a "[[Dutar|duttar]]".

During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang's [[Silk Road]] discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded [[arch]] [[ceiling]]s often divided into four sections, each with a [[mural]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The effect is of an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, [[Persians]] and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naïve while others are masterpieces of religious art.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.showcaves.com/english/cn/misc/Bezeklik.html |title= Bizaklik Thousand Buddha Caves |website= www.showcaves.com |accessdate= 2007-09-21 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103033/http://www.showcaves.com/english/cn/misc/Bezeklik.html |archive-date= 2007-09-29 }}</ref>

===Education===
Historically, the education level of Old Uyghur people was higher than the other ethnicities around them. The Buddhist Uyghurs of Qocho became the civil servants of Mongol Empire and Old Uyghur Buddhists enjoyed a high status in the Mongol empire. They also introduced the written [[Mongolian script|script]] for the [[Mongolian language]]. In the Islamic era, education was provided by the mosques and [[Madrasa|madrassas]].

Uyghur traditional medicine is [[Unani]] (طب یونانی) medicine as used in the [[Mughal Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Justin Jon Rudelson |author2=Justin Ben-Adam Rudelson |title=Oasis Identities: Uyghur Nationalism Along China's Silk Road |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MT2D_0_eBPQC&q=rudelson+unani&pg=PA84 |year=1997 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-10786-0 |pages=84–}}</ref> Sir [[Percy Sykes]] described the medicine as "based on the ancient Greek theory" and mentioned how ailments and sicknesses were treated in ''Through Deserts and Oases of Central Asia''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5yAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA318#v=onepage&q&f=false Sykes & Sykes 1920] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=BC5yAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA318#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-01-01 }}, p. 317-321.</ref> Today, traditional medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms and disease history and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically, Uyghur medical knowledge has contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients and symptom detection.<ref name="Bellér-Hann2008">{{cite book |author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann |title=Community Matters in Xinjiang, 1880-1949: Towards a Historical Anthropology of the Uyghur |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA81 |year=2008 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-16675-2 |pages=81– |access-date=2016-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109084148/https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=2017-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Xinjiang cuisine}}
[[File:Uyghur polu closeup.JPG|thumb|Uyghur ''[[Pilaf|polu]]'' ({{lang|ug-Arab|پولۇ}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|полу}})]]
Uyghur food shows both [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] elements. A typical Uyghur dish is ''polu'' (or [[pilaf]]), a dish found throughout Central Asia. In a common version of the Uyghur ''polu'', carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onions, then rice and water are added and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. ''Kawaplar'' ({{lang-ug|Каваплар}}) or ''[[chuanr]]'' (i.e., [[kebab]]s or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is ''[[leghmen]]'' ({{lang|ug-Arab|لەغمەن}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|ләғмән}}), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (''säy'', from Chinese ''cai'', {{lang|zh|{{linktext|菜}}}}) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, chili peppers and cabbage. This dish is likely to have originated from the Chinese ''[[lamian]]'', but its flavor and preparation method are distinctively Uyghur.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&pg=PA190 |title=Situating the Uyghurs between China and Central Asia|chapter= Chapter 10, ''Polo'', ''läghmän'', ''So Säy'': Situating Uyghur Food Between Central Asia and China|author=M Critina Cesàro|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|pages=185–202|accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref>

Uyghur food ({{lang|ug-Latn|Uyghur Yemekliri}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|Уйғур Йәмәклири}}) is characterized by [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], [[beef]], [[Camel meat|camel]] (solely [[Bactrian camel|bactrian]]), [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[goose]], [[carrot]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[Capsicum|peppers]], [[eggplant]], [[celery]], various [[Dairy product|dairy foods]] and fruits.

A Uyghur-style breakfast consists of [[tea]] with home-baked bread, [[hardened yogurt]], [[olive]]s, [[honey]], [[raisin]]s and [[almond]]s. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, [[naan]] and fruit before the main dishes are ready.

''[[Sangza]]'' ({{lang|ug-Arab|ساڭزا}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|Саңза}}) are crispy fried [[wheat flour]] dough twists, a holiday speciality. ''[[Samosa|Samsa]]'' ({{lang|ug-Arab|سامسا}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|Самса}}) are lamb [[pie]]s baked in a special brick oven. ''[[Youtazi]]'' is steamed multi-layer bread. ''Göshnan'' ({{lang|ug-Arab|گۆشنان}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|Гөшнан}}) are pan-grilled lamb pies. ''[[Pamirdin]]'' ({{lang|ug-Cyrl|Памирдин}}) are baked pies stuffed with lamb, carrots and onions. ''[[Chorba|Shorpa]]'' is lamb [[soup]] ({{lang|ug-Arab|شۇرپا}}, {{lang|ug-Cyrl|Шорпа}}). Other dishes include ''[[Tohax|Toghach]]'' ({{lang|ug-Cyrl|Тоғач}}) (a type of [[tandoor bread]]) and ''[[Doner kebab|Tunurkawab]]'' ({{lang|ug-Cyrl|Тунуркаваб}}). ''Girde'' ({{lang|ug-Cyrl|Гирде}}) is also a very popular [[bagel]]-like bread with a hard and crispy crust that is soft inside.

A cake sold by Uyghurs is the traditional Uyghur nut cake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://offbeatchina.com/an-unbelievably-expensive-piece-of-xinjiang-nut-cake-and-what-it-tells-about-the-ethnic-policy-in-china |title=An unbelievably expensive piece of Xinjiang nut cake and what it tells about the ethnic policy in China |date=December 4, 2012 |work=Offbeat China |access-date=August 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915171022/http://offbeatchina.com/an-unbelievably-expensive-piece-of-xinjiang-nut-cake-and-what-it-tells-about-the-ethnic-policy-in-china |archive-date=September 15, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://world.time.com/2012/12/05/dont-let-them-eat-cake-how-ethnic-tensions-in-china-explode-on-the-streets/ |title= Don't Let Them Eat Cake: How Ethnic Tensions in China Explode on the Streets |author= Austin Ramzy |date= December 5, 2012 |work= Time |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121212194419/http://world.time.com/2012/12/05/dont-let-them-eat-cake-how-ethnic-tensions-in-china-explode-on-the-streets/ |archive-date= December 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/xinjiang-nut-cake-scandal-in-china-2012-12 |title=Chinese Racial Tensions Flare Over An Overpriced Nut Cake |author=Adam Taylor |date=December 4, 2012 |work=Business Insider |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821152730/http://www.businessinsider.com/xinjiang-nut-cake-scandal-in-china-2012-12 |archive-date=August 21, 2016 }}</ref>

=== Livelihood ===
Most Uyghurs are agriculturists.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} Cultivating crops in an arid region has made the Uyghurs excel in irrigation techniques. This includes the construction and maintenance of underground channels called ''karez'' that brings water from the mountains to their fields. A few of the well-known agricultural goods include apples (especially from [[Yining|Ghulja]]), sweet melons (from [[Hami]]), and grapes from [[Turpan]]. However, many Uyghurs are also employed in the mining, manufacturing, cotton, and petrochemical industries. Local handicrafts like rug-weaving and jade-carving are also important to the cottage industry of the Uyghurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Human: The Definitive Visual Guide|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7566-0520-2|editor-last=Winston|editor-first=Robert|location=New York|page=447|editor-last2=Wilson|editor-first2=Dr. Don E.}}</ref>
