The '''Corporation for National and Community Service''' ('''CNCS''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government ]] that engages more than five million Americans in service through [[AmeriCorps]], [[Senior Corps]], the Volunteer Generation Fund, and other national service initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalservice.gov |website=Nationalservice.gov|title=National Service|accessdate=Nov 21, 2011}}</ref> The agency's mission is "to improve lives, strengthen communities, and foster civic engagement through service and volunteering."<ref>{{cite web |title=ABOUT CNCS |url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/about |publisher=Corporation for National and Community Service |accessdate=2020-09-21}}</ref> While a government agency, CNCS acts much like a foundation and is the nation's largest annual grant maker supporting service and volunteering. CNCS, formerly known as the "'''Corporation for National Service'''" or "'''CNS'''," was created by the [[National and Community Service Trust Act]] of 1993.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c103:6:./temp/~c103itpc1E:e312587: Bill Text, 103rd Congress (1993-1994), H.R.2010.EAS] [[Library of Congress]]</ref>

==Programs==
Currently, CNCS delivers several programs that are designed to help communities address poverty, the environment, education, and other unmet human needs. The programs include:

===AmeriCorps===
{{Main|AmeriCorps}}
AmeriCorps is a national service program designed to engage Americans in a variety of service. Programs under the AmeriCorps umbrella include AmeriCorps State and National programs, [[National Civilian Community Corps]] (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC, which includes [[FEMA Corps]]), and [[Volunteers in Service to America|AmeriCorps VISTA]].

On April 21, 2009, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act was signed into law, which reauthorized and dramatically expanded the AmeriCorps volunteer service program. The new law would more than triple the number of available AmeriCorps volunteer slots from then current 75,000 to 250,000 by fiscal year 2017 with 50% of these positions becoming full-time. The measure would also tie college tuition aid to demonstrated favorable community impacts; create a pilot Social Innovation Fund; expand eligibility for the Senior Companion and Foster Grandparent program; and expand participation by military veterans. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Senior Corps ===
{{Main|Senior Corps}}
The Senior Corps umbrella includes three programs that engage seniors aged 55+ in volunteerism: the Foster Grandparents program, through which volunteers teach and mentor children; Senior Companions, through which volunteers help older adults live independently in their homes; and RSVP, through which volunteers can serve in a variety of roles to meet their communities' needs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Senior Corps Programs |url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps/senior-corps-programs |publisher=Corporation for National and Community Service |accessdate=2020-09-21}}</ref>

*[[September 11 National Day of Service|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance]]
*[[President's Volunteer Service Award]]

==Special initiatives==

===Employers of National Service===
On September 12, 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] launched the ''Employers of National Service'' initiative at the 20th Anniversary of [[AmeriCorps]] event on the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn of the White House]].<ref>Archive of Obama White House Blog https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/03/09/employers-national-service-and-americorps-vista-champions-change Accessed 6 March 2018.</ref> Employers participating in the initiative connect to the talent pipeline of [[AmeriCorps]], [[Peace Corps]], and other service year alumni, by indicating in their hiring processes that they view national service experience as a plus. The initiative is a collaboration between CNCS with the [[Peace Corps]], [[Service Year Alliance]], [[AmeriCorps Alums]], and the [[National Peace Corps Association]]. To date, over 500 employers have joined the initiative.<ref>Employers of National Service Website. https://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/employers-national-service Accessed 6 March 2018.</ref>

==History==
The '''Commission on National and Community Service''' was a new, independent federal agency created as a consequence of the [[National and Community Service Act of 1990]], signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]].

The Commission was intentioned to mean to bring about a renewed focus on encouraging [[volunteering]] in the United States and was charged with supporting four streams of service:

# Service-learning programs for school-aged youth
# Higher education service programs
# Youth corps
# National service demonstration models

In 1993 the Corporation for National and Community Service was created by merging another agency, [[ACTION (U.S. government agency)|ACTION]], and the Commission on National and Community Service together, thus ending the Commission.

===Timeline===
1990: President [[George H.W. Bush]] signs the [[National and Community Service Act]] of 1990 into law, ushering in a renewed federal focus on encouraging [[volunteering]] in the U.S. This legislation created the new independent federal agency called the [[Commission on National and Community Service]].

1992: Enacted as part of the 1993 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) is created as a demonstration program to explore the possibility of using post-Cold War military resources to help solve problems here at home. It is modeled on the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and the United States military.

1993: President [[Bill Clinton]] signs into passage The National and Community Service Trust Act, formally merging the federal offices of [[ACTION (U.S. government agency)|ACTION]] and the Commission on National and Community Service, including Serve America and NCCC, to form CNCS, along with the addition of the new AmeriCorps program.

2002: President [[George W. Bush]] creates the [[USA Freedom Corps]].
