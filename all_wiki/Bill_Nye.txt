He is best known as the host of the PBS and syndicated children's science show ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' (1993–1998), the Netflix show ''[[Bill Nye Saves the World]]'' (2017–2018), and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a science educator.

Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], Nye began his career as a mechanical engineer for [[Boeing|Boeing Corporation]] in [[Seattle]], where he invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on [[Boeing 747|747]] airplanes. In 1986, Nye left Boeing to pursue comedy, writing and performing jokes and bits for the local sketch television show ''[[Almost Live!]]'', where he regularly conducted wacky science experiments. Nye aspired to become the next [[Don Herbert|Mr. Wizard]], and with the help of several producers, successfully pitched the [[children's television program]] ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' to [[KCTS-TV]], Seattle's public television station. The show—which proudly proclaimed in its theme song that "science rules!"—ran from 1993 to 1998 in national TV syndication.

Nye quit his job at Boeing on October 3, 1986 to focus on his burgeoning comedy career.<ref name="Fast Company"/>

During Nye's 10-year college reunion in 1987, he went to great lengths to meet with Sagan at Cornell. Sagan's assistant told Nye, "Okay, you can talk to him for five minutes." In their meeting at the space sciences building, Nye explained that he was interested in developing a science television program. "I mentioned how I planned to talk about bridges and bicycles and so on—stuff that, as an engineer, I'd been interested in—and [Sagan] said, 'Focus on pure science. Kids resonate to pure science rather than technology.' And that turned out to be great advice."<ref name="nuttiest-professor">{{cite news |url=https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2013/9/3/bill-nye-is-still-the-nuttiest-professor-september-2013 |title=Bill Nye Is Still the Nuttiest Professor |work=[[Seattle Metropolitan]] |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref>

In 1986, Nye worked as a writer/actor on a local [[sketch comedy]] television show in Seattle called ''[[Almost Live!]].''
