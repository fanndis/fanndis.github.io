'''Apple Music''' is a music and video [[Streaming media|streaming]] service developed by [[Apple Inc.]] Users select music to stream to their device on-demand, or they can listen to existing, expertly curated playlists. The service also includes the Internet radio station [[Apple Music 1]], Apple Music Hits, and Apple Music Country, which broadcasts live to over 200 countries 24 hours a day. The service was announced on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, 2015. New subscribers get a six-month free trial period before the service requires a monthly subscription.

Originally strictly a music service, Apple Music began expanding into video in 2016. Executive [[Jimmy Iovine]] has stated that the intention for the service is to become a "cultural platform", and Apple reportedly wants the service to be a "one-stop shop for pop culture". The company is actively investing heavily in the production and purchasing of video content, both in terms of music videos and concert footage that support music releases, as well as web series and feature films.

The original iOS version of Apple Music received mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards a [[user interface]] deemed "not intuitive". However, it was praised for its playlist curation, a vast library of songs to stream, and its integration with other Apple devices and services. In [[iOS 10]], the app received a significant redesign, which received positive reviews for an updated interface with less clutter, improved navigation, and a bigger emphasis on users' libraries. Apple Music rapidly gained popularity after its launch, passing the milestone of 10 million subscribers in only six months. The service has 60 million subscribers around the world {{as of|June 2019|lc=on}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8487726/apple-music-56-million-users-report|title=Apple Music Now Has 56 Million Users: Report|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref>

== Description ==
Apple Music allows users to stream over 70 million songs to their device on demand. The service offers curated playlists by music experts and recommendations tailored to a users music preference.<ref name="Announcement by Apple">{{cite web |title=Introducing Apple Music — All The Ways You Love Music.

The Apple Music Radio service is free for all users, even without an Apple Music subscription. Apple Music subscribers can create a profile to share their music with friends and follow other users to view the music they're listening to on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15727014/apple-music-app-update-social-features-wwdc-2017|title=Apple Music will let you share what you’re listening to with your friends|last=Singleton|first=Micah|date=June 5, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> Apple Music's use of [[iCloud]], which matches a users' songs to those found on the service, allows users to combine their iTunes music library with their Apple Music library and listen to their music all in one place. Additionally, the service is heavily integrated into Apple's own in-house services such as their personal voice assistant [[Siri]] as well as their audio and video streaming protocol [[AirPlay]]. As of late 2019, users also have the ability to access the full version of Apple Music through an Apple-designed [https://beta.music.apple.com web player] in beta.

Apple Music's interface consists of five tabs: "Library", "For You", "Browse", "Radio", and "Search". The "Library" tab shows the user's music collection, with options to view songs by "Playlists", "Artists", "Albums", "Songs", or "Downloaded Music". Below these options, the tab also shows music recently added to the user's library. The "For You" tab recommends music for the user based on their music tastes. Human expert selections supplement the algorithmic curation, while users are able to "Like" and "Dislike" songs to further improve music suggestions. "Browse" shows new album releases from artists, playlists curated by the Apple Music team, upcoming album releases, as well as different categories including "Genres", "Moods", "Top Charts", and "Music Videos". The "Radio" tab incorporates Apple Music Radio and other radio stations which play genre-specific or artist-related music, depending on the user's preference. Unlike traditional radio services, the radio feature in Apple Music allows users to skip songs, view previously played songs on the station, as well as view songs playing next. The "Search" tab features a search box where users can search for artists, albums, Apple Music users, or songs by name or by lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/05/apple-music-in-ios-12-adds-song-search-by-lyrics-new-artist-pages|title=Apple Music in iOS 12 adds song search by lyrics, new artist pages|last=Tuesday|first=Roger Fingas|last2=June 05|website=AppleInsider|language=en|access-date=2019-01-21|last3=2018|last4=PT|first4=10:58 am}}</ref> Below the search box, a list of recent user searches and overall trending searches on the service are shown.

When a song is playing, a "Now Playing" bar appears above the bottom navigation bar. When viewed, the Now Playing section allows users to add a song to their library, download it to their device, and like or dislike the song to improve suggestions on the "For You" tab. Other functions of the "Now Playing" section include the ability to control what music plays next and put songs on shuffle or repeat. Additionally, users can view live lyrics of the song they are listening to through the now playing card, which displays the song's lyrics live in sync with the time while it plays to the user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appletoolbox.com/time%e2%80%91synced-lyrics-on-apple-music/|title=How to see time‑synced lyrics on Apple Music|last=Sandy Writtenhouse|date=2019-10-10|website=AppleToolBox|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>

Each artist page includes a profile banner and a "Play" button which automatically creates a radio station based around the artist. Artist pages also include sections for their featured releases, albums, singles, top songs, and background information. Apple Music users have the ability create their own profile on the service, thus allowing them to follow other users and see what music their followers are listening to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/how-see-what-your-friends-are-listening-apple-music|title=How to see what your friends are listening to in Apple Music|date=2017-06-24|website=iMore|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>

Users also have the ability to view their most played songs, artists, and albums of the entire year through a feature called Apple Music Replay, accessible on the "For You" tab.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90431756/apple-music-replay-heres-how-to-get-your-most-played-songs-of-2019|title=Apple Music Replay: Here’s how to get your most played songs of 2019|last=Grothaus|first=Michael|date=2019-11-15|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>

After a period of rumors and anticipation, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] CEO [[Doug Morris]] confirmed on June 7, 2015, that Apple had plans to announce a music streaming service, saying "It's happening tomorrow,"<ref name="Sony Music CEO confirms">{{cite web |first=Chris |last=O'Brien |title=Sony Music CEO confirms launch of Apple’s music streaming service tomorrow |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/07/sony-music-ceo-confirms-launch-of-apples-music-streaming-service-tomorrow/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 7, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> with the launch later in the month.<ref name="Announcement by Apple"/> Morris emphasized several times that he prefers paid streaming as opposed to ad-supported, from a financial perspective. Furthermore, Morris said he expects the service to be the "tipping point" to accelerate the growth of streaming, along with arguing that Apple has "$178 billion dollars in the bank. And they have 800 million credit cards in iTunes." as opposed to [[Spotify]], which "never really advertised because it’s never been profitable". Morris further argued that "Apple will promote this like crazy and I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming business. A rising tide will lift all boats. It's the beginning of an amazing moment for our industry."<ref name="Sony Music CEO confirms"/>

=== Royalty payment policy ===
Shortly before Apple Music was released, singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] wrote an open letter publicly criticizing Apple's decision to not reimburse artists during a user's three-month free trial period and announced that she would be holding back her album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' from the service. She said the policy was "unfair" as "Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months".<ref>{{cite web |first=Mitchell |last=Peters |title=Taylor Swift Pens Open Letter Explaining Why '1989' Won't Be on Apple Music |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6605541/taylor-swift-pens-open-letter-explaining-why-1989-wont-be-on-apple-music |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |date=June 21, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=Taylor Swift calls Apple Music free trial 'shocking, disappointing' in open letter |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/21/8820035/taylor-swift-apple-music-free-trial-shocking-disappointing |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 21, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> UK independent record label [[Beggars Group]] also criticized the three-month trial period, saying it struggled "to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple's customer acquisition costs".<ref>{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Kreps |title=Indie Label Beggars Group Expresses Apple Music Concerns |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/indie-label-beggars-group-expresses-apple-music-concerns-20150618 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]  |date=June 18, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tshepo |last=Mokoena |title=Beggars Group express concern over Apple Music's free trial period |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/18/beggars-group-statement-apple-music-three-month-free-trial |website=[[The Guardian]]  |date=June 18, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref>

The day after Swift's letter, Apple's Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services [[Eddy Cue]] announced on [[Twitter]] that Apple had changed its policy, and that Apple Music "will pay artist for streaming, even during customer's free trial period".<ref>{{cite web |first=Eddy |last=Cue |author-link=Eddy Cue |title=#AppleMusic will pay artist for streaming, even during customer’s free trial period |url=https://twitter.com/cue/status/612824775220555776 |website=[[Twitter]] |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Stuart |last1=Dredge |first2=Hannah |last2=Ellis-Petersen |title=Apple Music to pay royalties during free trial: 'We hear you Taylor Swift' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/apple-music-royalties-free-trial-taylor-swift |website=[[The Guardian]]  |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Tim |last1=Fernholz |first2=Heather |last2=Timmons |title=Taylor Swift has successfully shamed Apple Music into paying artists all the time |url=https://qz.com/433499/taylor-swift-wont-put-1989-on-apples-streaming-music-app-until-she-gets-paid/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> On Twitter, Swift wrote "After the events of this week, I've decided to put ''1989'' on Apple Music...

=== Record label cartel ===
In negotiations with record labels for the new service, Apple allegedly attempted to encourage record labels to pull their content from the free, ad-supported tiers of competing services such as [[Spotify]] and [[Amazon Music]] in order to drive adoption of Apple Music and offered an incentive to [[Universal Music Group]] to pull its content from YouTube. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Trade Commission]] launched an investigation into this alleged [[cartel]] in May 2015.<ref name=recode-applemusicfree>{{cite web|title=Big Music Labels Want to Make Free Music Hard to Get, and Apple Says They’re Right|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/06/big-music-labels-want-to-make-free-music-hard-to-get-and-apple-says-theyre-right/|website=Re/code|access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Micah |last=Singleton |title=Apple pushing music labels to kill free Spotify streaming ahead of Beats relaunch |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8540935/apple-labels-spotify-streaming |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 4, 2015 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Apple Music received mixed reviews at launch. Among the criticism, reviewers wrote that the user interface was "not intuitive",<ref>{{cite web |first=Daniel B. |last=Kline |title=Apple Music: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |url=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/20/apple-music-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.aspx |website=[[The Motley Fool]] |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> and an "embarrassing and confusing mess".<ref>{{cite web |first=Yoni |last=Heisler |title=Apple Music on iTunes is an embarrassing and confusing mess |url=https://bgr.com/2015/07/09/apple-music-problems-itunes/ |website=[[Boy Genius Report|BGR]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=July 9, 2015 |access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> They also wrote about battery life problems.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lisa |last=Eadicicco |title=I ditched Spotify to use Apple Music — and I don't miss it |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-music-review-2015-7 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=July 5, 2015 |access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> However, the service was praised for its smart functions. Christina Warren of ''[[Mashable]]'' noted the emphasis on human curation in Apple Music, pointing out the various human-curated radio stations and the accuracy of the curated playlists recommended to users in the "For Me" section. The author concluded saying "[The] For Me section alone has made me excited about music for the first time in a long time."<ref>{{cite web |first=Christina |last=Warren |title=Apple Music first look: It's all about curation, curation, curation |url=http://mashable.com/2015/06/30/apple-music-hands-on/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=June 30, 2015 |access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> Sam Machkovech of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' wrote that Apple's emphasis on unsigned artist participation in the Connect feature could be an effort to restore the company's former reputation as a "tastemaker" in the mid-2000s.<ref name="Announcement by Ars Technica" />

Apple Music's major redesign in [[iOS 10]] received more positive reviews. Caitlin McGarry of ''[[Macworld]]'' praised Apple for having "cleaned up the clutter, reconsidered the navigation tools, put your library front and center, and added algorithmically created playlists to rival [[Spotify]]'s." She noted bigger fonts, large amounts of white space, and she welcomed changes to various functionalities, concluding with the statement that "Apple Music’s redesign is a huge improvement over its previous incarnation, and a clear sign that Apple is listening to its customers".<ref name="McGarry">{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3120412/ios/apple-music-ios-10-overview.html|title=Apple Music in iOS 10: Smart, simple, but still imperfect|last=McGarry|first=Caitlin|date=September 15, 2016|website=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|access-date=June 8, 2017}}</ref> However, another ''Macworld'' editor, Oscar Raymundo, criticized the new design, writing that "Apple Music in iOS 10 is not as elegant or intuitive as Apple promised.

In December 2017, singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] released a new archive as part of his [[Neil Young Archives]] project and criticized Apple for the audio quality offered by its Apple Music streaming service, stating: "Apple Music controls the audio quality that is served to the masses and chooses to not make high quality available, reducing audio quality to between 5 percent and 20 percent of the master I made in the studio in all cases. So, the people hear 5 percent to 20 percent of what I created. ... Apple not offering a top-quality tier has led labels to stop making quality products available to the masses".<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Matyszcyk |title=Neil Young savages Apple over audio quality |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/neil-young-savages-apple-over-audio-quality/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 5, 2017 |access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref> Young's claim, however, did not stand up to technical scrutiny, with Apple delivering an industry-standard high-quality bitrate of 256kbit/s AAC, slightly edging out Spotify in quality, which uses a 320kbit/s Ogg Vorbis bitrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/10/5/17927798/best-music-streaming-service-price-comparison-features|title=Spotify vs. Apple Music: the best music streaming service|last=Etienne|first=Stefan|date=2018-10-05|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>

=== Album exclusives controversy ===
In August 2016, [[Frank Ocean]] released ''[[Blonde (Frank Ocean album)|Blonde]]'' exclusively on Apple Music. The decision was made by Ocean independently, without [[Def Jam Recordings]], his former label, being a part of the deal. The exclusive deal reportedly "ignited a music streaming war".<ref>{{cite web |first=Natalie |last=Robehmed |title=Frank Ocean Just Went Independent And Ignited A Music Streaming War |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/23/frank-ocean-just-ignited-a-streaming-war-with-apple-and-universal-music/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> The move followed in the footsteps of other artists, including [[Adele]], [[Coldplay]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Kanye West]], who released albums on exclusive terms with music streaming competitors of leading service [[Spotify]]. Jonathan Prince, Spotify's head of communications, told ''[[The Verge]]'' that "We’re not really in the business of paying for exclusives, because we think they're bad for artists and they're bad for fans. Artists want as many fans as possible to hear their music, and fans want to be able to hear whatever they're excited about or interested in — exclusives get in the way of that for both sides. Of course, we understand that short promotional exclusives are common and we don't have an absolute policy against them, but we definitely think the best practice for everybody is wide release".<ref>{{cite web |first=Micah |last=Singleton |title=Does Spotify need to go after exclusive content? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/18/11054460/spotify-exclusive-content-apple-tidal |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=February 18, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> Ocean's independent move to Apple Music exclusivity caused "a major fight in the [[music industry]]",<ref>{{cite web |first=Micah |last=Singleton |title=Frank Ocean's release of Blonde marks the start of a major fight in the music industry |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/24/12627578/frank-ocean-blonde-apple-music-exclusive-universal |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=August 24, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> and [[Universal Music Group]] reportedly banned the practice of exclusive releases for its signed artists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Helmore |title=Universal reportedly outlaws streaming 'exclusives' after Frank Ocean release |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/23/universal-streaming-exclusives-frank-ocean-release |website=[[The Guardian]]  |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> Soon after, several major record labels followed Universal, marking a significant change in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |first=Hannah |last=Karp |title=Music Industry Hits Pause on Exclusive Album-Release Deals |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/music-industry-hits-pause-on-exclusive-album-release-deals-1473327004 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 8, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}} {{subscription required}}</ref> According to unnamed label executives, Spotify had also introduced a new policy that said that the service would not give the same level of promotion once an album arrives on Spotify after other services, including not being prominently featured in playlists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Sisario |title=Frank Ocean’s ‘Blonde’ Amplifies Discord in the Music Business |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/business/media/frank-oceans-blonde-amplifies-discord-in-the-music-business.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 25, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote in October 2016 that "if you wanted to keep up with new albums by Beyoncé, Drake, Frank Ocean, and Kanye West, among many others, you would have had to subscribe to not one but two streaming services", adding, "But over the past few months, a backlash has developed against this new reality".<ref name="rolling stone exclusives">{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Knopper |title=How Apple Music, Tidal Exclusives Are Reshaping Music Industry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-war-over-album-exclusives-w443385 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]  |date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> [[Lady Gaga]] told Apple Music's Beats 1 radio, "I told my label that if they signed those contracts with Apple Music and [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], I'd leak all my own new music".<ref name="rolling stone exclusives"/>
