She competed at the [[2016 Olympics]] in the women's singles, beating Johanna Larsson before losing to Serena Williams.<ref name=":0" />

===2017: First Premier final in doubles===
Cornet played her first tournament of the year at the [[2017 Brisbane International – Women's Singles|Brisbane International]].

[[Garbiñe Muguruza]] (seeded No. 4) retired after she was trailing Cornet 1–4 in the first set of the semifinal, enabling Cornet to reach the final (her second Premier career final), where she lost to No. 3 seed [[Karolína Plíšková]] 0–6, 3–6.

At the [[2017 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Cornet was seeded No. 28. She defeated French wild card [[Myrtille Georges]] in the first round before losing to [[Maria Sakkari]] in the second.

Cornet played in the [[2017 Fed Cup World Group]] quarterfinal tie against Switzerland, in which she lost the first singles match (her only match) to Timea Bacsinszky; France lost the tie 1–4.

On 16 February, Cornet withdrew from the [[2017 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]] because of a torn [[Pectoral muscles|pectoral muscle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/Actualites/Dubai-alize-cornet-declare-forfait/778711|title=Dubaï : Alizé Cornet déclare forfait|publisher=L'Équipe|date=16 February 2017}}</ref>

Cornet lost to [[Carla Suárez Navarro]] in the quarterfinals of the [[2017 Monterrey Open – Singles|Monterrey Open]]. She suffered early exits in the singles main draw of her next four WTA tournaments in Rabat (first round), Madrid (first round), Rome (second round) and Strasbourg (first round). At the [[2017 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], she upset No. 20 seed Barbora Strýcová in the second round, No. 9 seed Agnieszka Radwańska in the third before losing to No. 28 seed Caroline Garcia in the fourth round.

At the  Premier-5 tournament in Wuhan, she upset No. 6 seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round before falling to the qualifier Maria Sakkari in the quarterfinals; that was just Cornet's third singles quarterfinal appearance in a Premier-Mandatory or Premier-5 tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/Actualites/Wuhan-alize-cornet-tombe-en-quarts-de-finale-au-terme-d-un-beau-combat/838106|title=Wuhan : Alizé Cornet tombe en quarts de finale au terme d'un beau combat|publisher=L'Équipe|date=28 September 2017}}</ref> In early October, the unseeded Cornet knocked out No. 10 seed Angelique Kerber in the second round of the Premier Mandatory [[2017 China Open – Women's Singles|China Open]] before losing to her compatriot Caroline Garcia in the third round. In her last tournament of 2017 in [[2017 Kremlin Cup – Women's Singles|Moscow]], Cornet defeated No. 8 seed Magdaléna Rybáriková in the second round before losing to [[Natalia Vikhlyantseva]] in the quarterfinals in a three-hour match, meaning that Cornet advanced beyond the singles quarterfinals of a WTA tournament only once (in [[2017 Brisbane International – Women's Singles|Brisbane]]) in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/Actualites/Moscou-alize-cornet-sortie-en-quarts-malgre-un-enorme-combat/843788|title=Moscou : Alizé Cornet sortie en quarts malgré un énorme combat|publisher=L'Équipe|date=19 October 2017}}</ref>

===2018: Sixth WTA Tour singles title===
On 11 January 2018, Cornet was charged by the ITF with missing three out-of-competition drugs tests that were to be conducted between November 2016 and October 2017. Under [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] rules, Cornet could face a suspension of up to two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/Actualites/Alize-cornet-connaitra-la-decision-de-l-itf-dans-l-affaire-de-ses-trois-no-show-d-ici-14-jours/897502|title=Alizé Cornet connaîtra la décision de l'ITF dans l'affaire de ses trois no show d'ici 14 jours|publisher=L'Équipe|date=1 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/42813675|title=Alize Cornet charged with missing drug tests by International Tennis Federation|publisher=BBC|date=25 January 2018}}</ref> The case would be heard on 1 May 2018 in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/52665/alize-cornet-s-hearing-for-missing-doping-tests-postponed-/|title=Alizé Cornet's hearing for missing doping tests postponed|publisher=Tennis World|date=10 March 2018}}</ref> She would be allowed to play WTA and ITF tournaments until then, but if found guilty all prize money and [[WTA rankings|rankings points]] accumulated during a certain period in 2017 would be forfeited.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/15-least-flattering-photos-of-the-15-most-attractive-women-in-tennis/|title=15 Least Flattering Photos Of The 15 Most Attractive Women In Tennis|publisher=The Sportster|date=1 February 2018}}</ref> The [[French Tennis Federation]] stated that they would not select Cornet for the upcoming [[2018 Fed Cup World Group|Fed Cup]] team tie against [[Belgium Fed Cup team|Belgium]] in February 2018, to allow her time to "prepare her defence" in front of an independent tribunal set up by [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/alize-cornet-missed-drugs-tests-three-in-a-year-facing-ban-suspension-itf-anti-doping-a8176971.html|title=Alize Cornet: French tennis player facing ban after missing three drugs tests in the last year|publisher=The Independent|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>

On 15 May, the ITF announced that the independent tribunal set up by WADA had cleared Cornet of the charge of missing the three out-of-competition drugs tests that were to be conducted between November 2016 and October 2017 because the Doping Control Officer (DCO) did not satisfy all of the requirements of article I.4.3 of the International Standard for Testing and Investigations in relation to the third missed drugs test. Specifically, the DCO did not do “what was reasonable in the circumstances (i.e. given the nature of the specified location) to try to locate Cornet, short of giving her any advance notice of the test”. For that reason, the third missed drugs test declared against Cornet no longer stood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com/tennis/story/french-tennis-player-alize-cornet-cleared-of-doping-charge-051518|title=French tennis player Alize Cornet cleared of doping charge|publisher=Fox Sports|date=15 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itftennis.com/news/285133.aspx|title=Decision in the case of Alize Cornet|publisher=ITF official website|date=15 May 2018}}</ref>

On July 22, she won her sixth WTA Tour singles title at the [[2018 Ladies Championship Gstaad – Singles|Swiss Open]], held in [[Gstaad]].

At the US Open, Cornet was given a code violation under Grand Slam rules for changing her shirt while on the court, which angered some as male players are not penalized for doing such. The next day, officials declared that players of any gender would be allowed to change their shirt while sitting in their chair, and female players could also change their shirts in a private location off the court, for which they would not be assessed a bathroom break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/24513634/us-open-clarifies-changing-shirt-rule-alize-cornet-penalty |title=US Open clarifies changing shirt rule after Alize Cornet penalty |publisher=Espn.com |date=2018-08-29 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref>
