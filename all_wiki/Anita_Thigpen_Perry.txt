==Early life and education==
Perry was born in [[Haskell, Texas]]. She is the youngest daughter of family physician Joseph Eltidge Thigpen (1920–2013), a native of [[Bay Springs, Mississippi]], and homemaker Beunis Fay Ratliff Thigpen, originally from Haskell. Her parents met in [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], where Beunis was visiting relatives. Her father had a distinguished flight record in [[World War II]] and earned several medals, including the [[Bronze Star]]. He also flew his own plane and was known for making house calls long after the practice ceased to be the norm. Her paternal grandfather was also a doctor and also named Joseph Thigpen. She is named for a paternal aunt, Anita Thigpen Yelverton (1918–1999). She had three siblings: Joseph Emmitt Thigpen (1945–2013), an attorney in Austin who is a former county attorney and former district attorney), Peggy Hairgrove, and Emily Solis. Like Rick, she is a graduate of [[Haskell High School]]. She spent her first year of college at [[Texas Tech University]], but because they did not have a nursing program at the time, she switched to [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas State University]] in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]], where she received a bachelor's degree in nursing in 1974.
