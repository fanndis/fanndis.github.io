From late October 2006 to January 2007, he also served as [[Chief Advisor of Bangladesh|Chief Advisor]] of the [[caretaker government]]. From October 2006 to early 2008, his responsibilities as President included the Defense Ministry of the caretaker government.

With a doctorate in soil science, Ahmed became a full professor at the [[University of Dhaka]] and chairman of the department. Beginning in 1991, he started accepting appointments to public positions, as chairman of the Public Service Commission (1991 to 1993) and of the University Grants Commission (1995 to 1999).

==Teaching==
Returning to the '''University of Dhaka''', Ahmed joined the faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Soil Science. He moved up in the ranks until he became a full professor in the department. He held the posts at the university of chairman of the Soil Science Department of [[Dhaka University]] and dean of the Faculty of Biological Science, Dhaka University.

In 1984, Professor Ahmed was a visiting professor at [[Cornell University]] in the United States and the German Technical University and [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.

==Political career==
Ahmed was an adviser in the [[caretaker government]] in 1991. He was also chairman of the Public Service Commission from 1991 to 1993. He served as chairman of the University Grants Commission from 1995 to 1999.<ref name="bio"/>

During the 1990s Professor Ahmed was the president of the Federation of University Teachers Association in Bangladesh (FUTA). He led the anti-autocratic movement.

===Presidency===
Ahmed became President of Bangladesh in 2002 after becoming the only candidate to register for presidential elections. By that time, the position of prime minister was considered the top political role in the Bangladesh government.

During his presidency, Ahmed directed the writing and publication of two books about the nation, ''Hundred Years of Bangabhaban'' and ''Bangabhabaner Shatabarsha.'' These were published in 2006 by [[Bangabhaban]]'s press wing, under the initiative of his advisor, [[Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury]].<ref>{{cite news |date=15 February 2006 |title='Hundred Yrs of Bangabhaban' launched |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/02/15/d60215061482.htm |volume=5 |number=610 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=10 December 2012}}</ref>

===Chief Advisor, 2006–2007 Caretaker Government===
{{main|2006-2008 Bangladeshi political crisis}}
According to the constitution, the immediate past Chief Justice is appointed as Chief Advisor during a caretaker government. After Justice KM Hasan declined the position, reportedly because of ill health, five other men were considered for the position.
The last option was for the President to take over, as provided for in the constitution. Ahmed was sworn in as the Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government at 8.00&nbsp;pm (Bangladesh standard time) on 29 October 2006 after the main political parties failed to agree on another candidate. The opposition parties resisted his appointment, because he had been elected by the majority-BNP parliament. Iajuddin Ahmed as Chief Advisor was to oversee the [[2007 Bangladeshi parliamentary election|forthcoming elections]], planned for 22 January 2007, while continuing his responsibilities as President.

Sheikh Hasina of the [[Awami League]] and her allies demanded Ahmed's resignation, but he declined.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh President rules out resigning |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/12/15/wld07.asp |url-status=dead |work=Daily News |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=15 December 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221022611/http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/12/15/wld07.asp |archive-date=21 February 2013 |access-date=10 December 2012}}</ref> At first the Awami League and its allies announced they would [[election boycott|boycott the planned election]] because of BNP influence.

The President's advisor, Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, met repeatedly with Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. After successful negotiation, he brought all parties to the President for dialogue.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYEDNO8gUyk</ref> Finally they decided to participate in polls on 23 December for a 22 January 2007 election.<ref name="bbcdisaster">{{cite news

Concerned that a one-party election would jeopardise the nation's lucrative participation in United Nations' peacekeeping mission and that the caretaker government would have difficulty resisting takeover by the BNP, the military intervened on 11 January 2007. A group including General [[Moeen U Ahmed]], Army Chief, persuaded<ref>{{cite news |title=UN warned army against coup |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-201433 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=7 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Quadir |first1=Fahimul |last2=Tsujinaka |first2=Yutaka |date=2015 |title=Civil Society in Asia: In Search of Democracy and Development in Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1sdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA5 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |page=5 |isbn=978-1-4724-2331-3}}</ref> Iajuddin Ahmed to declare a [[state of emergency]] and resign, appointing an Interim Chief Advisor. Opponents of the military intervention were concerned about the threat to democracy, but many others were relieved to have professional technocrats leading efforts to stabilise the country and reduce corruption in the government. On 12 January, Fakruddin, formerly with the [[World Bank]], was appointed as Chief Advisor.<ref name="economist">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8560006?Story_ID=E1_RVGDDDG |title=The coup that dare not speak its name |magazine=The Economist| date=18 January 2007 |access-date=10 December 2012 |quote=Iajuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh's president, declared an army-backed state of emergency on January 11th and cancelled the election due on January 22nd ...

===Resignation as Chief Adviser===
On 11 January 2007, Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed resigned from his position as Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government, having already received the resignations of his advisors. He retained his position as President and responsibilities for the Defense Ministry in the caretaker government. He issued a statement acknowledging that the Election Commission and his government had been unable to achieve an election. He appointed the former Justice [[Fazlul Haque (judge)|Fazlul Haque]] as Interim Chief Advisor and imposed a state of emergency.<ref>{{cite news |date=12 January 2007 |title=Emergency declared; Iajuddin quits as chief adviser |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/01/12/d7011201011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> The next day, in consultation with the military, Ahmed appointed [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] as the new Chief Advisor. He is a prominent banker who had been with the World Bank and Bangladesh National Bank.

Iajuddin Ahmed's term as president was due to end on 5 September 2007. The government announced at that time that he would remain in office until after [[2008 Bangladeshi general election|the national election]] (planned by then to be held by late 2008). This was to elect new members of parliament, who would elect a president.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ahmed |first=Parveen |date=5 September 2007 |title=Bangladesh president's term will continue until successor chosen, government says |agency=Associated Press |quote=Ahmed's term as president normally would end on Sept. 5 ... However, 'the constitution also says that he will have to continue until his successor is elected, after an elected government takes over,' ... Officials have promised to hold new elections after a new voter list is completed, expected sometime before the end of 2008.}}</ref>

The Awami League and its Grand Alliance won two-thirds of the seats in parliament. It formed a government in 2009, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]] as prime minister. Ahmed left office on 12 February 2009, after [[Zillur Rahman]], an Awami League leader, was sworn in to succeed him as President of Bangladesh.

==Bypass operation==
On the afternoon of 23 May 2006, President Ahmed was admitted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Dhaka. Sources said he was seriously ill and being treated by a team of elite doctors. On their advice, President Ahmed was taken to Singapore on Wednesday, 24 May 2006.
