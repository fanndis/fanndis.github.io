[[File:Christmas broadcast 1957.png|thumb|right|The first [[television|televised]] Christmas Message, broadcast in 1957]]
'''The Queen's Christmas Message''' (also known as '''The King's Christmas Message''' in the reign of a male monarch, formally as '''Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech'''<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/queens-christmas-message-30-things-didnt-know-majestys-annual/ |title=Daily Telegraph |date=24 December 2016 |via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>) is a broadcast made by the sovereign of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] each [[Christmas]]. The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by [[George V|King George V]] on the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[BBC World Service|Empire Service]]. Since 1952, the message has been read by [[Elizabeth II]]; today, it is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers.

==History==
[[File:Royal broadcast, Christmas 1934 (Our Generation, 1938).jpg|thumb|left|[[George V]] giving the 1934 Royal Christmas Message]]
The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the [[British Empire]] was first proposed by the "founding father" of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], in 1922 when he approached King [[George V]] about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment.<ref name="whig">{{Cite news |url=http://www.thewhig.com/2015/12/23/a-christmas-day-staple |title=A Christmas Day staple |date=23 December 2015 |work=Kingston Whig-Standard |access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref> Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932,<ref>{{Citation |title=The BBC Story |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/factsheets/1920s.pdf |work=BBC |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> as a way to inaugurate the [[BBC World Service|Empire Service]] (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]<ref name=whig/> and Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]].<ref name="telspeech">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/12057926/The-Queens-speech-a-Christmas-tradition-worth-keeping.html |title=The Queen's speech: a Christmas tradition worth keeping |date=21 December 2015 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref> That year, [[George V]] read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of [[radio]], but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at [[Sandringham House]].<ref name="BuckHist">{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueensChristmasBroadcasts/AhistoryofChristmasBroadcasts.aspx |title=Images and Broadcasts > The Queen's Christmas Broadcasts > A history of Christmas Broadcasts |last=Royal Household |publisher=Queen's Printer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419170751/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueensChristmasBroadcasts/AhistoryofChristmasBroadcasts.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2009 |access-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> The broadcast was introduced from [[Ilmington]] Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa and the United Kingdom.<ref name=BuckHist />

While his brother, [[Edward VIII]], [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] just before his first Christmas as king, [[George VI]] continued his father's Christmas broadcasts; it was in his 1939 reading delivered in the opening stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]] that he uttered the famous lines: "I said to the man who stood at [[the Gate of the Year]]."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page3591.asp |title=Christmas Broadcast 1939 |last=Royal Household |publisher=Queen's Printer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122044800/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page3591.asp |archive-date=22 November 2008 |access-date=3 December 2009}}</ref>

For many years, the King's speech came at the end of an hour-long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a minder in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King's speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together.<ref name=whig/>

George's daughter and successor, [[Elizabeth II]], gave her first Christmas message to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, some 11 months after her father's death. Five years later, the tradition was first broadcast on television<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/the-queen/the-queen-art-image/1950s-to-the-present/ |title=1950s to the present |website=National Portrait Gallery |access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref> and, from then until 1996, was produced by the BBC; only in 1969 was no message given because a special documentary film, ''[[Royal Family (documentary)|Royal Family]]'', had been made during the summer in connection with the [[investiture of the Prince of Wales]]. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead.

The Queen ended this monopoly, however, announcing that the message would, from 1997, be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, [[ITN|Independent Television News]] (ITN), with a biennial rotation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm?mode=entry&entry=C8AED2D0-D159-04D5-1CDC87A680CD646D |title=Christmas Message to the Commonwealth from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II |date=29 December 2000 |work=Anglican Communion News Service |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> It was reported by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], on its [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Hastings |first=Chris |title=Queen sacked us over Diana interview, says BBC |date=29 January 2006 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/29/ndi29.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/01/29/ixhome.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |place=London |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements "reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today".<ref name=sky/> Beginning in 2011, [[Sky News]] was added to the rotation.<ref name="sky">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12224489 |title=Sky News to produce Queen's Christmas message |date=19 January 2011 |work=[[BBC Online]] |access-date=19 January 2011}}</ref>

Sky News recorded the Queen's Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Diamond Jubilee year]], and for the first time it has been recorded in [[3D television|3D]].<ref name="3D">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20804465 |title=Queen records Christmas message in 3D format |date=20 December 2012 |website=BBC News |access-date=20 December 2012}}</ref> Buckingham Palace are reported to have explained: "We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do."<ref name="3D" />

The themes and direction of the speech are decided by the Queen and the text is largely written by the Queen herself, sometimes with assistance from Prince Philip and her staff. In recent years, the speech has become more personal and religious in tone.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-christmas-message-that-keeps-giving-z3wb80f5p | title=The Christmas message that keeps giving| last1=Bradley| first1=Ian}}</ref>

==Broadcast==
The message typically combines a chronicle of that year's major events, with specific focus on the British Empire originally and later the Commonwealth of Nations, with the sovereign's own personal milestones and feelings on Christmas. It is one of the few instances when the sovereign speaks publicly without advice from any [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] in any of [[Commonwealth realm|the monarch's realms]]. Planning for each year's address begins months earlier, when the monarch establishes a theme and appropriate archival footage is collected and assembled; the actual speech is recorded a few days prior to Christmas.<ref name=BuckHist />

Timing:

* On the internet, as in the United Kingdom, broadcast of the Queen's Christmas message is embargoed until 15:00 GMT on 25 December.
* [[New Zealand]] is the first country in the Commonwealth to broadcast the message over the airwaves, at 18:06 local time (5:06 am GMT) by [[Radio New Zealand]] on [[RNZ National]], then again at 18:50 by [[Television New Zealand]] on [[TVNZ1]].
* In [[Australia]] the message is broadcast by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] at 15:20 local time (5:20 am to 7:20 am GMT, depending on the [[time in Australia|time zone]]).
* In [[Canada]] the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcasts the message generally at noon local time on television (3:30 pm to 8 pm GMT depending on the [[time in Canada|time zone]]), and at 14:50 local time on [[CBC Radio One]] and [[CBC Music]].
* Outside of the Commonwealth, [[C-SPAN]] in the [[United States]] airs the Queen's Message at times that vary depending on the network's schedule. No American radio station airs the broadcast, although some areas bordering Canada can receive it via the CBC.

| Delivering his message on the first Christmas of the [[World War II|Second World War]] the King spoke live from [[Sandringham House]] to offer a message of reassurance. He spoke of Christmas as a festival of peace and lamented that "it is the tragedy of this time that there are powerful countries whose whole direction and policy are based on aggression and the suppression of all that we hold dear for mankind." He continued, saying: "It is this that has stirred our peoples and given them a unity unknown in any previous war. We feel in our hearts that we are fighting against wickedness, and this conviction will give us strength from day to day to persevere until victory is assured." He spoke of his pride in the [[Royal Navy]]'s courage and devotion in its battles in the first months of the war as well as the courage of the [[merchant marine]]. He also expressed thanks to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] and other armies of the Empire saying that "Their task is hard. They are waiting, and waiting is a trial of nerve and discipline. But I know that when the moment comes for action they will prove themselves worthy of the highest traditions of their great Service." He referred to the nations and colonies of the Empire as a "Family of Nations which is prepared to sacrifice everything that freedom of spirit may be saved to the world" and referred to the assistance Britain has received from the rest of the Empire. George VI referred to "the cause of Christian civilisation" as what unites the Empire and its Allies, adding that "On no other basis can a true civilisation be built." He concluded with words of encouragement from the poem ''[[The Gate of the Year|God Knows]]'' by [[Minnie Louise Haskins]]: 'I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown."

| With the deepening [[Cold War]], the [[Korean War]], [[Malayan Emergency]] as well as the risk posed by [[thermonuclear]] weapons, the King spoke of "the grim shadow of war" hanging over the world. He took as the theme of his message [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', its story of going forward, only to fall back while keeping "our eyes fixed on the far-off, delectable mountains of peace and good will" as took from the book the motto "Whatever comes or does not come. I'll not be afraid" and the need for each individual to bear his burden, even if it seems insurmountable. The King also expressed his wish for peace saying "if our world is to survive in any sense that makes survival worthwhile, it must learn to love and not to hate, and to create and not destroy" warning that mankind must choose between these two paths.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93783134 |title=The King's Christmas Message |date=28 December 1950 |work=Chronicle (Adelaide, SA) |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93783121 |title=The King to his People |date=28 December 1950 |work=Chronicle (Adelaide, SA) |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42705898 |title="MUST DECIDE BETWEEN TWO CREEDS" King s Christmas Message |date=26 December 1950 |work=Cairns Post (Queensland) |access-date=29 December 2015 |agency=Associated Australian Press}}</ref>
