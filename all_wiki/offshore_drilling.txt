'''Offshore drilling''' is a mechanical process where a [[wellbore]] is drilled below the seabed.  It is typically carried out in order to explore for and subsequently extract [[petroleum]] which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed.  Most commonly, the term is used to describe drilling activities on the [[continental shelf]], though the term can also be applied to drilling in [[lakes]], inshore waters and inland [[seas]].

Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both offshore and onshore from the produced [[hydrocarbons]] and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing [[US offshore drilling debate|U.S. offshore drilling debate]].<ref>Compton, Glenn, ''[http://thebradentontimes.com/reasons-not-to-drill-for-oil-offshore-of-florida-p19415-137.htm 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida]'', The Bradenton Times, Sunday, January 14, 2018</ref>

There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs ([[Jackup rig|jackup barges]] and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships.  These are capable of operating in water depths up to {{convert|3000|m|ft}}.  In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than {{convert|1500|m|ft}} the [[semi-submersible]]s or [[Drillship]]s are maintained at the required drilling location using [[dynamic positioning]].

==History==
Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the [[Grand Lake St. Marys]] in [[Ohio]].  The wells were developed by small local companies such as Bryson, Riley Oil, German-American and Banker's Oil.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-30|title=DRILLING ON GRAND LAKE ST MARYS IN 1891|url=http://www.energyglobalnews.com/drilling-on-grand-lake-st-marys-in-1891/|access-date=2020-08-20|website=Energy Global News}}</ref>

Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the [[Summerland Oil Field|Summerland field]] extending under the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in [[California]].  The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.<ref>[http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/louisiana_coast.html History of the Offshore Oil and Gas Development in Louisiana] at the Mineral Management Services, Dept of the Interior</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.noia.org/website/article.asp?id=123 |title=National Ocean Industries Association |access-date=2010-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806100254/http://www.noia.org/website/article.asp?id=123 |archive-date=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] in the 1900s and [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Louisiana]] in the 1910s.  Shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the [[Texas]] and Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|gulf coast]].  The [[Goose Creek Oil Field]] near [[Baytown, Texas]] is one such example.  In the 1920s drilling activities occurred from concrete platforms in [[Venezuela]]'s [[Lake Maracaibo]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Offshore Drilling {{!}} Engenya GmbH|url=http://www.engenya.com/aboout-offshore-drilling/|access-date=2020-08-24|website=www.engenya.com}}</ref>

One of the oldest subsea wells is the [[Bibiheybət|Bibi Eibat]] well, which came on stream in 1923 in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/azmsa/oil.html|title=Oil in Azerbaijan|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref>{{dubious|date=June 2010}}  The well was located on an artificial island in a shallow portion of the [[Caspian Sea]].  In the early 1930s, the Texas Co., later Texaco (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico.

In 1937, Pure Oil (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) and its partner Superior Oil (now [[ExxonMobil]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field {{convert|1|mi|km}} offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]] in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water.

In 1938, Humble Oil built  a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Beyond Sight of Land: A History of Oil Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico|journal=GeoExpro|date=June 2016|volume=30|issue=3|pages=60–63|url=https://www.academia.edu/25960555|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>

In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President [[Harry Truman]] to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the [[3-mile limit]] "[[freedom of the seas]]" regime.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Overview - Convention & Related Agreements|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm|access-date=2020-08-20|website=www.un.org}}</ref>

In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now [[ExxonMobil]]) drilled at a site {{convert|18|mi|km}} off the coast, erecting a platform in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water off [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-06-25|title=Offshore Drilling: History and Overview|url=https://www.offshore-energy.biz/offshore-drilling-history-and-overview/|access-date=2020-08-24|website=Offshore Energy|language=en-US}}</ref>

In early 1947, [[Superior Oil]] erected a drilling and production platform in {{convert|20|ft|m}} of water some {{convert|18|mi|km}} off Vermilion Parish, La.  But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now [[Occidental Petroleum]]), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum ([[ConocoPhillips]]) and Stanolind Oil & Gas ([[BP]]) that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+offshore+oil+wells&hl=en&resnum=11|title=history of offshore oil wells - Google Search|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref>

When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to {{convert|30|m|ft}}, fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling [[equipment]] was needed in the {{convert|100|ft|m}} to {{convert|120|m|ft}} depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first [[Jackup rig|jack-up rigs]] began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Offshore Drilling {{!}} Engenya GmbH|url=http://www.engenya.com/aboout-offshore-drilling/|access-date=2020-08-24|website=www.engenya.com}}</ref>

The first [[semi-submersible]] resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Shell Oil Company]]. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the 'seadrome'. The first purpose-built drilling [[semi-submersible]] ''Ocean Driller'' was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.

The first offshore [[drillship]] was the ''CUSS 1'' developed for the [[Mohole]] project to drill into the Earth's crust.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Géosciences Montpellier - The project Mohole in 1961|url=http://www.gm.univ-montp2.fr/spip/spip.php?article2163&lang=fr|access-date=2020-08-20|website=www.gm.univ-montp2.fr|language=fr}}</ref>

As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/|title=RIGZONE - Offshore Rig Data, Onshore Fleet Analysis|access-date=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021427/http://www.rigzone.com/data/|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

One of the world's deepest hubs is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3123683920100331|title=UPDATE 1-Shell starts production at Perdido|work=Reuters|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Off-Shore Drilling|url=https://issolarenergyavailable.com/what-is/off-shore-drilling/|website=IssolareEnergy Available?}}</ref>

==Challenges==
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the [[Troll A platform]] standing on a depth of 300 meters.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Speight|first=James G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPTDBAAAQBAJ&q=Offshore+oil+and+gas+production+is+more+challenging+than+land-based+installations+due+to+the+remote+and+harsher+environment&pg=PA151|title=Handbook of Offshore Oil and Gas Operations|date=2014-10-22|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-087819-5|language=en}}</ref>

Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.

The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.

The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations [[subsea]], by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the [[Barents Sea]]. One such challenge in shallower environments is [[Seabed gouging by ice|seabed gouging by drifting ice features]] (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).

Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the [[petroleum industry]], at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term [[integrated operations]]. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.

==Effects on the environment==
{{see also |Oil platform#Ecological effects| label 1= Ecological effects of oil platforms}}

Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably [[oil spill]]s from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.<ref>{{cite video | title = Debate Over Offshore Drilling | medium = internet video | publisher = [[CBS News]] | date = 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html | access-date = 2008-09-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080824002817/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html | archive-date = 2008-08-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> [[Produced water]] is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.
