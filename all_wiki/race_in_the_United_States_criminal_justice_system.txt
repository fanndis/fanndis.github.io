'''Race in the United States criminal justice system''' refers to the unique experiences and disparities in the [[United States]] in regard to the policing and prosecuting of various [[Race (human categorization)|races]]. There have been different outcomes for different racial groups in convicting and sentencing felons in the [[United States criminal justice system]].<ref name="United States 2008">United States.

==History==
Race has been a factor in the United States criminal justice system since the system's beginnings, as the nation was founded on Native American soil.<ref name=cutler>{{cite book|title = Lynch-law: An Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United States|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uSgKAAAAIAAJ|publisher = Longmans, Green, and Company|date = January 1, 1905|first = James Elbert|last = Cutler}}</ref> It continues to be a factor throughout United States history through the present, with organizations such as [[Black Lives Matter]] calling for [[Decarceration in the United States|decarceration]] through divestment from police and prisons and reinvestment in public education and universal health care.<ref>{{cite web |date=2016-10-11|title=Divest From Prisons, Invest in People—What Justice for Black Lives Really Looks Like|url=https://populardemocracy.org/news-and-publications/divest-prisons-invest-people-what-justice-black-lives-really-looks|accessdate=2020-06-06|website=The Center for Popular Democracy}}</ref>

=== Legal background (1763–1829) ===
Lynching and Lynch-Law date back to the 1700s when the term was first used by the Scotch-Irish in reference to an act pursued by the Quakers toward Native Americans.<ref name=cutler/> The law was originally regulatory, providing regulations regarding how lynching could and could not be carried out.<ref name=cutler/> Most crimes of and relating to lynching prior to 1830 were frontier crimes and were considered justifiable due to necessity.<ref name=cutler/>

Groups of armed White men, called [[slave patrol]]s, monitored enslaved African Americans. First established in South Carolina in 1704, the slave patrols' function was to police slaves, especially runaways. Slave owners feared slaves might organize a revolt or rebellion, so state militias were formed to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.<ref>Loewen, James W. Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong. The New Press, 2013.

In the construction of the United States Constitution in 1789, slavery and White supremacy were made part of the justice system, as citizens were defined as free White men.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vs9wCQAAQBAJ |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=July 20, 2012 |isbn=9781483305936 |first=Wilbur R. |last=Miller}}</ref>

=== Antebellum (1830–1860) ===
Lynch law was renewed with the anti-slavery movement, as several acts of violence towards people of color took place in the early 1830s.<ref name=cutler /> In August 1831, [[Nat Turner]] led the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|slave insurrection]] in Virginia. Turner, an African-American Baptist preacher, believing that the Lord had destined him to free his race, followed through with his plans to conquer Southampton county through the enlistment of other slaves.<ref name=cutler/> He did so by traveling from house to house murdering every White person he could find.<ref name=cutler/> Due to this act, many innocent slaves were killed by the police.<ref name=cutler/>

The court decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' made it so that African slaves and their descendants were considered non-citizens, further incorporating racism into the justice system.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Postbellum (1865–) ===
When slavery was abolished after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the constitution]], violence against African Americans increased tremendously and thousands of African Americans experienced lynching.<ref name=":0"/> African American men were routinely rounded up, charged with [[vagrancy|being unemployed]] or having changed jobs without the consent of their previous employer (which were both illegal for Blacks in some southern states), and subjected to years of forced hard labor in a system of [[convict leasing]] and [[chain gangs]].<ref>http://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name</ref>

During the same time period, unequal treaties towards Native Americans led to a large decrease in Native American land holdings, and Native Americans were forced into {{convert|160|acre|abbr=on}} [[Indian reservation|reservations]].<ref name=":0"/>

Latin Americans entering the country were also a target for the penal system during this time.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Reconstruction Period (1865–1877) ===
{{Further|Reconstruction Era}}

The [[Ku Klux Klan]], was founded in 1865 in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]] as a [[vigilante]] organization whose goal was to keep control over freed slaves;<ref name=":0"/> It performed acts of lawlessness against negroes and other minorities. This included taking negro prisoners from the custody of officers or breaking into jails to put them to death. Few efforts were made by civil authorities in the South against the Ku Klux Klan.<ref name="cutler" />

The [[Memphis riots of 1866|Memphis Riots of 1866]] took place after many Black men were discharged from the [[United States Army]]. The riot broke out when a group of discharged Negro soldiers got into a brawl with a group of Irish police officers in Memphis, Tennessee. Forty-six African Americans and two White people were killed in the riot, and seventy-five people received bullet wounds. At least five African American women were raped by predatory gangs, and the property damage was worth over $100,000.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Memphis Riots of 1866: Terror in a Black Community During Reconstruction |jstor= 2716953 |journal= The Journal of Negro History |date= July 1, 1977 |pages= 243–257 |volume= 62 |issue= 3 |doi= 10.2307/2716953 |first= James Gilbert |last= Ryan|s2cid= 149765241 }}</ref>

In 1868 the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] overruled the 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] by establishing that those born or naturalized in the United States are entitled to [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] under the law, regardless of race.<ref name=":0" />

=== ''Norris v. Alabama'' (1935) ===
In 1935 the United States Supreme Court overturned convictions of the Scottsboro Boys in ''[[Norris v. Alabama]]''. These were nine African American teenagers who had been previously denied equal protection under the law as stated in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] because African Americans were purposely excluded from their cases' juries.<ref name=":0" />

==By stage of the criminal justice process==
Among key findings on the literature is that that Whites with the same bail decision as Blacks commit more pre-trial violations and that Blacks are more harshly sentenced by juries and judges than Whites when the underlying facts and circumstances of the cases are similar.<ref name=":19">{{cite journal |last1=Rehavi|first1=M.

===Race and policing===
Studies have documented patterns of racial discrimination, as well as patterns of police brutality and disregard for the constitutional rights of African-Americans, by police departments in various American cities, including [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]], [[New York City Police Department|New York]], [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia]].<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Williams, Suzanne Ife.|title=Police brutality : case study of Philadelphia/Move|oclc=84480572}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Balto|first=Simon|date=2019 |title=Occupied Territory: Policing Black Chicago from Red Summer to Black Power|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|doi=10.5149/northcarolina/9781469649597.001.0001|isbn=9781469649597}}</ref><ref name=":22">{{cite book |last=Ralph|first=Laurence|title=The Torture Letters|date=2020|publisher=University of Chicago Press|doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226650128.001.0001|isbn=978-0-226-65012-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Felker-Kantor|first=Max|date=2018|title=Policing Los Angeles: Race, Resistance, and the Rise of the LAPD |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|doi=10.5149/northcarolina/9781469646831.001.0001|isbn=9781469646831}}</ref>

A 2014 study involving computer-based simulations of a police encounter found a greater likelihood of undergraduate student participants shooting Black targets over White ones.

==== General use of force ====
Police behavior depends on the social dynamics of a scenario in a police to citizen interaction.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKqgBgAAQBAJ&q=police+brutality+statistics&pg=PA149 |title=Criminal Justice Theory: Explaining the Nature and Behavior of Criminal Justice|last1=Maguire|first1=Edward R.|last2=Duffee|first2=David E.|date=2015-02-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134706112|language=en}}</ref> Within scenarios of a police to citizen interaction, different levels of force can be applied to the citizen.

====Searches and arrests====
{{See also|Race and crime in the United States}}
According to a 2003 study, the probability of arrest given the commission of a crime is higher for Whites than it is for Blacks for robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, whereas for rape the probability of arrest is approximately equal across offender race.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=D'Alessio|first1=S.

=== Race and sentencing ===
Over the past 70 years, researching the impact that racial identity has on sentencing outcomes has been at the forefront of criminology. But, many studies contradict each other. Some studies found that minorities receive harsher sentences than Whites, while others found that minorities received lighter punishments.<ref>Mitchell, Ojmarrh, and Doris L. MacKenzie.

Consequently, they resort to jail term as opposed to community corrections sentence.

A 2014 study revealed that judges subconsciously utilize the assumption that minorities are more likely to recidivate to issue a longer sentencing that will prevent the defendants from reengaging in criminal offenses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Starr|first=S.B.|date=2014|title=Evidence-based sentencing and the scientific rationalization of discrimination|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=66|pages=803–872}}</ref> Additionally, theorists advocate that minorities are stereotypically identified as more violent and guilty than Whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bridges|first=George S.|date=1988|title=Law, social standing, and racial disparities in punishment |journal=Social Forces|volume=66|issue=3 |pages=699–724|doi=10.1093/sf/66.3.699}}</ref> This perception encourages judges to believe that they are preventing the onset of future crimes by imprisoning the defendants for a longer duration. This preconception that minorities are unable to economically support themselves warns the judicial system that they are more likely to resort to criminal activity in order to gain access to money or other objectives. Because these characteristics are less associated with White offenders, judges unintentionally treat the two differently.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Albonettie|first=Celesta|date=2002|title=The joint conditioning effect of defendant's gender and ethnicity on length of imprisonment under the federal sentencing guidelines for drug trafficking-manufacturing offenders.|journal=Journal of Gender, Race, and Justice|volume=6|pages=39–60}}</ref> The short amount of time that judges share with defendants in court is insufficient in establishing an objective understanding. As a result, judges may unconsciously utilize the factors that they are given, such as the color of the skin, to construct an impression. Prejudgments on the basis of race influence perception of responsibility and threat to the society.

Research also suggests that there is discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions and unfavorable sentencing for racial minorities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=David S.|last2=Bertrand|first2=Marianne|last3=Mullainathan|first3=Sendhil|s2cid=2338687|date=2012-06-01|title=Do Judges Vary in Their Treatment of Race?|url=https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/355|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=41|issue=2|pages=347–383|doi=10.1086/666006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mustard|first=David B.|date=2001|title=Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=285–314|doi=10.1086/320276|s2cid=154533225}}</ref><ref name=":32">{{cite journal|last1=Anwar|first1=Shamena|last2=Bayer|first2=Patrick|last3=Hjalmarsson|first3=Randi|date=2012-05-01|title=The Impact of Jury Race in Criminal Trials|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=127|issue=2|pages=1017–1055|doi=10.1093/qje/qjs014|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Daudistel|first1=Howard C.|last2=Hosch|first2=Harmon M.|last3=Holmes|first3=Malcolm D.|last4=Graves|first4=Joseph B.|date=1999-02-01|title=Effects of Defendant Ethnicity on Juries' Dispositions of Felony Cases|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=317–336|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb01389.x}}</ref><ref name=":62">{{cite journal|last1=Depew|first1=Briggs|last2=Eren|first2=Ozkan|last3=Mocan|first3=Naci|s2cid=147631237|year=2017|title=Judges, Juveniles, and In-Group Bias|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22003.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]]|volume=60|issue=2|pages=209–239|doi=10.1086/693822}}</ref><ref name=":25" /><ref name=":19" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Crystal S.|last2=Cohen|first2=Alma|date=2019|title=Judicial Politics and Sentencing Decisions|journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=160–91|doi=10.1257/pol.20170329|issn=1945-7731|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Arnold|first1=David|last2=Dobbie|first2=Will S|last3=Hull|first3=Peter|date=2020|title=Measuring Racial Discrimination in Bail Decisions|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w26999}}</ref> A 2012 study found that "(i) juries formed from all-White jury pools convict Black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than White defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one Black member."<ref name=":32" /> Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where "Black (White) juveniles who are randomly assigned to Black (White) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences."<ref name=":62" />

A 2016 study from the [[American Psychological Association]], "Discrimination and Instructional Comprehension", researched how the lack of comprehension of capital penalty jury instructions, relates to death sentencing in America. This study was composed of eligible subjects, who were given the option to sentence a verdict based on their comprehension from the given instructions and their evidence. The study concluded that multiple verdicts who could not comprehend the penalty instructions, had a higher death sentence probability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-15821-005|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-14}}</ref>

Some researchers have suggested that there is a "white victim effect" in the application capital punishment in the US, which is where defendants, particularly black defendants, who kill white victims are more likely to receive the death penalty than other victim-defendant combinations (such as black victim-black defendant or black victim-white defendant), though the existence of this effect remains debated. For example, one 2014 study on the application of the death penalty in Connecticut over the period 1973–2007 found "that minority defendants who kill White victims are capitally charged at substantially higher rates than minority defendants who kill minorities... There is also strong and statistically significant evidence that minority defendants who kill Whites are more likely to end up with capital sentences than comparable cases with White defendants."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donohue|first=John J.|s2cid=39548863|date=2014-10-28|title=An Empirical Evaluation of the Connecticut Death Penalty System Since 1973: Are There Unlawful Racial, Gender, and Geographic Disparities?|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=637–696|doi=10.1111/jels.12052|issn=1740-1453}}</ref> Conversely, another 2014 study focusing on North Carolina argued that the "white victim effect" was largely driven by confounders (such as aggravating and mitigating factors) and that controlling for these rendered the effect insignificant.<ref>Jennings, Wesley G., Tara N.

State prisons house almost all the offenders convicted of a violent crime in each respective state. In contrast to federal prisons, state prisons mostly consist of violent offenders. The disparities in imprisonment by race varies greatly between different states and regions in the US. In 2014, 12 states had majority Black prison populations and 1 state (New Mexico) majority Hispanic. African Americans were overrepresented relative to their population to varying degrees in every US state. The ratio in imprisonment between Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites was highest in New Jersey (12.2), Wisconsin (11.5) and Iowa (11.1). Racial disparities in imprisonment between Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites are much lower than average in most of the [[Southern United States]] with the lowest disparities being in the states of Hawaii (2.4), Mississippi (3.0) and Georgia (3.2). The only region with a large overrepresentation in imprisonment rate of Hispanics relative to non-Hispanic Whites is the [[Northeastern United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/|title=The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in State Prisons|publisher=The Sentencing Project}}</ref>

A 2016 analysis by ''[[The New York Times]]'' "of tens of thousands of disciplinary cases against inmates in 2015, hundreds of pages of internal reports and three years of parole decisions found that racial disparities were embedded in the prison experience in New York."<ref name=":142">{{Cite news|last1=Winerip|first1=Michael Schwirtz, Michael|last2=Gebeloff|first2=Robert|date=2016-12-03|title=The Scourge of Racial Bias in New York State's Prisons|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/nyregion/new-york-state-prisons-inmates-racial-bias.html|accessdate=2016-12-03}}</ref> Blacks and Latinos were sent more frequently to solitary and held there for longer durations than Whites.<ref name=":142" /> The ''New York Times'' analysis found that the disparities were the greatest for violations where the prison guards had much discretion, such as disobeying orders, but smaller for violations that required physical evidence, such as possessing contraband.<ref name=":142" />

=== Race and recidivism ===
A study that considered 34,794 federal offenders took into account the race, risk assessment, and future arrests of all participating members of the sample. Though the use of the Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA), which proved to be highly accurate in predicting whether or not Whites and Blacks would return to prison after being released, showed that [[recidivism]] correlates less with race and more with criminal history.<ref>SKEEM, J. L. and LOWENKAMP, C. T. (2016), RISK, RACE, AND RECIDIVISM: PREDICTIVE BIAS AND DISPARATE IMPACT. Criminology, 54: 680-712. doi:10.1111/1745-9125.12123</ref>

Other studies suggest that recidivism rates as related to race vary based on state. For example, the Alabama Department of Corrections performed a study where they tracked 2003 releases for three years. In that time span, 29% of both African American and White males that were released returned to prison, 20% of African American females that were released returned to prison, and 24% of White females returned to prison. The Florida Department of Corrections performed a similar study; they tracked 2001 releases for 5 years. They found that 45% of African American males were reincarcerated and 28% of non-African American males were reincarcerated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/created-equal.pdf|title=Created Equal: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the US Criminal Justice System|last=Hartney, Vuong|first=Christopher, Linh|date=2009}}</ref>

===Race and habitual offender sentencing===
There are two main studies that analyze the issue of habitual offenders in regards to race. Both were mostly conducted by Western Michigan University professor Charles Crawford. Published in 1998 and 2000, both studies focused on habitual offenders in the state of [[Florida]]. Crawford's studies found that Black defendants in [[Florida]] were significantly more likely to be sentenced as [[habitual offender]]s than were Whites, and that this effect was significantly larger for drug offenses and property crimes of which Whites are often the victims.<ref>CRAWFORD, CHARLES; CHIRICOS, TED; [[Gary Kleck|KLECK, GARY]] (August 1998). "RACE, RACIAL THREAT, AND SENTENCING OF HABITUAL OFFENDERS*". ''Criminology''. '''36''' (3): 481–512. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1111/j.1745-9125.1998.tb01256.x.</ref>

Examining both individual level and county level variables, a new study from 2008 updated and evaluated Crawford's work. It affirmed that sentencing policies are becoming harsher, and habitual offender statutes are currently just another tool that lawmakers use to incarcerate minorities at a higher rate than their White counterparts. The 2008 study concluded that habitual offender statutes can only continue to be used if they are used in a way that completely disregards race and is unbiased.<ref>Crow, M. S., & Johnson, K. A.

== Race in the juvenile justice system ==
In the United States, racial disparities in the [[American juvenile justice system|juvenile justice system]] are partly, but not entirely, due to racial differences in offending; differences in treatment by the justice system also appear to play a role.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Donna M. |last2=Leiber |first2=Michael J. |date=December 23, 2011 |title=Racial and Ethnic Differences in Delinquency and Justice System Responses |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Juvenile Crime and Juvenile Justice |url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385106.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195385106-e-20 |language=en |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385106.013.0020}}</ref>

Black and Latino juvenile offenders are also vastly more likely to be tried as adults by local prosecutors throughout the US, and are generally likelier to be given harsher, longer sentences by the judges presiding over their trials.

A study of New Jersey juvenile court records for the years 2010-2015 released by WNYC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/black-kids-more-likely-be-tried-adults-cant-be-explained|title=Kids in Prison: Getting Tried as An Adult Depends on Skin Color}}</ref> late in 2016 found that Black and Latino offenders comprised almost 90% of juveniles tried as adults (849 Black youths, 247 Latino out of a total of 1,251 juveniles tried as adults during the five-year period, thereby Black/Hispanic teens represented 87.6% of the total cases.) WNYC also surveyed all NJ inmates currently serving sentences which resulted from crimes committed as a minor, and found that 93% of them are Black or Latino. These numbers represent a clear racial disparity in sentencing, particularly so, given the fact that during this period New Jersey was only 14.8% Black and 19.7% Hispanic, in comparison to 56.2% of the state's residents being White.
"Controlling for nature of offense...for family background...for educational history—all of the things that go into a prosecutor's decision, there are still disparities, significant disparities, that cannot be explained by anything other than race," says Laura Cohen, the director of the Criminal and Youth Justice Clinic at Rutgers Law School.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/new-jersey-juvenile-detention-minority-tried-adults|title=Nearly 90% of New Jersey children tried as adults since 2011 were black or Latino|first=Sarah|last=Gonzalez|date=October 11, 2016|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

These numbers are comparable to the juvenile detention and sentencing trends for the country as a whole, analysis of which shows that roughly 60% of all juveniles who received life sentences after being tried as adults are Black. Judges, prosecutors, juries, and police/detention officers all commonly perceive Black children as less innocent and childlike than White children. Black teens are commonly over-estimated in age by an average of 4.5 years, meaning that Black boys as young as 13 could conceivably be seen as fully 18 years old, and thereby easily acceptable for overzealous prosecutors to treat as an adult defendant. This tendency to round Black teens up to adults is detailed in a 2014 study by the American Psychological Association entitled: "The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0035663.pdf|title=The essence of innocence: consequences of dehumanizing Black children|date=2014|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=106|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1037/a0035663|pmid=24564373|vauthors=Goff PA, Jackson MC, Di Leone BA, Culotta CM, DiTomasso NA}}</ref>

The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914.

The controversy surrounding The War on Drugs is still widely debated by the academic community. In March 2016, former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told a writer for Harper's magazine that "the Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and Black people". He then went on to elaborate further, saying: "knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or Black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities".<ref name="heinonline.org1">{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/osjcl9&div=5&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|title=The New Jim Crow|author=Alexander, M.|website=heinonline.org}}</ref> This recent comment by Ehrlichman made headlines primarily because it was the first instance of any person who was ever affiliated with the Presidential administration publicly framing the drug war as a political tactic to assist Nixon's win.<ref name="heinonline.org1"/>
 
Many scholars believe that The War on Drugs had a large impact on minority communities across the nation. In particular, African American communities were affected by the political implications of the new drug policies.

[[William Bennett|William J. Bennett]], John J. Dilulio, Jr., and [[John P.

They argue that children born out of wedlock are more likely to commit crimes, and they use this argument to explain the higher rate of crime for [[African Americans|African American]] youth compared to that of White youth in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://study.sagepub.com/system/files/Bennett,_William_J.,_John_J._DiIulio,_Jr.,_and_John_P._Walters_-_Moral_Poverty_Theory.pdf|title = Bennett, William J., John J.

==Causes of racial disproportionality==
===In the criminal justice system overall===
Two competing hypotheses exist regarding why racial/ethnic minorities, especially African Americans, are overrepresented in the criminal justice system compared to their share of the general population. These are the '''differential offending''' or '''differential involvement''' hypothesis, which proposes that this overrepresentation is a result of African Americans committing more of the crimes that result in criminal justice processing, and the '''differential selection''' hypothesis, which proposes that this disproportionality is a result of discrimination by the criminal justice system.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Piquero |first1=Alex R. |last2=Brame |first2=Robert W. |date=April 14, 2008 |title=Assessing the Race–Crime and Ethnicity–Crime Relationship in a Sample of Serious Adolescent Delinquents |journal=Crime & Delinquency |language=en |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=390–422 |doi=10.1177/0011128707307219 |pmc=2782848 |pmid=19946564}}</ref> Piquero (2008) argues that it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine which of these factors is more important than the other.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Disproportionate Minority Contact |last=Piquero |first=Alex R. |date=December 3, 2008 |journal=The Future of Children |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=59–79 |doi=10.1353/foc.0.0013 |pmid=21337998 |s2cid=11922711 }}</ref>

The criminal justice system in the United States has a very large imbalance in the composition of races, specifically between Blacks and Whites, incarcerated. Alfred Blumstein states, "Although Blacks comprise roughly one-eighth of the population, they represent about one-half of the prison population. Thus, the race-specific incarceration rates are grossly disproportionate." The research done by Alfred Blumstein and the apparent dis-proportionality raise the problem of injustice within the United States criminal justice system. This injustice is alluded to further, but not directly linked to racial injustice, because Black males are the victims of having an incarceration rate twenty five times higher than that of the total population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jclc73&div=59&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals#|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|accessdate=2017-11-15}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite journal|last1=Pettit|first1=Becky|last2=Western|first2=Bruce|date=2004-04-01|title=Mass Imprisonment and the Life Course: Race and Class Inequality in U.S. Incarceration|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|volume=69|issue=2|pages=151–169|doi=10.1177/000312240406900201|s2cid=14332898|issn=0003-1224}}</ref>

Education may also be a factor that plays into this dis-proportionality. Studies done from 1965 to 1969 based on administrative data, surveys, and census data showed that 3 percent of Whites and 20 percent of Blacks served time in prison by their early thirties. Thirty years later in 1999, risk of incarceration was partially dependent on education with 30 percent of college dropouts and roughly 60 percent of high school dropouts going to prison. Education playing a role in either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of incarceration based upon the education and skill a person possesses.<ref name="auto1"/>

Further research shows that there have been significant strides into diving deeper to explain why racial/ethnic minorities are incarcerated at a higher rate than then the rest of the population. In a manual by the Sentencing Project, they emphasize four commonly identified causes of racial disparity in the criminal justice system; higher crime rates, inequitable access to resources, legislative decisions, and overt racial bias. “While some claim that minority overrepresentation in the justice system is solely the result of people of color committing more crime, empirical analyses do not support this claim.” Studies have shown that a variety of factors could explain the racial disparity; “law enforcement practices, crime rates, and punitive sentencing policies.” The level of crime rates show that minorities commit more crimes but that does not account for crimes that go unreported.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title=Reducing Racial Disparity in the Criminal Justice System|url=https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reducing-Racial-Disparity-in-the-Criminal-Justice-System-A-Manual-for-Practitioners-and-Policymakers.pdf|journal=Sentencing Project}}</ref>

An inequitable access to resources can result in “very different outcomes between middle-class and low-income individuals even though they may share similar behavioral problems.” Communities that have more resources tend to find a different approach to treating behavioral problems that does not involve juvenile or criminal justice system. Resources are more available to middle-class parents than to lower income parents. “The misallocation of resources within the criminal justice system can compound the disparate experiences of minority defendants as they move through the system.”<ref name=":1" />

Legislatures have been enacting the laws that define prohibited behavior and the penalties for these violations since the very beginning. Many of which have a “disproportionate impact on minority communities.” Some areas that have been significant in this regard were the War on Drugs in the 1980s that accounts for a lot of the people of color that are in prison for the use of crack cocaine. Then there is the Three Strikes Legislation, that assigns “mandatory sentences of life without parole for three time repeat felony offenders.” Next, is the overreliance on incarceration, in the last couple of decades punitive laws have begun to pass, increasing the population of prison and jail. Despite lacking evidence that describes prison as the most effective approach to control crime. Lastly, the authors of 'Reducing Racial Disparity in the Criminal Justice System' state that “So long as racism exists within society at large, it will be found within the criminal justice system. Racism fuels the overt bias which can show in the language, attitudes, conduct, assumptions, strategies and policies of criminal justice agencies.” Research has shown that there is an overt racial bias in the criminal justice decision making. In the way police interact with the community, how minorities in the courtroom are addressed, as well as how prison officials interact with inmates’ family members. People are likely to identify with those who look like them and that does not exempt criminal justice practitioners.<ref name=":1" />

Ulmer findings suggest that “most disproportionality (particularly in Federal courts) is determined by processes prior to sentencing, especially sentencing policies that differentially impact minority males.” They found that there is a 25-30% unexplained difference between arrest and incarceration and that disproportionality you need to understand the role that prosecutors, judges, and probation and parole officers contribute.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Allen|date=Summer 2017|title=Racial Disproportionality in U.S. State Prisons: Accounting for the Effects of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Criminal Involvement, Arrests, Sentencing, and Time Served|journal=J Quant Criminol}}</ref>

===In incarceration rates===
Blacks had a higher chance of going to prison especially those who had dropped out of high school. If a Black male [[Dropping out|dropped out]] of high school, he had an over 50% chance of being incarcerated in his lifetime, as compared to an 11% chance for White male high school dropouts.<ref>Western, Bruce. 'Punishment and Inequality in America'. New York: Russell, 2006.</ref> Socio-economic, geographic, and educational disparities, as well as alleged unequal treatment in the criminal justice system, contributed to this gap in incarceration rates by race.

Failure to achieve [[literacy]] (reading at "[[Educational stage|grade level]]") by the third or fourth grade makes the likelihood of future incarceration twenty times more likely than other students. Some states use this measurement to predict how much prison space they will require in the future. It appears to be a poverty issue rather than a race issue.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Bob | last=Rains | title=Brevard's new literacy crusade:United Way.

Some studies suggest that [[Minority group|minorities]] are targeted at disproportionate rates and sent to prison for reasons that are ignored for non-minorities. When the citizens who have been arrested can no longer support themselves the legal route, they might decide to turn to the underground world of crime. This decision can lead to harm upon oneself, open the door to addiction, and possible re-arrest which repeats the cycle of sending minorities to prison. It was found in 2010 that "the United States imprisoned a larger percentage of its Black population than South Africa did at the height of the [[Apartheid]]."<ref>Martensen, Kayla. “The Price That US Minority Communities Pay: Mass Incarceration and the Ideologies That Fuel Them.” Contemporary Justice Review, vol. 15, no. 2, June 2012, pp. 211–222. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1080/10282580.2012.681165.</ref> This shows a clear occurrence of disproportionate racial incarceration.

In a 2013 study, Beaver et al. found that the increased likelihood of African American males of being arrested and incarcerated compared to White males was entirely accounted for by adjusting for both self-reported violence and [[IQ]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beaver|first1=Kevin M.|last2=DeLisi|first2=Matt|last3=Wright|first3=John Paul|last4=Boutwell|first4=Brian B.|last5=Barnes|first5=J.C.|last6=Vaughn|first6=Michael G.|title=No evidence of racial discrimination in criminal justice processing: Results from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=July 2013|volume=55|issue=1|pages=29–34|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2013.01.020}}</ref> However, a 2015 study found that African American males only had a higher likelihood to commit violent crime than White males, with a similar likelihood to commit property crime and a lower likelihood to consume drugs.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/2153368714546953|title = Group Differences in Delinquency|year = 2015|last1 = Felson|first1 = Richard B.|last2 = Kreager|first2 = Derek A.|journal = Race and Justice|volume = 5|pages = 58–87|s2cid = 147353080}}</ref> This study used a notably larger sample size than Beaver et al. (n=18060 compared to n=1197 since Beaver et al. limited themselves to looking at those with complete data on race, age, IQ, and self-reported lifetime violence), and failed to observe consistent effects of race for different offenses. They went so far as to posit "The inconsistent pattern challenges the stereotypical image of the criminality of Black communities. It is also a challenge to the idea that crime theories can explain race differences."

According to the US [[Census Bureau]] as of the year 2000, there were 2,224,181 Blacks enrolled in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=SEX BY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT BY LEVEL OF SCHOOL BY TYPE OF SCHOOL FOR THE POPULATION 3 YEARS AND OVER.

==Effects on families and neighborhoods==
According to Dorothy Roberts the current prison system serves as a [[punitive]] system in which mass incarceration has become the response to problems in society. Field studies regarding prison conditions describe behavioral changes produced by prolonged incarceration, and conclude that imprisonment undermines the social life of inmates by exacerbating criminality or impairing their capacity for normal social interaction. Roberts further argues this racial disparity in imprisonment, particularly with African Americans, subjects them to political subordination by destroying their positive connection with society.<ref name="Roberts 2004">{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Dorothy|title=The Social and Moral Cost of Mass Incarceration in African American Communities|journal=Stanford Law Review|year=2004|volume=56}}</ref> Roberts also argues that institutional factors – such as the [[prison industrial complex]] itself – become enmeshed in everyday lives, so much so that prisons no longer function as "law enforcement" systems.<ref name="Roberts 2004" /> It has also been argued that Latinos have been overlooked in the debate over the criminal justice system.<ref name="SpearIt"/> It has also been suggested that differences in the way the criminal justice system treats Blacks and Whites decreases legitimacy, which, in turn, increases criminal behavior, leading to further increases in racial disparities in interactions with the criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rocque|first1=M.|title=Racial Disparities in the Criminal Justice System and Perceptions of Legitimacy: A Theoretical Linkage|journal=Race and Justice|date=July 25, 2011|volume=1|issue=3|pages=292–315|doi=10.1177/2153368711409758|s2cid=147511976}}</ref>

Crime in poorer urban neighborhoods is linked to increased rates of mass incarceration, as job opportunities decline and people turn to crime for survival.<ref name=Pettit>{{cite journal|last=Pettit|first=B.|author2=Western, B. |title=Mass Imprisonment and the Life Course: Race and Class Inequality in U.S. Incarceration|journal=American Sociological Review|date=April 1, 2004|volume=69|issue=2|pages=151–169|doi=10.1177/000312240406900201|s2cid=14332898}}</ref> Crime among low-education men is often linked to the economic decline among unskilled workers.<ref name=Pettit /> These economic problems are also tied to reentry into society after incarceration. Data from the Washington State Department of Corrections and Employment Insurance records show how "the wages of Black ex-inmates grow about 21 percent more slowly each quarter after release than the wages of White ex-inmates".<ref name="Lyons 257–280">{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Christopher J.|author2=Pettit, Becky |title=Compounded Disadvantage: Race, Incarceration, and Wage Growth|journal=Social Problems|date=May 1, 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=257–280|doi=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257|url=https://www.issuelab.org/permalink/resource/14509}}</ref> A conviction leads to all sorts of social, political, and economic disadvantages for felons, and has been dubbed the "new civil death" (Chin 2012, 179). In the aggregate, these obstacles make it difficult for released inmates to transition to society successfully, which, in turn, makes it difficult for these communities to achieve social stability.

Black ex-inmates earn 10 percent less than White ex-inmates post incarceration on average.<ref name="Lyons 257–280" />

=== Black women ===

Problems resulting from mass incarceration extend beyond economic and political aspects to reach community lives as well. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 46% of Black female inmates were likely to have grown up in a home with only their mothers. A study by Bresler and Lewis shows how incarcerated African American women were more likely to have been raised in a single female headed household while incarcerated White women were more likely to be raised in a two parent household.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Susan|title=Mothering and Making It, in and Out of Prison|journal=[[Punishment & Society]]|date=April 1, 2004|volume=6|issue=2|pages=229–233|doi=10.1177/1462474504041269|s2cid=143817802}}</ref> Black women's lives are often shaped by the prison system because they have intersecting familial and community obligations. The "increase incarceration of Black men and the sex ratio imbalance it induces shape the behavior of young Black women".<ref name=mecho>{{cite journal|last=Mechoulan|first=Stephane|title=The External Effects of black Male Incarceration on Black Females|journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]]|issue=29}}</ref>

Education, fertility, and employment for Black women are affected due to increased mass incarceration. Black women's employment rates were increased, shown in Mechoulan's data, due to increased education. Higher rates of Black male incarceration lowered the odds of nonmarital teenage motherhood and Black women's ability to get an educational degree, thus resulting in early employment.<ref name=mecho/> Whether incarcerated themselves or related to someone who was incarcerated, women are often conformed into stereotypes of how they are supposed to behave yet are isolated from society at the same time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=S.|author2=Haas, L. P. |author3=Coverdill, J. E. |s2cid=145479349|title=Disentangling Victim Gender and Capital Punishment: The Role of Media|journal=Feminist Criminology|date=December 15, 2011|volume=7|issue=2|pages=130–145|doi=10.1177/1557085111427295}}</ref>

Furthermore, this system can disintegrate familial life and structure. Black and Latino youth are more likely to be incarcerated after coming in contact with the [[American juvenile justice system]]. According to a study by Victor Rios, 75% of prison inmates in the United States are Black and Latinos between the ages of 20 and 39.<ref name="Rios 40–54">{{cite journal|last=Rios|first=Victor M.|s2cid=219695079|title=The Hyper-Criminalization of Black and Latino Male Youth in the Era of Mass Incarceration|journal=Souls|date=July 1, 2006|volume=8|issue=2|pages=40–54|doi=10.1080/10999940600680457}}</ref> Rios further argued that, societal institutions – such as schools, families, and community centers can impact youth by initiating them into this "system of criminalization" from an early age. Rios argues that these institutions, which are traditionally set up to protect the youth, contribute to mass incarceration by mimicking the criminal justice system.<ref name="Rios 40–54"/>

From a different perspective, parents in prison face further moral and emotional dilemmas because they are separated from their children. Both Black and White women face difficulty with where to place their children while incarcerated and how to maintain contact with them.<ref name="Ferraro 9–40">{{cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kathleen J.|author2=Moe, Angela M. |title=Mothering, Crime, And Incarceration|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|date=February 1, 2003|volume=32|issue=1|pages=9–40|doi=10.1177/0891241602238937|s2cid=145505171}}</ref> According to the study by Bresler and Lewis, Black women are more likely to leave their children with related kin whereas White women's children are likely to be placed in foster care.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnes |first1=Sandra L. |last2=Stringer |first2=Ebonie Cunningham |s2cid=145363177 |title=Is Motherhood Important? Imprisoned Women's Maternal Experiences Before and During Confinement and Their Postrelease Expectations |journal=Feminist Criminology |date=2014 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=3–23 |doi=10.1177/1557085113504450}}</ref> In a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed how in 1999, seven percent of Black children had a parent in prison, making them nine times more likely to have an incarcerated parent than White children.<ref name="Roberts 2004"/>

Having parents in prison can have adverse psychological effects as children are deprived of parental guidance, emotional support, and financial help.<ref name="Roberts 2004"/> Because many prisons are located in remote areas, incarcerated parents face physical barriers in seeing their children and vice versa.

Societal influences, such as low education among African American men, can also lead to higher rates of incarceration. Imprisonment has become "disproportionately widespread among low-education Black men" in which the penal system has evolved to be a "new feature of American race and class inequality".<ref name="Pettit" /> Scholar Pettit and Western's research has shown how incarceration rates for African Americans are "about eight times higher than those for Whites", and prison inmates have less than "12 years of completed schooling" on average.<ref name="Pettit" />

=== Post release ===

These factors all impact released prisoners who try to reintegrate into society. According to a national study, within three years of release, almost 7 in 10 will have been rearrested. Many released prisoners have difficulty transitioning back into societies and communities from state and federal prisons because the social environment of peers, family, community, and state level policies all impact prison reentry; the process of leaving prison or jail and returning to society. Men eventually released from prison will most likely return to their same communities, putting additional strain on already scarce resources as they attempt to garner the assistance they need to successfully reenter society. They also tend to come from disadvantaged communities as well and due to the lack of resources, these same men will continue along this perpetuating cycle.<ref name=Pettit /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Warner|first=Cody|date=July 1, 2015|title=On the move: Incarceration, race, and residential mobility|journal=Social Science Research|volume=52|pages=451–464|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.03.009|issn=1096-0317|pmid=26004473}}</ref>

A major challenge for prisoners re-entering society is obtaining employment, especially for individuals with a felony on their record. A study utilizing U.S. Census occupational data in New Jersey and Minnesota in 2000 found that "individuals with felon status would have been disqualified from approximately one out of every 6.5 occupations in New Jersey and one out of every 8.5 positions in Minnesota".<ref>Wheelock, Darren; Christopher Uggen and Heather Hlvaka. [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=socs_fac 'Employment Restrictions for Individuals with Felons Status and Racial Inequality in the Labor Market'] in 'Global Perspectives on Re-Entry'. Marquette University, 2011.</ref> It has also been argued that combination of race and criminal status of an individual will diminish the positive aspects of an individual and intensify stereotypes. From the viewpoint of employers, the racial stereotypes will be confirmed and encourage discrimination in the hiring process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lyons|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Pettit|first2=Becky|date=January 1, 2011|title=Compounded Disadvantage: Race, Incarceration, and Wage Growth|jstor=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257|journal=Social Problems|volume=58|issue=2|pages=257–280 |doi=10.1525/sp.2011.58.2.257|url=https://www.issuelab.org/permalink/resource/14509}}</ref> As African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by felon status, these additional limitations on employment opportunity were shown to exacerbate racial disparities in the labor market.

==Calls for reform==
There have been minor adjustments to reduce the incarceration rate in the United States on the state level. Some of these efforts include introducing [[California Proposition 47 (2014)|Proposition 47]] in 2014, which reclassified specific property and drug crimes, and the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws|Rockefeller drug laws]] in 2009, which pressed extreme minimum sentences for minor drug offenses. According to [[Sentencing Project|The Sentencing Project]], there can be other alterations made to lower the incarceration rate. Some changes include reducing the length of some sentences, making resources such as treatment for substance abuse available to all and investing in organizations that promote strong youth development.
