'''Jesse Louis Jackson Sr.''' ([[Given name|né]] '''Burns'''; born October 8, 1941) is an American [[civil rights]] [[activist]], [[Baptist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], and [[Politics of the United States|politician]]. He was a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[presidential nomination]] in [[1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1984]] and [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988]] and served as a [[shadow U.S. Senator]] for the [[District of Columbia]] from 1991 to 1997.

He is the founder of the organizations that merged to form [[Rainbow/PUSH]]. Former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jesse Jackson Jr.|Jesse. Jackson, Jr.]], is his eldest son. Jackson hosted ''[[Both Sides with Jesse Jackson]]'' on [[CNN]] from 1992 to 2000.

==Early life and education==
Jackson was born in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], to Helen Burns (1924–2015), a 16-year-old high school student and her 33-year-old married neighbor, Noah Louis Robinson (1908–1997). The family has some [[Cherokee]] roots.<ref>Blue Clark, ''Indian Tribes of Oklahoma: A Guide'', University of Oklahoma Press (2012), p. 75</ref> Robinson was a former professional boxer who was an employee of a textile brokerage and a well-known figure in the black community.<ref name="father"/><ref name="aims"/><ref name="history"/> One year after Jesse's birth, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, a post office maintenance worker who later adopted the boy.<ref name="father"/><ref name="aims"/> Jesse was given his stepfather's name in the adoption, but as he grew up he also maintained a close relationship with Robinson. He considered both men to be his fathers.<ref name="father"/><ref name="aims"/>

As a young child, Jackson was taunted by other children about his out-of-wedlock birth, and has said these experiences helped motivate him to succeed.<ref name="father"/><ref name="aims"/> Living under [[Jim Crow]] segregation laws, Jackson was taught to go to the back of the bus and use separate water fountains—practices he accepted until the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] of 1955.<ref name="aims"/> He attended the [[Segregation in the US South|racially segregated]] Sterling High School in Greenville, where he was elected student class president, finished tenth in his class, and [[Letterman (sports)|earned letters]] in baseball, football and basketball.<ref name="gale"/>

Upon graduating from high school in 1959, he rejected a contract from a minor league professional baseball team so that he could attend the [[University of Illinois]] on a football scholarship.<ref name="history"/><ref name="MSN"/> After his second semester at that predominantly white school, Jackson transferred to [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University|North Carolina A&T]], a [[historically black university]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. Accounts of the reasons for this transfer differ. Jackson has said that he changed schools because racial prejudice prevented him from playing quarterback and limited his participation on a competitive public-speaking team.<ref name="MSN"/><ref name="would"/>

Writing an article on [[ESPN.com]] in 2002, sociologist [[Harry Edwards (sociologist)|Harry Edwards]] noted that the University of Illinois had previously had a black quarterback, but also noted that black athletes attending traditionally white colleges during the 1950s and 1960s encountered a "combination of culture shock and discrimination".<ref name="would"/> Edwards also suggested that Jackson had left the University of Illinois in 1960 because he had been placed on academic probation,<ref name="would"/> but the school's president reported in 1987 that Jackson's 1960 freshman year transcript was clean, and said he would have been eligible to re-enroll at any time.<ref name="records"/>

At A&T, Jackson played quarterback and was elected student body president.<ref name="history"/> He became active in local civil rights protests against segregated libraries, theaters and restaurants.<ref name="100 greatest"/> He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[sociology]] in 1964, then attended the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] on a scholarship.<ref name="aims"/> He dropped out in 1966, three classes short of earning his master's degree, to focus full-time on the [[civil rights movement]].<ref name="gale"/><ref name="degree"/> He was ordained a minister in 1968, and in 2000 was awarded a Master of Divinity Degree based on his previous credits earned plus his life experience and subsequent work.<ref name="degree"/><ref name="masters"/>

===The Greenville Eight===
{{Main|Greenville Eight}}

On July 16, 1960, while home from college, Jackson joined seven other African Americans in a [[sit-in]] at the Greenville Public Library in Greenville, South Carolina, which only allowed white people. The group was arrested for "disorderly conduct". Jackson's pastor paid their bond, the ''[[Greenville News]]'' said. DeeDee Wright, another member of the group, later said they wanted to be arrested "so it could be a test case.” The Greenville City Council closed both the main library and the branch black people used. The possibility of a lawsuit led to the reopening of both libraries September 19, also the day after the ''News'' printed a letter written by Wright.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.salisburypost.com/2018/10/23/wright-recalls-time-when-greenville-eight-were-arrested-not-celebrated/|title=DeeDee Wright recalls the time when the 'Greenville Eight' were arrested, not celebrated|last=Wineka|first=Mark|work=[[Salisbury Post]]|date=October 23, 2018|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}</ref>

===SCLC and Operation Breadbasket===
Jackson has been known for commanding public attention since he first started working for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]<ref name="pride"/> In 1965 he participated in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] organized by [[James Bevel]], King and other civil rights leaders in Alabama.<ref name="aims"/> Impressed by Jackson's drive and organizational abilities, King soon began giving Jackson a role in the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), though he was concerned about Jackson's apparent ambition and attention-seeking.<ref name="aims"/><ref name="maverick"/> When Jackson returned from Selma, he was charged with establishing a frontline office for the SCLC in Chicago.<ref name="maverick"/>

In 1966 King and Bevel selected Jackson to head the Chicago branch of the SCLC's economic arm, [[Operation Breadbasket]]<ref name="maverick"/><ref name="quits"/> and he was promoted to national director in 1967.<ref name="MSN"/> Operation Breadbasket had been started by the Atlanta leadership of the SCLC as a job placement agency for blacks.<ref name="chicago's"/> Under Jackson's leadership, a key goal was to encourage massive boycotts by black consumers as a means to pressure white-owned businesses to hire blacks and to purchase goods and services from black-owned firms.<ref name="maverick"/><ref name="chicago's"/>

[[T. R. M. Howard]], a 1950s proponent of the consumer boycott tactic, soon became a major supporter of Jackson's efforts – donating and raising funds, and introducing Jackson to prominent members of the black business community in Chicago.<ref name="maverick"/> Under Jackson's direction, Operation Breadbasket held popular weekly workshops on Chicago's South Side featuring white and black political and economic leaders,<ref name="quits"/> and religious services complete with a jazz band and choir.<ref name="chicago's"/>

Jackson became involved in SCLC leadership disputes following King's assassination on April 4, 1968. When King was shot, Jackson was in the parking lot one floor below.<ref name="aims"/> Jackson told reporters he was the last person to speak to King, and that King died in his arms – an account that several King aides disputed.<ref name="aims"/> In the wake of King's death, Jackson worked on SCLC's [[Poor People's Campaign|Poor People's Crusade]] in Washington, D.C., and was credited with managing its 15-acre tent city – but he began to increasingly clash with [[Ralph Abernathy]], King's successor as chairman of the SCLC.<ref name="chief"/><ref name="shanty"/> In 1969 ''The New York Times'' reported that several black leaders viewed Jackson as King's successor and that Jackson was one of the few black activists who was preaching racial reconciliation.

Jackson was also reportedly seeking coalition with whites in order to approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems. "When we change the race problem into a class fight between the haves and the have-nots, then we are going to have a new ball game", he said.<ref name="chicago's"/> In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. ''The Times'' also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.<ref name="chicago's"/>

In the spring of 1971 Abernathy ordered Jackson to move the national office of Operation Breadbasket from Chicago to Atlanta and sought to place another person in charge of local Chicago activities, but Jackson refused to move.<ref name="quits"/> He organized the October 1971 Black Expo in Chicago, a trade and business fair to promote black capitalism and grass roots political power.<ref name="races"/> The five-day event was attended by black businessmen from 40 states, as well as politicians such as Cleveland Mayor [[Carl Stokes]], and Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. Daley's presence was seen as a testament to the growing political and economic power of blacks.<ref name="races"/>

In December 1971 Jackson and Abernathy had a complete falling out, with the split described as part of a leadership struggle between Jackson, who had a national profile, and Abernathy, whose prominence from the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was beginning to wane.<ref name="quits"/> The break began when Abernathy questioned the handling of receipts from the Black Expo, and then suspended Jackson as leader of Operation Breadbasket for not obtaining permission to form non-profit corporations.<ref name="quits"/> [[Al Sharpton]], then youth group leader of the SCLC, left the organization to protest Jackson's treatment and formed the [[National Youth Movement]].<ref name=DS/> Jackson, his entire Breadbasket staff, and 30 of the 35 board members resigned from the SCLC and began planning a new organization.<ref name="search"/><ref name="races2"/> ''Time'' magazine quoted Jackson as saying at that time that the traditional civil rights movement had lost its "offensive thrust."<ref name="races2"/>

===Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:20070906 Rainbow-PUSH Headquarters.JPG|thumb|The [[Rainbow/PUSH]] national headquarters in [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]], Chicago]]
[[People United to Save Humanity]] (Operation PUSH) officially began operations on December 25, 1971;<ref name="races2"/> Jackson later changed the name to People United to Serve Humanity.<ref name="clearing"/> T. R. M. Howard was installed as a member of the board of directors and chair of the finance committee.<ref name="maverick"/> At its inception, Jackson planned to orient Operation PUSH toward politics and to pressure politicians to work to improve economic opportunities for blacks and poor people of all races.<ref name="races2"/> SCLC officials reportedly felt the new organization would help black businesses more than it would help the poor.<ref name="races2"/>

In 1978 Jackson called for a closer relationship between blacks and the Republican Party, telling the [[Republican National Committee|Party's National Committee]] that "Black people need the Republican Party to compete for us so we can have real alternatives ... The Republican Party needs black people if it is ever to compete for national office."<ref name="wooing"/>

In 1983 Jackson and Operation PUSH led a boycott against beer giant [[Anheuser-Busch]], criticizing the company's level of minority employment in their distribution network. [[August Busch IV]], Anheuser-Busch's CEO was introduced in 1996 to Yusef Jackson, Jesse's son, by Jackson family friend [[Ron Burkle]]. In 1998 Yusef and his brother Jonathan were chosen by Anheuser-Busch to head River North Sales, a Chicago beer distribution company, leading to controversy. "There is no causal connection between the boycott in 1983 and me meeting in the middle '90s and me buying this company in 1998," said Yusef.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jackson|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20051015/ISSUE02/100024624/jackson|work=Crain's Chicago Business|date=October 15, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jackson Contacts Cultivated Beer Deal|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-08/news/0104080240_1_yusef-jackson-rev-jackson-jackson-sons|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2013-11-03-ct-biz-1103-jackson-deal-20131103-story.html|title=Yusef Jackson: Beer boundaries didn't work|first=Melissa Harris and Ameet|last=Sachdev|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>

In 1984 Jackson organized the [[Rainbow/PUSH|Rainbow Coalition]] and resigned his post as president of Operation PUSH in 1984 to run for president of the United States, though he remained involved as chairman of the board.<ref name="clearing"/> PUSH's activities were described in 1987 as conducting boycotts of business to induce them to provide more jobs and business to blacks and as running programs for housing, social services and voter registration.<ref name="clearing"/> The organization was funded by contributions from businesses and individuals.<ref name="clearing"/> In early 1987 the continued existence of Operation PUSH was imperiled by debt, a fact that Jackson's political opponents used during his race for the 1988 Democratic Party nomination.<ref name="clearing"/> In 1996 the Operation PUSH and Rainbow Coalition organizations were merged.

==International activism==
Jackson's influence extended to international matters in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1983 he traveled to [[Syria]] to secure the release of a captured American pilot, Navy Lt. [[Robert Goodman]], who was being held by the Syrian government. Goodman had been shot down over Lebanon while on a mission to bomb Syrian positions in that country. After Jackson made a dramatic personal appeal to [[List of Presidents of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]], Goodman was released. The Reagan administration was initially skeptical about Jackson's trip, but after Jackson secured Goodman's release, Reagan welcomed Jackson and Goodman to the White House on January 4, 1984.<ref name="damascus"/> This helped to boost Jackson's popularity as an American patriot and served as a springboard for his 1984 presidential run. In June 1984 Jackson negotiated the release of 22 Americans being held in [[Cuba]] after an invitation by Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name="times topics"/>

On the eve of the 1991 Persian [[Gulf War]], Jackson made a trip to Iraq to plead with [[Saddam Hussein]] for the release of foreign nationals held there as a "human shield", securing the release of several British and 20 American individuals.<ref name="reunites"/><ref name="pilgrimage"/><ref name="politics"/>

In 1997 Jackson traveled to [[Kenya]] to meet with [[Heads of state of Kenya|Kenyan President]] [[Daniel arap Moi]] as United States President [[Bill Clinton]]'s special envoy for democracy to promote free and fair elections. In April 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]], he traveled to [[Belgrade]] to negotiate the release of three U.S. POWs captured on the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] border while patrolling with a UN peacekeeping unit. He met with then-Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milošević]], who later agreed to release the three men.<ref name="frontline"/>

His international efforts continued into the 2000s. On February 15, 2003, Jackson spoke in front of over an estimated one million people in [[Hyde Park, London]] at the culmination of the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|anti-war demonstration]] against the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of [[Iraq]] by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In November 2004 Jackson visited senior politicians and community activists in [[Northern Ireland]] in an effort to encourage better cross-community relations and rebuild the peace process and restore the governmental institutions of the [[Belfast Agreement]].

In August 2005 Jackson traveled to [[Venezuela]] to meet [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]], following controversial remarks by televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] that implied that Chávez should be assassinated. Jackson condemned Robertson's remarks as immoral. After meeting with Chávez and addressing the Venezuelan Parliament, Jackson said there was no evidence that Venezuela posed a threat to the U.S. He also met representatives from the Venezuelan African and indigenous communities.<ref name="venezuela"/>

In 2005 Jackson was enlisted as part of the United Kingdom's "Operation Black Vote", a campaign Simon Woolley ran to encourage more of Britain's ethnic minorities to vote in political elections ahead of the May 2005 General Election.<ref name="black vote"/>

In 2009 Jackson served as a speaker for The International Peace Foundation on the topic "Building a culture of peace and development in a globalized world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peace-foundation.net/speaker_previous.asp |title=International Peace Foundation - Previous speakers and artists |date=2007 |accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> He visited multiple locations in Malaysia, including the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in Thailand, including [[NIST International School]] in Bangkok.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zenfolio.nist.ac.th/p431554045 |title=2009-04-23: Bridges - Rev. Jesse Jackson |accessdate=August 12, 2017 |year=2009 |publisher=NIST International School}}</ref>

==Political activism==
During the 1980s Jackson achieved wide fame as a politician and a spokesman for civil rights issues. In 1980, for example, he mediated in a firefighters' strike.<ref name="aims"/>

===1984 presidential campaign===
[[File:Jesse Jackson, half-length portrait of Jackson seated at a table, July 1, 1983 edit.jpg|thumb|Jackson in 1983]]
{{Main|Jesse Jackson presidential campaign, 1984}}
On November 3, 1983, Jackson announced his campaign for [[President of the United States]] in the 1984 election,<ref name="jackson and white"/> becoming the second African American (after [[Shirley Chisholm]]) to mount a nationwide campaign for president as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=In Black America; Reverend Jesse Jackson|url=http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-529-cc0tq5sj2p|access-date=2020-11-04|website=American Archive of Public Broadcasting|language=en}}</ref>

In the [[1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]], Jackson, who had been written off by pundits as a fringe candidate with little chance at winning the nomination, surprised many when he took third place behind Senator [[Gary Hart]] and former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]], who eventually won the nomination. Jackson garnered 3,282,431 primary votes, or 18.2% of the total, in 1984,<ref name="aims"/> and won primaries and caucuses in Louisiana, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Mississippi.<ref name="texas"/> More Virginia caucus-goers supported Jackson than any other candidate, but Mondale won more Virginia delegates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keeping 'Em Corralled|author=Beck, Melinda|work=Newsweek|date=April 16, 1984}}</ref>

In May 1988 Jackson complained that he had won 21% of the popular vote<ref name=may>{{cite news|title=Manatt, Jackson to Confer Again on Vote-Delegate Disparity|author=Williams, Juan|date=May 22, 1984|work=Washington Post|at=The primaries lasted through June 12, and the final percentage has been calculated as 18.09%}}</ref> but was awarded only 9% of the delegates. He afterwards stated that he had been handicapped by party rules. While Mondale (in the words of his aides) was determined to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate by picking a woman or visible minority, Jackson criticized the screening process as a "[[Public relations|p.r.]] parade of personalities". He also mocked Mondale, saying that [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the "last significant politician out of the St. Paul–Minneapolis" area.<ref name="trying"/>

===Relations with Jewish community===
Jackson was criticized in the early 1980s for referring to Jews as "Hymies" and New York City as "Hymietown" in remarks to a black Washington Post reporter.<ref name="aims"/><ref name=wapo/> ("[[List of religious slurs|Hymie]]" is a [[pejorative]] term for [[Jew]]s.) He had mistakenly assumed the references would not be printed. [[Louis Farrakhan]] made the situation worse by issuing, in Jackson's presence, a public warning to Jews that "If you harm this brother [Jackson], it will be the last one you harm."<ref name="aims"/><ref name=wapo/> During a speech before national Jewish leaders in a [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] [[synagogue]], Jackson publicly apologized to Jews for the pejorative remarks, but did not denounce Farrakhan's warning. A rift between Jackson and many in the Jewish community endured at least through the 1990s.<ref name=wapo />

Shortly after President [[Jimmy Carter]] fired U.N. Ambassador [[Andrew Young]] for meeting with [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] representatives, Jackson and other black leaders began publicly endorsing a Palestinian state, with Jackson calling Israel's prime minister a "terrorist" and soliciting Arab-American financial support.<ref name="'70s 273"/> Jackson has since apologized for some of these remarks, but they badly damaged his presidential campaign, as "Jackson was seen by many conservatives in the United States as hostile to Israel and far too close to Arab governments."<ref name=LibyaSalon/>

According to a 1987 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, Jackson began attempting to improve his relationship with the Jewish community after 1984.<ref name="aims"/> In 2000 he was invited to speak in support of [[Jewish]] Senator and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate [[Joe Lieberman]] at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="don't ask"/>

On March 8, 2020, Jackson endorsed Jewish candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] for president.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/486484-civil-rights-activist-jesse-jackson-endorses-sanders |title = Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson endorses Sanders|date = March 8, 2020}}</ref>

===1988 presidential campaign===
{{Main|Jesse Jackson presidential campaign, 1988}}
In 1988 Jackson again sought the Democratic presidential nomination. According to a November 1987 ''New York Times'' article, "Most political analysts give him little chance of being nominated – partly because he is black, partly because of his unretrenched liberalism."<ref name="aims"/> But his past successes made him a more credible candidate, and he was both better financed and better organized than in 1984. Jackson once again exceeded expectations as he more than doubled his previous results, prompting [[R.W. Apple]] of ''The New York Times'' to call 1988 "the Year of Jackson".<ref name="is seen"/>

[[File:Trotter, anderson and jackson.jpg|thumb|267px|Jesse Jackson (right) with [[Curt Anderson]] (center) and [[Decatur "Bucky" Trotter]] (left) during a [[Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland|Maryland Legislative Black Caucus]] meeting in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (1988)]]

In early 1988 Jackson organized a rally at the former [[American Motors]] assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], approximately two weeks after new owner [[Chrysler]] announced it would close the plant by the end of the year. In his speech he spoke out against Chrysler's decision: "We have to put the focus on Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic violence!" He compared the workers' fight to that of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|1965 Voting Rights Movement]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. As a result, the UAW Local 72 union voted to endorse Jackson, even against UAW rules.<ref name=dudley/>

After winning 55% of the vote in the [[Michigan]] Democratic caucus, Jackson was considered the front-runner for the nomination, as he surpassed all the other candidates in total number of pledged [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s. But Jackson's campaign suffered a significant setback less than two weeks after the UAW endorsement when he narrowly lost the Colorado primary to [[Michael Dukakis]] and was defeated handily the following day by Dukakis in the [[Wisconsin]] primary. Jackson's showing among white voters in Wisconsin was significantly better than in 1984, but was also noticeably lower than pre-primary polling had predicted. The back-to-back victories established Dukakis as the front-runner. He went on to win the party's nomination, but lost the general election in November.<ref name="dukakis defeats"/>

Jackson's campaign was also interrupted by allegations regarding his half-brother Noah Robinson Jr.'s criminal activity.<ref name="robinson"/> Jackson had to answer frequent questions about Noah who was often called "the [[Billy Carter]] of the Jackson campaign".<ref name="shakedown"/>

At the conclusion of the Democratic primary season, Jackson had captured 6.9 million votes and won 11 contests: Seven primaries (Alabama, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, and Virginia) and four caucuses (Delaware, Michigan, South Carolina, and Vermont).<ref name="keep hope"/> Jackson also scored March victories in Alaska's caucuses and Texas's local conventions, despite losing the Texas primary.<ref name="lead"/><ref name="edges out"/>

===Campaign platform===
In both races Jackson ran on what many considered to be a very [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] platform. In 1987 ''The New York Times'' described him as "a classic liberal in the tradition of the New Deal and the Great Society".<ref name="aims"/> Declaring that he wanted to create a "Rainbow Coalition" of various [[minority group|minority]] groups, including [[African American]]s, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]], [[Arab-American]]s, [[Asian American]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[family farm]]ers, the [[Poverty|poor]] and [[working class]], and [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], as well as [[European American]] [[progressivism|progressives]] who fit into none of those categories, Jackson ran on a platform that included:
* Creating a [[Works Progress Administration]]-style program to rebuild America's [[infrastructure]] and provide jobs to all Americans,
* Re-prioritizing the [[War on Drugs]] to focus less on [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for drug users (which he views as racially biased) and more on harsher punishments for [[money-laundering]] [[banker]]s and others who are part of the "supply" end of "[[supply and demand]]"
* Reversing [[Reaganomics]]-inspired [[tax cuts]] for the richest ten percent of Americans and using the money to finance [[social welfare]] programs
* Cutting the [[budget]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] by as much as fifteen percent over the course of his administration
* Declaring [[Apartheid]]-era South Africa to be a [[Rogue state|rogue nation]]
* Instituting an immediate [[nuclear freeze]] and beginning [[disarmament]] negotiations with the [[Soviet Union]]
* Supporting family farmers by reviving many of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]]–era farm programs
* Creating a single-payer system of [[universal health care]]
* Ratifying the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]
* Increasing federal funding for lower-level [[public education]] and providing free [[community college]] to all
* Applying stricter enforcement of the [[Voting Rights Act]] and
* Supporting the formation of a [[Palestinian state]].

[[File:Jesse Jackson at Goodwill Games, 1990 (27189823926) (cropped1).jpg|thumb|Jackson making a speech at the [[Goodwill Games]] in Seattle, 1990]]
With the exception of a resolution to implement sanctions against South Africa for its apartheid policies, none of these positions made it into the party's platform in either 1984 or 1988.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Stance on abortion===
Although Jackson was one of the most liberal members of the Democratic Party, his position on abortion was originally more in line with [[pro-life]] views. Less than a month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times.<ref name="maverick"/> Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters, T. R. M. Howard, a black physician who performed abortions.<ref name="maverick"/>

In 1975 Jackson endorsed a plan for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.<ref name="christians join"/> He also endorsed the [[Hyde Amendment]], which bars the funding of abortions through the federal [[Medicaid]] program. In a 1977 [[National Right to Life Committee]] News report Jackson argued that the basis for ''Roe v. Wade'' – the right to privacy – had also been used to justify slavery and the treatment of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the casual taking of life and the decline in society's values. But Jackson later adopted the view that women have the right to an abortion and that the government should not interfere.<ref name="reprint"/>

===Later political activities===

====1990s====
[[File:Barlow-and-jesse-jackson.jpg|thumb|200px|Jackson with [[Maude Barlow]]]]
Jackson ran for office as "[[shadow senator]]" for the District of Columbia when the position was created in 1991<ref name="to run"/> serving as such through 1997, when he did not run for reelection. This unpaid position was primarily a post to lobby for statehood for the District of Columbia.<ref name="behind"/>

In the mid-1990s Jackson was approached about being the [[United States Ambassador to South Africa]] but declined the opportunity in favor of helping his son [[Jesse Jackson Jr.]] run for the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref name=Berke/>

Jackson was initially critical of Bill Clinton's moderate, "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" policies. According to journalist [[Peter Beinart]], Clinton was "petrified about a primary challenge from" Jackson in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]].<ref name="why obama"/> But Jackson became a key ally in gaining African American support for Clinton and eventually became a close adviser and friend of the Clinton family.<ref name=Berke/> His son [[Jesse Jackson Jr.]] was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Illinois]].

On May 2, 1999, during the Kosovo war, three US soldiers who had been held captive were released as a result of talks with Jackson.<ref name="kosovo">SUSAN SACHS, [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-prisoners-serbs-release-3-captured-us-soldiers.html CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: PRISONERS; Serbs Release 3 Captured U.S. Soldiers] May 2, 1999 ''New York Times''</ref> Jackson's negotiation was not sanctioned by the Clinton administration.<ref name="kosovo" />

On November 18, 1999, seven [[Decatur, Illinois]] high school students were expelled for two years after participating in a brawl at a football game. The incident was caught on home video and became a national media event when CNN ran pictures of the fight. After the students were expelled, Jackson argued that the expulsions were unfair and racially biased. He called on the school board to reverse its decision.<ref name="national race"/>

====2000s====
On January 20, 2001, Bill Clinton's final day in office, Clinton pardoned Congressman Mel Reynolds, John Bustamante, and Dorothy Rivers; Jackson had requested pardons for them. Jackson had also requested a pardon for his half-brother Noah Robinson who had been convicted of murdering Leroy Barber and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Clinton did not pardon Robinson on the grounds that Robinson had already submitted three pardon appeals, all of which the Justice Department had denied.<ref>Timmerman, Kenneth, "Shakedown, Exposing the Jesse Jackson Racket"</ref>

Jackson was a target of the [[2002 white supremacist terror plot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/07/26/Jury-convicts-white-supremacists/UPI-67151027718854/|title=Jury convicts white supremacists|author=Haskell, Dave|date=July 26, 2002|work=[[United Press International]]|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref>

In early 2005 Jackson visited the parents in the [[Terri Schiavo case]]; he supported their unsuccessful bid to keep her alive.<ref name="schiavo"/>

In 2005 the [[Federal Election Commission]] ruled that Jackson and the [[Democratic National Committee]] had violated electoral law and levied a $200,000 fine on them.<ref>{{cite news|title=Democrats, Jackson fined $200,000 by FEC|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-27/news/0505270241_1_campaign-travel-arrangement-citizen-education-fund-democratic-committee|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|language=en}}</ref>

In March 2006 an African-American woman accused three white members of the [[Duke University]] men's lacrosse team of raping her. During [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal|the ensuing controversy]], Jackson stated that his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition would pay for the rest of her college tuition regardless of the outcome of the case. The case against the three men was later thrown out and the players were declared innocent by the North Carolina Attorney General.<ref name="prosecutors"/>

Jackson took a key role in the scandal caused by comedic actor [[Michael Richards]]'s racially charged comments in November 2006. Richards called Jackson a few days after [[Michael Richards#Controversy|the incident]] to apologize; Jackson accepted Richards's apology<ref name="comedian's"/> and met with him publicly as a means of resolving the situation. Jackson also joined black leaders in a call for the elimination of the "[[nigger|N-word]]" throughout the entertainment industry.<ref name="richards"/>

On June 23, 2007, Jackson was arrested in connection with a protest at a gun store in Riverdale, a poor suburb of Chicago, Illinois. Jackson and others were protesting due to allegations that the gun store had been selling firearms to local gang members and was contributing to the decay of the community. According to police reports, Jackson refused to stop blocking the front entrance of the store and let customers pass. He was charged with one count of criminal trespass to property.<ref name="arrested"/>

In March 2007 Jackson declared his support for then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 democratic primaries]].<ref name="backs obama"/> He later criticized Obama in 2007 for "[[acting white|acting like he's white]]" in response to the [[Jena 6]] beating case.<ref name="jena 6"/>

On July 6, 2008, during an interview with [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], a microphone picked up Jackson whispering to fellow guest Reed Tuckson:<ref name="regrets"/> "See, Barack's been, ahh, talking down to black people on this faith-based... I want to cut his nuts off."<ref name=apologizes/> Jackson was expressing his disappointment in Obama's [[Father's Day]] speech chastisement of black fathers.<ref name="the end"/> Subsequent to his Fox News interview, Jackson apologized and reiterated his support for Obama.<ref name=apologizes/>

On November 4, 2008, Jackson attended the Obama victory rally in Chicago's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. In the moments before Obama spoke Jackson was seen in tears.<ref name="world television"/>

In 2012, he commended Obama's 2012 decision to support gay marriage and compared the fight for same-sex marriage to the fight against slavery and the anti-miscegenation laws that once prevented interracial marriage.<ref name="gay marriage"/> He favored federal legislation extending marriage rights to gays.<ref name="gay marriage"/> In the [[2016 United States presidential election]] he endorsed Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/11/politics/jesse-jackson-hillary-clinton/|title=Jesse Jackson endorses Hillary Clinton|last=Scott|first=Eugene|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=June 11, 2016|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> In the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]] he endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/08/politics/jesse-jackson-bernie-sanders-endorsement/index.html|title=Jesse Jackson endorses Bernie Sanders for president|author1=Annie Grayer |author2=Devan Cole|website=CNN|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>
