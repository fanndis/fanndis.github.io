The '''''National Review''''' was founded in 1883 by the English writers [[Alfred Austin]] and [[William John Courthope|William Courthope]].

It was launched as a platform for the views of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], its masthead incorporating a quotation of the former Conservative Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]]: "What is the Tory Party, unless it represents National feeling?"

Under editor [[Leopold Maxse]], the ''National Review'' took an unfriendly attitude towards [[Imperial Germany]] in the years leading up to [[World War I]].

The magazine was published by the Cecil Club, which became the [[United and Cecil Club]] in 1949. The magazine was renamed the '''''National and English Review''''' in 1950.  It closed in 1960.
