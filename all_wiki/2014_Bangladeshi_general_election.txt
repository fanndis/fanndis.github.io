'''General elections''' were held in [[Bangladesh]] on 5 January 2014, in accordance with the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitutional requirement]] that elections must take place within the 90-day period before the expiration of the term of the [[Jatiya Sangshad]] on 24 January 2014. The elections were controversial, with almost all major opposition parties [[Election boycott|boycotting]] and 153 of the total 300 seats being uncontested. Around 21 people were killed on election day.<ref name="aljaz2"/>

The elections were not free and fair.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riaz|first=Ali|date=2020-09-21|title=The pathway of democratic backsliding in Bangladesh|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2020.1818069|journal=Democratization|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/13510347.2020.1818069|issn=1351-0347}}</ref> The elections were preceded by government crackdown on the opposition and BNP and Opposition leader Khaleda Zia was put under house arrest.<ref name=HouseArrest/> There were also widespread arrests of opposition members, violence and strikes by the opposition, attacks on religious minorities, and extrajudicial killings by the government.<ref name=HRW/> The elections were criticized by the United States, United Kingdom, [[European Union]] and the United Nations.<ref name="credible">{{cite news|title=Violent Bangladesh poll 'not credible'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/violent-bangladesh-poll-not-credible-201417153340105129.html}}</ref>

== Background ==
Throughout most of 2013, [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] and its alliance of 18 opposition parties led by three-time former [[Prime Minister]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (Bangladesh)|Opposition Leader]] [[Khaleda Zia]] called more than 85 days of nationwide general strikes and blockades that brought the entire country to a grinding halt. The opposition demanded that the ruling [[Awami League]] party led by the current Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] amend the constitution, dissolve the parliament after their full five-year term ended on 24 January 2014, and then hand over power to a [[non-partisan]] [[interim government]] or a [[caretaker government]] that would be run by [[technocrats]] for 90 days. The job of a [[Caretaker Government of Bangladesh]] would then be to work in tandem with the [[Bangladesh Election Commission]] by helping them to organise, arrange, and oversee the general election held on 5 January and transfer power to a newly elected government. As most of the demands were not met within the stipulated time frame, all opposition parties boycotted the polls.<ref>{{cite news |date=2011-10-04 |title=Bangladesh paralysed by opposition strike |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/201352653414218728.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera English |access-date=2013-05-29}}</ref> Hasina had offered an all party interim election cabinet government which would include opposition parties till the election but this was rejected by Zia.<ref>{{cite news |date=2013-10-18 |title=Bangladesh PM Hasina proposes all-party election cabinet |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24583020 |work=BBC News |access-date=2013-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=PM calls on BNP to name reps to poll-time cabinet |url=http://www.newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2013-10-19&nid=69557 |newspaper=New Age |location=Dhaka |date=2013-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031905/http://www.newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2013-10-19&nid=69557 |archive-date=2014-01-06 |access-date=2013-12-27}}</ref>

==Crackdown on the opposition==
Before the election there were reports of opposition leaders and members being killed and arbitrarily arrested by the police. According to [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[US Department of State]], Bangladesh police arrested "thousands" of opposition members.<ref name=HRW>{{cite web|title=Democracy in the Crossfire|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/04/29/democracy-crossfire/opposition-violence-and-government-abuses-2014-pre-and-post|date=2014-04-29}}</ref>

The government also interfered with opposition parties' organization of political events.<ref name=state>{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: 2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2014/sca/236634.htm#section1darbitrary|publisher=[[US Department of State]]}}</ref> In December 2013, police prevented opposition from holding pre-election rallies, citing security reasons.

Often opposition leaders were detained shortly after they announced strikes to protest the elections.<ref name=HRW/> In one case, authorities arrested 203 opposition and leaders and activists on 26 December, immediately after the opposition announced it would be holding a "March for Democracy" on 29 December. By 28 December, one day before the rally, the police had arrested more than thousand BNP and Jamaat members.<ref name=HRW/> Many of these were released in the evening or after the election.<ref name=HRW/> In another case, BNP vice president Hafizuddin Ahmed was arrested immediately after he urged "non-stop demonstrations" until the elections. The police charged him with firebombing a bus in 2013. After the election, he was released.<ref name=HRW/>

Khaleda Zia was prevented from leaving her home to attend a rally on 26 December,<ref name=HRW/> and kept under house arrest until the election.<ref name=HouseArrest>{{cite news|title=Bangladesh's former prime minister Khaleda Zia 'under house arrest'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/bangladesh/10542535/Bangladeshs-former-prime-minister-Khaleda-Zia-under-house-arrest.html}}</ref> The government denied Zia was under house arrest. Zia's advisor Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury and  Enam Ahmed Chowdhury were arrested on 29 December.<ref name=HRW/>

===Media shutdown===
Prior to the election, the government restricted opposition broadcasting.<ref name=state/> In 2013, ruling [[Awami League]] shut down TV stations and detained a prominent newspaper editor. The government said the measure was necessary to curb violence, but opposition saw this as politically motivated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bangladesh media suffers crackdown|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/2013528153749695207.html}}</ref>

The ruling Awami League suffered electoral losses when, according to ''[[The Economist]]'', the opposition BNP "thrashed the League in mayoral elections in June and July, notably in Gazipur in the industrial belt, hitherto one of the League’s safest constituencies"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bangladesh's volatile politics: The battling begums |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21583297-pendulum-swings-away-sheikh-hasina-and-her-government-battling-begums |magazine=The Economist |date=2013-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811103540/http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21583297-pendulum-swings-away-sheikh-hasina-and-her-government-battling-begums |archive-date=2013-08-11 |url-status=live}}</ref> and polling data showed a plunge in the government's popularity.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Justice and vengeance in Bangladesh: Swing votes |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21586592-election-looms-and-so-does-hangman-swing-votes |magazine=The Economist |date=2013-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919185839/http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21586592-election-looms-and-so-does-hangman-swing-votes |archive-date=2013-09-19 |url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, just prior to the election, an opinion poll indicated the incumbent Awami League would lose to the BNP in a direct contest.<ref name="aljaz">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh PM open for talks if unrest ends |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/01/bangladesh-pm-says-election-win-legitimate-201416113644882630.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera English}}</ref>

In the weeks following the election, a poll was conducted by [[Democracy International, Inc|Democracy International]] (DI), a US-based organization.

==Results==
The incumbent [[Bangladesh Awami League]] won the election with a safe majority, winning 234 seats. The election was controversial however as the opposition alliance boycotted the election.

As a result of the boycott, 153 of the 300 seats were uncontested,<ref>[http://archive.ipu.org/parline/reports/2023_E.htm Last elections] IPU</ref> of which the Awami League won 127 by default, the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)]] led by [[Rowshan Ershad]] won 20, the JSD won three, the [[Workers Party of Bangladesh|Workers Party]] won two and the [[Jatiya Party (Manju)]] won one.<ref name="bdnews1">{{cite news |date=2013-09-14 |title=Repolls ordered in 8 constituencies |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/01/06/re-election-in-8-constituencies |newspaper=bdnews24.com |access-date=2014-01-06}}</ref>

==Reactions==
The day after the result, Hasina said that the boycott should "not mean there will be a question of legitimacy. People participated in the poll and other parties participated." However, she also said she offered Zia a role in a new government. "Look, I tried my best, I told you, I offered ministry, I offered to share power with our opposition. I have done as much as I can do but they didn't respond. Now if they realise that they made a mistake in not participating in the election, perhaps then they may come forward to discuss with us or make an offer. If they come forward to discuss with us, they have to leave all these terrorist activities behind because what they are doing it is absolutely killing people, killing police, killing innocent people."<ref name="aljaz"/> Information Minister [[Hasanul Haq Inu]] added that the turnout did not matter: "What is important is that the people defied violence."<ref name="aljaz2">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh ruling party sweeps violent vote |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/01/bangladesh-vote-201416229528440.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera English}}</ref> BNP Vice President Shamsher Chowdhury said that the low turnout indicated a desire for a new election. "This government must declare this election null and void and we need a new election organised by a non-party government. The government should not waste any more time."

===International===

*{{flag|United States}}: The United States said the election "did not appear to credibly express the will of the Bangladeshi people".
*{{flag|United Kingdom}}: The United Kingdom expressed "disappointment" at the low voter turnout and criticized acts of violence and political harassment that had taken place.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/baroness-warsi-comments-on-bangladesh-election-results Baroness Warsi comments on Bangladesh election results]</ref>

===Media===
Dhaka's ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'' featured an editorial that called the election  in the country's history and that the Awami League won "a predictable and hollow victory, which gives it neither a mandate nor an ethical standing to govern effectively." In similarly criticising the opposition, the editorial mentioned that "political parties have the right to boycott elections. They also have the right to motivate people to side with their position. But what is unacceptable is using violence and intimidation to thwart an election."<ref name="indept"/>

===Aftermath===
In the aftermath of the election, violence continued and the government continued the crackdown on the opposition. Police carried out raids and arrested opposition leaders. Other opposition leaders and members went into hiding, citing harassment by authorities.<ref name=raids>{{cite news|title=Bangladesh opposition members go into hiding following violent national election|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/01/09/bangladesh_opposition_members_go_into_hiding_following_violent_national_election.html}}</ref> By 21 January, the government had arrested 7,015 activists and leaders of opposition, and placed a bounty of 100,000 taka ($1,300) on the heads of other protest leaders.<ref name=7,000>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30917345|title=Bangladesh arrests 7,000 opposition activists}}</ref> Many of the protesters had destroyed vehicles and blockaded roads, and 29 people had died in the unrest.<ref name=7,000/>
