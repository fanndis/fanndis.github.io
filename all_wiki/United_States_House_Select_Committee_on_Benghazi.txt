The '''United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi''' was created after [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[John Boehner]], on May 2, 2014, proposed that a House [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committee]] would be formed to further investigate the [[2012 Benghazi attack|Benghazi attack]] on September 11, 2012. During that event, the U.S. [[diplomatic mission]] in [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]] was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the [[United States Ambassador to Libya|U.S. ambassador to that country]], [[J. Christopher Stevens]], and three other Americans.

On May 8, 2014, the House voted 232–186 to establish the select committee, with 225 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 7 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in favor, and 186 Democrats voting against.<ref>{{cite news|title=House votes to establish select committee on Benghazi|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/08/house-approves-benghazi-select-committee-probe/|accessdate=May 10, 2014|publisher=Fox News|date=May 8, 2014}}</ref> The chairman of the committee was Representative [[Trey Gowdy]] from [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/05/boehner-taps-rep-trey-gowdy-to-lead-benghazi-select-committee/?tid=hpModule_ba0d4c2a-86a2-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394&hpid=z9 |title=Boehner taps Rep.

==Minority participation question==
House Democrats did not immediately commit to participating in the Benghazi attack investigation select committee. Aides for Boehner and Pelosi engaged in discussions over how the committee would operate, points of contention being shared authority to issue subpoenas, interview witnesses, and determine what can be released to the public. When she finally made the decision that her party would participate in the committee investigation, Pelosi acknowledged: "I could have argued this either way. Why give any validity to this effort?"<ref name=TH-21.5.14 />

When on May 21 Pelosi decided to name a [[full slate]] of Democrats to the committee, she argued that by selecting senior legislators—most of whom had already been engaged in investigations of the Benghazi attacks—Democrats could have a say in access to pertinent documents and determining the direction of the committee's investigation.<ref name="nyt-dems-named" /> Pelosi stated that participation would allow Democrats "to be there to fight for a fair hearing and process, to try to bring some openness and transparency to what's going on."<ref name=TH-21.5.14>{{cite news|last1=Wasson |first1=Erik |first2=Mike |last2=Lillis |title=Pelosi appoints five Democrats to Benghazi committee to fight 'abuses'|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/206809-pelosi-names-dems-to-benghazi-panel|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=21 May 2014}}</ref> Reacting to the minority appointments to the committee, Gowdy commented: "The ones that I know well are very thoughtful and very smart, and I have a great working relationship with them."<ref name="pol-dems-hrc"/>

==Investigation and report==
The expected focus of the investigation by the select committee is<!--??--> on events before, during, and after the actual attack. In particular, the resolution passed by the House states that the scope of the Select Committee's investigation include, but not be limited to:
# security decisions and military posture prior to the attack

==Hearings==
The first hearing was held on September 17, 2014, two years after the attack and four months after the launch of the special investigation.

In December 2014, Committee Chairman Gowdy announced hearings would be held in January, February, and March the following the year. During that timeframe, a single January hearing was held, interviewing State Department legislative liaison Joel Rubin and [[CIA]] representative Neil Higgins. An announced hearing to be focused on explaining the State Department's presence in Benghazi was not held. In February, Gowdy notified ranking Democratic committee member Elijah Cummings that the committee would begin interviewing a list of twenty prominent members of the Obama administration in April. This would include [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Martin Dempsey]], former [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Jay Carney]], and former State Department Chief of Staff [[Cheryl Mills]]. Gowdy said on [[Fox News]] that April that the committee had gone from interviewing two witnesses a week to four. According to a Democrat committee aide, however, the committee had not conducted four interviews within a week at any point and a committee staff member said none of Gowdy's list of twenty Obama administration members had been interviewed.<ref name=NYO />

Prior to interviewing longtime Clinton confidante [[Sidney Blumenthal]] on June 16, Gowdy told ''[[Politico]]'' that the committee had partly shifted focus from investigating the actual attack in Benghazi to reviewing policy decisions made by Clinton regarding Libya prior to the attack: "They believe we're supposed to be Benghazi-centered, looking at a couple of days on either side of the Benghazi attacks. But the language of the [House] resolution is pretty clear: We're to examine all policies and decisions that led to the attacks."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hirsh|first1=Michael|last2=Bartholet|first2=Jeff|title=Beyond Benghazi: Hilary, Sid, and Libya |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/hillary-clinton-2016-benghazi-118992.html#ixzz3dGTeQ1nb|work=Politico|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

As of June 20, 2015, the Committee had conducted three hearings and interviewed 29 witnesses, substantially fewer than previous investigations such as that of the [[Iran-Contra]] scandal, which held 40 days of public hearings with 500 witness interviews over 10 1/2 months.<ref name=NYO>{{cite web|last1=Rabin-Havt|first1=Ari|title=Benghazi Investigation Spends Fortune to Harass Hillary Clinton|url=http://observer.com/2015/06/sticker-shock-calculating-the-benghazi-investigations-huge-price-tag/|work=New York Observer|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

Of the committee's lack of progress, Cummings said, in mid-2015, "After a full year, it now seems obvious that this investigation is being dragged out in order to attack Secretary Clinton and her campaign for president—squandering millions of taxpayer dollars in the process."<ref name=NYO /> Gowdy has blamed the Obama administration's slow pace in producing documents, although the committee made its first document request to the State Department in mid-November 2014, and its document request to the Department of Defense was made in April 2015.<ref name=NYO />

Gowdy's report described progress over the previous year in several areas, including:
*Receiving 20,000+ emails and other documents from the State Department, that were never before released to Congress.
*Acquiring 15,000 additional pages of documents after numerous classified and unclassified briefings with administration agencies.
*Producing almost 100 hours of interviews and 2,500 pages of testimony from survivors of the terrorist attacks and others with first-hand accounts of before, during and after the attacks.

[[Elijah Cummings]], the top Democrat on the panel, said that "the Select Committee comes up with a new excuse to further delay its work", and that "Republicans are desperately trying to validate the $3 million in taxpayer funds they have spent over the past year, but they have nothing to show for it other than a partisan attack against Secretary Clinton and her campaign for president."<ref name=POLITICO.testimony-delayed>{{cite web|title=Hillary Clinton's Benghazi testimony likely to be delayed  |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-benghazi-testimony-delayed-emails-117771.html#ixzz3Zm9k32oS|publisher=Politico|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}</ref>

==June 2015 depositions==
Clinton confidante [[Sidney Blumenthal]] came to the Committee's attention when it learned that he had on numerous occasions sent Libyan intelligence to Clinton by email while she was at the State Department. The Committee voted to subpoena and depose Blumenthal regarding why he had emailed Clinton the unsubstantiated intelligence on Libya, whether he was paid for the work, and whether he used any of his connections with Clinton to benefit himself and his business partners who had interests in various business and financial contracts in Libya.<ref name=Bade /> "He clearly corresponded with one of the key decision-makers with respect to the security levels in Libya, the risk in Libya, Libya policy, and provided information to her [on] threats and potential responses to those threats," said Republican Committee member [[Mike Pompeo|Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas)]], "So it is incumbent on our committee to learn ... what his role was in U.S. Libya policy and how it impacted decisions related to security."<ref name=Bade>{{cite web|last=Bade|first=Rachael|title=Clinton confidant set for private Benghazi grilling|work=Politico|date=June 15, 2015|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/clinton-confidant-private-benghazi-grilling-blumenthal-118996.html|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

The deposition was held on June 16, 2015. Under oath, Blumenthal indicated that, using then [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Secretary Clinton's private email server]] in her home in [[Chappaqua, New York]], Blumenthal had sent Clinton several emails on Benghazi before and after the attack. Among them were suggestions as to the Administration's response, that linked to several postings by [[David Brock]]'s ''[[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]'', in which Media Matters encouraged and defended the Administration's stated view of the cause of the attack and defended the State Department. The emails in question had not been included among those the State Department had provided earlier to Congress in answer to the [[Congressional subpoena|Committee's subpoena]] (even though Secretary Clinton had maintained earlier that all her official government emails had been turned over to the Department before the hard drive of her private server was erased by the Clintons), but copies were instead obtained from Blumenthal from his files.<ref name=SBemails>Berger, Judson - "Clinton confidant who sent Libya memos paid $200G by Brock network", ''FNPolitics'', June 19, 2015.[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/19/sources-clinton-confidant-who-sent-libya-memos-being-paid-200g-by-brock-network/ Retrieved: 2015-06-19]</ref>

During Blumenthal's deposition, it was also ascertained by the Committee that, at the time he sent the emails to Clinton, Blumenthal was being paid an $320,000 annually by the [[Clinton Foundation]], and was being paid $200,000 a year by [[David Brock]]. Although those payments did not necessarily create a [[conflict of interest]] for Blumenthal or for Clinton—Blumenthal's financial relationships with Brock's liberal advocacy and media groups, and with the Clinton Foundation and Secretary Clinton, then became a major focus of further questioning by the Committee. Members expressed concerns that his work with Brock's liberal advocacy and media groups, and the financial interests he held at the time in several contract proposals under consideration for Benghazi, may have presented problems when he was simultaneously sending political and messaging guidance to Clinton.<ref name=Politico>Vogel, Kenneth and Rachael Bade - "Benghazi panel probes Sidney Blumenthal's work for David Brock", ''Politico'', June 18, 2015.[http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/benghazi-panel-sidney-blumenthals-david-brock-119130.html#ixzz3daLFLqIh] Retrieved June 20, 2015</ref> During the deposition, Blumenthal testified that he had received the intelligence from a business contact and was not being paid to pass it along to Clinton.<ref name=Politico />

Committee Democrats, who took issue with the June 16 deposition session, have called on [[Trey Gowdy|Committee Chairman Gowdy]] to publicly release the transcript of the deposition, stating that the Blumenthal documents revealed no "smoking gun" about the attacks. "[I]n fact, they hardly relate to Benghazi at all," [[Elijah Cummings|Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.]], [[Ranking Minority Member]] on the committee, said in a statement.<ref name=SBemails /> According to a fact sheet released by committee Democrats, of 270 questions posed to Blumenthal, less than 20 concerned the Benghazi attacks and only four concerned Benghazi's security.<ref name=Mak>{{cite web |last1=Mak |first1=Tim|title=Blumenthal: Free My Benghazi Testimony|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/19/blumenthal-free-my-benghazi-testimony.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref> Blumenthal's attorney also called for the public release of his client's emails and private testimony transcripts, claiming that Republicans were selectively leaking emails as a way of "distorting the truth by mischaracterizing facts and circumstances."<ref name=Mak /> Brock of Media Matters portrayed the line of questioning as more focused on his organization's attempt to refute "false claims" about Benghazi than about the attacks themselves<ref name=Politico/> and said of the Committee's session, "Despite the fact that the conclusions of nine congressional committee reports and the findings from an independent review board don't support his political agenda, Chairman Gowdy keeps doubling down and expanding his taxpayer funded [[fishing expedition]] in the hopes of undermining Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign. This week's spectacle is the latest proof that he is failing."<ref name=SBemails />

After the hearing, Blumenthal said: "It seems obvious that my appearance before this committee was for one reason and one reason only—politics. ... [They] "spent hours asking me questions about things that had nothing to do with Benghazi," adding, "I hope I have cleared up the series of misconceptions some members of the committee may have held. ... My testimony has shed no light on the events of Benghazi—nor could it, because I have no firsthand knowledge." Republican Committee Members asserted, however, that scrutinizing Blumenthal's work for Brock's media and messaging groups, and for the Clinton Foundation, provide a perspective into the overall Clinton political and philanthropic operations as related to the Clintons' potential conflicts of interest regarding Benghazi and other matters while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State. Committee Democrats argued that the Committee's real motive was to provide fodder for campaign attacks.<ref name=SBemails /><ref name=Politico />

==Calls for dissolution==
On September 29, 2015, Republican [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] said the following during an appearance on ''[[Hannity]]'': "Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?

Several days later, McCarthy followed up on his comments and said that "Benghazi is not political. It was created for one purpose and one purpose only—to find the truth on behalf of the families of four dead Americans. ...

The ''New York Times'' reported that "the long day of often-testy exchanges between committee members and their prominent witness revealed little new information about an episode that has been the subject of seven previous investigations ... Perhaps stung by recent admissions that the pursuit of Mrs. Clinton's emails was politically motivated, Republican lawmakers on the panel for the most part avoided any mention of her use of a private email server."<ref name="ShearSchmidt"/> The email issue did arise shortly before lunch, in "a shouting match" between Republican committee chair [[Trey Gowdy]] and two Democrats, [[Adam B. Schiff]] and [[Elijah Cummings|Elijah E.

During questioning by [[Martha Roby]], which probed Clinton on the minute-by-minute events on the day of the Benghazi attacks, Clinton laughed upon being asked whether she was alone after leaving the State Department offices, which drew scorn from Roby.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/congress/hillary-clinton-testimony-at-house-benghazi-panel/during-sharp-questioninga-moment-of-levity |title=During Sharp Questioning, a Moment of Levity |work=The New York Times |date=October 22, 2015 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Benghazi committee, came to Clinton's defense during the hearing, apologizing to her for his colleagues who suggested that she did not care for the people who died on her watch.

==Main report==

The Republicans on the committee released their main report on June 28, 2016 with committee chairman Gowdy saying its contents should "fundamentally change the way you view Benghazi." Major findings from the investigation included:

#The State Department failed to protect U.S. diplomats in Libya: Clinton and the administration should have realized and addressed risks. (The Democrats' version of the report acknowledges "security measures in Benghazi were woefully inadequate"). 
#The CIA misread how dangerous Libya was in midst of a revolution after overthrowing [[Gaddafi]] a year earlier. 
#The Defense Department failed to rescue Americans: U.S. military forces did not reach Benghazi until mid-afternoon the day after the initial attack on the compound. "No U.S. military asset was ever deployed to Benghazi despite the order of the Secretary of Defense at 7 o'clock that night," Gowdy said. 
#The Administration subverted investigation through what Gowdy described as "intentional", "coordinated", and "shameful" stonewalling. Clinton deleted numerous emails on the private server she was using for official business, which the report says "makes it impossible to ever represent to those killed in Benghazi that the record is whole."
