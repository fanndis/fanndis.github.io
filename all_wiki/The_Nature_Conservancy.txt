The Nature Conservancy developed out of a scholarly organization initially known as the [[Ecological Society of America]] (ESA).<ref name="Adams50-51">{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Jonathan S.|title=The Future of the Wild|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8070-8537-0|location=|pages=51–54}}</ref> The ESA was founded in 1915 and later formed a Committee on Preservation of Natural Areas for Ecological Study, headed by [[Victor Ernest Shelford|Victor Shelford]].<ref name="Adams50-51"/><ref name="NC-History">"[http://www.nature.org/about-us/vision-mission/history/ Our History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220202505/http://www.nature.org/about-us/vision-mission/history/ |date=December 20, 2016 }}". The Nature Conservancy. nature.org. Retrieved December 18, 2016.</ref> The primary aim of Shelford was to find areas of land that would be beneficial for long-term research.<ref name="Adams50-51" /> By the 1930s Shelford and his colleagues such as Aldo Leopold increasingly sought to advocate for conservation.<ref name="Adams50-51"/> The divide in viewpoints regarding scholarship or advocacy led the Society to dissolve the committee and in 1946, Shelford and his colleagues formed the Ecologists' Union.<ref name="Adams50-51"/><ref name="NC-History"/> The latter group eventually took the name "The Nature Conservancy", in emulation of the British agency of that name, which pursued a mission of conserving open space and wildlife preserves. The Nature Conservancy was incorporated in the United States as a non-profit organization on October 22, 1951.<ref name="NC-History"/>

As the organization grew, the organization focused largely on buying as much land as possible in the name of conservation with little scientific research conducted on land before being purchased.<ref name="Adams50-51" /> It was not until 1974 that the organization hired its first staff scientist, Robert Jenkins, Jr., who helped the organization refocus its mission to a more representational approach to conservation.<ref name="Adams50-51" />

===Environmental benefits===
The Plant a Billion Trees campaign has also been identified as a tool to help slow [[climate change]] with forest restoration being an effective way to help regulate emissions in the atmosphere and stabilize global climate.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Olatz Cases |first1=Maria |title=Biodiversity conservation and climate change protection go hand in hand |url=https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/23672.html |publisher=German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) |access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>

The Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign also aims to protect 10 critical watersheds in the Atlantic Forest that provide water and [[Hydropower|hydro power]] to more than 70 million people, create 20,000 direct jobs, and an additional 70,000 indirectly as part of this effort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.nature.org/site/PageServer?pagename=brazil_aaa |title=Adopt an Acre – The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Support.nature.org |access-date=February 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126031351/http://support.nature.org/site/PageServer?pagename=brazil_aaa |archive-date=January 26, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2010}}

===Tree planting===
The Nature Conservancy plants trees for every contribution donated by supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plant a Billion|url=https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/plant-a-billion/|website=Plant a Billion Trees|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref> Some of the seeds being planted in Brazil consist of:

* Guapuruvu Tree (''[[Schizolobium parahyba]]'')&nbsp;– An indigenous plant of Atlantic Forest, this has one of the fastest growth rates of all the native species.
* Golden Trumpet Tree (''[[Handroanthus chrysotrichus]]'')&nbsp;– According to popular belief, when this tree's yellow blooms appear, no more frosts will occur.  The wood of a Golden Trumpet Tree has the same fire rating as concrete and is denser than water. [[Illegal logging]] activity has grown due to this tree's growing popularity.
* Ice-Cream Bean Tree (''[[Inga edulis]]'')&nbsp;– Leafy and abundant, this tree controls weeds and erosion.  Its popular fruit is a long pod up to a few feet, containing a sweet pulp surrounding large seeds.
* Capororoca Tree (''Myrsine ferruginea'')&nbsp;– Birds like the Rufous-bellied Thrush enjoy the fruit off of this tree.<ref name="plantabillion.org"/>{{better source|date=August 2010}}

=== Questionable resale ===
There have been allegations of The Nature Conservancy obtaining land and reselling it at a profit, sometimes to supporters and sometimes to large organizations that allows them to claim tax breaks.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stephens|first=Joe|last2=Ottaway|first2=David B.|date=2005-06-08|title=Senators Question Conservancy's Practices|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060701640.html|url-status=live|access-date=2020-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Stephens|first=Joe|last2=Ottaway|first2=David B.|date=2003-05-16|title=Charity Hiring Lawyers to Try to Prevent Hill Probe|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601287.html|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-30}}</ref><ref>''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''.

=== Hunting ===
Like many large environmental groups such as the [[Sierra Club]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]], the Conservancy has also been criticized{{By whom|date=November 2018}}<!--  This appears to be not simple to resolve.  See talk page --> for including allowances for hunting within its management policies. The organization does not totally ban hunting by their staff nor do they ban it on properties they own.<ref> {{cite web
