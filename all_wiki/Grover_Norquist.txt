{{Conservatism in the United States}}
'''Grover Glenn Norquist''' (born October 19, 1956) is an American political activist and tax reduction advocate who is founder and president of [[Americans for Tax Reform]], an organization that opposes all [[Taxation in the United States|tax]] increases. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]],<ref name=60minutes/> he is the primary promoter of the "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", a pledge signed by lawmakers who agree to oppose increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses, as well as net reductions or eliminations of deductions and credits without a matching reduced tax rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/about-grover |title=Who is Grover Norquist? |publisher=Americans for Tax Reform |access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> Prior to the November 2012 election, the pledge was signed by 95% of all Republican members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and all but one of the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2012|candidates]] running for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican presidential nomination]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Howard Fineman |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/grover-norquist-jon-huntsman-tim-pawlenty-no-tax-pledge_n_881857.html |title=It's Grover Time: Huntsman Rejects No-Tax Pledge, Pawlenty Waivers |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 21, 2011 |access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>

At college, Norquist was an editor at the ''[[The Harvard Crimson|Harvard Crimson]]'' and helped to publish the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-leaning ''Harvard Chronicle''.<ref name=Nation/> He was a member of the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]]. Norquist has said: "When I became 21, I decided that nobody learned anything about politics after the age of 21."<ref name=Post-First-Person/> He attended the [[Leadership Institute]] in Arlington, Virginia,<ref name="my right"/> an organization that teaches conservative Americans how to influence public policy through activism and leadership.<ref name="li difference"/>

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Reagan, Abramoff, Norquist.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] meeting with [[Jack Abramoff]] and Grover Norquist in connection with the College Republican National Committee, 1981]]
Early in his career, Norquist was executive director of both the [[National Taxpayers Union]] and the national [[College Republicans]], holding both positions until 1983. He served as Economist and Chief Speechwriter at the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] from 1983 to 1984.<ref name="newsmax1"/>

Norquist traveled to several war zones to help support anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] guerrilla armies in the second half of the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He worked with a support network for [[Oliver North]]'s efforts with the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Contras]] and other insurgencies, in addition to promoting U.S. support for groups including [[Mozambique]]'s [[RENAMO]] and [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] in Angola<ref name=Nation/> and helping to organize anti-Soviet forces in [[Laos]]. In 1985, he went to a conference in South Africa sponsored by South African businesses called the "Youth for Freedom Conference", which sought to bring American and South African conservatives together to end the anti-apartheid movement.<ref>Kleiner, Sam (July 9, 2013). [http://www.thenation.com/article/175172/meet-conservatives-who-campaigned-apartheid-south-africa# "Meet the Conservatives Who Campaigned for Apartheid South Africa".] ''The Nation.''</ref> Norquist represented the [[France-Albert Rene]] government of [[Seychelles]] as a lobbyist from 1995 until 1999. Norquist's efforts were the subject of [[Tucker Carlson]]'s 1997 article in [[The New Republic]], "What I sold at the revolution." <ref>{{cite book|last=Easton|first=Nina|title=Gang of five : leaders at the center of the conservative crusade|year=2000|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0684838990|url=https://archive.org/details/gangoffiveleader00east}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The New Republic|journal=What I Sold at the Revolution|date=June 9, 1997}}</ref>

===Americans for Tax Reform===
Norquist is best known for founding [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR) in 1985, which he says was done at the request of then-President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name="mission statement"/> Referring to Norquist's activities as head of ATR, [[Steve Kroft]], in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' episode that aired on November 20, 2011, claimed that "Norquist has been responsible, more than anyone else, for rewriting the dogma of the Republican Party."<ref name="hold on"/>

The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce government revenues as a percentage of the GDP.<ref name=NTPTP/><ref name="cost of gov"/> ATR states that it "opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle."<ref name="debate"/> Americans for Tax Reform has supported [[Taxpayer Bill of Rights]] (TABOR) legislation<ref name="touts"/> and transparency initiatives,<ref name="press release"/> while opposing cap-and-trade legislation<ref name="would need"/> and efforts to regulate health care.<ref name="press release1"/>

In 1993, Norquist launched his Wednesday Meeting series at ATR headquarters, initially to help fight President Clinton's healthcare plan. The meeting eventually became one of the most significant institutions in American conservative political organizing. The meetings have been called "a must-attend event for Republican operatives fortunate enough to get an invitation", and "the Grand Central station of the conservative movement."<ref name=60minutes/><ref name=Nation/> Medvetz (2006) argues that the meetings have been significant in "establishing relations of ... exchange" among conservative subgroups and "sustaining a moral community of conservative activists."<ref>Thomas Medvetz [http://pas.sagepub.com/content/34/3/343.short “The Strength of Weekly Ties: Relations of Material and Symbolic Exchange in the Conservative Movement”] ''Politics & Society'' (2006) 34#3 pp. 343-368. quote is from p. 343</ref><ref>See also Peter Beinart.

''The New Republic'', May 21, 2001; [http://www.economist.com/node/550516 The Caveman Cometh] ''The Economist'', March 31, 2001; John Aloysius Farrell. "Right Where He Belongs." ''Boston Globe'', April 17, 2002; Mara Liasson [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1123439 "Political Activist Grover Norquist"] ''Morning Edition Roll Call'', [[National Public Radio]] May 25, 2001; Susan Page [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-06-01-grover.htm "Norquist Power High, Profile Low"] ''[[USA Today]]'' June 1, 2001; Robin Toner [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/us/conservatives-savor-their-role-as-insiders-at-the-white-house.html "Conservatives Savor Their Role as Insiders at the White House"] ''[[New York Times]]'' March 19, 2001; Jill Zuckman [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-06-09/news/0306090168_1_white-house-grover-norquist-anti-tax "Pipeline Leads to White House"] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' June 9, 2003.</ref>

As a nonprofit organization, Americans for Tax Reform is not required to disclose the identity of its contributors. Critics, such as Sen. [[Alan Simpson (American politician)|Alan Simpson]], have asked Norquist to disclose his contributors; he has declined but has said that ATR is financed by direct mail and other [[grassroots fundraising]] efforts. According to CBS News, "a significant portion appears to come from wealthy individuals, foundations and corporate interests."<ref name=60minutes/>

===Taxpayer Protection Pledge===
Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 [[United States House of Representatives|House]] Republicans and 41 out of 47 [[United States Senate|Senate]] Republicans had signed ATR's "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", in which the pledger promises to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."<ref name="Taxpayer Protection Pledge"/><ref name="random guy"/>

The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to "fewer than ... 218" in the House of Representatives.<ref name="2012 elections"/> According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the "[[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]" have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2012/11/14/is_it_game_over_for_grover_norquist/ Is it game over for Grover Norquist?]| By Alex Seitz-Wald| November 14, 2012</ref>

In November 2011, [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority leader]] [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV) blamed Norquist's influence for the [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]]'s lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans "are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They're giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader."<ref name="like puppets"/> Since Norquist's pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican [[deficit hawk]]s now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction.<ref name=AP/><ref name="barrier"/> Former Republican Senator [[Alan K. Simpson|Alan Simpson]] (R-WY), co-chairman of the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], has been particularly critical, describing Norquist's position as "[n]o taxes, under any situation, even if your country goes to hell."<ref name=60minutes/>

==Other political activities==

===National politics===
[[File:2013 David Boaz, Grover Norquist and Joseph Farah (cropped to Norquist).jpg|left|thumb|Norquist speaking at FreedomFest 2013 in Las Vegas.]]
Norquist was listed as one of the five primary leaders of the post-[[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] conservative movement by [[Nina Easton]] in her 2000 book, ''Gang of Five''.<ref name="gang of five"/> Working with eventual Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], Norquist was one of the co-authors of the 1994 [[Contract with America]], and helped to rally grassroots efforts, which Norquist later chronicled in his book ''Rock the House.''<ref name=Nation/> Norquist also served as a campaign staff member on the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Republican Platform Committees.

Norquist was instrumental in securing early support for the presidential campaign of then-Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], acting as his unofficial liaison to the conservative movement.<ref name=Nation/> He campaigned for Bush in both [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]].<ref name=vote/> After Bush's first election, Norquist was a key figure involved in crafting Bush's tax cuts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[John Fund]] of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' dubbed Norquist "the Grand Central Station" of conservatism and told ''[[The Nation]]'': "It's not disputable" that Norquist was the key to the Bush campaign's surprising level of support from movement conservatives in 2000.<ref name="gop prophet"/>

He has long been active in building bridges between various ethnic and religious minorities and the free-market community through his involvement with [[Acton Institute]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Toward Tradition]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

He has also "announced his plan to assemble a center-right coalition to discuss pulling out of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] to save hundreds of billions of dollars."<ref name="antiwar"/>

Norquist is active in [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party politics]]. Talking at a Florida rally he said "tea party groups should serve as the '[[exoskeleton]]' that protects newly elected Republicans" from pressures to increase government spending.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pillow |first=Travis |date=October 25, 2010 |access-date=February 16, 2012|title=FL: Norquist says tea party should serve as GOP 'exoskeleton' after Nov. 2|newspaper=The Florida Independent|url=http://www.americanindependent.com/151317/norquist-tea-party-should-serve-as-gop-'exoskeleton'-after-nov-2}}</ref>

Comprehensive immigration reform is an interest of Norquist's, who believes that the United States should have "dramatically higher levels of immigration" than it currently does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/07/26/grover-norquist-on-open-borders-and-hist |title=Grover Norquist on Open Borders and Historically Racist Immigration Policy |publisher=Reason.com |date=2013-07-26 |access-date=2013-08-01}}</ref>

===Involvement with Jack Abramoff===
According to a 2011 memoir by former lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]], Norquist was one of Abramoff's first major Republican party contacts.<ref name="Capitol Punishment"/> Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform were also mentioned in Senate testimony relating to the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] which resulted in a 2006 guilty plea by Abramoff to three criminal felony counts of defrauding of American Indian tribes and corrupting public officials. Records released by the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]] allege that ATR served as a "conduit" for funds that flowed from Abramoff's clients to surreptitiously finance grass-roots lobbying campaigns.<ref name="funneled"/> Norquist has denied that he did anything wrong, and has not been charged with any crime.

===State and local politics===
[[File:Grover Norquist (30217237032).jpg|right|thumb|Norquist speaking with the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.]]
Norquist's national strategy has included recruiting state and local politicians to support ATR's stance on taxes. Norquist has helped to set up regular meetings for conservatives in many states. These meetings are modeled after his Wednesday meetings in Washington, with the goal of creating a nationwide network of conservative activists that he can call upon to support conservative causes, such as tax cuts and deregulation. There are now meetings in 48 states.<ref name="Wednesdays with Grover"/>

In 2004, Norquist helped California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] with his plan to privatize the [[CalPERS]] system.<ref name="cross hairs"/> In [[Virginia]]'s 2005 Republican primaries, Norquist encouraged the defeat of a number of legislators who voted for higher taxes.<ref name="Wednesdays with Grover"/>

===Boards and other activities===
Norquist serves on the boards of directors of numerous organizations including the [[National Rifle Association]],<ref name="nra leaders"/> the [[American Conservative Union]],<ref name="ACU"/> the [[Hispanic Leadership Fund]], the [[Indian-American Republican Caucus]], and ParentalRights.org, an organization that wishes to add a [[Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 2010, Norquist joined the advisory board of [[GOProud]], a political organization representing [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] conservatives and their allies, for which he was criticized by the [[Family Research Council]].<ref name="go proud"/><ref name="family research"/> Norquist also sits on a six-person advisory panel that nominates [[Time Person of the Year|Time magazine's Person of the Year]].<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/random-person-coaches-house-gop-on-tax-message-pelosi-blames-grover-norquist-for-superfailure/ ‘Random Person’ Coaches House GOP on Tax Message; Pelosi Blames Grover Norquist for Superfailure] ''[[ABC News]]'' December 1, 2011</ref>

In business, Norquist was a co-founder of the Merritt Group, later renamed [[Janus-Merritt Strategies]].<ref name="teaching uncle sam"/>

He is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=N |title=Membership Roster - Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |access-date=2013-08-01}}</ref>

==Views on government==
Norquist favors dramatically reducing the size of government.<ref name=Nation/> He has been noted for his widely quoted quip:

{{quote|I'm not in favor of abolishing the government. I just want to shrink it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub."<ref name="1115.ORG"/>}}

Journalist [[William Greider]] quotes him saying his goal is to bring America back to what it was "up until [[Teddy Roosevelt]], when the socialists took over. The income tax, the death tax, regulation, all that."<ref name="20th century"/> When asked by journalist Steven Kroft about the goal of chopping government "in half and then shrink it again to where we were at the turn of the [20th] century" before Social Security and Medicare, Norquist replied, "We functioned in this country with government at eight percent of GDP for a long time and quite well."<ref name=60minutes/>

Some smaller government advocates argue that Norquist's "obsession with tax revenue" is actually counterproductive with respect to minimizing the size of government.<ref name="ForbesCato"/> Although the Americans for Tax Reform mission statement is "The government's power to control one's life derives from its power to tax. We believe that power should be minimized",<ref name="mission statement1"/> critics at the [[Cato Institute]] have argued that "holding the line on taxes constrains only one of the four tools (taxes, tax deductions, spending without taxation, and regulation) used by government to alter economic outcomes."<ref name="ForbesCato"/>

Norquist published ''Leave Us Alone: Getting the Government's Hands Off Our Money, Our Guns, Our Lives'',<ref name="hands off"/> in 2008. In 2012, he published ''Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future'',<ref name="Debacle"/> with John R. Lott, Jr. He has served as a monthly "Politics" columnist and contributing editor to ''[[The American Spectator]]''.<ref name="spectator"/>

Norquist has also called for reductions in defense spending as one way to reduce the size of government.<ref>DiMascio, Jen [http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_08_20_2012_p18-486369.xml "How Romney, Ryan Differ on Defense Spending."] ''Aviation Week & Space Technology'', August 20, 2012.</ref> He favors reduced defense spending through budget sequestration.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Norquist-Sequestration-Obama-Overspending/2013/02/06/id/489250 "Norquist: Sequestration ‘Fine Way’ to Stop Overspending."]</ref>

Norquist has endorsed a [[non-interventionist]] foreign policy and cuts to the [[US military budget]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/08/14/grover-norquist-takes-on-the-war-party/|title=Grover Norquist Takes On the War Party|last=Raimondo|first=Justin|date=2012-08-15|website=Antiwar.com Original|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Norquist has described himself as a "boring white bread [[Methodist]]."<ref name = Methodist/> In 2004, at age 48, he married a Palestinian Muslim<ref name="mosque debate"/> named Samah Alrayyes,<ref name="marriage"/><ref name="vows"/> a [[Kuwait]]i PR specialist who was formerly a director of the [[Khaled Saffuri#Islamic Free Market Institute|Islamic Free Market Institute]] and specialist at the Bureau of Legislative and Public Affairs at [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).<ref name="network of arab"/><ref name="how muslim"/> The couple has adopted two children, both girls, one of whom from the city of [[Bethlehem]].<ref name="watch out"/>

According to friend and former roommate [[John Fund]], Norquist's devotion to his political causes is "monk-like" and comparable to that of [[Ralph Nader]].<ref name=Nation/>

Norquist has competed three times in the comedy fundraiser "Washington's Funniest Celebrity" and placed second in 2009.<ref name="funniest"/><ref name="dc's funniest"/><ref>The Americans for Tax Reform Foundation also issued a $5,000 grant in 2009 to the Funniest Celebrity Charity Fund.{{cite web |first=Grover |last=Norquist |author2=Americans for Tax Reform |work=IRS form 990 |url=http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2009/521/400/2009-521400492-06092d9a-9.pdf |title=Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax: 2009 |publisher=GuideStar |page=27 |date=May 12, 2010 |access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> Humorist [[P. J. O'Rourke]] has described Norquist as "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] crossed with [[Lee Atwater]] plus just a [[wikt:soupçon|soupçon]] of [[Madame Defarge]]".<ref name=Nation1/>

Norquist and his wife attended the annual [[Burning Man]] festival in August 2014 in Black Rock, Nevada. Norquist explained that he wished to attend because, "There's no government that organizes this. That's what happens when nobody tells you what to do. You just figure it out. So Burning Man is a refutation of the argument that the state has a place in nature."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roller|first1=Emma|title=Grover Norquist Explains Why He's Going to Burning Man|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/grover-norquist-explains-why-he-s-going-to-burning-man-20140729|access-date=1 August 2014|work=National Journal|date=29 July 2014}}</ref>
