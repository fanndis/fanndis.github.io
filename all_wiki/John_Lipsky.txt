===IMF leadership role===
Lipsky's unplanned accession at the IMF led quickly to his immersion in addressing [[European sovereign debt crisis#Greek government funding crisis|the European and Greek sovereign debt crises]], a high-profile role his predecessor had been playing. At the [[37th G8 summit]] held on 26–27 May 2011 in [[Deauville]], France, Lipsky had to overcome Germany's reluctance to fund another round of bailouts for Greece. He did so by threatening to withhold IMF disbursements, an action that would precipitate a Greek default – an option none was ready to accept at that point.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/16/imf-forced-germany-to-guarantee-greek-bailout|title=Hardline IMF forced Germany to guarantee Greek bailout|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 June 2011<!-- 21.30 BST-->|last=Traynor|first=Ian|accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref> In the "bitter infighting," Lipsky was characterized in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "less silky, much blunter" than Strauss-Kahn.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/16/dominique-strauss-kahn-europe-woe|title=How Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York worsened Europe's woe|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 June 2011<!-- 21.31 BST-->|last=Traynor|first=Ian|accessdate=2011-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/16/imf-forced-germany-to-guarantee-greek-bailout|title=Hardline IMF forced Germany to guarantee Greek bailout|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 June 2011|last=Traynor|first=Ian|accessdate=2011-06-17}}</ref>

He now teaches at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazette.jhu.edu/2011/12/05/john-lipsky-formerly-of-imf-joins-economics-program-at-sais/|title=John Lipsky, formerly of IMF, joins economics program at SAIS : Johns Hopkins University|website=Gazette.jhu.edu|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref>
