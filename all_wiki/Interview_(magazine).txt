'''''Interview''''' is an American [[magazine]] founded in late 1969<ref>{{cite web|title=The 20 Best Magazines of the Decade (2000-2009)|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/the-20-best-magazines-of-the-decade.html|work=Paste Magazine|accessdate=10 August 2015|date=26 November 2009}}</ref> by artist [[Andy Warhol]] and British journalist [[John Wilcock]].

==History==
[[File:AndyWarholMuseumInterviewDisplay.jpg|thumb|left|Covers displayed in the [[Andy Warhol Museum]]]]

===Andy Warhol period===
In the early days, complimentary copies of ''Interview'' were often given away to the "in-crowd"; this was the start of the magazine's circulation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Toward the end of his life, as Warhol withdrew from everyday oversight of his magazine, a more conventional editorial style was introduced under editor [[Bob Colacello]]. However, Warhol continued to act as ambassador for the magazine, distributing issues in the street to passersby and creating ''ad hoc'' signing events on the streets of [[Manhattan]], New York City. The creative covers of Interview which gave the magazine its signature style were done by artist [[Richard Bernstein (artist)|Richard Bernstein]] from 1972 to 1989.

===Brant Publications period===
The magazine's format has remained consistent at 60% features and 40% glossy advertising. It has been published by Brant Publications, Inc since shortly after Warhol's death in 1987. It was helmed for 18 years by [[Ingrid Sischy]], until she and [[Peter Brant]]'s ex-wife Sandra became lovers and left the magazine, selling Ms. Brant's half-ownership stake in the parent company Brant Publications.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ingrid Sischy and Sandra Brant to Helm 'Vanity Fair' Abroad|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/03/ingrid_sischy_and_sandra_brant.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=17 March 2008}}</ref> For a year and a half the magazine was in flux, edited by [[Christopher Bollen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Management Changes at Interview Magazine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/business/media/20interview.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 July 2009}}</ref>

===2008 to 2018===
''Interview'' restarted under co-editorial directors [[Fabien Baron]] and [[Glenn O'Brien]] in September 2008, with a cover featuring [[Kate Moss]]. Stephen Mooallem and [[Christopher Bollen]] served as the working editor-in-chief and editor-at-large, respectively. The publication's content can be found online and via an [[Application software|app]], Other Edition, available on iTunes.

As of 2017, Fabien Baron was the editorial director; [[Karl Templer]] was creative director; Nick Haramis was editor-in-chief. In December 2013, Stephen Mooallem left Interview to join ''[[Harper’s Bazaar]]'' as its executive editor. Keith Pollock served as editor-in-chief from 2014 to 2016.<ref name="Keith Pollock Named Editor in Chief of Interview">{{cite web| url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/keith-pollock-named-editor-in-chief-of-interview-7399093?src=nl/mornReport/20140129|title=Keith Pollock Named Editor in Chief of Interview|work=WWD|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=29 January 2014|author=Steigrad, Alexandra}}</ref>
