Russian is written using the [[Cyrillic script]]; it distinguishes between [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s with [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatal]] [[secondary articulation]] and those without, the so-called ''soft'' and ''hard'' sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or a soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language. Another important aspect is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[vowel]]s. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated [[Orthography|orthographically]]{{sfn|Timberlake|2004|p=17}} though an optional [[acute accent]] may be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], such as to distinguish between [[homograph]]ic words, for example [[:ru:Замок (устройство)|замо́к]] (''zamók'' – a lock) and [[:ru:Замок (строение)|за́мок]] (''zámok'' – a castle), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.

== Classification ==

Russian is an [[East Slavic language]] of the wider [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European family]]. It is a descendant of the language used in [[Kievan Rus']], a loose conglomerate of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes from the late 9th to the mid 13th centuries. From the point of view of [[spoken language]], its closest relatives are [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Most similar languages to Russian | url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=rus | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525141518/http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=rus | archive-date=25 May 2017 }}</ref> the other three languages in the East Slavic branch. In many places in eastern and southern [[Ukraine]] and throughout [[Belarus]], these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as [[Surzhyk]] in eastern Ukraine and [[Trasianka]] in [[Belarus]]. An East Slavic [[Old Novgorod dialect]], although it vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common [[Church Slavonic]] influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477–478, 480}} In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called "[[Great Russian language|Great Russian]]" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called "White Russian" and Ukrainian, then called "Little Russian".

The [[vocabulary]] (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], a developed and partly Russified form of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] language used by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the [[Church Slavonic]] forms are in use, with many different meanings. ''For details, see [[Russian phonology]] and [[History of the Russian language]].''

Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[English language|English]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Russian Language |first=Ellis Hovell |last=Minns |author-link=Ellis Minns|volume=23 |pages=912–914 }}</ref> and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Turkic Languages of Central Asia: Problems of Planned Culture Contact by Stefan Wurm|journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume = 17|issue = 2|pages = 392–394|jstor = 610442 |last = Waterson |first = Natalie|year = 1955|doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00111954}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/491-0102/491-0102-GOUSKOVA-0-0.PDF |title=Falling Sonoroty Onsets, Loanwords, and Syllable contact|access-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505092913/http://roa.rutgers.edu/files/491-0102/491-0102-GOUSKOVA-0-0.PDF |archive-date=5 May 2015 }}</ref> [[Persian language|Persian]],<ref>{{cite web |author1=Aliyeh Kord Zafaranlu Kambuziya |author2=Eftekhar Sadat Hashemi |url = http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1317_hashemi_1.pdf|title=Russian Loanword Adoptation in Persian; Optimal Approach |website=roa.rutgers.edu |year=2010|access-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150505092721/http://roa.rutgers.edu/content/article/files/1317_hashemi_1.pdf|archive-date=5 May 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Iraj Bashiri |url = https://www.academia.edu/10442551|title=Russian Loanwords in Persian and Tajiki Language |website=academia.edu |year=1990|access-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530193133/http://www.academia.edu/10442551/Russian_Loanwords_in_Persian_and_Tajiki_Languages |archive-date=30 May 2016 }}</ref> and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones [https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&pg=PA219&dq=russian+loanwords+in+hebrew&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=Y75GVbmtKomuUe25gbAJ&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=russian%20loanwords%20in%20hebrew&f=false ''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320151848/https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&pg=PA219&dq=russian+loanwords+in+hebrew&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=Y75GVbmtKomuUe25gbAJ&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=20 March 2018 }} pp 219 Multilingual Matters, 1998 {{ISBN|1-85359-362-1}}</ref>

{{Main|Moscovian dialect}}

Feudal divisions and conflicts, as well as other obstacles to the exchange of goods and ideas that ancient Russian principalities have suffered from before and especially during the Mongol yoke, strengthened dialectical differences and for a while prevented the emergence of the standardized national language. The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in 15th and 16th centuries and the gradual (re)emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space have created the need for a common standard language. The initial impulse for the standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem. The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language.{{When|date=February 2020}} Since then the underlying logic of language reforms in Russia reflected primarily the considerations of standardizing and streamlining language norms and rules in order to ensure the Russian language's role as a practical tool of communication and administration.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

The current standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the ''modern Russian literary language'' ({{lang|ru|современный русский литературный язык}} - "sovremenny russky literaturny yazyk"). It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of [[Peter the Great]], and developed from the Moscow ([[Central Russian dialects|Middle or Central Russian]]) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancery language.

[[Mikhail Lomonosov]] first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the [[Russian Academy]]'s first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the "Golden Age", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.

Until the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the [[Soviet government]]. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in [[Southern Russian dialects]]) are still observed in colloquial speech.

The Russian language is also one of two official languages aboard the [[International Space Station]] – [[NASA]] astronauts who serve alongside Russian cosmonauts usually take Russian language courses. This practice goes back to the [[Apollo-Soyuz]] mission, which first flew in 1975.

In March 2013 it was announced that Russian is now the second-most used language on the Internet after English. People use the Russian language on 5.9% of all websites, slightly ahead of German and far behind English (54.7%). Russian is used not only on 89.8% of [[.ru]] sites, but also on 88.7% of sites with the former Soviet Union domain [[.su]]. The websites of former Soviet Union nations also use high levels of Russian: 79.0% in Ukraine, 86.9% in Belarus, 84.0% in Kazakhstan, 79.6% in Uzbekistan, 75.9% in Kyrgyzstan and 81.8% in Tajikistan. However, Russian is the sixth-most used language on the top 1,000 sites, behind [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian is now the second most used language on the web|url=http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/russian_is_now_the_second_most_used_language_on_the_web|work=W3Techs|publisher=Q-Success|access-date=17 June 2013|author=Matthias Gelbmann|date=19 March 2013|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130504180244/http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/russian_is_now_the_second_most_used_language_on_the_web|archive-date=4 May 2013}}</ref>

Russian is a rather homogeneous language, in terms of dialectal variation, due to the early political centralization under Moscow's rule, compulsory education, mass migration from rural to urban areas in the 20th century, as well as other factors. The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from [[Kaliningrad]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] in the West to [[Vladivostok]] and [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] in the East, the enormous distance between notwithstanding.

Despite [[Dialect levelling|leveling]] after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, "Northern" and "Southern", with [[Moscow]] lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern]], [[Central Russian dialects|Central]] (or Middle), and [[Southern Russian dialects|Southern]], with Moscow lying in the Central region.<ref>David Dalby. 1999–2000. ''The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities''. Linguasphere Press.  Pg. 442.</ref>{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} All dialects are also divided into two main chronological categories: the dialects of ''primary formation'' (the territory of [[Muscovy]] roughly consists of the modern [[Central Federal District|Central]] and [[Northwestern Federal District|Northwestern]] Federal districts) and ''secondary formation'' (other territories where Russian was brought by migrants from primary formation territories or adopted by the local population). [[Dialectology]] within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.

The [[Northern Russian dialects]] and those spoken along the [[Volga River]] typically pronounce unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} clearly, a phenomenon called [[vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|okanye]] ({{lang|ru|оканье}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have [[high vowel|high]] or [[diphthong]]al {{IPA|/e⁓i̯ɛ/}} in place of {{proto|slavic|ě}} and {{IPA|/o⁓u̯ɔ/}} in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} Another Northern dialectal morphological feature is a post-posed definite article ''-to'', ''-ta'', ''-te'' similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}

In the [[Southern Russian dialects]], instances of unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} following [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced {{IPA|[a]}} in such positions (e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|несл'''и'''}} is pronounced {{IPA|[nʲaˈslʲi]}}, not {{IPA|[nʲɪsˈlʲi]}}) – this is called [[yakanye]] ({{lang|ru|яканье}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=ru|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|access-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607225323/http://gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|archive-date=7 June 2012}}</ref> Consonants include a [[Voiced velar fricative|fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}}]], a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w⁓u̯/}}]] and {{IPA|/x⁓xv⁓xw/}}, whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}} The morphology features a palatalized final {{IPA|/tʲ/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521–526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=ru|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|access-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212213519/http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|archive-date=12 February 2012}}</ref> Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a [[debuccalized]] or [[lenited]] {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w⁓u̯/}}]] and palatalized final {{IPA|/tʲ/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and some dialects of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (Eastern [[Polesia]]n), indicating a linguistic continuum.

The city of [[Old Novgorod dialect|Veliky Novgorod]] has historically displayed a feature called [[chokanye]] or [[tsokanye]] ({{lang|ru|чоканье}} or {{lang|ru|цоканье}}), in which {{IPA|/tɕ/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} were switched or merged. So, {{wikt-lang|ru|'''ц'''апля}} (tsaplya, 'heron') has been recorded as {{lang|ru|чапля}} (chaplya). Also, the [[Slavic second palatalization|second palatalization]] of [[Velar consonant|velars]] did not occur there, so the so-called '''ě²''' (from the [[Proto-Slavic]] diphthong *ai) did not cause {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x/}} to shift to {{IPA|/ts, dz, s/}}; therefore, where Standard Russian has {{wikt-lang|ru|'''ц'''епь}} ('chain'), the form {{lang|ru|'''к'''епь}} {{IPA|[kʲepʲ]}} is attested in earlier texts.

Among the first to study Russian dialects was [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] in the 18th century. In the 19th, [[Vladimir Dal]] compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century. In modern times, the monumental ''Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language'' ({{lang|ru|Диалектологический атлас русского языка}} - ''Dialektologichesky atlas russkogo yazyka''), was published in three folio volumes 1986–1989, after four decades of preparatory work.

== Derived languages ==
* [[Balachka]], a dialect spoken in Krasnodar region, Don, [[Kuban]], and [[Terek River|Terek]], brought by relocated [[Cossacks]] in 1793 and is based on the southwest Ukrainian dialect. During the Russification of the aforementioned regions in the 1920s to 1950s, it was replaced by the Russian language.
* [[Fenya]], a criminal [[argot]] of ancient origin, with Russian grammar, but with distinct vocabulary
* [[Medny Aleut language]], a nearly extinct [[mixed language]] spoken on [[Bering Island]] that is characterized by its [[Aleut]] nouns and Russian verbs
* [[Padonkaffsky jargon]], a [[slang]] language developed by [[padonki]] of [[Runet]]
* [[Quelia]], a [[macaronic language]] with Russian-derived basic structure and part of the [[lexicon]] (mainly nouns and verbs) borrowed from German
* [[Runglish]], a Russian-English pidgin. This word is also used by English speakers to describe the way in which Russians attempt to speak English using Russian morphology and/or syntax.
* [[Russenorsk language|Russenorsk]], an extinct [[pidgin]] language with mostly Russian vocabulary and mostly [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] grammar, used for communication between [[Russians]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] traders in the Pomor trade in [[Finnmark]] and the [[Kola Peninsula]]
* [[Trasianka]], a heavily russified variety of [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] used by a large portion of the rural population in [[Belarus]]
* [[Taimyr Pidgin Russian]], spoken by the [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] on the [[Taymyr Peninsula|Taimyr Peninsula]]

== Alphabet ==
{{Main|Russian alphabet|Russian Braille}}

Russian is written using a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabet. The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their upper case forms, along with [[help:IPA|IPA]] values for each letter's typical sound:

Older letters of the Russian alphabet include {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѣ}}}}, which merged to {{angbr|{{lang|ru|е}}}} ({{IPA|/je/}} or {{IPA|/ʲe/}}); {{angbr|{{lang|orv|і}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѵ}}}}, which both merged to {{angbr|{{lang|ru|и}}}} ({{IPA|/i/}}); {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѳ}}}}, which merged to {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ф}}}} ({{IPA|/f/}}); {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѫ}}}}, which merged to {{angbr|{{lang|ru|у}}}} ({{IPA|/u/}}); {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѭ}}}}, which merged to {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ю}}}} ({{IPA|/ju/}} or {{IPA|/ʲu/}}); and {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѧ}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|orv|ѩ}}}}, which later were graphically reshaped into {{angbr|{{lang|ru|я}}}} and merged phonetically to {{IPA|/ja/}} or {{IPA|/ʲa/}}. While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The [[yer]]s {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ъ}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ь}}}} originally indicated the pronunciation of ''ultra-short'' or ''reduced'' {{IPA|/ŭ/}}, {{IPA|/ĭ/}}.

=== Transliteration ===
{{Further|Romanization of Russian|Informal romanizations of Russian}}

Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, {{wikt-lang|ru|мороз}} ('frost') is transliterated ''moroz'', and  {{wikt-lang|ru|мышь}} ('mouse'), ''mysh'' or ''myš'''. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]], which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |last=Caloni |first=Wanderley |title=RusKey: mapping the Russian keyboard layout into the Latin alphabets |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |date=15 February 2007 |access-date=28 January 2011 |publisher=[[The Code Project]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301121842/http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |archive-date=1 March 2012 }}</ref>

=== Computing ===
The Russian alphabet has many systems of [[character encoding]]. [[KOI8-R]] was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of [[MS-DOS]] and [[OS/2]] ([[Code page 866|IBM866]]), traditional Macintosh ([[ISO/IEC 8859-5]]) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (CP1251) meant the proliferation of many different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a [[de facto standard]] in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995–2005.

All the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with [[UTF-8]]. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. "[[iconv]]" is an example that is supported by most versions of [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]] and some other [[operating system]]s; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.

In addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] (which is very similar to the [[Greek alphabet]]), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.

=== Orthography ===
{{Main|Russian orthography}}

The current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on [[Byzantine Greek]], was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional [[acute accent]] ({{lang|ru|знак ударения}}) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: {{lang|ru|замо́к}} (''zamók'' - "lock") – {{lang|ru|за́мок}} (''zámok'' - "castle"), {{lang|ru|сто́ящий}} (''stóyashchy'' - "worthwhile") – {{lang|ru|стоя́щий}} (''stoyáshchy'' - "standing"), {{lang|ru|чудно́}} (''chudnó'' - "this is odd") – {{lang|ru|чу́дно}} (''chúdno'' - "this is marvellous"), {{lang|ru|молоде́ц}} (''molodéts'' - "well done!") – {{lang|ru|мо́лодец}} (''mólodets'' - "fine young man"), {{lang|ru|узна́ю}} (''uznáyu'' - "I shall learn it") – {{lang|ru|узнаю́}} (''uznayú'' - "I recognize it"), {{lang|ru|отреза́ть}} (''otrezát'' - "to be cutting") – {{lang|ru|отре́зать}} (''otrézat'' - "to have cut"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names, like {{lang|ru|афе́ра}} (''aféra'', "scandal, affair"), {{lang|ru|гу́ру}} (''gúru'', "guru"), {{lang|ru|Гарси́я}} (''García''), {{lang|ru|Оле́ша}} (''Olésha''), {{lang|ru|Фе́рми}} (''Fermi''), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence, for example {{lang|ru|Ты́ съел печенье?}} (''Tý syel pechenye?'' - "Was it ''you'' who ate the cookie?") – {{lang|ru|Ты съе́л печенье?}} (''Ty syél pechenye?'' - "Did you ''eat'' the cookie?) – {{lang|ru|Ты съел пече́нье?}} (''Ty syel pechénye?'' "Was it the ''cookie'' you ate?"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Russian phonology}}

The phonological system of Russian is inherited from [[Common Slavonic]]; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.

The language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St.{{nbsp}}Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called ''hard'' and ''soft.'' The hard consonants are often [[velarization|velarized]], especially before front vowels, as in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Marshallese language#Phonology|Marshallese]]. The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear [[schwa]]. (See also: [[vowel reduction in Russian]].)

The Russian [[syllable]] structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the maximal structure can be described as follows:

(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)

However, Russian has a constraint on syllabification such that syllables cannot span multiple [[morpheme]]s.

Clusters of four consonants are not very common, especially within a morpheme. Some examples are: {{wikt-lang|ru|взгляд}} ({{IPA|vzglʲat}} ''vzglyad'', 'glance'), {{wikt-lang|ru|государств}} ({{IPA|gəsʊˈdarstf}} ''gosudarstv'', 'of the states'), {{wikt-lang|ru|строительств}} ({{IPA|strɐˈitʲɪlʲstf}} ''stroitelstv'', 'of the constructions').

Russian is notable for its distinction based on [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of most of its consonants. While {{IPA|/k, ɡ, x/}} do have palatalized [[allophone]]s {{IPA|[kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ]}}, only {{IPA|/kʲ/}} might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native [[minimal pair]] that argues for {{IPA|/kʲ/}} being a separate phoneme is {{lang|ru|это {{wikt-lang|ru|ткать|ткёт}}}} ({{IPA|[ˈɛtə tkʲɵt]}} ''eto tkyot'' - "it weaves"){{snd}}{{lang|ru|этот {{wikt-lang|ru|кот}}}} ({{IPA|[ˈɛtət kot]}}, ''etot kot'' - "this cat"). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of {{IPA|/tʲ/}} and {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds {{IPA|/t, d, ts, s, z, n, rʲ/}} are [[dental consonant|dental]], that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the [[alveolar ridge]].

[[File:Russian vowel chart.svg|thumb|Russian vowel chart by {{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Trofimov|1923|p=55}}.]]

Russian has five or six vowels in stressed syllables, {{IPA|/i, u, e, o, a/}} and in some analyses {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, but in most cases these vowels have merged to only two to four vowels when unstressed: {{IPA|/i, u, a/}} (or {{IPA|/ɨ, u, a/}}) after hard consonants and {{IPA|/i, u/}} after soft ones.

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Russian grammar}}

{{expand section|date=August 2014}}

Russian has preserved an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Synthetic language|synthetic]]-[[inflection]]al structure, although considerable [[Morphological levelling|levelling]] has taken place.
Russian grammar encompasses:
* a highly [[Fusional language|fusional]] '''morphology'''
* a '''syntax''' that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements:<ref>Can Russians from different locations of the country https://www.rbth.com/education/328851-dialects-russian-language/amp</ref>
** a polished [[vernacular]] foundation;{{clarify|What is this supposed to mean?|date=August 2014}}
** a [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] inheritance;

The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/education/328851-dialects-russian-language/amp|title=Can Russians from different parts of the country understand each other?|website=www.rbth.com|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.

The [[Church Slavonic language]] (not to be confused with [[Old Church Slavonic]] which was introduced during the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization of the Kievan Rus']]  in the 10th century) was introduced to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]] in the late 15th century and was adopted as official language for correspondence for convenience. Firstly with the newly conquered southwestern regions of former Kyivan Rus and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the [[Golden Horde]], for communication between all newly consolidated regions of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]].

In terms of actual grammar, there are three [[tenses]] in Russian - past, present, and future - and each verb has two [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspects]] (perfective and imperfective). Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine, or neuter, indicated by spelling at the end of the word. Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six [[Grammatical case|cases]]: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of'), and Prepositional (used after a preposition). Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim', and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of [[prefix]]es to add more meaning to the verb.

* [[Early Modern Russian|The Moscow period (15th–17th centuries)]]
* Standard national language

Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]] was the Eastern branch of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into [[Kievan Rus']] in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus trace their origins, established [[Old East Slavic]] as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and [[calque]]s from [[Byzantine Greek]] began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.

[[File:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ostromir Gospels]] of 1056 is the second oldest [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] book known, one of many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s preserved in the [[Russian National Library]].]]
Dialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and in modern Russia [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]]. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of the land between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] in the west and independent [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the [[Tatars]]) in the east.

The official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was [[Church Slavonic]], which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained [[Diglossia|the literary language]] for centuries, until the [[Peter I of Russia#Early reign|Petrine age]], when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.

The political reforms of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (Пётр Вели́кий, ''Pyótr Velíky'') were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke [[French language|French]] daily, and [[German language|German]] sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s (Лев Толсто́й) ''[[War and Peace]]'', contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.

The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of [[Alexander Pushkin]] ({{lang|ru|Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин}}) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized [[Russian literature]] by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called {{lang|ru|высо́кий стиль}} — "high style") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, [[Mikhail Lermontov]] ({{lang|ru|Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов}}), [[Nikolai Gogol]] ({{lang|ru|Никола́й Го́голь}}), [[Aleksander Griboyedov]] ({{lang|ru|Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов}}), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|spelling reform of 1918]]. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific, and technological matters (especially [[cosmonaut]]ics), gave Russian a worldwide prestige, especially during the mid-20th century.

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the [[official language]] only in 1990.<ref>[http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm "Закон СССР от 24 April 1990 О языках народов СССР"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |date=8 May 2016 }} (The 1990 USSR Law about the Languages of the USSR) {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break-up of the USSR]] in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.

The Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of [[Russians]] in the world and diminution of the total population in [[Russia]] (where Russian is an official language), however this has since been reversed.<ref name="demoscope.ru" /><ref name=autogenerated20130215-1 /><ref name="Mof.gov.cy">{{cite web|date=23 May 2012|title=журнал "Демоскоп".
