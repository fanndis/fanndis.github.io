The cultural hearts of Telangana, Hyderabad and Warangal, are noted for their wealth and renowned historical structures – [[Charminar]], [[Qutb Shahi Tombs]], [[Paigah Tombs]], [[Falaknuma Palace]], [[Chowmahalla Palace]], [[Warangal Fort]], [[Kakatiya Kala Thoranam]], [[Thousand Pillar Temple]] and the [[Bhongir Fort]] in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district. The historic city [[Golconda]] in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name [[Golconda Diamonds]] became synonymous with Golconda itself. The Golconda region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless [[Koh-i-Noor]] (United Kingdom), the blue [[Hope Diamond|Hope]] (United States), the pink [[Daria-i-Noor]] (Iran), the white [[Regent Diamond|Regent]] (France), the [[Dresden Green Diamond|Dresden Green]] (Germany), and the colourless [[Orlov (diamond)|Orlov]] (Russia), [[Nizam Diamond|Nizam]] and [[Jacob Diamond|Jacob]] (India), as well as the now lost diamonds [[Florentine Diamond|Florentine Yellow]], [[Akbar Shah (diamond)|Akbar Shah]] and [[Great Mogul Diamond|Great Mogul]]. Religious edifices like the [[Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Yadadri|Lakshmi Narasimha Temple]] in [[Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district]], [[Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad|Makkah Masjid]] in Hyderabad, and [[Medak Cathedral]] are several of its most famous places of worship.

== Etymology ==
A popular etymology derives the word "Telangana" from ''[[Trilinga Kshetras|Trilinga desa]]'' ("land of three [[lingam|lingas]]"), a region so called because three important [[Shaivite]] shrines were located here: [[Kaleshwaram]], [[Srisailam]] and [[Draksharama]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Phillip B. Wagoner |title=Mode and meaning in the architecture of early medieval Telangana (C. 1000–1300) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3wKAQAAMAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}</ref> According to Jayadhir Thirumala Rao, a former director of Andhra Pradesh Oriental Manuscripts Library and Research Centre, the name Telangana is of [[Gondi language|Gondi]] origin. Rao asserts that it is derived from "Telangadh", which according to him, means "south" in Gondi and has been referred to in "Gond script dating back to about 2000 years".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/earliest-reference-to-telangana-found-not-in-telugu-but-gond-language/articleshow/62046296.cms|title=Earliest reference to Telangana found not in Telugu, but Gond language|access-date=13 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213235534/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/earliest-reference-to-telangana-found-not-in-telugu-but-gond-language/articleshow/62046296.cms|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

One of the earliest uses of a word similar to Telangana can also be seen in a name of [[Malik Maqbul]] (14th century CE), who was called the ''Tilangani'', which implies that he was from Telangana. He was the commander of the [[Warangal Fort]] (''Kataka Pāludu'').<ref>Sri Marana Markandeya Puranamu, ed.&nbsp;{{clarify|date=June 2014}} G. V. Subrahmanyam, 1984, Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Academy, Hyderabad.</ref>

A 16th-century travel writer, [[Firishta]], recorded in his book:
<blockquote>During the just reign of [[Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali|Ibrahim Kootb Shah]], ''Tulingana'', like Egypt, became the mart of the whole world. Merchants from Toorkistan, Arabia, and Persia resorted to it; and they met with such encouragement that they found in it inducements to return frequently. The greatest luxuries from foreign parts daily abounded at the king's hospitable board.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shia of India|url=https://insideismailism.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/shia-of-india-1953-john-norman-hollister_txt.pdf|page=123|author=John Norman Holister|year=1953|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010135146/https://insideismailism.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/shia-of-india-1953-john-norman-hollister_txt.pdf|archive-date=10 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

The word "Telinga" changed over time to "Telangana" and the name "Telangana" was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]] from its predominantly [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking one, [[Marathwada]]. After Asaf Jahis ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the Telugu region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency's Circars and Ceded.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWDnTWrz4O8C&pg=PA684 "India Today&nbsp;• An encyclopedia of life in the Republic"&nbsp;• Vol.&nbsp;1.

The area came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 14th century, followed by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]]. [[Quli Qutb Mulk]], a governor of Golconda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in 1518. On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] after a [[Siege of Golconda|year-long siege]] of the Golconda fort.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Hyderabad Karnatik, 1687–1707|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|first=J.&nbsp;F.|last=Richards|year=1975|journal=[[Modern Asian Studies]]|pages=241–260|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00004996|volume=9|issue=2}}</ref>

During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Telangana. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption.

He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the ''Deccan suba,'' establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name ''Asif Jah'', starting what came to be known as the [[Asaf Jahi dynasty]].<ref name="brief" /> He named the area [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad Deccan]].

When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. The Nizam [[Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV]] signed the [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state's defence and foreign affairs. Hyderabad State became a [[princely state]] among the [[presidencies and provinces of British India]].<ref name="Nizam" />

{{See also|List of cities in Telangana}}
[[File:Telangana State English Map.svg|thumb|Telangana and its neighbours]]
Telangana is situated on the [[Deccan Plateau]], in the central stretch of the eastern seaboard of the Indian Peninsula. It covers {{convert|112077|km2}}.<ref name=stats /> The region is drained by two major rivers, with about 79% of the [[Godavari River]] catchment area and about 69% of the [[Krishna River]] catchment area, but most of the land is arid.<ref name="State profile" /> Telangana is also drained by several minor rivers such as the [[Bhima River|Bhima]], the [[Maner River|Maner]], the [[Manjira River|Manjira]] and the [[Musi River (India)|Musi]].

The annual rainfall is between 900 and 1500&nbsp;mm in northern Telangana and 700 to 900&nbsp;mm in southern Telangana, from the southwest [[monsoon]]s. Telangana contains various soil types, some of which are red sandy loams (Chalaka), Red loamy sands (Dubba), lateritic soils, salt affected soils, alluvial soils, shallow to medium black soils and very deep black cotton soils. These soil types allow the planting of a variety of fruits and vegetable crops such as mangoes, oranges, coconut, sugarcane, paddy, banana and flower crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/sireeshasudharani/soils-of-telangana-and-water-management|title=Soils of telangana and water management|date=16 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telangana.pscnotes.com/telangana-geography/soil-of-telangana/|title=Soil of Telangana for Telangana PSC|date=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Characterization and Classification of Soils of Northern Telangana|url=http://www.jtropag.in/index.php/ojs/article/viewFile/102/97|publisher=Journal of Tropical Agriculture|accessdate=14 July 2014|page=24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311061934/http://www.jtropag.in/index.php/ojs/article/viewFile/102/97|archive-date=11 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Telangana is a semi-arid area and has a predominantly hot and dry climate. Summers start in March, and peak in May with average high temperatures in the {{convert|42|C|F}} range. The [[monsoon]] arrives in June and lasts until September with about 755&nbsp;mm (29.7&nbsp;inches) of precipitation.

==== Ecology ====
The [[Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion covers much of the state, including Hyderabad. The characteristic vegetation is woodlands of ''[[Hardwickia binata]]'' and ''[[Albizia amara]]''. Over 80% of the original forest cover has been cleared for agriculture, timber harvesting, or cattle grazing, but large blocks of forest can be found in [[Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve]] and elsewhere.<ref>Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.'' Island Press; [[Washington, DC]]. pp. 324-326</ref> The more humid [[Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests]] cover the [[Eastern Ghats]] in the eastern part of the state.

==== National parks and sanctuaries ====
Telangana has three [[List of national parks of India|National Parks]]: [[Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park]] in [[Hyderabad District, India|Hyderabad district]], and [[Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park]] and [[Mrugavani National Park]] in [[Ranga Reddy district]].

[[File:Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) near Hyderabad W IMG 4818.jpg|thumb|Indian peafowl (''[[Pavo cristatus]]'') near Hyderabad|alt=|left]]
Wildlife Sanctuaries in Telangana include [[Eturunagaram Wildlife Sanctuary]] and [[Pakhal Lake|Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Warangal District]], [[Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary|Kawal Tiger Reserve]] and [[Pranahita Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Adilabad district]], [[Kinnerasani Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Khammam district, [[Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Medak district]], [[Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve]] in [[Nalgonda District|Nalgonda]] and [[Mahbubnagar district]]s, [[Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Medak and Nizamabad districts, [[Shivaram Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Karimnagar district]].

[[Sacred groves of India|Sacred groves]] are small areas of forest preserved by local people. Sacred groves provide sanctuary to the local flora and fauna. Some are included within other protected areas, like Kadalivanam in Nagarjunsagar–Srisailam Tiger Reserve, but most stand alone.

Telangana is governed by a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. There are three branches of government.

# [[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of Telangana|Chief Minister]], although the titular head of government is the [[Governor of Telangana|Governor]].

The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.
# The legislature, the [[Telangana Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Telangana Legislative Council]], consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the speaker or the deputy speaker in the speaker's absence. The Assembly is [[bicameral]] with 119 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] and 40 [[Member of the Legislative Council]]. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The Legislative Council is a permanent body with one-third members retiring every two years.
# The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] and a system of lower courts.

Auxiliary authorities known as ''[[panchayat]]s'', for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes seats to [[Lok Sabha]].

The main players in the [[Politics of Telangana|regional politics]] are the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]], [[All India Forward Bloc]], [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Indian National Congress]].
