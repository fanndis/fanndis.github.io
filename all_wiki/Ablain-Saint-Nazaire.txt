==History==
At the start of [[World War I]], the [[Notre Dame de Lorette|'''Battle of Lorette''']] lasted for 12 months, from October 1914 to October 1915, resulting in high casualties on both sides: 100,000 killed and as many wounded.
A French national cemetery was built on 13 hectares nearby and comprises 20,000 graves, laid out irrespective of rank or military training. General Barbot has a private soldier buried next to him, on his right.
In eight ossuaries, around the base of the lantern tower, are the remains of 22,970 unidentified soldiers. A portion of the cemetery has been reserved for Muslim soldiers.

In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of [[World War I]], French President [[François Hollande]] and German defence minister [[Ursula von der Leyen]] inaugurated a memorial for [[Armistice Day]].<ref>Natalie Muller (11 November 2014), [http://www.dw.de/hollande-von-der-leyen-europe-observe-armistice-day/a-18057098 Hollande, von der Leyen, Europe observe Armistice Day]''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>
