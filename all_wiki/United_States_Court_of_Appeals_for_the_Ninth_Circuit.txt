The '''United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''9th Cir.''') is a [[United States courts of appeals|federal court of appeals]] that has [[appellate jurisdiction]] over the [[United States district court|district courts]] in the following [[United States federal judicial district|districts]]:
* [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska|District of Alaska]]
* [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|District of Arizona]]
* [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central District of California]]
* [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California|Eastern District of California]]

* [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon|District of Oregon]]
* [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington|Eastern District of Washington]]
* [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|Western District of Washington]]

It also has appellate jurisdiction over the following [[United States territorial court|territorial courts]]:
* [[District Court of Guam|District of Guam]]
* [[District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands|District of the Northern Mariana Islands]]

Additionally, it sometimes handles appeals that originate from [[American Samoa]], which has no district court and partially relies on the District of Hawaii for its federal cases.<ref name="GAO_AS">https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-1124T GAO (U.S. Government Accountability Office. AMERICAN SAMOA: Issues Associated with Some Federal Court Options. September 18, 2008. Retrieved September 7, 2019.</ref>

Headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]], the Ninth Circuit is by far the largest of the thirteen [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeals]], with 29 active judgeships. The court's regular meeting places are [[Seattle]] at the [[William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse]], [[Portland, OR|Portland]] at the [[Pioneer Courthouse]], San Francisco at the [[James R. Browning U.S. Court of Appeals Building]], and [[Pasadena, CA|Pasadena]] at the [[Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals]]. 

Panels of the court occasionally travel to hear cases in other locations within the circuit. Although the judges travel around the circuit, the court arranges its hearings so that cases from the northern region of the circuit are heard in Seattle or Portland, cases from southern California and [[Arizona]] are heard in Pasadena, and cases from northern California, [[Nevada]], [[Hawaii]], and the Pacific territories are heard in San Francisco. Additionally, the court holds yearly sittings in [[Anchorage]] and [[Honolulu]]. For lawyers who must come and present their cases to the court in person, this administrative grouping of cases helps to reduce the time and cost of travel. Ninth Circuit judges are also appointed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] to serve as temporary acting Associate Justices for non-federal appellate sessions at the [[High Court of American Samoa]] in [[Fagatogo]].<ref name="GAO_AS" />

The large size of the current court is because both the population of the [[Western United States|western states]] and the geographic jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit have increased dramatically since the [[U.S. Congress]] created the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1891.<ref>{{cite book|first=David C.|last=Frederick|title=Rugged justice: the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the American West, 1891–1941|isbn=9780520083813|publisher=University of California Press|date=1994}}</ref> The court was originally granted appellate jurisdiction over federal district courts in [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. As new states and territories were added to the federal judicial hierarchy in the twentieth century, many of those in the West were placed in the Ninth Circuit: the newly acquired [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1900, [[Arizona]] upon its admission to the Union in 1912, the [[Territory of Alaska]] in 1948, [[Guam]] in 1951, and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] in 1977.

The Ninth Circuit also had jurisdiction over certain American interests in [[China]], in that it had jurisdiction over appeals from the [[United States Court for China]] during the existence of that court from 1906 through 1943.<ref>See, e.g., ''Republic of China v. Merchants' Fire Ass'n of N.Y.'', 49 F.2d 862 (9th Cir. 1931). As the court noted, this bizarre insurance claim dispute arose directly from the "perplexing" civil war during China's [[warlord era]], in which various groups of military officers claimed to be the representatives of the Republic's legitimate government.</ref>{{refn|The population of China is not included in the above chart for 1920 or 1940, since the Court for China lacked plenary jurisdiction over China's domestic population, then numbering about 430 million people; the court exercised only [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] over the relatively small number of American citizens in China.|group=fn}}

However, [[the Philippines]] were never under the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction. Congress never created a federal district court in the Philippines from which the Ninth Circuit could hear appeals. Instead, appeals from the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] were taken directly to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref>''Kepner v. United States'', {{ussc|195|100|1904}}.</ref>

In 1979, the Ninth Circuit became the first federal judicial circuit to set up a [[Bankruptcy Appellate Panel]] as authorized by the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]].

[[File:Court of Appeals.jpg|thumb|The Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals, Pasadena, California]]

The cultural and political jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit is just as varied as the land within its geographical borders. In a dissenting opinion in a [[personality rights|rights of publicity]] case involving the ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' star [[Vanna White]], Circuit Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] sardonically noted that "[f]or better or worse, we are the Court of Appeals for the [[Hollywood]] Circuit."<ref>''White v. Samsung Elec. Am., Inc.'', 989 F.2d 1512, 1521 (9th Cir. 1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting).</ref> Judges from more remote parts of the circuit note the contrast between legal issues confronted by populous states such as California and those confronted by rural states such as Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada.

Judge [[Andrew J. Kleinfeld]], who maintains his judicial chambers in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], wrote in a letter in 1998: "Much federal law is not national in scope....It is easy to make a mistake construing these laws when unfamiliar with them, as we often are, or not interpreting them regularly, as we never do."<ref>Kleinfeld, Andrew J.&#32;(1998-05-22).&#32;[http://www.library.unt.edu/gpo/csafca/hearings/submitted/KLEINFEL.htm Memo to the Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals].&#32;URL Retrieved June 21, 2005.</ref>

== Controversy ==

===Rate of overturned decisions===
Some argue the court's rulings are reversed by the Supreme Court at a higher rate than other courts. For example, in 2018, [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] claimed that the Ninth Circuit "is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/fact-check-trump-ninth-circuit.html|first=Linda|last=Qiu|title=Does the Ninth Circuit Have the Highest Reversal Rate in the Country?|work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 26, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>

From 1999 to 2008, of the 0.151% of Ninth Circuit Court rulings that were reviewed by the Supreme Court, 20% were affirmed, 19% were vacated, and 61% were reversed; the median reversal rate for all federal appellate courts was 68.29% for the same period.<ref>Landslide, Volume 2, Number 3, January/February 2010 by the American Bar Association.</ref> From 2010 to 2015, of the cases it accepted to review, the Supreme Court reversed around 79% of the cases from the Ninth Circuit, ranking its reversal rate third among the circuits; the median reversal rate for all federal circuits for the same time period was around 70 percent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/10/sean-hannity/no-9th-circuit-isnt-most-overturned-court-country-|title=No, the 9th Circuit isn't the 'most overturned court in the country,' as Hannity says|first=Lauren|last=Carroll|date=February 10, 2017|work=[[PolitiFact]]}}</ref>

Some argue the court's high percentage of reversals is illusory, resulting from the circuit hearing more cases than the other circuits. This results in the Supreme Court reviewing a smaller proportion of its cases, letting stand the vast majority of its cases.<ref>[[Joseph Jerome Farris|Farris, Jerome]], ''The Ninth Circuit—Most Maligned Circuit in the Country Fact or Fiction?'' 58 Ohio St. L.J. 1465 (1997) (noting that, in 1996, the Supreme Court let stand 99.7 percent of the Ninth Circuit's cases).</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Supreme Court again rejects most decisions by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals|author=Carol J.

However, a detailed study in 2018 reported by [[Brian T. Fitzpatrick]], a law professor at [[Vanderbilt University]], looked at how often a federal circuit court was reversed for every thousand cases it terminated on the merits between 1994 and 2015.<ref name="Fitz">{{cite web |url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-31-18%20Fitzpatrick%20Testimony.pdf |first=Brian |last=Fitzpatrick |author-link=Brian T. Fitzpatrick |title=Written Testimony at Hearing on Oversight of the Structure of the Federal Courts |work=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary |date=July 31, 2018 |accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>  The study found that the Ninth Circuit's decisions were reversed at a rate of 2.50 cases per thousand, which was by far the highest rate in the country, with the Sixth Circuit second as 1.73 cases per thousand.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/fact-check-trump-ninth-circuit.html |first=Linda |last=Qiu |title=Does the Ninth Circuit Have the Highest Reversal Rate in the Country? |work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 26, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Fitz" /> Fitzgerald also noted that the 9th Circuit was unanimously reversed more than three times as often as the least reversed circuits and over 20% more often than the next closest circuit.<ref name="Fitz" />

=== Size of the court ===
[[File:Mary M. Schroeder.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Chief Judges [[Mary M. Schroeder]] and [[Procter Ralph Hug Jr.]]]]

Many commentators have argued that the Ninth Circuit faces several adverse consequences of its large size,<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Scannlain|first=Diarmuid|author-link=Diarmuid O'Scannlain|date=October 2005|title=Ten Reasons Why the Ninth Circuit Should Be Split|journal=Engage|volume=6|issue=2|pages=58–64|url=http://www.fed-soc.org/Publications/Engage/Oct%2005.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=May 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924011410/http://www.fed-soc.org/Publications/Engage/Oct+05.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> such as "unwieldly size, procedural inefficiencies, jurisprudential unpredictability, and unusual ''en banc'' process."<ref>{{cite journal | first1=Ilya | last1=Shapiro | first2=Nathan | last2=Harvey | title=Break Up the Ninth Circuit | journal=George Mason Law Review | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=1299–1329 | year=2019 | url=http://georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/26-4_ShapiroHarvey_Final_Web.pdf }}</ref>

Chief among these is the Ninth Circuit's unique rules concerning the composition of an ''[[en banc]]'' court. In other circuits, ''en banc'' courts are composed of all active circuit judges, plus (depending on the rules of the particular court) any senior judges who took part in the original panel decision. By contrast, in the Ninth Circuit it is impractical for 29 or more judges to take part in a single oral argument and deliberate on a decision en masse. The court thus provides for a limited ''en banc'' review by the Chief Judge and a panel of 10 randomly selected judges.<ref>Rule 35–3 http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/frap.pdf</ref> This means that ''en banc'' reviews may not actually reflect the views of the majority of the court and indeed may not include any of the three judges involved in the decision being reviewed in the first place. The result, according to detractors, is a high risk of ''intracircuit'' conflicts of law where different groupings of judges end up delivering contradictory opinions. That is said to cause uncertainty in the district courts and within the bar. However, ''en banc'' review is a relatively rare occurrence in all circuits and Ninth Circuit rules provide for full ''en banc'' review in limited circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|date=October 21, 2003|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/kozinski102103.htm|title=Statement of Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=February 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926114549/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/kozinski102103.htm|archivedate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

All recently proposed splits would leave at least one circuit with 21 judges, only two fewer than the 23 that the Ninth Circuit had when the limited ''en banc'' procedure was first adopted. In other words, after a split at least one of the circuits would still be using  limited ''en banc'' courts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schroeder | first=Mary M. |author-link=Mary M. Schroeder |date=April 2006 |title=A Court United: A Statement of a Number of Ninth Circuit Judges |journal=Engage |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=63–66 |url=https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/wsj_court_united.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=June 6, 2006 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In March 2007, Associate Justices [[Anthony Kennedy]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee that the consensus among the justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] was that the Ninth Circuit was too large and unwieldy and should be split.<ref name="testify">"[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/197182-1 America and the Courts]," 48:28.
