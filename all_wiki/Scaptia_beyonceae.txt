'''''Scaptia beyonceae''''' is a [[species]] of [[horse fly]] found in the [[Atherton Tablelands]] in north-east [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].<ref name=CSIRO2012>{{cite journal |last=Lessard |first=Bryan |author2=Yeates, David  |year=2011 |title=New species of the Australian horse fly subgenus ''Scaptia (Plinthina)'' Walker 1850 (Diptera: Tabanidae), including species descriptions and a revised key |journal=[[Australian Journal of Entomology]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=241–252 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.2011.00809.x}}</ref> Discovered in 1981 but not scientifically [[Taxonomy (biology)|described]] until 2011, the fly is named after American recording artist and actress [[Beyoncé]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fly named after Beyonce because of bum|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=Sydney, Australia|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/fly-named-after-beyonce-because-of-bum-20120113-1py98.html|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="beyoncename"/>

==Description==
''Scaptia beyonceae'' has a striking golden tip to its [[abdomen]], formed by a dense patch of golden hairs, providing the inspiration for its name.<ref>{{cite news|last=Atherton|first=Ben  |title=CSIRO unveils bootylicious Beyonce fly|work=[[ABC Online]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-13/horse-fly-named-after-beyonce/3771224|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref> Part of the ''Plinthina'' subgenus, ''S. beyonceae'' was first collected in 1981, along with two other previously unknown subgenus specimens; the fly was officially described in 2011 by [[CSIRO]] research scientist [[Bryan Lessard]].<ref name=encycearth>{{cite web|last=Draggan|first=Sidney|authorlink=|title = ''Scaptia beyonceae'': new species of fly|publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.eoearth.org/news/view/172767/?topic=49548|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref>  According to Lessard, although usually considered by humans to be [[pest (organism)|pests]], many types of horse fly serve an important role in the [[pollination]] of [[plants]]. The flies drink [[nectar]] from several types of [[grevillea]]s, [[Myrtaceae|tea tree]]s and [[eucalypt]]s.<ref name="beyoncename">{{cite web|title=New species of fly named in honour of performer Beyoncé|publisher=CSIRO|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/New-species-fly-Beyonce.aspx|accessdate=14 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117022039/http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/New-species-fly-Beyonce.aspx|archivedate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

Other than the 1981 specimen, the fly has only been collected on two other occasions. All three collected specimens are female.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Morgan D.|title=Irreplaceable fly described from Australia|work=Biodiversity in Focus|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.biodiversityinfocus.com/blog/2012/01/13/irreplaceable-fly-described-from-australia/|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref>

The naming of animal species is required to comply with guidelines established by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN).<ref name=huffpost20120113>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Sarah C.|title=Beyonce fly ''Scaptia (Plinthina) beyonceae'' is as bootylicious as the singer|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=13 January 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/01/13/beyonce-fly-is-as-bootylicious-as-singer-_n_1204294.html|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> The ICZN's guidelines allow for species to receive names that honour people, including celebrities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearlman|first=Jonathan|title=The Beyonce fly: Researchers name insect with golden behind after singer|newspaper = The Telegraph|date=14 January 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9012133/The-Beyonce-fly-Researchers-name-insect-with-golden-behind-after-singer.html|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> Other species named after famous people include ''Hyla stingi'', a [[frog]] named after the singer [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]; ''[[Pachygnatha zappa]]'', a [[spider]] named after singer-songwriter [[Frank Zappa]]; and three [[beetle]] species from the ''[[Agathidium]]'' [[genus]] (''A. bushi'', ''A. cheneyi'' and ''A. rumsfeldi'') named after American politicians [[George W.
