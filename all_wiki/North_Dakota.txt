'''North Dakota''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|audio=en-us-North Dakota.ogg|-|_|d|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|t|ə}}) is a U.S. state in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the [[United States]].  It is named after the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Dakota people|Dakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, who comprise a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|nineteenth largest in area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|fourth least populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|fourth most sparsely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 states]]. North Dakota was admitted to the Union on November 2, 1889, along with its neighboring state, [[South Dakota]]. They were the 39th and 40th states admitted to the union. President [[Benjamin Harrison]] shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Stein|author-link=Mark Stein (author)|title=How the States Got Their Shapes|publisher=Smithsonian Books/Harper Collins|date=2008|page=256|isbn=978-0061431395}}</ref> Its capital is [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], and its largest city is [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]].

In the 21st century, North Dakota's [[natural resource]]s have played a [[North Dakota oil boom|major role]] in its economic performance, particularly with the [[Extraction of petroleum|oil extraction]] from the [[Bakken formation]], which lies beneath the northwestern part of the state. Such development has led to population growth and reduced unemployment, resulting in North Dakota's having the [[List of U.S. states and territories by unemployment rate|second lowest unemployment rate]] in the nation (after [[Hawaii]]).<ref>{{cite web

North Dakota is home to the tallest man-made structure in the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[KVLY-TV mast]].

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of North Dakota}}
{{See also|List of North Dakota counties}}North Dakota is located in the [[Upper Midwest]] region of the United States. It lies at the center of the [[North American continent]] and borders [[Canada]] to the north. The geographic center of North America is near the town of [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]]. [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] is the capital of North Dakota, and [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] is the largest city.
[[File:Western North Dakota.JPG|thumb|left|View of western North Dakota]]

Soil is North Dakota's most precious resource. It is the base of the state's great agricultural wealth. North Dakota also has enormous mineral resources. These mineral resources include billions of tons of lignite coal. In addition, North Dakota has large oil reserves. Petroleum was discovered in the state in 1951 and quickly became one of North Dakota's most valuable mineral resources. In the early 2000s, the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technologies enabled mining companies to extract huge amounts of oil from the Bakken shale rock formation in the western part of the state.

North Dakota's economy is based more heavily on farming than the economies of most other states. Many North Dakota factories process farm products or manufacture farm equipment. Many of the state's merchants also rely on agriculture.

Farms and ranches cover nearly all of North Dakota. They stretch from the flat Red River Valley in the east, across rolling plains, to the rugged Badlands in the west. The chief crop, wheat, is grown in nearly every county. North Dakota harvests more than 90 percent of the nation's canola and flaxseed. It is also the country's top producer of barley and sunflower seeds and a leader in the production of beans, honey, lentils, oats, peas, and sugar beets.

Few white settlers came to the North Dakota region before the 1870s because railroads had not yet entered the area. During the early 1870s, the Northern Pacific Railroad began to push across the Dakota Territory. Large-scale farming also began during the 1870s. Eastern corporations and some families established huge wheat farms covering large areas of land in the Red River Valley. The farms made such enormous profits they were called bonanza farms. White settlers, attracted by the success of the bonanza farms, flocked to North Dakota, rapidly increasing the territory's population. In 1870, North Dakota had 2,405 people. By 1890, the population had grown to 190,983.

North Dakota was named for the Sioux people who once lived in the territory. The Sioux called themselves Dakota or Lakota, meaning allies or friends. One of North Dakota's nicknames is the Peace Garden State. This nickname honors the [[International Peace Garden]], which lies on the state's border with Manitoba, Canada. North Dakota is also called the Flickertail State because of the many flickertail ground squirrels (Richardson's ground squirrel) that live in the central part of the state.

North Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the [[Great Plains]]. The state shares the [[Red River of the North]] with [[Minnesota]] to the east. [[South Dakota]] is to the south, [[Montana]] is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] are to the north. North Dakota is near the middle of [[North America]] with a stone marker in [[Rugby, North Dakota]] marking the "Geographic Center of the North American Continent".

The western half of the state consists of the hilly [[Great Plains]] as well as the northern part of the [[Badlands]], which are to the west of the [[Missouri River]].

The region is abundant in [[fossil fuel]]s including [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|crude oil]] and [[lignite]] coal. The [[Missouri River]] forms [[Lake Sakakawea]], the third largest artificial lake in the United States, behind the [[Garrison Dam]].<ref>{{cite web| title = History of Lake Sakakawea State Park| publisher=North Dakota Parks & Recreation Department| year = 2003| url = http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm | access-date = August 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061913/http://www.ndparks.com/Parks/Sakakawea/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 28, 2007}}</ref>

The central region of the state is divided into the [[Drift Prairie]] and the [[Missouri Plateau]]. The eastern part of the state consists of the flat [[Red River Valley]], the bottom of glacial [[Lake Agassiz]]. Its fertile soil, drained by the meandering [[Red River of the North|Red River]] flowing northward into [[Lake Winnipeg]], supports a large agriculture industry.<ref>{{cite web| title = A Glacier, A Lake, A Valley and Soil for the Future| publisher = University of Minnesota| year = 1979| url = http://mbbnet.umn.edu/hoff/hoff_agassiz.html| access-date = August 17, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811093735/http://mbbnet.umn.edu/hoff/hoff_agassiz.html| archive-date = August 11, 2007| url-status = live}}</ref> [[Devils Lake (North Dakota)|Devils Lake]], the largest natural lake in the state, is also found in the east.<ref name="50states">{{cite web| title = North Dakota Facts and Trivia| publisher = 50States.com| year = 2007| url = http://www.50states.com/facts/ndakota.htm| access-date = August 17, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711121322/http://www.50states.com/facts/ndakota.htm| archive-date = July 11, 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>

Most of the state is covered in [[grassland]]; crops cover most of eastern North Dakota but become increasingly sparse in the center and farther west. Natural trees in North Dakota are found usually where there is good drainage, such as the ravines and valley near the Pembina Gorge and Killdeer Mountains, the Turtle Mountains, the hills around Devil's Lake, in the dunes area of McHenry County in central North Dakota, and along the Sheyenne Valley slopes and the Sheyenne delta. This diverse terrain supports nearly 2,000 species of plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/fnddb/index.htm|title=Flora of North Dakota: Checklist|website=ashipunov.info|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924052523/http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/fnddb/index.htm|archive-date=September 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
===Climate===

{{main|Climate of North Dakota}}
[[File:North Dakota Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Köppen climate types of North Dakota]]

North Dakota has a [[continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The temperature differences are significant because of its far inland position and being in the center of the Northern Hemisphere, with roughly equal distances to the North Pole and the Equator.

[[File: Early Indian treaty territories, North Dakota. Map and overview.png|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Early Indian treaty territories in North Dakota]] map and overview]]

Native American peoples lived in what is now North Dakota for thousands of years before the coming of Europeans. The known tribes included the [[Mandan people]] (from around the 11th century),<ref name="auto">Wood, W. Raymond and Thomas D. Thiessen: ''Early Fur Trade On The Northern Plains.

D. Thiessen and M. K. Trimble: ''People of the Willows. The Prehistory and Early History of the Hidatsa Indians''. Grand Forks, 1991., p. 38.</ref> They both assembled in villages on tributaries of the Missouri River in what would become west-central North Dakota. [[Crow Nation|Crow Indians]] traveled the plains from the west to visit and trade with the related Hidatsas<ref name="auto"/> after the split between them, probably in the 17th century.<ref>Wood, W.

The [[Assiniboine]] and the [[Plains Cree]] undertook southward journeys to the village Indians, either for trade or for war.<ref name="auto"/><ref>Milloy, John S.: ''The Plains Cree.

Before the middle of the 19th century, the [[Arikara]] entered the future state from the south and joined the Mandan and Hidatsa.<ref>Meyer, Roy W.: ''The Village Indians of Upper Missouri.

European Americans settled in Dakota Territory only sparsely until the late 19th century, when railroads opened up the region. With the advantage of grants of land, they vigorously marketed their properties, extolling the region as ideal for agriculture. Congress passed an omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, [[South Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], titled the [[Enabling Act of 1889]], on February 22, 1889 during the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]]. His successor, [[Benjamin Harrison]], signed the proclamations formally admitting North Dakota and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889.<ref name="washington">{{cite web | title = Enabling Act | publisher= Washington State Legislature | url = http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm | access-date = August 19, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919230052/http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/State/enabling.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | archive-date = September 19, 2007}}</ref>

The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine]] to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first. The actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first.<ref name="using">{{cite web | title=H.I.P.

Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegian [[immigrants]], led to a populist political movement centered in the [[Non Partisan League]] ("NPL") around the time of World War I. The NPL ran candidates on the Republican ticket (but merged into the [[North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party|Democratic Party]] after World War II). It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations. In addition to founding the state-owned [[Bank of North Dakota]] and [[North Dakota Mill and Elevator]] (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the [[Soo Line Railroad]]). Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland. These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company.<ref name="state-law">{{cite web |url= http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t10c06-1.pdf |title= CHAPTER 10-06.1 Corporate or Limited Liability Company Farming |publisher= State of North Dakota |access-date= December 29, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161222063532/http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t10c06-1.pdf |archive-date= December 22, 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref> Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis.<ref name="state bank">{{cite journal |url= https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/03/how-nation%E2%80%99s-only-state-owned-bank-became-envy-wall-street |title= How the Nation's Only State-Owned Bank Became the Envy of Wall Street |journal= [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |last= Harkinson |first= Josh |date= March 27, 2009 |access-date= December 29, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161230085936/http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/03/how-nation%E2%80%99s-only-state-owned-bank-became-envy-wall-street |archive-date= December 30, 2016 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

For decades, North Dakota's annual murder rate and the violent crime rate was regularly the lowest in the United States. In recent years, however, while still below the national average, crime has risen sharply. In 2016, the violent crime rate was three times higher than in 2004, with the rise occurring mostly in the late 2000s, coinciding with the oil boom era.

===Population===

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates North Dakota's population was 762,062 on July 1, 2019, a 13.30% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="PopEstUS"/> This makes North Dakota the U.S. state with the largest percentage in population growth since 2011.

===Migration===

Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, experienced a mass influx of newcomers from both the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the [[Red River Valley]], as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.

From the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases. Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families. Many people moved to urban areas for jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Population Trends in North Dakota |publisher=North Dakota State University |year=2007 |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |access-date=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818144416/http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |archive-date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, one of the major causes of migration from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates. Expansion of economic development programs has been urged to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate.<ref>{{cite news | title = Agenda 2003—Saving North Dakota | newspaper = The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead | year = 2002 | url = http://www.in-forum.com/specials/savingnd/index2.cfm?page=articles_inside&id=27390 | access-date = August 19, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204321/http://www.in-forum.com/specials/savingnd/index2.cfm?page=articles_inside&id=27390 | archive-date = September 27, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased in large part because of jobs in the oil industry related to development of [[tight oil]] (shale oil) fields.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22258851/oil-boom-turbocharges-north-dakota-population-growth "Oil boom turbocharges North Dakota population growth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120114748/http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_22258851/oil-boom-turbocharges-north-dakota-population-growth |date=January 20, 2013 }}, ''The Denver Post'', Retrieved on July 12, 2013.</ref>

Elsewhere, the Native American population has increased as some reservations have attracted people back from urban areas.

'''Immigration'''

North Dakota is one of the top resettlement locations for refugees proportionally.

Throughout the mid-19th century, Dakota Territory was still dominated by Native Americans. Warfare and disease reduced their population at the same time Europeans and Americans were settling in the state.

In the 21st century, most North Dakotans are of Northern European descent. As of 2009, the seven largest European ancestry groups in North Dakota are:

* [[German American|German]]: 47.2% (305,322)

===American Indian Nations===

[[File:Kane Métis Buffalo Hunt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Paul Kane]] witnessed and participated in the annual [[bison hunting|bison hunt]] of the [[Métis people (United States)|Métis]] in June 1846 on the prairies in Dakota.]]

In the 21st century, North Dakota has an increasing population of Native Americans, who in 2010 made up 5.44% of the population. By the early 19th century the territory was dominated by Siouan-speaking peoples, whose territory stretched west from the Great Lakes area. The word "Dakota" is a Sioux (Lakota/Dakota) word meaning "allies" or "friends".

The primary historic tribal nations in or around North Dakota, are the Lakota and the Dakota ("[[The Great Sioux Nation]]" or "Oceti Sakowin", meaning the seven council fires), the [[Blackfoot]], the [[Cheyenne]], the [[Chippewa]] (known as [[Ojibwe]] in Canada), and the [[Mandan]]. The federally recognized tribes have [[Indian reservations]] in the state.

===Pow wows===

Social gatherings known as "[[powwows]]" (or wacipis in Lakota/Dakota) continue to be an important part of Native American culture and are held regularly throughout the state. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice at the beginning of new life and the end of the winter cold. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet with old friends and acquaintances, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture and are attended by Natives and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow held each September in the capital of [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], is one of the largest powwows in the United States.

A [[pow wow]] is an occasion for parades and Native American dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills, and eagle feathers; male [[grass dance]]rs wear colorful fringe regalia, and male [[fancy dance]]rs wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins, and jewelry, while the [[jingle dress]] dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. Inter-tribal dances during the powwow, allow everyone (even spectators) can take part in the dancing.

===Norwegian and Icelandic influences===

[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|Norwegian settlers in front of their sod house in North Dakota in 1898]]

Around 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. [[Icelandic American|Icelanders]] also arrived from Canada.<ref>William Charles Sherman, Playford V. Thorson, Warren A. Henke, ''Plains Folk: North Dakota's Ethnic History'' (North Dakota Institute for Regional Studies, 1986) pp 189, 242, 256</ref> [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] was a town of many [[Norwegian American|Norwegians]] when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as ''[[lefse]]'' and ''[[lutefisk]]''. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, ''[[Norsk Høstfest]]'', is celebrated each September in [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot's]] [[North Dakota State Fair Center]], a local attraction featuring art, architecture, and cultural artifacts from all five Nordic countries. The Icelandic State Park in [[Pembina County, North Dakota|Pembina County]] and an annual Icelandic festival reflect immigrants from that country, who are also descended from Scandinavians.

Old World folk customs have persisted for decades in North Dakota, with the revival of techniques in weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. Traditional turf-roof houses are displayed in parks; this style originated in Iceland. A [[stave church]] is a landmark in Minot. Ethnic Norwegians constitute nearly one-third or 32.3% of Minot's total population and 30.8% of North Dakota's total population.

===Germans from Russia===

{{See also|Germans from Russia}}

Ethnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations since the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century because of economic problems and because of the revocation of religious freedoms for [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] and [[Hutterite]]s, in particular the revocation of exemption from military service in 1871. Most Mennonites and Hutterites migrated to America in the late 1870s. By 1900, about 100,000 had immigrated to the U.S., settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as "the German-Russian triangle". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. They were Lutherans, Mennonites, Hutterites and Roman Catholics who had kept most of their German customs of the time when their ancestors immigrated to Russia. They were committed to agriculture. Traditional iron cemetery grave markers are a famous art form practiced by ethnic Germans.<ref>Elwyn B. Robinson, ''History of North Dakota'' (1966) pp. 285–87, 557</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gilmour3.html |title=Germans from Russia Heritage Collection |publisher=Library.ndsu.edu |date=September 1, 2002 |access-date=September 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218092351/http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gilmour3.html |archive-date=December 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state is the largest producer in the U.S. of many cereal grains, including [[barley]] (36% of U.S. crop), [[durum|durum wheat]] (58%), hard red spring wheat (48%), [[oat]]s (17%), and combined wheat of all types (15%). It is the second leading producer of [[buckwheat]] (20%). {{As of|2007}}, corn became the state's largest crop produced, although it is only 2% of total U.S. production.<ref name="usda facts"/> The [[Corn Belt]] extends to North Dakota, but is more on the edge of the region instead of in its center. Corn yields are high in the southeast part of the state and smaller in other parts of the state. Most of the cereal grains are grown for livestock [[Fodder|feed]].
The state is the leading producer of many oilseeds, including 92% of the U.S. [[canola]] crop, 94% of [[flax]] seed, 53% of [[sunflower seed]]s, 18% of [[safflower]] seeds, and 62% of [[mustard seed]]. Canola is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of canola for oil production produces canola meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed.

[[Soybeans]] are also an increasingly important crop, with {{convert|400000|acre|km2}} additional planted between 2002 and 2007.<ref name="usda facts"/> Soybeans are a major crop in the eastern part of the state, and cultivation is common in the southeast part of the state.

North Dakota is the second leading producer of [[sugarbeet]]s, which are grown mostly in the [[Red River Valley]]. The state is also the largest producer of honey, dry edible peas and beans, [[lentil]]s, and the third-largest producer of potatoes.<ref name="usda facts" />

The energy industry is a major contributor to the economy. North Dakota has both coal and oil reserves. [[Shale gas]] is also produced. [[Lignite coal]] reserves in Western North Dakota are used to generate about 90% of the electricity consumed, and electricity is also exported to nearby states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/state_profiles/north_dakota.html|title=EIA Renewable Energy-North Dakota Renewable Profile|date=May 27, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527040437/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/state_profiles/north_dakota.html|archive-date=May 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> North Dakota has the second largest lignite coal production in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | website=National Mining Association | title=Coal Statistics | date=May 15, 2011 | url=http://www.nma.org/statistics/coal.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515065127/http://www.nma.org/statistics/coal.asp | archive-date=May 15, 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=November 15, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, lignite coal is the lowest grade coal.

===Tourism===
North Dakota is considered the least visited state, owing, in part, to its not having a major tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lukas |first=Paul |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1999/11/01/268029/index.htm |title=State Secret North Dakota, our least visited state, is also among the most underappreciated |work=CNNMoney.com |date=November 1, 1999 |access-date=July 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122133737/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/1999/11/01/268029/index.htm |archive-date=January 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Transportation in North Dakota is overseen by the [[North Dakota Department of Transportation]]. The major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] are [[Interstate 29]] and [[Interstate 94]], with I-29 and I-94 meeting at [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], with I-29 oriented north to south along the eastern edge of the state, and I-94 bisecting the state from east to west between Minnesota and Montana. A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system is virtually all of it is paved in concrete, not blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure. [[BNSF]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] operate the state's largest rail systems. Many branch lines formerly used by BNSF and Canadian Pacific Railway are now operated by the [[Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad]] and the [[Red River Valley and Western Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmvwrr.com/ |title=Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad |publisher=Dakota, Missouri Valley and Western Railroad |access-date=October 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004083301/http://dmvwrr.com/ |archive-date=October 4, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rrvw.net/about/about.htm |title= About Us |publisher= Red River Valley and Western Railroad |access-date= October 5, 2007 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013151429/http://rrvw.net/about/about.htm |archive-date= October 13, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

==Governance==
<!-- "Government of North Dakota" redirects here. -->
As with the federal government of the United States, political power in North Dakota state government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.<ref>{{cite web|title=State Government|url=http://www.nd.gov/category.htm?id=82|publisher=State of North Dakota|access-date=October 6, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320113652/http://www.nd.gov/category.htm?id=82|archive-date=March 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The state has 47&nbsp;districts, each with one senator and two representatives. Both senators and representatives are elected to four-year terms. The state's legal code is named the [[North Dakota Century Code]].

===Indian tribes and reservations===

Historically, North Dakota was populated by the [[Mandan]], [[Hidatsa people|Hidatsa]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Ojibwe]], and later by the [[Arikara people|Sanish]] and [[Métis people (United States)|Métis]]. Today, five federally recognized tribes within the boundaries of North Dakota have independent, sovereign relationships with the federal government and territorial reservations:

* [[Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation]], [[Fort Berthold Reservation]];
* [[Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate]], [[Lake Traverse Indian Reservation]];
* [[Standing Rock Sioux]], [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]];
* [[Spirit Lake Tribe]], [[Spirit Lake Tribe|Spirit Lake Reservation]]; and

North Dakota's [[United States Senators]] are [[John Hoeven]] ([[North Dakota Republican Party|R]]) and [[Kevin Cramer]] (R). The state has one [[at-large]] [[North Dakota's At-large congressional district|congressional district]] represented by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Kelly Armstrong]] ([[North Dakota Republican Party|R]]).

Federal court cases are heard in the [[United States District Court for the District of North Dakota]], which holds court in [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]], and [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot]].

[[File:Hoeven_Official_Portrait_2014.JPG|thumb|upright|North Dakota [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[John Hoeven]] (R)]]

The major political parties in North Dakota are the [[North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party|Democratic-NPL]] and the [[North Dakota Republican Party|Republican Party]]. {{As of|2007}}, the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] are also organized parties in the state.

At the state level, the [[Governor of North Dakota|governorship]] has been held by the Republican Party since 1992, along with a majority of the state legislature and statewide officers. Dem-NPL showings were strong in the 2000 governor's race, and in the 2006 legislative elections, but the League has not had a major breakthrough since the administration of former state governor [[George Sinner]].

The Republican Party presidential candidate usually carries the state; in 2004, [[George W. Bush]] won with 62.9% of the vote. Of all the Democratic presidential candidates since 1892, only [[Grover Cleveland]] (1892, one of three votes), [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1912 and 1916), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1932 and 1936), and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1964) received [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes from North Dakota.

On the other hand, Dem-NPL candidates for North Dakota's federal Senate and House seats won every election between 1982 and 2008, and the state's federal delegation was entirely Democratic from 1987 to 2011. However, both of the current U.S. Senators, [[John Hoeven]] and [[Kevin Cramer]], are Republicans, as is the sole House member, [[Kelly Armstrong]].
