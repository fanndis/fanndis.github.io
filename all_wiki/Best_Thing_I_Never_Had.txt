"'''Best Thing I Never Had'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). It was released by [[Columbia Records]] on June&nbsp;1, 2011, as the third single from the album. "Best Thing I Never Had" was composed by [[Patrick "J. Que" Smith]], [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], [[Strange Fruit Project|Symbolyc One]], Caleb McCampbell, Antonio Dixon, Beyoncé, and [[Shea Taylor]]. The song was originally not written as a [[Ballad (music)|ballad]], but was inspired by the drumming on [[Doug E. Fresh]]'s 1985 single "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]". Beyoncé said that both men and women should be able to relate to the song.

A [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] ballad, the subjects of "Best Thing I Never Had" are [[revenge]] and [[karma]]. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize the potential for a happy life with her. Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé's 2006 single "[[Irreplaceable]]" as the two songs are thematically similar. However, some lyrics, including "showed your ass" and "sucks to be you right now", were criticized. The ballad was also likened to [[Vanessa Carlton]]'s 2002 single "[[A Thousand Miles]]" (2002).<!-- You should at least use a word to describe this song, perhaps "hit" if appropriate -->

"Best Thing I Never Had" peaked at number 16 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and at number four on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. It rose to number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number two on the [[Irish Singles Chart]] among others. The song reached number one on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Chart]], the [[UK R&B Chart]], and the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, and the top 30 in mainland Europe, Oceania, and Canada. It was certified platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand]] (RIANZ).

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Best Thing I Never Had" was directed by [[Diane Martel]]. It shows Beyoncé getting ready for her wedding while she recalls her ex-lover, who never gave her the attention she deserved. "Best Thing I Never Had" was promoted with several live performances by Beyoncé, notably at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2011|2011 Glastonbury Festival]] and on the televised [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. The song was also included on the [[set list]] for her concert ''[[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]]'' and other shows.

But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you').

===Background and concept===
{{Quote box|width=280px|align=right|quote="I wanted to do something a little brighter and so I thought it could be interesting to reenact a prom. I never got to go to my prom. I remember that awkward stage and usually you're attracted to the person that is not really thinking about you. The guy is kinda flirting with everybody else and you're kinda just sitting there shy and uncomfortable. I was that way when I was a teenager. [...] I never went to my prom, so now I get to have a prom, but my prom sucks."|source= – Knowles talking about the concept of the video.<ref name="inspiredby" />}}

It was a little strange. And definitely when I walked down the aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.'

===Synopsis===
The music video begins with Beyoncé preparing herself for her wedding ceremony. She is in her boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming the subject of the song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor.<ref name="premiere">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666967/beyonce-best-thing-i-never-had-video.jhtml |title=Beyonce's 'Best Thing I Never Had' Video Premieres |first=Kara |last=Warner |publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.<ref name="premiere"/>
