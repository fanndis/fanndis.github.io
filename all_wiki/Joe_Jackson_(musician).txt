==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Burton upon Trent]], Staffordshire, David Jackson spent his first year in nearby [[Swadlincote]], [[Derbyshire]].  He grew up in the [[Paulsgrove]] area of [[Portsmouth]], where he attended the Portsmouth Technical High School.  Jackson's parents moved to nearby [[Gosport]] when he was a teenager.  Jackson learned to play the violin but soon switched to piano and prevailed on his father to install one in the hall of their Paulsgrove [[council house]].  Jackson began playing piano in bars at the age of 16, and he also won a scholarship to study [[musical composition]] at London's [[Royal Academy of Music]].

Jackson's first band, formed in Gosport, was called Edward Bear,{{#tag:ref|Not to be confused with the [[Edward Bear|band of the same name]], which disbanded in 1974.|group="note"}} later renamed Arms and Legs.  The band broke up in 1976 after two unsuccessful singles.  He was still known as David Jackson when he joined Arms and Legs, but around this time he picked up the nickname "Joe," based on his perceived resemblance to the puppet character Joe Piano, who was [[Snoopy]] in Joe Cool guise playing piano.<ref>Jackson, Joe. [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cure-Gravity-Musical-Journey/dp/1862300836 "A Cure for Gravity: A Musical Journey"] 1 October 1999</ref> Jackson then spent some time performing on the [[cabaret]] circuit to make money to record a demo.

===Joe Jackson Band===

In 1978, a record producer heard Jackson's demo tape and signed him to [[A&M Records]]. The next year the newly formed Joe Jackson Band released their debut album ''[[Look Sharp! (Joe Jackson album)|Look Sharp!]]'' A mix of rock, melodic jazz, and [[New wave music|new wave]], it mined a vein similar to that of contemporaries [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Graham Parker]]. The album enjoyed wide critical success: in 2013 ''Rolling Stone'' magazine named ''Look Sharp!'' number 98 in a list of the 100 best debut albums of all time. Some commercial success also followed, as the debut single "[[Is She Really Going Out with Him?]]" reached the top 40 in 5 countries, and no. 9 in Canada.

The Joe Jackson Band released ''[[I'm the Man (Joe Jackson album)|I'm the Man]]'' in 1979. The album followed a similar musical pattern, and received good, though not as strong, reviews. It did produce the single "[[It's Different for Girls]]", which became Jackson's highest charting UK single, peaking at no. 5.<ref name=occ/> ''[[Beat Crazy]]'' followed in 1980. Jackson also collaborated with [[Lincoln Thompson]] in [[reggae]] crossover.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />
[[File:Joe Jackson2.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jackson at [[El Mocambo]], [[Toronto]], 21 May 1979]] In 1981, Jackson produced an album for the British [[power pop]] group [[The_Keys_(English_band)|the Keys]]. ''The Keys Album'' was the group's only LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwoutpost.com/mfv_detail.asp?mfv_id=185 |title=The Keys : The Keys Album |author=Mike Paulsen |year=2009 |work=New Wave Outpost |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xMBM7f8G?url=http://www.nwoutpost.com/mfv_detail.asp?mfv_id=185 |archivedate=21 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Joe Jackson Band toured extensively until it broke up. Jackson subsequently recorded an album of old-style [[swing music|swing]] and [[blues]] tunes, ''[[Jumpin' Jive (Joe Jackson album)|Jumpin' Jive]]'', with songs by [[Cab Calloway]], [[Lester Young]], [[Glenn Miller]], and [[Louis Jordan]]. The album, and associated single release, was credited to the band "Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

Jackson's 1982 album ''[[Night and Day (Joe Jackson album)|Night and Day]]'' was his only studio album to reach either the UK or US Top 10, peaking at No.&nbsp;3 (UK)<ref name=occ>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17919/joe-jackson/|title=Official Charts > Joe Jackson|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref> and at No.&nbsp;4 (US).<ref name=USalbums>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/DGnieTT.jpg|title=Chart runs for Joe Jackson: US albums|publisher=UKmix.org|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref> Two singles released from the album, "[[Steppin' Out (Joe Jackson song)|Steppin' Out]]" and "[[Breaking Us in Two]]", were US top 20 hits. The tracks "[[Real Men (song)|Real Men]]" and "[[A Slow Song]]" referred obliquely to [[New York City]]'s early 1980s gay culture.<ref name="Gay Pop Music">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1306240 |title="NPR Weekend Edition Sunday: Gay Pop Music", 22&nbsp;June 2003 |publisher=Npr.org |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref>  "Real Men" also became a top 10 hit in Australia.<ref name="AUS1">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970–1992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink=David Kent (historian) |publisher=Australian Chart Book |location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W. |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6}}<!--|accessdate=24 March 2009-->Note: This reference gives Australian albums and singles information.</ref>

By 1984, New York had become Jackson's home base, and he recorded ''[[Body and Soul (Joe Jackson album)|Body and Soul]]'' there, an album he later said was "from the point of view of a relative newcomer".<ref name="Bessman">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBAEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22night+and+day%22+%22joe+jackson%22&pg=PA24|title=Artists & Music: New York Inspires Joe Jackson Again on ''Night and Day II''|last=Bessman|first=Jim|date=14 October 2000|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=24|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Heavily influenced by [[pop standard|pop]] and jazz standards and [[salsa music|salsa]], it had the US No.&nbsp;15 hit single "[[You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)]]".<ref name="US charts">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/joe-jackson|title=Billboard > Artists / Joe Jackson > Billboard 200|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=4 December 2015}} N.B.

In 1985 Jackson played piano on [[Joan Armatrading]]'s album ''[[Secret Secrets]]'', and in 1986 he collaborated with [[Suzanne Vega]] on the single "[[Left of Center (Suzanne Vega song)|Left of Center]]" from ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''{{'}}s [[Pretty in Pink (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. Jackson's next album was ''[[Big World]]'', with all-new songs recorded live in front of an audience instructed to remain silent while music was playing. Released in 1986, it was a three-sided double record; the fourth side consisted of a single centering groove and a label stating "there is no music on this side". The instrumental album ''[[Will Power (album)|Will Power]]'' (1987), with heavy classical and jazz influences, set the stage for things to come later, but before he left pop behind, he put out two more albums, ''[[Blaze of Glory (Joe Jackson album)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (which he performed in its entirety during the subsequent tour) and ''[[Laughter & Lust]]''. In 1995, Jackson contributed his version of "Statue of Liberty" on a tribute album for the English band [[XTC]] called ''[[A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC]]''.

===Post-pop===
In the late 1990s Jackson expanded into classical music; he signed with [[Sony Classical Records|Sony Classical]] in 1997 and released ''[[Symphony No.&nbsp;1 (album)|Symphony No.&nbsp;1]]'' in 1999, for which he received a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album|Best Pop Instrumental Album]] in [[43rd Grammy Awards|2001]].<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p4574/charts-awards/grammy-awards |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Joe Jackson > Charts & Awards > Grammy Awards )))}}</ref> In 2000 he released a follow-up album, ''Night and Day II''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010722075133/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2000/10/2401.cfm "CD REVIEWS: Lenny Kravitz, Megadeth, Ron Hawkins and more"]. ''Chart Attack'', October 24, 2000, By: Debbie Bento</ref>

In 2003, he reunited his original [[quartet]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> for the album ''[[Volume 4 (Joe Jackson album)|Volume 4]]'', and a lengthy tour. In 2004, he contributed a cover of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s "[[Common People (song)|Common People]]" with [[William Shatner]] for Shatner's album ''[[Has Been]]''. In 2005 he teamed up with [[Todd Rundgren]] and the string quartet [[Ethel (string quartet)|ETHEL]] for a tour of the US and Europe. A dedicated [[Smoking|smoker]], he gave up his New York apartment in 2006 partly in protest over the ascendancy of [[smoking ban]]s, and made the [[Berlin]] neighbourhood [[Kreuzberg]] his new home. It was there that he recorded, with longtime collaborators [[Graham Maby]] and Dave Houghton, his eighteenth studio album, ''[[Rain (Joe Jackson album)|Rain]]'' ([[Rykodisc]], January 2008); the album was followed by a five-month tour.<ref name="McNair">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/joe-jackson-catching-up-with-the-maverick--singersongwriter-780626.html |title=Joe Jackson: Catching up with the maverick singer-songwriter |last=McNair |first=James |date=11 February 2008 |work=[[The Independent]];|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, Jackson announced the completion of his follow-up to 2012's ''The Duke'' via his official website. The album's title, ''[[Fast Forward (Joe Jackson album)|Fast Forward]],'' and track list were confirmed in addition to North American tour dates. The titular first single was released for streaming via his official Soundcloud page. The entire record was briefly posted before being taken down a day later.<ref name=officialfastforward>{{cite web |title=FAST FORWARD: A NEW ALBUM + US TOUR DATES |url=http://joejackson.com/?page=news_item&NewsID=3765647631557&last_page=home |website=Official Joe Jackson |accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>

On 18 January 2019 Jackson released the album ''[[Fool (Joe Jackson Album)|Fool]]'', preceded by the songs "Fabulously Absolute", "Strange Land" and "Friend Better".{{citation needed |date=January 2019}} Jackson said about the album on his website: "One of my inspirations for this album was the band I've been touring with on and off for the last 3 years. I've had many different line-ups but this one is special. I met Graham Maby when I was 18, and he's still one of the best bassists around. Doug Yowell is a vortex of energy on drums and Teddy Kumpel is the guitarist I always wanted to work with but could never find. Like my first album, this was a band effort, recorded and mixed (brilliantly, by [[Pat Dillett]]) in about a month." Jackson and the band performed "Fabulously Absolute" on Jimmy Fallon's ''Tonight Show'' on 21 January 2019.{{citation needed |date=January 2019}} ''Fool'' debuted in the Album Top 20 in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. In the US it debuted at #25 in Billboard's Top Album Sales Chart. In the UK it entered the Top 40 Indie Albums Chart at #13.

=== Album reissues ===
Beginning in 2016, independent record label Intervention Records began reissuing several of Joe Jackson's albums.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.analogplanet.com/content/joe-jackson-reissues-intervention-records#Mpog4hU4emEjYaUD.97|title=Joe Jackson Reissues From Intervention Records|date=2016-07-26|work=Analog Planet|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en}}</ref> All reissues were done in 180-gram vinyl with deluxe jackets.

===Personal life===
Jackson spent a number of years living in New York City which served as an inspiration for his 1982 song "Steppin' Out".  In a 2018 interview, Jackson said "I don't like New York much these days. It's as if the city and I had a hot love affair and now we're just friends, but we still have to see each other to remain friends. Today I live in Berlin. The New York I knew in late '81 and '82 is gone."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Myers |first1=Marc |title=The Story Behind Joe Jackson's 'Steppin' Out'; A night on the town in a vanished New York City inspired Joe Jackson's hit 'Steppin' Out' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-story-behind-joe-jacksons-steppinout-1528895238?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7 |accessdate=6 July 2018 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 13, 2018}}</ref>

Jackson was married to his wife, Ruth, for two years, but the marriage ended in divorce and was later called a "disaster" by Jackson. In a 2001 interview with the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' Jackson stated that he was in a relationship with a male partner.<ref name="is he really going out with him">Jackson, Joe (24 June 2001).

===Other activities===
Jackson has actively campaigned against [[smoking ban]]s in both the United States and the United Kingdom, publishing a 2005 pamphlet (''The Smoking Issue'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestonline.org/output/Page303.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508022124/http://www.forestonline.org/output/Page303.asp |archivedate=8 May 2008 |title=The Smoking Issue |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> and a 2007 essay (''Smoke, Lies and the Nanny State''),<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202083043/http://joejackson.com/smoke-lies.pdf|url=http://www.joejackson.com/smoke-lies.pdf|title=Smoke, Lies and the Nanny State|publisher=Joejackson.com|archivedate=2 December 2012|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref> and recording a satirical song ("[[In 20-0-3]]") on the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joejackson.com/forest.htm |title=Joe Jackson.com |publisher=Joe Jackson.com |accessdate=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411231540/http://www.joejackson.com/forest.htm |archivedate=11 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Jackson wrote an autobiography called ''A Cure For Gravity'', published in 1999, which he described as a "book about music, thinly disguised as a memoir".  It traces his working-class upbringing in Portsmouth and charts his musical life from childhood until his twenty-fourth birthday.  Life as a pop star, he insisted, was hardly worth writing about.<ref>''A Cure for Gravity'', 1999, {{ISBN|1-86230-083-6}}</ref>
===Material loss===
On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Jackson among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>
