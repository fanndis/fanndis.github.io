The predecessor to the modern university was the [[University of Kolozsvár]] (University of today's [[Cluj-Napoca]]), founded in 1872 by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], which had to move to Hungary after the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1921, and was restarted in Szeged.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.u-szeged.hu/english/history/the-history-of-the |title=The history of the University of Szeged |access-date=7 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103034340/http://www.u-szeged.hu/english/history/the-history-of-the |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Among its teachers were [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], one of the founders of the Faculty of Science, who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937 for his discoveries in connection with [[Vitamin C]].

== Setting and architecture ==
=== Cathedral Square ===
[[File:Hungary-szeged-szabadteri.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye view of the University and the Votive Church at Cathedral Square, where open-air plays are sometimes performed.]]

Cathedral ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Dóm'') Square is one of the largest public spaces in Hungary, with a total area of 12,000 m² (similar to that of [[Venice]]'s [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]]). In 1920, all the buildings in the vicinity were torn down, giving way to the modern square, which was built according to the designs of the architect [[Béla Rerrich]]. The square is surrounded in a U-shape by archwayed buildings made of dark brown bricks. The buildings are shared by Szeged University, the College of Catholic Theology, the Seat of the Bishop and a university [[dormitory]]. The [[relief]]s decorating the walls were made by [[Béla Ohmann]]. After the noon chimes, a musical clock (the work of [[Ferenc Csuri]], a master watchmaker) brings models of famous University figures to life. 86 statues of prominent Szeged University figures line the walls of the archways.

=== Dugonics Square ===
[[File:József Attila-emlékszobor (Varga Imre, 1964), Szeged-ja-1.jpg|thumb|A statue commemorating [[Attila József]] in Dugonics Square, sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964.]]

The main building of the University, built between 1872 and 1873 to the designs of [[Antal Skalnitzky]] and [[Ferenc Arleth]], was moved to Dugonics Square in 1921. Before the Great Szeged Flood of 1879, the square was home to Szeged's wheat market. A fountain, built in 1979 on the 100th anniversary of the flood by [[István Tarnai]], occupies the centre of the square. Also present is a statue commemorating the famous Hungarian poet [[Attila József]], which was sculpted by [[Imre Varga]] in 1964. Festivals and concerts are often held in Dugonics Square, which is a popular hangout for students of the University.
