====''Saturday Night Live'' characters====

*[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 2012–2013#Olya Povlatsky|Olya Povlatsky]], a Russian woman who voices her opinions on current events, comparing them to the outrageous struggles she faces in her village. She also appeared in a cold open with [[Beck Bennett]] as [[Vladimir Putin]] reading a prepared statement against her will.
*[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 2012–2013#Last Call (Sheila Sovage)|Sheila Sovage]], a heavily intoxicated woman at a bar who meets and hooks up with a heavily intoxicated man or woman, played by the host, at closing time.
* Jodi Cork, one of the hosts of Women in the Workplace.
* Barbara DeDrew, a lesbian volunteer at the cat shelter Whiskers R We.
* Deenie, a.k.a. "Somebody's Mom", a middle-aged woman who attempts to recap shows she's been watching, but only knows the characters by self-applied nicknames, such as "Big Boobs" and "Mustache". She is always eating some foul concoction out of Tupperware, such as Brussels sprouts and imitation crab, which generally both revolts and breaks up [[Weekend Update]] anchor [[Colin Jost]].
* Mrs. Santini, an apartment dweller who writes passive-aggressive notes to her neighbors. Originally performed as Effie Villalopolus on ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]''
* Colleen Rafferty, a twenty-seven-year-old woman (despite looking middle-aged, impliedly due to her repeated traumas) who appears in panels with two of her friends (played by [[Cecily Strong]] as a hippie named Sharon, alongside the episode's [[List of Saturday Night Live guests|host]]). The three friends recount their experience of a shared paranormal event (such as being abducted by aliens, having a near-death experience, discovering that Santa Claus is real, being visited by ghosts, and discovering that time travel is possible). The other two friends always have an idyllic experience, while Rafferty instead goes through a different, traumatic experience during the event and invariably loses her pants.
* Les Dykawitz, a lesbian cop from the 1970s who works for Chicago PD along with her partner Chubina Fatzarelli (played by [[Aidy Bryant]]) in "Dyke & Fats".
*[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 2016–2017#Debette Goldry|Debette Goldry]], a senile elderly actress whose harsh experiences with being an actress in old Hollywood (including the on-going issues of equal pay, sexual harassment and abuse, racial diversity in film roles, and actresses getting involved behind the camera as directors and writers) are more outrageous than what modern actresses have gone through.
* A member of Woodbridge High School's theatre troupe who make their performances obsessively and solely about social justice issues that they know very little about.
* Noelle LeSoup, the co-host of the French show "America's Funniest Cats" who appears on the American version of the show along with Joelle LaRue (played by [[Cecily Strong]]).
* Shud, a crass [[mermaid]] who is based on a [[Psychrolutes microporos|blobfish]], and makes sexual advances on an unfortunate marooned sailor.
