"'''22'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). As the sixth track on the album, it was written by Swift along with its producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. It was released as the album's fourth single on March 12, 2013. "22" has been described as a "thunderous" [[Pop music|pop]] song, that kicks-off with a [[twang]]y [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] [[guitar riff]], propelling into a [[disco]], [[bubblegum pop]] and [[dance-pop]] chorus. Lyrically, it describes the joys of being 22 years old. Over the course of time, the song grew into a [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomenon]] that dubs the age twenty-two as a milestone, resulting in the prominence of twenty-second [[birthday]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mylrea|first=Hannah|date=September 8, 2020|title=Every Taylor Swift song ranked in order of greatness|url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/features/every-taylor-swift-song-ranked-2747916|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=[[NME]]|language=en}}</ref>

Upon release, "22" received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented the catchy melody and pop production. The song peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the sixth song from ''Red'' to reach the top 20 in the United States. It reached the top-ten in many countries worldwide. "22" has been certified [[RIAA certification|3Ã— Platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for selling over 3 million units in the country. The accompanying music video was shot in [[Malibu, California]]. It sees Swift bouncing on [[trampoline]]s, playing on the beach and having a [[house party]] with her friends. As of July 2020, the video has more than 546 million views on [[YouTube]].

==Background and release==
After writing her third studio album ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) entirely solo, Swift opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''. Thus, she called [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], two songwriters and producers whose work she admired, to discuss a possible collaboration. She told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine: "For me, being 22 has been my favorite year of my life. I like all the possibilities of how you're still learning, but you know enough. You still know nothing, but you know that you know nothing. You're old enough to start planning your life, but you're young enough to know there are so many unanswered questions. That brings about a carefree feeling that is sort of based on in-decision and fear and at the same time letting loose. Being 22 has taught me so much".<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474565/taylor-swift-qa-the-risks-of-red-and-the-joys-of-being-22 | title=Taylor Swift Q&A: The Risks of 'Red' and The Joys of Being 22 | date=October 19, 2012 | accessdate=April 28, 2013 | journal=Billboard | first=Phil | last=Gallo | archive-date=May 29, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529022531/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474565/taylor-swift-qa-the-risks-of-red-and-the-joys-of-being-22 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Critical reception==

"22" received positive reviews from critics.  [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] said "'22' is a thunderous pop track kicking off with a twangy acoustic guitar riff before a propulsive beat that evokes [[Katy Perry]]â€˜s '[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]' drops to make way for verses that are cute and likeably bratty".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://idolator.com/7204522/taylor-swift-22-listen | title=Taylor Swift's "22": Listen To The Storming Pop Track | publisher=Idolator | date=October 18, 2012 | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | archive-date=October 1, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001075213/http://www.idolator.com/7204522/taylor-swift-22-listen | url-status=live }}</ref> [[Digital Spy]] said ""We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time," Swift acknowledges over perky guitars, before launching into an earworm chant of "twenty twooo-oo-oo" that will stubbornly swirl around your head for hours on end. She may have already achieved more during her youth than most do in their lifetime, but with one more pop smash to add to her repertoire, it seems she's only just getting started.", giving the song four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a465359/taylor-swift-22-single-review.html |title=Taylor Swift: '22' - Single review |work=Digital Spy |date=March 14, 2013 |first=Lewis |last=Corner |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archive-date=May 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515131800/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a465359/taylor-swift-22-single-review.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said that it is "Swift's most blatantly pop song of her career", adding that:

{{blockquote|"'22' is all about trying to 'forget about the deadlines' and embraces only the most sugary hooks available. Underneath the heel-clicking positivity and shiny production sits the line 'We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way', a rather stunning meditation on being in your early 20s that's flicked off like a piece of pre-chorus lint. Even when she's having fun, Swift is succinctly communicating conflicting emotion."<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1066798/taylor-swift-red-track-by-track-review | title=Taylor Swift, 'Red': Track-By-Track Review | magazine=Billboard | date=October 19, 2012 | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | archive-date=February 13, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213012607/https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1066798/taylor-swift-red-track-by-track-review | url-status=live }}</ref>}}
