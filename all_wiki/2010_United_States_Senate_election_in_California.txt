Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] won re-election to a fourth term.

== Democratic primary ==

=== Candidates ===
* [[Barbara Boxer]], incumbent [[United States Senator]]
* [[Mickey Kaus]], Journalist/Blogger
* Brian Quintana, Businessman/Educator

=== Controversies ===

==== Boxer ====
In 2009, Boxer was criticized for correcting a general who called her "ma'am". Brigadier General Michael Walsh was testifying on the Louisiana coastal restoration process in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and answered Boxer's query with "ma'am" when Boxer interrupted him. "Do me a favor," Boxer said. "can you say 'senator' instead of 'ma'am?'" "Yes, ma'am," Walsh interjected.  "It's just a thing, I worked so hard to get that title, so I'd appreciate it. Thank you," she said. The Army's guide to protocol instructs service members to call members of the U.S. Senate "sir", "ma'am" or "senator".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/19/no-maam-for-boxer | title=Sen.

=== Controversies ===

==== Fiorina ====
In February 2010, Carly Fiorina put out a campaign ad attacking Republican rival [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]] featuring a "[[Demon Sheep|demon sheep]]", creating international, mostly negative, publicity.<ref>{{cite news | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-02-05/news/17847567_1_online-ad-political-ad-fiorina | title=Demon sheep' ad may be bad move, experts say | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=February 5, 2010 | accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>

The [[Los Angeles Times]] research of public records indicated Fiorina had failed to vote in most elections. Fiorina responded by saying, "I'm a lifelong registered Republican but I haven't always voted, and I will provide no excuse for it. You know, people die for the right to vote. And there are many, many Californians and Americans who exercise that civic duty on a regular basis. I didn't.

==== Campbell ====
Former [[California State Senate|State Senator]] and [[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]] [[Bruce McPherson]] alleged that during a telephone call with Carly Fiorina's [[campaign manager]], Marty Wilson, Wilson expressed surprise that McPherson was endorsing the candidacy of Tom Campbell, and called him an [[anti-Semite]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Seema | last=Mehta | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/25/local/la-me-senate-israel25-2010feb25 | title=GOP Senate race grows heated over Israel | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 25, 2010 | accessdate=June 8, 2010}}</ref> Subsequently, Wilson strongly denied having made that charge against Campbell, thus leading to a controversy for the Fiorina campaign, where the credibility of long-time Sacramento political operative Marty Wilson was called into a comparison with that of Bruce McPherson.

On March 5, the three principal Republican primary candidates, Campbell, DeVore, and Fiorina participated in a live, on-air debate, which was broadcast on [[KTKZ]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The debate was called by Campbell, in order to respond to accusations of "anti-Semitism," and otherwise being unfriendly to the interests of [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite news | author1=Freking, Kevin | author2=Hindery, Robin | name-list-style=amp | url=http://scpr.org/news/2010/03/05/calif-senate-debate-focuses-support-israel | title=Calif.

Campbell had also been criticized for having accepted campaign contributions (during his [[United States Senate election in California, 2000|2000 Senate race]]), from then-[[University of South Florida]] professor [[Sami Al-Arian]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Seema | last=Mehta | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2010/03/devore-campbell-facetoface-in-gop-senate-debate-fiorina-to-phone-in.html | title=DeVore, Campbell face-to-face in GOP Senate debate; Fiorina to phone in | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref> On March 2, 2006, Al-Arian entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]], a "[[specially designated terrorist]]" organization; he was sentenced to 57 months in prison, and ordered deported following his prison term.<ref name="plea">{{cite web | url=http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/U.S._v_Al-Arian_pleaagr.pdf | title=Plea Agreement; U.S. v.

Air it, and let me respond to it. But there’s no place for calling me anti-Semitic, then denying it. That whispering campaign, that 'silent slander,' stops today."<ref>[http://hoguenews.com/?p=8479 Hogue News] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100819212218/http%3A//hoguenews.com/?p%3D8479 |date=August 19, 2010 }}, "''Spirited CA GOP Senatorial Debate''," by Eric Hogue (March 5, 2010 – retrieved on March 5, 2010).</ref>

A dispute had been triggered as well by Campbell's 2002 letter in defense of Al-Arian.  Campbell said he had not been aware of the charges against Al-Arian when he wrote his January 21, 2002, letter to USF's president, asking USF not to discipline Al-Arian.<ref name="radic">{{cite news | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/08/local/la-me-senate9-2010mar09 | title=Letter on Muslim radical roils GOP Senate race; Website posts text contradicting Tom Campbell's claim of writing on behalf of donor Sami Al-Arian before 9/11. | last=Mehta | first=Seema | date=March 15, 2010 | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14471989 | title=Fiorina aide accused of calling Campbell an anti-Semite – San Jose Mercury News | publisher=Mercurynews.com | date=February 25, 2010 | accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=The Associated Press | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_14641904 | title="Calif.

He also said he had not been aware that Al-Arian had said, in a speech discussed in an O'Reilly interview before Campbell wrote his letter:  "Jihad is our path. Victory to Islam.

Campbell said he was sorry he wrote the letter, adding that he did not know about the statements at the time. He said he should have researched that matter more thoroughly, and he would have known.<ref name="radic"/><ref name="stokes"/><ref name="mare">{{cite news | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/14/fiorina-lashes-out-at-boxer-destructive-elitism | title=Fiorina lashes out at Boxer, ‘destructive elitism’; Senate candidate, opponents squabble at GOP convention | publisher=San Diego Union Tribune | last=Marelius | first=John | date=March 14, 2010 | accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_14667298 | title=McLaughlin, Ken, "Candidates for California governor promise to release income tax returns," '&#39;Mercury News'&#39;, March 13, 2010, accessed March 17, 2010 | publisher=Mercurynews.com | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>

Boxer as expected performed extremely well in [[Los Angeles County]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Boxer was declared the winner shortly after the polls closed. Fiorina conceded defeat to Boxer at 11:38 P.M.

== Miscellaneous ==
Due to changes in California's election law whereby the top two candidates in the primary would advance regardless of party, this election marked the last time that a Republican advanced to the general election for this particular US Senate seat.  In [[United States Senate election in California, 2016|2016]], the next year this seat was contested again, two Democrats advanced to the general election.
