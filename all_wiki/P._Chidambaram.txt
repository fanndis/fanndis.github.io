==Political career==
[[File:Shri P. Chidambaram taking charge of the Union Finance Minister, in New Delhi on August 01, 2012.jpg|thumb|P. Chidambaram in his office after taking over the charge of the Union Minister of Finance in 2012.|left]]
Chidambaram was elected to the [[Lok Sabha]] (lower house) of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] from the [[Sivaganga (Lok Sabha constituency)|Sivaganga]] constituency of [[Tamil Nadu]] in general elections held in 1984. He was a union leader for MRF and worked his way up in the Congress party. He was the Tamil Nadu [[Indian Youth Congress|Youth Congress]] president and then the general secretary of the [[Tamil Nadu Pradesh Congress Committee]] unit.
He was inducted into the Union (Indian federal) Council of Ministers in the government headed by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] on 21 September 1985 as a Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Commerce and then in the Ministry of Personnel. His main actions during his tenure in this period was to control the price of tea and he has been criticized by the [[Government of Sri Lanka]] for destroying the Sri Lankan tea trade by fixing the prices of the commodity in India using state power. He was elevated to the rank of Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in January 1986. In October of the same year, he was appointed to the Ministry of Home Affairs as Minister of State for Internal Security. He continued to hold both offices until general elections were called in 1989. The [[Indian National Congress]] government was defeated in the general elections of 1989.

In June 1991, Chidambaram was inducted as a Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Commerce, by the then Prime Minister Mr P V Narasimha Rao; a post he held till July 1992. He was later re-appointed Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Commerce in February 1995 and held the post until April 1996. He made some radical changes in India's export-import (EXIM) policy, while at the Ministry of Commerce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 1996, Chidambaram quit the Congress party and joined a breakaway faction of the [[Tamil Nadu]] state unit of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] called the [[Tamil Maanila Congress]] (TMC). In the general elections held in 1996, TMC along with a few national and regional level opposition parties, formed a coalition government. The coalition government came as a big break for Chidambaram, who was given the key cabinet portfolio of Finance. His 1997 budget is still remembered as the dream budget<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-18-years-ago-a-tax-amnesty-scheme-that-worked-and-why/|title=In fact: 18 years ago, a tax amnesty scheme that worked – and why|date=2015-10-02|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref> for the Indian economy. The coalition government was a short-lived one (it fell in 1998), but he was reappointed to the same portfolio in the government formed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004.

In 1998, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) took the reins of the government for the first time and it was not until May 2004 that Chidambaram would be back in government. Chidambaram became Minister of Finance again in the Congress party led [[United Progressive Alliance]] government on 24 May 2004. During the intervening period Chidambaram made some experiments in his political career, leaving the TMC in 2001 and forming his own party, the [[Congress Jananayaka Peravai]], largely focused on the regional politics of Tamil Nadu. The party failed to take off into mainstream Tamil Nadu or national politics. Just before the elections of 2004, he merged his party with the mainstream Congress party and when the Congress won the election, he was inducted into the Council of Ministers under the new Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as cabinet Minister of Finance.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/11/26/stories/2004112605371100.htm | title=CJP merges with Congress | newspaper=The Hindu | date=26 November 2004}}</ref>

On 30 November 2008, he was appointed the Union [[Home Minister]] following the resignation of [[Shivraj Patil]] who had come under intense pressure to tender his resignation following a series of terror attacks in India, including the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] on 26 November 2008. The public response to this move was generally favourable given Chidambaram's reputation for competence and efficiency.

He has been credited with taking the bold decision of prioritising elections above corporate demands to deploy security for the [[2009 Indian Premier League]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2608/stories/20090424260808700.htm A victory for the terrorist?].

The Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) 1997, which he announced when he was Finance Minister with the United Front government, was condemned by the Controller and Auditor General of India as abusive because of the loopholes that made it possible to fudge data to the financial advantage of the confessor.<ref name="jeth" />

Chidambaram was criticised for his ministry's failure to prevent the [[2011 Mumbai bombings]], despite massive investments in security following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. Three years after the 2008 attacks, security preparations were proven to be inadequate with channel breakdown and failures in modernising, procuring, and installing security equipment.<ref name="wsj-mumbaigap">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304223804576447993312720946|title=Mumbai Response Points to Security Gaps|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 July 2011|access-date=26 July 2011|first=Megha|last=Bahree}}</ref> Chidambaram defended the agencies under his ministry against the charge of intelligence failure with the response which was later ridiculed by many people in India and its media:

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayaram Jayalalithaa wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner in 2011 that data entry operators at Sivaganga had transferred 3,400 votes polled by Kannappan from 11 polling stations in Chidambaram's favour. News reports suggest that on May 16, 2009, the AIADMK candidate Raja Kannappan was declared elected by 3555 votes at 12.30 pm, and the news was also broadcast on television. But in a dramatic reversal a few hours later, P Chidambaram was declared elected by 3354 votes at 4.30 pm, and was confirmed as the winner after a recount at 8.30 pm.<ref name="web.archive.org">{{Cite web |url=http://www.niticentral.com/2014/02/09/mr-recount-minister-here-are-the-facts-of-sivaganga-poll-188438.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718164038/http://www.niticentral.com/2014/02/09/mr-recount-minister-here-are-the-facts-of-sivaganga-poll-188438.html |archive-date=18 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The notice was a demand that Sterlite directors answer allegations about using their holding companies-Volcan and Twinstar-to avoid paying taxes on forex transactions. It was a polite way of saying there was prima facie evidence, dating back to 1993, that the Agarwals were guilty of money laundering. For seven years the case dragged on in courts as Sterlite employed top lawyers to use every possible delaying tactic. P. Chidambaram argued in Sterlite's defence in a 2003 Bombay High Court case related to the ED's allegations. The following year, Chidambaram found himself appointed non-executive director on the board of Vedanta Resources Plc. And very soon, he became finance minister in UPA 1.
