On 17 August 2017, three [[Hong Kong]] pro-democracy activists, [[Alex Chow]], [[Nathan Law]] and [[Joshua Wong]], were given prison sentences by the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] for their roles in a protest at the [[Civic Square (Hong Kong)|Civic Square]] in front of the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] in [[Tamar, Hong Kong|Tamar]], [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]], on 26 and 27 September 2014.<ref name="guiltyhkfp" /> The events at the Civic Square helped set off [[2014 Hong Kong protests|massive pro-democracy protests]], sometimes referred to as the [[Umbrella Movement]], which lasted until police cleared the last of the protest sites in December 2014.

The three had originally been convicted and ordered to perform [[community service]] or, in the case of Chow, given a [[suspended sentence]]. The government appealed their sentences and successfully pursued harsher punishments on the grounds that their crime involved a large-scale unlawful assembly with a high risk of violence.<ref name="halted" /> The trio's imprisonment was applauded by the [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing camp]] but decried by pro-democracy figures in [[Hong Kong]] as well as international politicians and [[human rights]] advocates, who have called the activists Hong Kong's first [[prisoners of conscience]], and alleged that the sentence is intended to intimidate other would-be activists.

The sentence also disqualifies the three from running for office for five years, quashing their political aspirations in the near future. Wong had previously sought election but was barred due to his age, while Law, democratically elected to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] in September 2016, was removed from office in July 2017 following a [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|government challenge]].

The three activists were released on 6 February 2018 after a successful appeal at the Court of Final Appeal.<ref name="freed">{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=Hong Kong democracy activists Joshua Wong, Alex Chow, Nathan Law free to go after Occupy sentence appeal|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/02/06/breaking-hong-kong-democracy-activists-joshua-wong-alex-chow-nathan-law-free-go-occupy-sentence-appeal/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=6 February 2018}}</ref>

==Background==
===Activists===
[[File:香港學民思潮宣佈926中學生罷課安排 (5).jpg|thumb|Wong (far right) and other student activists protesting in front of the Civic Square on 23 September 2014]]
Wong, Law, and Chow have been prominent democracy activists for several years. [[Joshua Wong (activist)|Joshua Wong]], now a student at the [[Open University of Hong Kong]], co-founded [[Scholarism]] in 2011. Scholarism gained prominence as one of several civil society organisations that protested against the "[[Moral and National Education]]" curriculum, proposed by the [[Education Bureau]]. He subsequently participated in the Umbrella Movement and then co-founded a political party, [[Demosistō]], in 2016.

[[Nathan Law]] is an undergraduate student at [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]] as well as the incumbent chairman of Demosistō. He previously occupied various leadership positions in the Lingnan University Students' Union and served as Secretary General of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]]. During the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]] Law ran under the Demosistō banner in the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)|Hong Kong Island geographical constituency]] and was elected, becoming the youngest-ever elected legislator in Hong Kong.<ref name="youngestlegislator">{{cite news|last1=Gupta|first1=Priyanka|title=Q&A with Hong Kong's youngest legislator Nathan Law|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/qa-hong-kong-youngest-legislator-160905181029829.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=6 September 2016}}</ref> On 14 July 2017, Law became one of [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|six pro-democracy legislators removed from office]] due to legal action by the Hong Kong Government regarding their manners during the oath-taking ceremony.<ref name="fourmore">{{cite news|last1=Lui|first1=Kevin|title=Four More Hong Kong Lawmakers Ousted In a Blow to Democratic Hopes|url=http://time.com/4856181/hong-kong-lawmakers-oath-china-disqualified/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>

[[Alex Chow]] is a [[University of Hong Kong]] student, a former vice-president of the [[Hong Kong University Students' Union]], and a former secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. He was one of the early organisers of the Umbrella Movement.

===Political context===
{{see also|2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform}}
The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] is the head of the [[Government of Hong Kong]]. [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] of Hong Kong's constitution, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], stipulates that the "ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter IV : Political Structure|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html|website=Basic Law Full Text|publisher=Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> Following the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong]] to [[China]] in 1997, the pro-democratic camp pushed for the election of the chief executive in 2007 through universal suffrage. On 26 April 2004, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC), a mainland Chinese legislative body, ruled out the possibility that universal suffrage would be allowed in 2007.<ref name="lastword">{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Gary|last2=Cheung|first2=Jimmy|title=Beijing's last word on elections in 2007 and 2008|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/453674/beijings-last-word-elections-2007-and-2008|work=South China Morning Post|date=27 April 2004}}</ref> In 2007, the NPCSC ruled out the 2012 election of the legislature and chief executive through universal suffrage, but stated that the Legislative Council and the chief executive could be elected through universal suffrage in 2016 and 2017, respectively.<ref name="suffragedraft">{{cite news|title=Beijing delivers its suffrage draft|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/620902/beijing-delivers-its-suffrage-draft|work=South China Morning Post|date=27 December 2007}}</ref> 
{{see also|831 decision}}
However, democratic aspirations stalled on 31 August 2014, when the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] in Beijing made [[831 decision|a decision]] that chief executive candidates in 2017 would be required to "love the country and love Hong Kong"; that all candidates would be screened by a nominating committee of a composition paralleling the existing [[Election Committee]], which is dominated by pro-Beijing interests; and that any chief executive elected through these means would then have to be appointed by the Chinese government. The decision was intensely decried by the pan-democratic camp, who said the arrangement would not amount to genuine democracy.<ref name="entercomplex">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong democracy protesters enter government complex|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29378961|publisher=BBC|date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

===2014 Civic Square protests===
[[File:CGO East Wing Entry Plaza Compare 2012 vs 2014.jpg|thumb|The Civic Square, pictured in 2012 and 2014]]
The incident which led to the sentencing took place in the forecourt of the East Wing of the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]], known more commonly as the [[Civic Square (Hong Kong)|Civic Square]]. The new government headquarters was opened in 2011, and was designed under the concept of "Door Always Open" by architect [[Rocco Design Architects|Rocco Yim]] to symbolise the pride that Hong Kongers take in "openness and transparency of governance".<ref name="securityworks"/><ref name=ArchDaily>{{cite news|title=HKSAR Government Headquarters / Rocco Design Architects|url=http://www.archdaily.com/481237/hksar-government-headquarters-rocco-design-architects|work=ArchDaily|date=28 February 2014}}</ref> In keeping with this design concept, the Civic Square was originally open to the public when the new government headquarters was inaugurated in 2011.<ref name="securityworks">{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Chi-fai|last2=Lam|first2=Jeffie|title=Popular protest spot Civic Square closed for security works, public access limited|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1555573/popular-protest-spot-civic-square-closed-security-works-public-access|work=South China Morning Post|date=17 July 2014}}</ref>

The square became a popular site for political demonstrations. In mid-2014, several protests were held there against plans for the development of [[North East New Territories New Development Areas Planning|new towns in the northeastern New Territories]]. In response, around 16 July 2014 work began on a permanent three-metre high metal fence, closing off the Civic Square from [[Tim Mei Avenue]]. The Hong Kong government stated that the barrier was a necessary security measure while others stated that the move ran contrary to Hong Kong people's right to [[freedom of assembly]], which is codified in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]]. The government responded that protests would be allowed in the square on public holidays if the director of the Administration Wing consented in advance. Other areas of the complex were fortified at the same time as the Civic Square.<ref name="securityworks"/>

Concurrently with the fortification of the square, the government's controversial [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform|democratic reform proposals]], coupled with the [[831 decision]], were triggering discontent and protests. On 22 September 2014, students launched a week-long class boycott campaign, coupled with demonstrations at the government complex. At around 22:30 on 26 September 2014, protesting students scaled the fence that had been erected in July in an attempt to "retake" the Civic Square. Police managed to regain control of the square, and [[Kettling|kettled]] dozens of protesters on the circular base of the flagpoles, where they were denied access to water and the toilet.<ref name="boycottends">{{cite news|title=Occupy Central won't start early, says Benny Tai, after student clashes with police leave dozens injured|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1601262/chaotic-scenes-students-break-civic-square-class-boycott-ends|work=South China Morning Post|date=26 September 2014}}</ref> At the same time, a large number of protesters amassed outside the Civic Square. The square was cleared by police by the end of the following day, with more than 60 people arrested.<ref name="clearpro">{{cite news|title=Hong Kong police clear pro-democracy protesters|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29390770|publisher=BBC|date=27 September 2014}}</ref> Wong, Chow, and Law were among those arrested. Four police officers were injured, one of them suffered a deep wound by an umbrella, and eleven security staff at the government complex were also injured.<ref name="boycottends" />

The incident immediately helped kick off the 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which saw the motorway in front of the government complex, [[Harcourt Road]], occupied by protesters until 11 December 2016.<ref name="170817nytimes">{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Alan|title=Joshua Wong and 2 Others Jailed in Hong Kong Over Pro-Democracy Protest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/asia/hong-kong-joshua-wong-jailed-umbrella-movement.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 August 2017}}</ref>

==Legal action==
[[File:Eastern Law Courts Building edit.jpg|thumb|Eastern Magistrates' Court, where the trio initially received noncustodial sentences in August 2016]]

===Initial sentencing===
On 21 July 2016, the [[Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)|Eastern Magistrates' Court]] found Wong and Chow guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly, while Law was found guilty of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly. These were the first criminal convictions for all three. Wong was cleared of a charge of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly.<ref name="guiltyhkfp">{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Kris|title=Hong Kong Occupy activists including Joshua Wong guilty of unlawful assembly|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/21/breaking-hong-kong-occupy-activists-including-joshua-wong-guilty-of-unlawful-assembly/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=21 July 2016}}</ref>

On 15 August 2016, the three were sentenced. Wong was ordered to perform 80 hours of [[community service order|community service]], while Law was sentenced to 120 hours. Chow was sentenced to three weeks in prison with a [[Suspended sentence|one-year suspension]] to allow her to continue her education at the [[London School of Economics]] as planned.<ref name="communityservicehkfp">{{cite news|last1=Yuen|first1=Chantal|title=Hong Kong Occupy activist Joshua Wong sentenced to 80 hours community service|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/08/15/breaking-hong-kong-umbrella-movement-occupy-activist-joshua-wong-sentenced-to-80-hours-community-service/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=15 August 2016}}</ref>

Immediately following the sentencing, Law said that they respected the decision of the court, and alleged that the [[Public Order Ordinance]] was "suppressing [their] freedoms to assemble and protest".<ref name="communityservicehkfp"/>

The trio subsequently served these initial sentences.

===Appeal and additional sentence===
The [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]] disagreed with the sentencing. In September 2016 it requested a review of the sentences, arguing that the community service sentence was "clearly not enough" as the three "[did] not feel true remorse".<ref name="seeksimmediate">{{cite news|last1=Yuen|first1=Chantal|title=Department of Justice seeks immediate jail terms for Occupy activists|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/15/department-justice-seeks-immediate-jail-terms-occupy-activists/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=15 September 2016}}</ref>

A review hearing was held on 21 September 2016, where the magistrate stated that the original sentencing and reasoning was sufficient, and that the department had "failed to provide sufficient evidence for the necessity of a tougher sentence".<ref name="failtohave">{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Liam|title=Hong Kong Authorities Fail to Have Tougher Sentences Imposed on Democracy Activists|url=http://time.com/4502413/hong-kong-democracy-nathan-law-joshua-wong-alex-chow-appeal/|work=Time|date=21 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="loseschallenge">{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=Ellie|title=Gov't loses challenge to unlawful assembly sentences against Occupy activists Nathan Law, Joshua Wong, Alex Chow|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/09/21/govt-loses-challenge-to-unlawful-assembly-sentences-against-occupy-activists-nathan-law-joshua-wong-and-alex-chow/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=21 September 2016}}</ref> The department had compared the activists to gangsters, which the presiding magistrate, June Cheung, said was unfair as they were expressing their political beliefs.<ref name="DOJloses">{{cite news|title=DOJ loses appeal for jailing of Occupy student leaders|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20160922-doj-loses-appeal-for-jailing-of-occupy-student-leaders/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=22 September 2016}}</ref> She stated that there were precedents for non-custodial sentences in similar cases, and dismissed the bid to impose harsher sentences on the three.<ref name="failtohave"/>

In October 2016, the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] agreed to hear a government appeal against the original sentence.<ref name="willhear">{{cite news|last1=Yuen|first1=Chantal|title=Court of appeal will hear gov't appeal against Occupy activists' sentences|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/10/14/court-appeal-will-hear-govt-appeal-occupy-activists-sentences/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=14 October 2016}}</ref>

[[File:三名香港傘運學生領袖 被改判即時入獄6至8月 01.jpg|Law, Wong, and Chow speaking to media and supporters before entering court on 17 August 2017|thumb|right]]

On 17 August 2017, the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of all three and enhanced their sentences by imposing six and seven-month prison terms on Wong and Chow, respectively, and sentencing Law to eight months in jail, removing the suspension. The judges found that the case involved a large-scale unlawful assembly with a high risk of violence, and the crimes were serious, calling for deterrent custodial sentences.<ref name="halted">{{cite news|last1=Siu|first1=Jasmine|title=Joshua Wong and other jailed Hong Kong student leaders see political careers halted|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107216/occupy-activists-joshua-wong-and-nathan-law-jailed-hong-kong|work=South China Morning Post|date=17 August 2017}}</ref>

The sentencing prevented the activists from running for public office in the next five years. Law was previously an elected legislator, while Wong had expressed a desire to seek election in the future, having been unable to run in the 2016 LegCo election for not meeting the minimum age qualification.<ref name="facejailamid">{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Venus|title=Young Hong Kong democrats face jail amid fears of broader crackdown|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-idUSKCN1AW15O?il=0|agency=Reuters|date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

==Imprisonment==

==Reactions==
===Domestic===
The sentence received mixed reactions in Hong Kong. Political figures from the pro-democratic camp and civil rights activists criticised the sentence for being disproportionately long, the [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] for appealing the sentence, and the sitting judges for not considering the act committed by Wong, Law and Chow as civil disobedience that would result in a mitigated sentence. On the contrary, pro-establishment politicians welcomed the sentence. The legal profession has also responded to allegations by the media that the Hong Kong judiciary had been influenced or controlled by the [[Communist Party of China]] through the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and the [[Law Society of Hong Kong]], stating that there is no indication of such influence.<ref name="lawjointstatement">{{cite press release |author1= Hong Kong Bar Association |author-link1= Hong Kong Bar Association |author2= The Law Society of Hong Kong |author-link2= Law Society of Hong Kong |date= 18 August 2017|title= Joint Statement of The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong in Response to Criticisms of Judicial Independence in Hong Kong|url= http://www.hkba.org/sites/default/files/20170818%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20of%20HKBA%20and%20LSHK%20in%20Response%20to%20Criticisms%20of%20Judicial%20Independence%20in%20HK%20%28E%29.pdf|location= Hong Kong |publisher= Hong Kong Bar Association|access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref>

Upon the sentencing, Joshua Wong wrote in a series of [[Twitter|tweets]] that the sentence will not halt the activism for universal suffrage and democracy, or "win the hearts and minds of Hong Kongers".<ref name="criticscryfoul"/><ref name="deathknell">{{cite news|last1=Pang|first1=Jun|title='A death knell for rule of law and human rights': 20 Int'l figures condemn jailing of Hong Kong democracy activists|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/08/18/death-knell-rule-law-human-rights-16-intl-figures-condemn-jailing-democratic-activists/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=18 August 2017}}</ref> Other pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong also criticised the court decision. Academic [[Benny Tai]] at [[The University of Hong Kong]], who also faces prosecution for his role in the 2014 protests, stated that civil disobedience to "challenge the law or acts of injustice by the government" is a necessary part of a civilised society.<ref name="bennytaihkfp">{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=Occupy leader Benny Tai slams jailing of student activists, as pro-democracy party plans protests this weekend|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/08/18/occupy-leader-benny-tai-slams-jailing-student-activists-pro-democracy-party-plans-protests-weekend/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=18 August 2017}}</ref>

There was also criticism against sentence appeal made by the Secretary of Justice. Lawyer Wilson Leung expressed on behalf of the Progressive Lawyers Group that "we strongly disagree with the government treating political problems as ‘law and order’ problems and focusing on the prosecution of protestors."<ref name="finallymanaged"/> Former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association and [[Civic Party]] politician [[Alan Leong]] commented that the appeal was "certainly politically motivated".<ref name="shiehleong">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=23 August 2017 |title=律政司覆核刑期 大律師公會兩前主席激辯 石永泰：應交代決定過程 梁家傑：袁有政治動機 |trans-title=Sentence Appeal by the Department of Justice.

On the other hand, members of the [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing camp]] applauded the prison sentences.

[[Nancy Pelosi]], leader of the United States [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], called the ruling an injustice that should "shock the conscience of the world". She described the prison sentence as an "egregious decision", and that the resulting disqualification of Wong, Law and Chow to run for public office was unjust. She also regarded the sentence to be against "the basic notions of freedom and democracy".<ref name="pelosihkfp">{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=US Democratic leader says Occupy activists' sentencing should 'shock the conscience of the world'|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/08/18/us-democratic-leader-says-occupy-activists-sentencing-shock-conscience-world/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=18 August 2017}}</ref>

A group of 25 international figures released a joint statement describing the imprisonment as "outrageously unjust". The signatories called the Umbrella Movement "one of the most peaceful and restrained movements of public protest the world has ever seen" and wrote that the sentencing amounted to "an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of 'One Country, Two Systems'". The statement was signed by eminent politicians, human rights activists, and ex-political prisoners including [[David Alton]], [[Paddy Ashdown]], [[Sonja Biserko]], [[Charles Maung Bo]], [[Fiona Bruce]], [[John Dayal]], Andrew Khoo, [[David Kilgour]], [[John McCarthy (ambassador born 1947)|John McCarthy]], [[Mohamed Nasheed]], [[Geoffrey Nice]], [[Consiglio Di Nino]], [[Grover Rees III]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]], [[Janelle Saffin]], [[Charles Santiago]], [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], [[Charles Tannock]], Alissa Wahid, and [[Zarganar]].<ref name="deathknell"/> The group also questioned whether punishing the activists twice (as Wong, Law, and Chow had already served their initial community service orders) contraveneds provisions against [[double jeopardy]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].<ref name="lettertochina">{{cite news|title=A letter to China: Hong Kong's democrats should be honoured|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/a-letter-to-china-hong-kongs-democrats-should-be-honoured|work=The Guardian|date=18 August 2017}}</ref>

===Academics===
Eric Cheung, a faculty member at the [[University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law]], questioned why the Court of Appeal decision described the defendants' actions as "seriously violent" while earlier the Eastern Magistracy had cleared the trio of committing any acts of violence. He stated that there did not seem to be any evidence presented that the three committed violence, and questioned whether the Court of Appeal had effected a "substantial and grave injustice". He said there were grounds for the three to appeal the ruling to the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], Hong Kong's [[court of last resort]].<ref name="graveinjustice">{{cite news|title=Grave injustice to the defendants, says academic|url=http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1348938-20170818.htm|publisher=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=18 August 2017}}</ref>

===Human rights organisations===
Various human rights organisations also spoke against the sentencing. A spokesperson for [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that the effort to put the trio in jail was "not about public order, but is instead a craven political move to keep the trio out of the Legislative Council, as well as deter future protests."<ref name=dwsentences>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong sentences prominent democracy activists to prison|url=http://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-sentences-prominent-democracy-activists-to-prison/a-40129981|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=17 August 2017}}</ref> Similarly, Mabel Au, a spokeswoman for [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International Hong Kong]], commented, "the relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities."<ref name="ripjail">{{cite news|last1=Awai|first1=Yasuo|title=Human rights groups rip jail terms for Hong Kong activists|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Human-rights-groups-rip-jail-terms-for-Hong-Kong-activists?page=1|work=[[The Nikkei|Nikkei Asian Review]]|date=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="criticscryfoul">{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Venus|last2=Pomfret|first2=James|title=Critics cry foul as Joshua Wong and other young Hong Kong democracy leaders get jail|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-verdict-idUSKCN1AX0T3|agency=Reuters|date=17 August 2017}}</ref>

==Other jailings==
This article focuses on the three most well-known activists to be jailed in 2017. The high-profile imprisonment of Wong, Law, and Chow spurred some Hong Kong media outlets to compile lists of all individuals who have been imprisoned for allegedly political reasons. On 15 August 2017, 13 protesters who stormed the Legislative Council building in June 2014 (during a protest against the planned [[North East New Territories New Development Areas Planning|North East New Territories new towns]]) were handed prison sentences of eight to 13 months after a similar push by the Department of Justice for more severe sentences than the community service orders originally imposed.<ref name="170817nytimes"/><ref name="finallymanaged">{{cite news|last1=Steger|first1=Isabella|title=Hong Kong's government finally managed to put democracy fighter Joshua Wong behind bars|url=https://qz.com/1055810/hong-kongs-government-finally-managed-to-put-democracy-fighter-joshua-wong-behind-bars/|work=Quartz|date=17 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="shumcalls">{{cite news|title=Lester Shum calls on public to join protest march|url=http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1349147-20170819.htm|publisher=Radio Television Hong Kong|date=19 August 2017}}</ref>
