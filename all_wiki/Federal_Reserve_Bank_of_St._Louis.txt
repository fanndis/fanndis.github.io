The '''Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis''' is one of 12 [[Federal Reserve System|regional Reserve Banks]] that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the United States' [[central bank]]. Missouri is the only state to have two main Federal Reserve Banks ([[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] also has [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|a bank]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wheelock|first=David C.|date=2015|title=Economics and Politics in Selecting Federal Reserve Cities: Why Missouri Has Two Reserve Banks|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedlrv/00047.html|journal=Review, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|language=en|volume=97|issue=4|pages=269–288}}</ref> Located in downtown [[St. Louis]], the St. Louis Fed is the headquarters of the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes the state of [[Arkansas]] and portions of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], the eastern half of [[Missouri]] and [[West Tennessee]].  It has branches in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].  Its building, at 411 Locust Street, was designed by St. Louis firm [[Mauran, Russell & Crowell]] in 1924.

== President James B. Bullard ==
[[File:FRS STL cent grp 121613 0579 02840 (14103256133).jpg|thumb|Bank presidents (left to right) Theodore Roberts (1983–1984), James Bullard (2008–present), [[William Poole (economist)|William Poole]] (1998–2008), and Thomas Melzer (1985–1998)]]
{{Main|James B. Bullard}}
James Bullard took office as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in April 2008.  He directs the activities of the bank's head office in St. Louis as well as its three branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis.  In addition, he participates in the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's principal monetary policymaking body.  Bullard is an accomplished economic theorist, whose fundamental contributions to monetary economics and policy analysis are highly regarded in the profession.  Bullard joined the research division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in 1990 and attained positions of increasing responsibility. Prior to being appointed president, he was deputy director of research for monetary analysis.<ref name="JamesBullard" />

== Responsibilities ==

=== Monetary policy ===
{{Main|Federal Open Market Committee}}
Congress gave the Federal Reserve responsibility for setting monetary policy under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 so that actions taken by the central bank would be free from political concerns.  Along with the other 11 regional Feds, the St. Louis Fed helps guide the nation's economy by participating on the Federal Open Market Committee.  Advised by the research division staff, President James Bullard contributes informed opinions about national and district conditions, and participates in FOMC decisions concerning monetary policy, including setting the [[federal funds rate]].

=== Supervisory functions ===
{{Main|Lender of last resort|Discount window}}
The St. Louis Fed supervises [[Federal Reserve System#Member banks|state-member banks]] and [[bank holding company|bank holding companies]], and, since the passage of the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act]], savings and loan holding companies.  The Banking Supervision and Regulation division, led by executive vice president Julie Stackhouse, is tasked with assessing the safety and soundness of financial institutions' assets and operations, the effectiveness of their risk management practices, and their compliance with laws and regulations governing activities and consumer protection.  Examiners collect and verify data from financial institutions to ensure an accurate accounting of financial institutions' conditions, as well as data on the money and reserves in the banking system.<ref name="banking" />  The Federal Reserve is considered the "lender of last resort" for financial institutions, and the St. Louis Fed is tasked with ensuring adequate liquidity in financial markets by making loans to depository institutions through the "discount window" and allowing the prudent use of intraday credit.  The St. Louis Fed processes bank applications for acquisitions and new activities.

Twelve senior executives of banks, thrift institutions and credit unions in the Eighth District serve on the St. Louis Fed's Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC),<ref>[http://www.stlouisfed.org/about_us/cdiac.cfm Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council] Retrieved April 17, 2013.</ref> which meets twice a year to advise the St. Louis Fed president on the credit, banking and economic conditions facing the members' institutions and communities.  The chairman of the St. Louis Fed's CDIAC represents the Eighth District at the Board of Governors' CDIAC<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/cdiac.htm Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council of the Board of Governors] Retrieved April 17, 2013.</ref> meetings, held twice annually.  Banking-related publications include quarterly banking performance data, tailored to bank executives in the Eighth District. The publication ''Central Banker''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/cb/ |title=Central Banker |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2018-04-06}}</ref> was discontinued in 2014.

=== Community development ===
{{Main|Community Reinvestment Act}}
As part of Banking Supervision and Regulation, the St. Louis Fed's Community Development department provides financial institutions and others with information on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), community and economic development, and issues related to credit access.  The department also facilitates partnerships between lenders and their communities and seeks to generate economic development and affordable housing throughout the Eighth District.  Executives from organizations throughout the district serve on the St. Louis Fed's Community Development Advisory Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/community_development/advisory_council.cfm |title=Community Development &#124; About Us &#124; Community Advisory Council |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> which was created to keep the St. Louis Fed's president and community development staff informed about development issues and to suggest ways the bank might support local development efforts.  The executives are all experts in community and economic development and represent nonprofit organizations, financial institutions, universities, local governments and foundations. Community Development holds many events throughout the year, covering such topics as the impact and possible solutions to foreclosures and vacancies, neighborhood revitalization, rebuilding household balance sheets, and reaching the [[unbanked]] and [[underbanked]]. Publications include ''Bridges'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/br/ |title=Bridges |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> a quarterly publication for community organizations and leaders.

=== Economic research ===
{{Main|Federal Reserve Economic Data}}
The St. Louis Fed's research division, led by executive vice president [[Christopher Waller|Christopher J. Waller]], produces economic research for a wide range of national and international audiences.  In the 1960s, the St. Louis Fed garnered a reputation as a maverick in the Federal Reserve System because of its espousal of [[monetarism]].  Spurred by bank president Darryl Francis and research director [[Homer Jones (economist)|Homer Jones]], the bank's economists published research showing a direct relationship between the growth of money and inflation.  Monetarist theories have since been adopted widely.

St. Louis Fed economists previously released the ''Burgundy Books'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/regecon/district.html |title=Burgundy Books |publisher=St. Louis Fed |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2018-04-06}}</ref> patterned after the Federal Reserve System's ''[[Beige Book]]'', as an economic snapshot of the four zones in the district (Little Rock, Louisville, Memphis and St. Louis).  The ''Burgundy Books'' collected data and anecdotal feedback from numerous sources to help track the district's consumer spending, commercial and residential real estate, manufacturing and industrial activities, banking data and more. Publication was discontinued after 2015.

Research publications include the ''Review'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/ |title=Review |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2014-01-23}}</ref> a journal of national and international economic developments, particularly focusing on their monetary aspects; ''Economic Synopses'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/ |title=Economic Synopses |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> short essays and reports on the economic issues of the day; and ''The Regional Economist'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/ |title=The Regional Economist |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> a magazine with articles written largely by economists but for readers who, for the most part, aren't economists.

The St. Louis Fed's research division maintains [[FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)]], a database of over 500,000 economic [[time series]] from more than 80 national, international, private and public sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/tags/series |title=FRED All Series |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |accessdate= April 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/sources |title=FRED Economic Data Sources |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Data series include interest rates, gross domestic product and its components, GDP and gross national product together, employment and population, consumer price indexes, monetary aggregates and Treasury constant maturity.  FRED and the other free online data services—ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI and FRASER—are collectively, with other research sites, accessed several million times a year. Writing at ''[[Business Insider]]'', Joe Weisenthal called FRED "The most amazing economics website in the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://businessinsider.com/fred-2012-3 |title=The Most Amazing Economics Website in the World |publisher= Business Insider |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate= May 4, 2012}}</ref> The bank also maintains the [[Research Papers in Economics]] (RePEc) database, a listing of economics authors and the  Economics Departments, Institutes and Research Centers in the World (EDIRC) databases.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Former [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]] once served on the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, where he did early research on the American [[Divisia Monetary Aggregates]].

=== Economic education ===
The St. Louis Fed's Econ Lowdown<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/education_resources |title=Personal Finance Education Resources &#124; Economic Education Resources |publisher=Stlouisfed.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> provides a variety of free online tools for K-16 educators nationwide, including online courses, audio and video podcasts, apps, personal finance chats, and [[PDF]] and [[interactive whiteboard]] versions of lesson plans.  The economics topics covered include basic concepts such as [[opportunity cost]] and [[supply and demand]] to more complex topics such as [[comparative advantage]] and [[monetary policy]].  In personal finance, the topics include earning income, taxes, budgeting, saving, banks and credit cards. Economic education staff provide in-service workshops for K-12 educators, as well as conferences and workshops at the bank and its branches for K-16 educators.  Economic Education publishes a newsletter, ''Page One Economics''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/pageone-economics |title=Page One Economics |publisher=St. Louis Fed |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> Another newsletter, ''Inside the Vault,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/itv/ |title=Inside the Vault |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2018-04-06}}</ref> was retired in 2015.  Another publication, ''In Plain English,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/inplainenglish/ |title=In Plain English |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> is a multimedia online course on the structure and functions of the Federal Reserve System.  Many materials, including personal finance online courses and personal finance chats, are available in Spanish as well as English.

=== U.S. Treasury support ===
{{Main|United States Department of the Treasury}}
The St. Louis Fed supports the U.S. Treasury with a number of functions.  Led by executive vice president Kathleen O. Paese, the Treasury Division includes the Treasury Relations and Support Office (TRSO), which manages the Federal Reserve System's overall relationships with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's [[Bureau of the Fiscal Service]] and Office of Fiscal Assistant Secretary. The St. Louis Fed's Treasury Division supports the following U.S. Treasury programs: Debt Management Services, Fiscal Accounting Operations, Information and Security Services, Payment Management, Revenue Collections Management, and Treasury Security Services. It also serves as the offering administrator for the Fed's [[Federal Reserve System#Term deposit facility|Term Deposit Facility]].

=== Payments support ===
Beginning in the mid-2000s, the Federal Reserve consolidated its check-handling services as the number of paper checks fell rapidly in favor of check cards, debit cards and electronic bill payments. The most recently completed payments study (released in late 2010) revealed that more than three-quarters of noncash payments in America were done electronically.<ref name="PaymentsStudy" />  On March 3, 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland became the Fed's single paper check processing and adjustments site and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta]] became the Fed's single electronic check processing site.  As led by executive vice president Karl W. Ashman, the St. Louis Fed provides currency and coin handling services for the Eighth District and beyond, which includes helping to ensure that depository institutions have enough currency and coin to meet public demand through currency ordering and depositing services.  The St. Louis Fed also checks currency for fit status (money that can still be circulated), destroys notes that can no longer be circulated and reports [[counterfeit money]] to the [[United States Secret Service]].

=== General outreach ===
The St. Louis Fed holds several events annually for educators, civic and business leaders, bankers and more throughout the district.  These include the "Dialogue with the Fed"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue |title=Dialogue with the Fed |publisher=St. Louis Fed |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> events for the public, in which St. Louis Fed experts discuss economic matters such as the federal deficit, the financial crisis and unemployment; and "Economic Briefings", where a Fed economist or other expert discusses the current local and national economy. The St. Louis Fed also features research symposiums, educator workshops and special presentations on topics such as the cost of higher education and recession demographics.

=== Office of Minority and Women Inclusion ===
As with all Federal Reserve banks, the St. Louis Fed established an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) in January 2011, as called for by the Dodd-Frank Act. The St. Louis OMWI is designed to increase participation of minority- and women-owned businesses in Bank procurement needs, further diversify the St. Louis Fed's workforce at all levels, and support financial literacy efforts at inner-city, girls' and majority-minority high schools. Anna Hart,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Files/PDFs/About-Us/OMWI/OMWI-Report-2017-FINAL.PDF |title=Office of Minority and Women Inclusion |publisher=Stlouisfed.org |accessdate=2018-07-02}}</ref> group vice president of human resources and diversity and inclusion, is the St. Louis Fed's OMWI director.

==Past Leadership==
When the Federal Reserve System was established in 1914, the [[chief executive officer]]s of the regional banks were known as Governors. The position was renamed to President after the [[Banking Act of 1935]].
