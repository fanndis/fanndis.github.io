The second stage begins with the ''[[Amoraim]]'' and sees RH being replaced by Aramaic as the spoken vernacular, surviving only as a literary language.

With the rise of national consciousness among Jews in the 19th century, [[Revival of the Hebrew language|it was revived]] as a spoken and literary language, becoming the main language of the [[Yishuv]] and subsequently of the [[State of Israel]].

[[Modern Hebrew]] is the [[official language]] of the State of Israel, while premodern Hebrew is used for prayer or study in [[Jews|Jewish]] communities around the world today. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan dialect]] is also the liturgical tongue of the [[Samaritans]], while modern Hebrew or Arabic is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it is studied mostly by [[Jews]] and students of Judaism and Israel and by [[Archaeology of Israel|archaeologists]] and linguists specializing in the [[Middle East]] and its civilizations, as well as by theologians in Christian seminaries.

Nearly all of the [[Hebrew Bible]] is written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with much of its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]]. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as ''[[Lashon Hakodesh]]'' ({{lang|he|לשון הקודש}}), "the holy language" or "the language of holiness", since ancient times. The Mishnah Megillah<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ashurit Hebrew {{!}} Sefaria Search|url=https://www.sefaria.org/search|access-date=2020-09-12|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref> refers to the Hebrew language as "Ashurit". [[Joel Manuel Hoffman]] states, "However, Megillah 17a (again in Hebrew) refers to a 'foreigner who heard [the Megillah] in Ashurit.' Here it looks like Ashurit refers to the Hebrew language, particularly in light of the point of the passage, which is that the foreigner who hears the Megillah in Ashurit has fulfilled his holy obligation to hear the Megillah, having heard it in a holy language."<ref>Hoffman, Joel M. ''In the Beginning : A Short History of the Hebrew Language''. New York, New York University Press, 2006, p. 169.</ref>

== Etymology ==
The modern English word "Hebrew" is derived from [[Old French]] ''Ebrau'', via Latin from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Ἑβραῖος'' (''Hebraîos'') and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''<nowiki/>'ibrāy'', all ultimately derived from [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''Ivri'' ({{lang|he|עברי}}), one of several names for the [[Israelites|Israelite]] (Jewish and Samaritan) people ([[Hebrews]]). It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name of Abraham's ancestor, [[Eber]], mentioned in {{bibleref2|Genesis|10:21}}. The name is believed to be based on the Semitic root ''ʕ-b-r'' ({{lang|he|עבר}}) meaning "beyond", "other side", "across";<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5676.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 5676. עֵ֫בֶר (eber) – region across or beyond, side|website=biblehub.com|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> interpretations of the term "Hebrew" generally render its meaning as roughly "from the other side [of the river/desert]"—i.e., an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] for the inhabitants of the land of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel/Judah]], perhaps from the perspective of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]] or the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] (with the river referenced perhaps the [[Euphrates]], [[Jordan River|Jordan]] or [[Litani River|Litani]]; or maybe the northern [[Arabian Desert]] between [[Babylonia]] and [[Canaan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12606 |title=הספריה של מט"ח |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> Compare the word [[Habiru]] or cognate [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''ebru'', of identical meaning.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uycYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9#q=assyrian%20ebru|title=A Concise Dictionary of the Assyrian Languages|last=Muss-Arnolt|first=William|date=1905|publisher=Reuther & Reichard|isbn=|location=|pages=9|language=en}}</ref>

One of the earliest references to the language's name as "Ivrit" is found in the prologue to the [[Book of Ben Sira]],{{Efn|https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=30|See original text}} from the 2nd century BCE.<ref name="XeravitsZsengellér2008">{{cite book|author1=Géza Xeravits|author2=József Zsengellér|title=Studies in the Book of Ben Sira: Papers of the Third International Conference on the Deuterocanonical Books, Shime'on Centre, Pápa, Hungary, 18–20 May, 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y042aO03HLUC&pg=PA43|date=25 June 2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-16906-7|pages=43–}}</ref> The Hebrew Bible does not use the term "Hebrew" in reference to the language of the [[Jews|Hebrew people]];<ref>Barton, John, ed.

== History ==
Hebrew belongs to the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group of languages]]. Canaanite languages are a branch of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] family of languages.<ref>Ross, Allen P. ''Introducing Biblical Hebrew'', Baker Academic, 2001.</ref>

According to Avraham Ben-Yosef, Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdoms of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] during the period from about 1200 to 586 BCE.<ref>
אברהם בן יוסף ,מבוא לתולדות הלשון העברית (Avraham ben-Yosef, Introduction to the History of the Hebrew Language), page 38, אור-עם, Tel-Aviv, 1981.</ref> Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following the [[Babylonian exile]] when the predominant international language in the region was [[Old Aramaic]].

Hebrew was extinct as a colloquial language by [[Late Antiquity]], but it continued to be used as a literary language and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary [[Medieval Hebrew]], until its [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revival as a spoken language]] in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Share |first1=David L. |year=2017 |chapter=Learning to Read Hebrew |editor1-last=Verhoeven |editor1-first=Ludo |editor2-last=Perfetti |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-link=Charles Perfetti |title=Learning to Read Across Languages and Writing Systems |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-w0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&q=%22colloquial%20usage%20ceased%20for%20some%22 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=156 |isbn=9781107095885 |access-date=1 November 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fellman |first1=Jack |year=1973 |title=The Revival of a Classical Tongue: Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Modern Hebrew Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eH_6deaHk8IC&pg=PA12&q=%22hebrew%20died%20as%20a%20spoken%22 |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton |page=12 |isbn=9789027924957 |access-date=1 November 2017 }}</ref>

===Oldest Hebrew inscriptions===
{{Further|Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Ancient Hebrew writings}}
[[File:Silwan-inscr.jpg|thumb|The [[Shebna Inscription]], from the tomb of a royal steward found in [[Siloam]], dates to the 7th century BCE.]]

In July 2008, Israeli archaeologist [[Yosef Garfinkel|Yossi Garfinkel]] discovered a ceramic shard at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] that he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating from around 3,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news |work=BBC News |date=30 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7700037.stm |title='Oldest Hebrew script' is found |access-date=3 March 2010}}</ref> [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] archaeologist [[Amihai Mazar]] said that the inscription was "proto-Canaanite" but cautioned that "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear," and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 |title=Have Israeli Archaeologists Found World's Oldest Hebrew Inscription? |work=Haaretz |agency=AP |date=30 October 2008 |access-date=8 November 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071612/http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/have-israeli-archaeologists-found-world-s-oldest-hebrew-inscription-1.256305 |archive-date=6 August 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Gezer calendar]] also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the [[Monarchic period]], the traditional time of the reign of [[David]] and [[Solomon]]. Classified as [[Biblical Hebrew|Archaic Biblical Hebrew]], the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The [[Gezer]] calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one that, through the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], later became the [[Roman script]]. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use [[Mater lectionis|consonants to imply vowels]] even in the places in which later Hebrew spelling requires them.

Numerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example, [[Protosinaitic]]. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the [[acrophonic]] principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]], and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from that of Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous [[Moabite Stone]], written in the Moabite dialect; the [[Siloam Inscription]], found near [[Jerusalem]], is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the [[ostracon|ostraca]] found near [[Lachish]], which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.

=== Classical Hebrew ===

====Biblical Hebrew====
{{main|Biblical Hebrew}}
In its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between the 10th century BCE and the turn of the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name="dvbrbw">[http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf William M. Schniedewind, "Prolegomena for the Sociolinguistics of Classical Hebrew", The Journal of Hebrew Scriptures vol. 5 article 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035409/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_36.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }}</ref> It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.
* [[Archaic Biblical Hebrew]] from the 10th to the 6th century BCE, corresponding to the Monarchic Period until the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]] and represented by certain texts in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]), notably the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Also called Old Hebrew or Paleo-Hebrew. It was written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. A script descended from this, the [[Samaritan alphabet]], is still used by the [[Samaritans]].
[[File:Sefer-torah-vayehi-binsoa.jpg|thumb|Hebrew script used in [[Ktav Stam|writing a Torah scroll]]. Note ornamental [[Ktav Stam#Serifs (tagin)|"crowns"]] on tops of certain letters.]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew|Standard Biblical Hebrew]] around the 8th to 6th centuries BCE, corresponding to the late Monarchic period and the Babylonian Exile. It is represented by the bulk of the Hebrew Bible that attains much of its present form around this time. Also called Biblical Hebrew, Early Biblical Hebrew, Classical Biblical Hebrew or Classical Hebrew (in the narrowest sense).
* [[Late Biblical Hebrew]], from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BCE, corresponding to the [[Persian period]] and represented by certain texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]], notably the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Basically similar to Classical Biblical Hebrew, apart from a few foreign words adopted for mainly governmental terms, and some syntactical innovations such as the use of the particle ''she-'' (alternative of "asher", meaning "that, which, who"). It adopted the [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic script]] (from which the modern Hebrew script descends).
* [[Israelian Hebrew]] is a proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew, believed to have existed in all eras of the language, in some cases competing with late biblical Hebrew as an explanation for non-standard linguistic features of biblical texts.

====Early post-Biblical Hebrew====
* [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] Hebrew from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, corresponding to the Hellenistic and Roman Periods before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and represented by the Qumran Scrolls that form most (but not all) of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Commonly abbreviated as DSS Hebrew, also called Qumran Hebrew. The Imperial Aramaic script of the earlier scrolls in the 3rd century BCE evolved into the [[Hebrew square script]] of the later scrolls in the 1st century CE, also known as ''ketav Ashuri'' (Assyrian script), still in use today.
* [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] from the 1st to the 3rd or 4th century CE, corresponding to the Roman Period after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and represented by the bulk of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]] within the [[Talmud]] and by the Dead Sea Scrolls, notably the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]] letters and the [[Copper Scroll]]. Also called Tannaitic Hebrew or Early Rabbinic Hebrew.

Sometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into "Biblical Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and "Mishnaic Hebrew" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls).<ref name=Segal>M. Segal, ''A Grammar of Mishnaic Hebrew'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927).</ref> However, today most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.<ref name=Qimron>Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Harvard Semitic Studies 29 (Atlanta: Scholars Press 1986).</ref>

By the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceased as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] around 135 CE.

===Displacement by Aramaic===

[[File:Шабатна кибритна кутија - Shabbat matchbox holder.jpg|thumb|A silver matchbox holder with inscription in Hebrew]]
{{See also|Aramaic language}}
In the early 6th century BCE, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] conquered the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]], destroying much of [[Jerusalem]] and exiling its population far to the East in [[Babylon]].

[[Moshe Zvi Segal|Segal]], [[Joseph Klausner|Klausner]] and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946–1948 near [[Qumran]] revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.

=== Mishnah and Talmud ===
{{Main|Mishnaic Hebrew}}
The term "Mishnaic Hebrew" generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in the [[Talmud]], excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.

About a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.

Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194849/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref> After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.

=== Medieval Hebrew ===
{{Main|Medieval Hebrew}}
[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo Codex]]: 10th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pointing (Joshua 1:1).]]
[[File:Cochin Jewish Inscription.JPG|thumb|Kochangadi Synagogue in [[Kochi]], India dated to 1344.]]

After the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called "Biblical Hebrew" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning "tradition"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.

During the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]<ref>Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)</ref> and later (in [[Provence]]), [[David Kimhi]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in a "purified" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.<ref>T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.</ref>

The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.

Hebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses—not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,<ref>Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036</ref> and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];<ref>Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326</ref> but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cojs.org/1577-first-printing-press-middle-east-safed/|title=1577 The First Printing Press in the Middle East – Safed – Center for Online Judaic Studies|date=2017-09-07|work=Center for Online Judaic Studies|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref> This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the "''average'' 17-year-old" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]], Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]'s purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to "produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute".  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, "the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onNwsw0akyoC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14 |title=Mishnah B'rurah – Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein – Google Books |accessdate=3 May 2013|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980|last1=(Ha-Kohen) |first1=Israel Meir }}</ref>

=== Revival ===
{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}
Hebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a [[pidgin]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language | title=This week in history: Revival of the Hebrew language – Jewish World – Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] ({{lang|he|שיבת ציון}}, ''Shivat Tziyon,'' later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called "Judezmo" and "Ladino"), [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

The major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.

In the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'' and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.

[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]
The literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Me'assefim|HaMe'assef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[maskil]]im in [[Königsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.<ref>[[Shalom Spiegel]], ''Hebrew Reborn'' (1930), Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p. 56.</ref> In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[Hamagid]]'', founded in [[Ełk]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.

The [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] "[[shtetl]]" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904–1914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.

While many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz</ref> (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.

In the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew "reactionary" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024723/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>).

Later in the 1980s in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel ([[refusenik]]s). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. [[Iosif Begun|Yosef Begun]], [[Ephraim Kholmyansky]], [[Yevgeny Korostyshevsky]] and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.

=== Modern Hebrew ===

[[File:Annava165.jpg|thumb|upright=1.59|Hebrew, [[Arabic]] and English multilingual signs on an Israeli highway]]
[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]
Standard Hebrew, as developed by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], was based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation. However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often introduced [[calque]]s from Yiddish and [[phono-semantic matching]]s of international words.

Despite using Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation as its primary basis, modern Israeli Hebrew has adapted to [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] [[phonology]] in some respects, mainly the following:

* the elimination of [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal articulation]] in the letters ''chet'' (<big>{{Hebrew|[[ח]]}}</big>) and ''ayin'' ({{nbsp}}<big>{{Hebrew|[[ע]]}}</big>) by most Hebrew speakers.

The vocabulary of Israeli Hebrew is much larger than that of earlier periods. According to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]]:

{{quote|The number of attested Biblical Hebrew words is 8198, of which some 2000 are [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]] (the number of Biblical Hebrew roots, on which many of these words are based, is 2099). The number of attested Rabbinic Hebrew words is less than 20,000, of which (i) 7879 are Rabbinic par excellence, i.e. they did not appear in the Old Testament (the number of new Rabbinic Hebrew roots is 805); (ii) around 6000 are a subset of Biblical Hebrew; and (iii) several thousand are Aramaic words which can have a Hebrew form. Medieval Hebrew added 6421 words to (Modern) Hebrew. The approximate number of new lexical items in Israeli is 17,000 (cf. 14,762 in Even-Shoshan 1970 [...]). With the inclusion of foreign and technical terms [...], the total number of Israeli words, including words of biblical, rabbinic and medieval descent, is more than 60,000.<ref name="Zuckermann">[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]].

In Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions called [[Ulpan]]im (singular: Ulpan). There are government-owned, as well as private, Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.

Steps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale incorporation of English words into the Hebrew vocabulary. The [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary.

== Phonology ==
{{Contains special characters|IPA}}
{{Further|Biblical Hebrew#Phonology|Modern Hebrew phonology}}

[[Biblical Hebrew]] had a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal /ʕ ħ/, a series of "emphatic" consonants (possibly [[ejective consonant|ejective]], but this is debated), lateral fricative /ɬ/, and in its older stages also uvular /χ ʁ/. /χ ʁ/ merged into /ħ ʕ/ in later Biblical Hebrew, and /b ɡ d k p t/ underwent allophonic spirantization to [v ɣ ð x f θ] (known as [[begadkefat]]). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a aː i iː u uː/ as well as /oː/, but this system changed dramatically over time.

By the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /ɬ/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /ʃ/ instead.<ref name="Qimron" /> The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a ɛ e i ɔ o u ă ɔ̆ ɛ̆/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.

A number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.

Modern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [ɣ ð θ] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /ʕ ħ/ with /ʔ χ/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [ʁ] or a voiced velar fricative [ɣ] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.

Notes:
# Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*ś}} was still pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɬ}} in Biblical Hebrew, but no letter was available in the Phoenician alphabet, so the letter <big>{{script|Hebr|ש}}</big> did double duty, representing both {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ɬ/}}. Later on, however, {{IPA|/ɬ/}} merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of <big>{{script|Hebr|ש}}</big> were distinguished graphically in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] as <big>{{script|Hebr|שׁ}}</big> {{IPA|/ʃ/}} vs. <big>{{script|Hebr|שׂ}}</big> {{IPA|/s/}} < {{IPA|/ɬ/}}.
# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes {{transl|sem|ġ}} {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, {{transl|sem|ḫ}} {{IPA|/χ/}}, {{transl|sem|ḏ}} {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{transl|sem|ṯ}} {{IPA|/θ/}}, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. As in the case of {{IPA|/ɬ/}}, no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: <big>{{script|Hebr|ח}}</big> {{IPA|/χ/ /ħ/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|ע}}</big> {{IPA|/ʁ/ /ʕ/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|שׁ}}</big> {{IPA|/θ/ /ʃ/}} and <big>{{script|Hebr|ז}}</big> {{IPA|/ð/ /z/}}. In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.
# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent [[begadkefat]] spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} were [[lenition|softened]] to the corresponding fricatives {{IPA|[v ɣ ð x f θ]}} (written ''ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ'') when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes {{IPA|/θ, ð/}} disappeared in the 7th century&nbsp;BCE,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=72}}</ref> and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew {{IPA|/χ, ʁ/}} c. 200&nbsp;BCE.<ref group="note">According to the generally accepted view, it is unlikely that begadkefat spirantization occurred before the merger of {{IPA|/χ, ʁ/}} and {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}}, or else {{IPA|[x, χ]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ, ʁ]}} would have to be contrastive, which is cross-linguistically rare. However, Blau argues that it is possible that lenited {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/χ/}} could coexist even if pronounced identically, since one would be recognized as an alternating allophone (as apparently is the case in Nestorian Syriac). See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=56}}.</ref> It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=73}}</ref> After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low [[functional load]]), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic.<ref name="bbgd">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=78–81}}</ref> In [[Modern Hebrew]], the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives {{IPA|/v χ f/}} are still preserved (the fricative {{IPA|/x/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/χ/}} in modern Hebrew). (The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, apparently under the influence of later non-native speakers whose native European tongues lacked the sounds {{IPA|/ɣ ð θ/}} as phonemes.)

== Hebrew grammar ==
{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}
{{Further|History of Hebrew grammar}}
Hebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a [[construct state]], called "smikhut", to denote the relationship of "belonging to": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition "shel", meaning "of".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and "person"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to "decline" prepositions.

Like all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of "[[triliteral]]", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]], from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes or [[infix]]es. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some triliteral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called "Nehim" (Resting).

Hebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or "Letters of Use" ({{lang-he|אותיות השימוש|Otiyot HaShimush|links=no}}). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (=&nbsp;"the"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/bə/}}) (=&nbsp;"in"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/lə/}}) (=&nbsp;"to"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (=&nbsp;"from"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/və/}}) (=&nbsp;"and"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/ʃe/}}) (=&nbsp;"that"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/kə/}}) (=&nbsp;"as", "like"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').

The vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes are hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form. However, they may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (=&nbsp;"in a village") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.

The definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''mé-ha-kfar'' (=&nbsp;"from the village"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'',  ''le'' and ''ke'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'', ''la'' or ''ka''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (=&nbsp;"in the plane"). Note that this does not happen to ''mé'' (the form of "min" or "mi-" used before the letter "he"), therefore ''mé-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means "from the airplane".

=== Syntax ===
Like most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.
* Though early [[Biblical Hebrew]] had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object ordering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/basic-word-order-in-the-biblical-hebrew-verbal-clause-part-6/ |title=Basic Word Order in the Biblical Hebrew Verbal Clause, Part 6 &#124; Ancient Hebrew Grammar |publisher=Ancienthebrewgrammar.wordpress.com |date= 2011-05-24|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>  Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence "Dad went to work", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|אבא}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|הלך}} ''{{transl|he|halaḵ}}''), and for ''to work'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|לעבודה}} ''{{transl|he|la-ʿavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, those three words can be put in almost any combination ({{lang|he|אבא&nbsp;הלך&nbsp;לעבודה/ לעבודה&nbsp;אבא&nbsp;הלך/ לעבודה&nbsp;הלך&nbsp;אבא/ הלך&nbsp;אבא&nbsp;לעבודה}} and so on).
* In Hebrew, there is no [[indefinite article]].
* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted. For example, the sentence "I am here" ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;פה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|אני}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|פה}}). In the sentence "I am that person" ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;הוא&nbsp;האדם&nbsp;הזה}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;hu&nbsp;ha'adam&nbsp;ha'ze}}''), the word for "am" corresponds to the word for "he" ({{lang|he|הוא}}). However, this is usually omitted. Thus, the sentence ({{lang|he|אני&nbsp;האדם&nbsp;הזה}}) is more often used and means the same thing.
*Negative and interrogative Sentences have the same order as the regular declarative one. A question that has a yes/no answer begins with {{lang|he|"האם"}} (''haim'', an interrogative form of 'if'), but it's largely omitted in informal speech.
* In Hebrew there is a specific preposition ({{lang|he|את}} ''{{transl|he|et}}'') for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase "he ate the cake" would in Hebrew be {{lang|he|הוא&nbsp;אכל&nbsp;את&nbsp;העוגה}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;et&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' (literally, "He ate {{lang|he|את}} the cake"). The word {{lang|he|את}}, however, can be omitted, making {{lang|he|הוא&nbsp;אכל&nbsp;העוגה}} ''{{transl|he|hu&nbsp;akhal&nbsp;ha'ugah}}'' ("He ate the cake"). Former Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] was convinced that {{lang|he|את}} should never be used as it elongates the sentence without adding meaning.
* In spoken Hebrew {{lang|he|-את ה}} {{transl|he|et ha-}} is also often contracted to {{lang|he|-ַת'}} {{transl|he|ta-}}, e.g. {{lang|he|ת'אנשים}} {{transl|he|ta-anashim}} instead of {{lang|he|את האנשים}} {{transl|he|et ha-anashim}} (the ' indicates non-standard use). This phenomenon has also been found by researchers in the [[Cave of Letters#Bar-Kokhba letters|Bar Kokhba documents]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} : {{lang|he|מעיד אני עלי תשמים… שאני נותן תכבלים ברגליכם}}, writing {{lang|he|תללו}} instead of {{lang|he|את הללו}}, as well as {{lang|he|תדקל}} and so on.

{{Main|Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew braille}}
[[File:Frank-ruehl.png|thumb|[[Hebrew alphabet]]]]
Modern Hebrew is written from [[Right-to-left|right to left]] using the [[Hebrew alphabet]], which is an "impure" [[abjad]], or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the "square" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).

== Liturgical use in Judaism ==
{{Listen|filename=Cantillation_Example_Aliyah_Reform2.ogg|title=Audio example of liturgical Hebrew |description=This is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally [[cantillation|chanted]] before the [[Baal kore|Aliyah La-Torah]] (reading of the Torah). |format=[[Ogg]]}}

Hebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.

[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.

[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.

[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was derived from the old [[Arabic language]], and in some cases influenced by [[Sephardi Hebrew]]. The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and "ghimel".)

These pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew. However, some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.

Many synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the "Sephardic" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].
