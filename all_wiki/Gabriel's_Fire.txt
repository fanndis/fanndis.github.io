==Overview==
The main character, Gabriel Bird, was played by [[James Earl Jones]]. He was a former Chicago police officer who, over twenty years prior, had been wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a fellow police officer. In fact, he shot the officer to protect a defenseless mother and child whom the officer was about to murder [[wiktionary:in cold blood|in cold blood]] during a 1969 police raid. Unbeknownst to Bird, the raid had been merely a pretext for the police to attack the members of a militant [[black nationalist]] organization.

This incident in the character's background was inspired by the 1969 death of [[Black Panther Party]] leader [[Fred Hampton#Death following Chicago police raid|Fred Hampton]], who was shot and killed during a raid upon his residence conducted by Chicago police and other law enforcement personnel.  On the show, the street on which the raid involving Bird had occurred was identified as "Hampton Street".

When Bird is released, he starts working as a [[private detective]], hired by the lawyer who had helped free him.
