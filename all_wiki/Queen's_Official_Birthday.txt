The '''Queen's Official Birthday''', or the '''King's Official Birthday''', is the selected day in some [[Commonwealth realm]]s on which the [[birthday]] of the [[Commonwealth_realm#The_Crown_in_the_Commonwealth_realms|monarch]] is officially celebrated in those countries. It does not necessarily correspond to the date of the monarch's actual birth.

The Sovereign's birthday was first officially marked in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1748, for [[George II of Great Britain and Ireland|King George II]]. Since then, the date of the king or queen's birthday has been determined throughout the [[British Empire]], and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], either by Royal Proclamations issued by the sovereign or viceroy, or by statute laws passed by the local parliament. The date of the celebration today varies as adopted by each country and is generally set around the end of May or start of June, to coincide with a higher probability of fine weather in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] for outdoor ceremonies. In some cases, it is an official [[public holiday]], sometimes aligning with the celebration of other events. Most Commonwealth realms release a [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] list at this time.

==Australia==
[[Australia]]n states and territories observe the Queen's Birthday on the second Monday in June, except in [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. As Western Australia celebrates [[Western Australia Day]] (formerly known as Foundation Day) on the first Monday in June, the [[Governor of Western Australia]] each year proclaims the day on which the state will observe the Queen's Birthday, based on school terms and the [[Perth Royal Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/| title=Department of Consumer and Employment Protection, Labour Relations division| publisher=Docep.wa.gov.au| date=17 August 2012| accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> There is no firm rule to determine this date, though it is usually the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October. Some regional areas of Western Australia celebrate the Queen's Birthday public holiday on alternative days for locally significant dates or events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/labour-relations/regional-dates-queens-birthday-public-holiday|title=Regional dates for the Queen's Birthday public holiday|publisher=Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref> In 2012, Queensland celebrated the holiday in October, as the June holiday was reserved to mark [[Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Australia|Diamond Jubilee]] as [[Queen of Australia]], after which the holiday then for three years reverted to its traditional date in line with the other eastern Australian states.<ref>{{cite news| title=Holiday double treat for Queen's big year| url=http://brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/holiday-double-treat-for-queens-big-year-20111106-1n1ow.html| newspaper=Brisbane Times| date=6 November 2011| agency=Australian Associated Press| accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref> However, starting in 2016, Queensland celebrates the holiday on the first Monday of October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public holidays|url=http://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/travel/holidays/public/|publisher=Queensland Government|date=7 April 2016|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Queensland Labour Day moved to May, Queen's Birthday to October|url=http://brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/queensland-labour-day-moved-to-may-queens-birthday-to-october-20151013-gk8biu.html|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=13 October 2015|agency=Australian Associated Press|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref>

[[Norfolk Island]] celebrates Bounty Day on 8 June, so Queen's Birthday is held on the Monday after the second Saturday in June.<ref>[https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/australia/queens-birthday Queen's Birthday Holidays]</ref>. [[Christmas Island]] has other holidays and does not hold a Queen's Birthday holiday at all.<ref>[https://www.regional.gov.au/territories/indian_ocean/iot_bulletins/2019/A52-2020-public-holidays-christmas-island.aspx 2020 Public Holidays, Christmas Island]</ref>

The day has been celebrated since 1788, when [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Arthur Phillip]] declared a holiday to mark the birthday of the King of Great Britain. Until 1936, it was held on the actual birthday of the monarch, but, after [[King George V]] died, it was decided to keep the date on the second Monday in June.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31398244| title=Advertising| newspaper=The Queanbeyan Age|page=5| date=6 June 1913| publisher=National Library of Australia| location=NSW| accessdate=1 June 2013}}</ref> This has more evenly spaced out public holidays throughout the year. While George V's successor, [[Edward VIII]], also celebrated his birthday in June, the two sovereigns since have not: [[George VI]]'s birthday was in December, very close to public holidays for Christmas, Boxing Day, and New Years, while Elizabeth II's birthday falls shortly after holidays for Good Friday and Easter and very close to [[ANZAC Day]].

The Queen's Birthday weekend and [[Empire Day]] (24 May) were the traditional times for public [[fireworks]] displays in Australia. The sale of fireworks to the public was banned in various states through the 1980s and by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] on 24 August 2009. [[Tasmania]] is the only state and the [[Northern Territory]] the only territory to allow the sale of fireworks to the public.<ref>{{cite web| title=Cracker down: ACT bans fireworks| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/24/2664761.htm| date=24 August 2009| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate=24 August 2009}}</ref> The Queen's [[Birthday Honours]] List, in which new members of the [[Order of Australia]] and other [[Australian honours system|Australian honours]] are named, is released on the date of the Queen's Birthday in most states.

[[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward VIII abdicated]] on 11 December 1936, three days before the birthday of his brother and successor, George VI. The new King expressed to his ministers his wish that his birthday not be publicly celebrated, in light of the recent circumstances. But, the Prime Minister at the time, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], the rest of [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], and [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]], the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], felt otherwise, seeing such a celebration as a way to begin the reign on a positive note.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/king/001059-119.02-e.php?&page_id_nbr=17497&interval=20PHPSESSID=bgajorjbf37d43pri9gimsmfv0| last=Library and Archives Canada| title=The Diaries of William Lyon Mackenzie King| page=573| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2007| access-date=14 August 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416052458/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/king/001059-119.02-e.php| archive-date=16 April 2012| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> George VI's official birthday in Canada was thereafter marked on various days between 20 May and 14 June.

The Canadian monarch has been in Canada for his or her official birthday twice. The first time was 20 May 1939, when King George VI was on a coast-to-coast tour of [[Canada]] and his official birthday was celebrated with a [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur|author2=Toffoli, Gary|  title=Royal Spring: The Royal Tour of 1939 and the Queen Mother in Canada| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=1989| location=Toronto| page=30| url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Go5p_CN8UQC&printsec=frontcover&q=| isbn=1-55002-065-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/victoria-eng.cfm|last=Department of Canadian Heritage|title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion> Victoria Day> Observance in Canada of the Sovereign's Birthday|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|accessdate=12 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205141327/http://pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/victoria-eng.cfm|archive-date=5 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The second time was when Queen Elizabeth II was in Canada from 17&nbsp;– 25 May 2005, to mark the centennial of the entries of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] into Confederation; no government-initiated events, aside from those dictated by normal protocol, were organized to acknowledge the official birthday.

==United Kingdom==
[[File:Trooping the Colour Inspection.JPG|thumb|Queen Elizabeth II at the [[Trooping the Colour]] on her Official Birthday.]]
The monarch's birthday has been celebrated in the [[United Kingdom]] since 1748, during the reign of King George II. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s Official Birthday was originally celebrated on the second Thursday of June, the same day that her father, King George VI, celebrated his Official Birthday during his reign.  However, this was changed in 1959, seven years after she became Queen, and her Official Birthday has since then been celebrated on the second Saturday of June.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Queen's Birthday|url=https://www.royal.uk/queens-birthday|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref> Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910 and whose birthday was on 9 November, after 1908 moved the ceremony to summer in the hope of good weather.<ref name="Official">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueensbirthdays.aspx|title=The Queen's birthdays|quote=The current Queen Elizabeth II celebrates two birthdays each year: her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.|work=royal.gov.uk, the Official Website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=1 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008185420/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueensbirthdays.aspx|archivedate=8 October 2011}}</ref><ref>The Times 9 November 1908 published the King's Birthday Honours list, apparently the first occasion of such awards. The lists were subsequently published on the monarch's official birthday in June</ref>

The day is marked in London by the ceremony of [[Trooping the Colour]], which is also known as the Queen's Birthday Parade. The list of Birthday [[British honours system|Honours]] is also announced at the time of the Official Birthday celebrations. In British diplomatic missions, the day is treated as the [[National Day]] of the United Kingdom. Although it is not celebrated as a specific public holiday in the UK, some [[civil servants]] are given a "[[privilege day]]" at this time of year, which is often merged with the Spring [[Bank Holiday]] (last Monday in May) to create a long weekend, which was partly created to celebrate the monarch's birthday.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Parts of Scotland also mark [[Victoria Day (Scotland)|Queen Victoria's birthday]] on the last Monday before or on 24 May. Local government and higher education institutions typically close on this day.

===British Overseas Territories===

The Queen's official birthday is a public holiday in [[Gibraltar]] and most other [[British overseas territories]]. In 2008, the government of [[Bermuda]] decided the day would be, beginning the following year, replaced by [[Heroes' Day|National Heroes' Day]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20091009/NEWS/310099945| title=National Heroes' holiday is in June| date=9 October 2009| newspaper=The Royal Gazette| accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> despite protests from people on the island, who signed a petition calling for retention of The Queen's Official Birthday.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/371565| title=Bermuda ditches Queen's Birthday public holiday| date=17 April 2008| agency=[[Reuters]]| work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]| accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>  The [[Falkland Islands]] celebrate the actual day of the Queen's birth, 21 April, as June occurs in late autumn or winter there. It is a [[public holiday in Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha]], where it falls on the third Monday in April.

[[Cook Islands]], a self-governing country in [[associated state|free association]] with New Zealand, also celebrates the holiday on the second Monday of June.

Despite [[Fiji]] abolishing the [[monarchy of Fiji|monarchy]] in 1987, following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|second military coup d'état]], the Queen's Birthday continued to be celebrated each 12 June until 2012. That year, the military government of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] announced the holiday would be abolished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbint/932411065-fiji-scraps-queen-s-birthday-holiday|publisher=[[NewstalkZB]]|date=31 July 2012|title=Fiji Scraps Queen's birthday holiday}}</ref>

As a legacy of British rule, Malaysia continues to celebrate its monarch's official birthday during the first week of June, although it has its own elected King.
