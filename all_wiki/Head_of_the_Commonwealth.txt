The '''Head of the Commonwealth''' is the "symbol of the free association of independent member nations" of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (commonly known as ''the Commonwealth''), an [[intergovernmental organisation]] that currently comprises [[Member states of the Commonwealth of Nations|54 sovereign states]]. There is no set term of office or term limit and the role itself involves no part in the day-to-day governance of any of the member states within the Commonwealth.

By 1949, the British Commonwealth was a group of eight countries, each having [[George VI]] as king. [[India]], however, desired to become a republic, but not to leave the Commonwealth by doing so. This was accommodated by the creation of the title ''Head of the Commonwealth'' for the King, and India became a republic in 1950. Subsequently, many other nations including [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Ghana]] and [[Singapore]] ceased to recognise the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch of the United Kingdom]] as their respective head of state, but recognised the British monarch as Head of the Commonwealth as members of the Commonwealth of Nations.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the commonwealth|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=The Foreign and Commonwealth office, UK|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref> 

The title is currently held by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], George VI's elder daughter. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], was appointed her designated successor at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018|2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].

==Title==
The title was devised in the [[London Declaration]] as a result of discussions at the [[1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/files/214257/FileName/TheLondonDeclaration1949.pdf| title=London Declaration 1949| publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat| access-date=2 April 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031216/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/files/214257/FileName/TheLondonDeclaration1949.pdf| archive-date=27 September 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> It is rendered in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Consortionis Populorum Princeps}}''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/uk/king_uk/elizabeth2.php |title=Biography of Elizabeth II (UK) |publisher=archontology.org}}</ref>

==Position==
The Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]], is recognised by the members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] as the "symbol of their free association" and serves as a leader, alongside the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] and [[Commonwealth Chair-in-Office]]. The Head of the Commonwealth does not, though, have any role in the governance of any Commonwealth state; Elizabeth's positions as monarch of each of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s are separate from that of Head of the Commonwealth.

The Head of the Commonwealth or a representative (such as [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]) attends the biennial [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), held at locations throughout the Commonwealth. This is a tradition begun by the monarch on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1973,<ref>{{Citation| last=Heinricks| first=Geoff| year=2001| publication-date=2001| contribution=Trudeau and the monarchy; National Post| contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/20080622173849/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2001/opinion.htm| title=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Winter/Spring 2000–2001| location=Toronto| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| access-date =26 February 2010}}</ref> when the CHOGM was first held in Canada. During the summit, the Head of the Commonwealth has a series of private meetings with Commonwealth countries' leaders, attends a CHOGM reception and dinner, and makes a general speech. The Queen or a representative is also present at the quadrennial [[Commonwealth Games]] and on every [[Commonwealth Day]], the second Monday in March, broadcasts a message to all member countries.

==History==
In 1949, King [[George VI]] was king of each of the countries that then comprised the British Commonwealth (later the Commonwealth of Nations): the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of India|India]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. However, the Indian Cabinet desired the country to become a republic, but not to leave the Commonwealth as a consequence of no longer having George VI as king, as happened to Ireland. To accommodate this, the [[London Declaration]], devised by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian prime minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]], stated that the King, as the symbol of the free association of the countries of the Commonwealth, was the Head of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/files/214257/FileName/TheLondonDeclaration1949.pdf| title=London Declaration| year=1949| publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat| access-date=29 July 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927031216/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/files/214257/FileName/TheLondonDeclaration1949.pdf| archive-date=27 September 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> When [[History of the Republic of India|India]] adopted [[Constitution of India|a republican constitution]] on 26 January 1950, George VI ceased to be [[Monarchy of India|its monarch]] (the [[President of India]], [[Rajendra Prasad]], became head of state), but it did regard him as Head of the Commonwealth.

Elizabeth II became Head of the Commonwealth on her accession in 1952, stating at the time, "[t]he Commonwealth bears no resemblance to the empires of the past. It is an entirely new conception built on the highest qualities of the spirit of man: friendship, loyalty, and the desire for freedom and peace."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34493/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/| title=Head of the Commonwealth| publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat| access-date=23 March 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331201736/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34493/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/| archive-date=31 March 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, a [[Royal Style and Titles Act]] was passed in each of the Commonwealth realms, adding for the first time the term ''Head of the Commonwealth'' to the monarch's titles.

In December 1960, the Queen had a [[Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II|personal flag]] created to symbolise her as Head of the Commonwealth and not associated with her role as queen of any particular country. Over time, the flag has replaced the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|British Royal Standard]] when the Queen visits Commonwealth countries of which she is not head of state (and thus does not possess a unique royal standard for that state) and on Commonwealth occasions in the United Kingdom. When the Queen visits the headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] in London, this personal standard—not any of her royal standards—is raised.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/Page5467.asp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119134240/http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/Page5467.asp| archive-date=19 November 2008| title=Mailbox| publisher=Royal Insight| page=3| date=September 2006}}</ref>

Former Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] said Elizabeth was a "behind the scenes force" in ending [[apartheid in South Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal| last=Geddes| first=John| title=The day she descended into the fray| journal=Maclean's| edition=Special Commemorative Edition: The Diamond Jubilee: Celebrating 60 Remarkable years| year=2012| page=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last1=MacQueen| first1=Ken| last2=Treble| first2=Patricia| title=The Jewel in the Crown| journal=Maclean's| edition=Special Commemorative Edition: The Diamond Jubilee: Celebrating 60 Remarkable years| year=2012| pages=43–44}}</ref>

===Succession===
By 2018, with the Queen in her 90s, and the position of "Head of the Commonwealth" not technically hereditary, talks as to whether or not [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] or someone else should become the third person to hold it had been going on for some time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43040240|title=Commonwealth in secret succession plans|first=James|last=Landale|date=13 February 2018|via=www.bbc.com|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> The [[London Declaration]] states that "The King [acts] as the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth", whereby both republics and kingdoms that are not Commonwealth realms can recognise the monarch as Head of the Commonwealth without accepting the person as the country's head of state. However, though each Commonwealth realm's laws on royal titles and styles make ''Head of the Commonwealth'' part of the [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Current|reigning monarch's full title]], and Queen Elizabeth II declared in 1958, through the [[Letters Patent]] creating her son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], as Prince of Wales, that Charles and his heirs and successors shall be future Heads of the Commonwealth,<ref>{{citation| url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/sites/royalcollection.org.uk/files/ra_warrants_cpw_1958.pdf| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| title=Letters Patent creating Prince Charles Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, 1958| publisher=Queen's Printer| access-date=3 June 2014}}</ref> there have been conflicting statements on how successors to the position of Head of the Commonwealth are chosen.

Commentators in British newspapers discussed whether it should be a one-off decision to elect Prince Charles to the Headship, whether the British monarch should automatically become head of the Commonwealth, or whether the post should be elected or chosen by consensus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/13/seven-decades-glad-handing-doesnt-prince-charles-deserve-lead/|title=After seven decades of slogging around the globe, doesn't Prince Charles deserve to lead the Commonwealth?|first=Harry|last=Mount|date=13 February 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/15/head-commonwealth-royal-brexit-britain-colonial-institution|title=The next head of the Commonwealth must not be a royal from Brexit Britain - Nalini Mohabir|first=Nalini|last=Mohabir|date=15 February 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/918495/Prince-Charles-NOT-king-head-of-Commonwealth-Queen-dies|title=Prince Charles 'might NOT be next head of Commonwealth if the Queen dies'|first=Richard|last=Palmer|date=13 February 2018}}</ref> There was also speculation that a rotating ceremonial "republican" headship might be instituted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/918359/The-Queen-news-death-succession-Commonwealth-royal-news-Prince-Charles-king|title='Disastrous consequences!'
