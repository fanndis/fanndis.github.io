'''Andrew William Stevenson Marr''' (born 31 July 1959)<ref name="whoswho">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.26659|title=Marr, Andrew William Stevenson, (born 31 July 1959), Presenter: Start The Week, Radio 4, since 2002; The Andrew Marr Show (formerly Sunday AM), BBC TV, since 2005|journal=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]|year=2007}}</ref> is a Scottish journalist and presenter for radio and television. Beginning his career as a political commentator, he subsequently edited ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper (1996–1998) and was political editor of [[BBC News]] (2000–2005).  He began hosting a political programme—''Sunday AM'', now called ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]''—on Sunday mornings on [[BBC One]] from September 2005.  In 2002, Marr took over as host of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s long-running ''[[Start the Week]]'' Monday morning discussion programme.

In 2007, he presented a political history of post-war Britain on [[BBC Two]], ''[[Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain]]'', followed by a [[prequel]] in 2009, ''[[Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain]]'', focusing on the period between 1901 and 1945. In 2010, he presented a series, ''Andrew Marr's Megacities'' (the title distinguishes it from another Megacities series), examining the life, development and challenges of some of the largest cities in the world.

In early 2012, he presented ''[[The Diamond Queen (TV programme)|The Diamond Queen]]'', a three-part series about the reign of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref name="BBCMediaCentre E1">{{cite web|title=The Diamond Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/06/The-Diamond-Queen.html|work=BBC Media Centre|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> In late September 2012, Marr began presenting ''[[Andrew Marr's History of the World]]'', a series examining the history of human civilisation.

Following a [[stroke]] in January 2013, Marr was in hospital for two months. He returned to presenting ''The Andrew Marr Show'' on 1 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrew Marr to return to BBC Sunday show after stroke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23482003|publisher=BBC|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
Marr was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland<ref name="BBCbio">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7081002.stm|title=Meet Andrew Marr|date=13 April 2008|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> to Donald Marr, an investment trust manager, and his wife Valerie.

Regarding his political affiliations, he was formerly a [[Maoist]] and a member of the [[Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory]], an offshoot of the International-Communist League, now known as the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].  At Cambridge, Marr says he was a "raving [[Left-wing politics|leftie]]" who handed out copies of [[Mao Zedong]]'s ''[[Little Red Book]]'' and he acquired the nickname "[[Red (political adjective)#Use by political movements|Red]] Andy".<ref>White, Michael.

==Newspaper career==
Marr joined ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as a trainee and junior business reporter in 1981.  In 1984, he moved to London where he became a parliamentary correspondent for the newspaper, and then a political correspondent in 1986.  Marr met the political journalist [[Anthony Bevins]], who became his mentor and close friend.  Bevins was responsible for Marr's first appointment at ''[[The Independent]]'' as a member of the newspaper's launch staff, also in 1986.

Marr left shortly afterwards, and joined ''[[The Economist]]'', where he contributed to the weekly "Bagehot" political column and ultimately became the magazine's political editor in 1988. Marr has remarked that his time at ''The Economist'' "changed me quite a lot" and "made me question a lot of my assumptions".<ref name="findarticles.com">Paul Vallely [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20021102/ai_n12650308 "Profile: Andrew Marr – On a roll: the BBC's all-action, 24-hour [...&#93;"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222004640/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20021102/ai_n12650308 |date=22 December 2007 }} ''The Independent'', 2 November 2002. Retrieved on 28 April 2006.</ref>

Marr returned to ''The Independent'' as the newspaper's political editor in 1992, and became its editor in 1996 during a particularly turbulent time at the paper.  Faced with price cutting by the [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]]-owned ''[[The Times|Times]]'', sales had begun to decline, and Marr made two attempts to arrest the slide.  He made use of bold 'poster-style' front pages, and then in 1996 radically re-designed the paper along a mainland European model, with [[Gill Sans]] headline fonts, and stories being grouped together by subject matter, rather than according to strict news value.  This tinkering ultimately proved disastrous.  With a limited advertising budget, the re-launch struggled for attention, then was mocked for reinterpreting its original marketing slogan 'It Is – Are You' to read 'It's changed – have you?'.

At the beginning of 1998, Marr was sacked, according to one version of events, for having refused to reduce the newspaper's production staff to just five subeditors.<ref name="Cozens">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/sep/03/theindependent.pressandpublishing1 |work=The Guardian |first=Claire |last=Cozens |title=Marr: tabloid Independent was my idea |date=3 September 2004}}</ref> According to [[Nick Cohen]]'s account, the sacking was due to the intervention of [[Alastair Campbell]], director of communications for [[Tony Blair]]. Campbell had demanded that [[David Montgomery (newspaper executive)|David Montgomery]], the paper's publisher, fire Marr over an article in which he had compared Blair with his predecessor [[John Major]]. This article had followed an earlier one by Blair published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', in which Blair had written: "On the day we remember the legend that St George slayed a dragon to protect England, some will argue that there is another dragon to be slayed: Europe." Marr's response asserted that Blair had spoken in bad faith, opportunistically championing Europe to pro-EU audiences while criticising it to anti-EU ones; and that the phrase "some will argue" was Blair's disingenuous rhetorical ruse to distance himself from the xenophobic appeal that he himself was making.<ref>Nick Cohen ''Cruel Britannia: Reports on the Sinister and the Preposterous'', London: Verso, 1999, p.154</ref>

Three months later, Marr returned to ''The Independent''. [[Tony O'Reilly]] had increased his stake in the paper and bought out owners, the [[Mirror Group]]. O'Reilly, who had a high regard for Marr, asked him to collaborate as co-editor with [[Rosie Boycott]], in an arrangement whereby Marr would edit the comment pages, and Boycott would have overall control of the news pages.<ref name="Cozens" />

Many [[pundit (expert)|pundit]]s predicted the arrangement would not last and two months later, Boycott left to replace [[Richard Addis]] as editor of the ''[[Daily Express]]''. Marr was sole editor again, but only for one week. [[Simon Kelner]], who had worked on the paper when it was first launched, accepted the editorship and asked Marr to stay on as a political columnist. Kelner was not Marr's "cup of tea", Marr observed later, and he left the paper for the last time in May 1998.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=Andrew|title=My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-41192-9|page=205}}</ref>

Marr was then a columnist for the ''Daily Express'' and ''[[The Observer]]''. Marr presented a three-part television series shown on BBC Two from 31 January to 2 February 2000 after ''Newsnight''. A state-of-the-nation reflection, ''The Day Britain Died'' (2000) also had an accompanying book. Among Marr's other publications is ''My Trade: A Short History of British Journalism'' (2004).

==At the BBC==

===Political editor===
Marr was appointed BBC political editor in May 2000. Among his personal scoops as Political Editor were the second resignation of [[Peter Mandelson]], and the interview in late 2004 in which [[Tony Blair]] told him that he would not seek a fourth term as prime minister should he win the forthcoming general election. During his time as political editor, Marr assumed various presentational roles, and announced in 2005 that following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 General Election]], he would step down as political editor to spend more time with his family. He was succeeded as political editor by [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]].

In September 2009 on the Sunday before the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference#2009 Brighton|Labour Party conference in Brighton]], Marr interviewed Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]. Towards the end of the interview, Marr told Brown he wanted to ask about:
{{cquote|Something everybody has been talking about in the Westminster village... A lot of people in this country use prescription painkillers and pills to help them get through. Are you one of them?}}
The Prime Minister responded: "No. I think this is the sort of questioning which is all too often entering the lexicon of British politics."

In 2012, Marr presented an eight-part series on BBC One entitled ''[[Andrew Marr's History of the World]]'', in conjunction with the [[Open University]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/tv/ou-on-the-bbc-andrew-marrs-history-the-world |title=OU on the BBC: Andrew Marr's History of the World |publisher=Open University |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>

Following [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] on 8 April 2013, Marr narrated a memorial documentary, ''Margaret Thatcher: Prime Minister''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/09/lady-thatcher-tv-tributes | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | work=The Guardian | title=Lady Thatcher TV tributes draw fewer than 3m viewers | date=9 April 2013}}</ref>

On an 8 April 2018, BBC Sunday news programme Marr said "lots of Palestinian kids" were killed by Israeli forces. [[Jonathan Sacerdoti]] complained that the statement was misleading and false. BBC management ruled that Marr breached editorial guidelines, that the statement lacked any evidence and "risked misleading audiences on a material point".<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC finds comment on Israel and Gaza was 'misleading' - Diaspora - Jerusalem Post |url=https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/BBC-finds-comment-on-Israel-and-Gaza-was-misleading-560733 |accessdate=12 May 2019 |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=24 June 2018}}</ref>

Marr portrayed himself in the 2018 BBC series ''[[Bodyguard (UK TV series)|Bodyguard]]'', interviewing [[Keeley Hawes]]' character Julie Montague, and wrote an opinion piece for ''[[The Guardian]]'' about his decision to do so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=Why I played myself interviewing Keeley Hawes in Bodyguard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/30/playing-myself-bodyguard-andrew-marr-jed-mercurio |accessdate=12 May 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

On 1 December 2019, Marr interviewed British Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] and discussed Islamic terrorist [[Usman Khan (terrorist)|Usman Khan]], perpetrator of the [[2019 London Bridge stabbing]]. Marr claimed the government had done nothing since 2010 to tighten the rules on sentencing for terrorist offences, implying that Johnson could have stopped Khan's early release. In reality, Johnson's government had lengthened the minimum early release, and in Khan's case any legislation would have need to be retrospective anyhow. The BBC Editorial Complaints Unit therefore found that Marr had misled viewers on two counts.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/ecu/the-andrew-marr-show-bbc-one-1-december-2019 The Andrew Marr Show, BBC One, 1 December 2019 | Contact the BBC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Politics==
Marr has written about the need to remain impartial and "studiously neutral" whilst delivering news reports and "convey fact, and nothing more".<ref>{{cite book | last =Marr | first =Andrew | title = My Trade: A short history of British Journalism | publisher = Macmillan | year =2004 | page =279}}</ref>

In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', in 2007, he said that he was a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] when discussing his conflicting views on [[Smoking ban in England|smoking bans]].<ref>{{cite news | location=London | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3638787/Britain-could-be-in-for-some-turbulent-times.html | accessdate = 26 September 2015 | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Britain could be in for some turbulent times | first=Andrew | last=Marr | date=28 March 2007 | quote = I suppose what unites Scotland and the Underground is the smoking ban, which will reach the rest of England in July. It still seems vaguely unimaginable. As a libertarian who is an anti-smoker, I don't quite know what to think, except that as soon as the ban starts it is clearly my civic duty to get down the pub a lot more.
}}</ref> Writing in ''The Guardian'' in 1999, he defined  himself as a "pampered white [[Social liberalism|liberal]]" and said that:
{{quote|... though teachers are the most effective anti-racist campaigners in the country, this means more than education in other religions it means a form of political education. Only people who understand the economic forces changing their world, threatening them but also creating new opportunities, have a chance of being immune to the old tribal chants. And the final answer, frankly, is the vigorous use of state power to coerce and repress. It may be my [[Presbyterian]] background, but I firmly believe that repression can be a great, civilising instrument for good. Stamp hard on certain 'natural' beliefs for long enough and you can almost kill them off. The police are first in line to be burdened further, but a new Race Relations Act will impose the will of the state on millions of other lives too.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/28/lawrence.ukcrime4 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Poor?

At an October 2006, BBC seminar discussing impartiality, Marr highlighted [[Criticism of the BBC|alleged bias within the BBC]]. He stated: "The BBC is not impartial or neutral. It's a publicly funded, urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people, ethnic minorities, and gay people. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3633619/The-BBCs-commitment-to-bias-is-no-laughing-matter.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tom | last=Leonard | title=The BBC's commitment to bias is no laughing matter | date=27 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6764779.stm | work=BBC News | first=Torin | last=Douglas | title=Does the BBC have a bias problem? | date=18 June 2007}}</ref>

In March 2014, Marr was criticised for allegedly expressing his own opinion on an independent Scotland's membership of the EU while interviewing Scottish politician [[Alex Salmond]] on BBC Television.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/10701331/Andrew-Marr-accused-of-bias-over-Scottish-independence.html|title=Andrew Marr accused of bias over Scottish independence|date=16 March 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>

In the ''[[New Statesman]]'' during 2015, Marr expressed the opinion that the new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] may be electable and that [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leaders recognise this. Marr wrote, "Here and now, in 2015, we know diddly-squat." At that time Marr considered a Labour election victory under Corbyn unlikely.<ref>''[[New Statesman]]'' (London) 17 September 2015 [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2015/09/between-revolution-and-reform-challenge-facing-jeremy-corbyn Between revolution and reform: the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn]</ref>
