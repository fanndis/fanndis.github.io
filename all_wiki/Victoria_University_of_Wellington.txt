Victoria is named after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], as 1897 was the 60th anniversary of her coronation. There was a dispute initially as to where to site it, and it opened in temporary facilities in Thorndon. It was eventually decided to place it in [[Kelburn, New Zealand|Kelburn]], where it still has its primary campus. This decision was influenced by the [[Wellington Cable Car|Cable Car company]]'s offer of a donation of £1,000 if it were located in Kelburn so that students would patronise the Cable Car from the city.<ref name="bar99-1">{{cite book|title=Victoria University of Wellington 1899 ~ 1999 A History|last=Barrowman|first=Rachel|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BarVict-c1.html#n25|accessdate=2008-04-14|year=1999|publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0-86473-369-0|page=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302150915/http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BarVict-c1.html#n25|archive-date=2 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of [[Richard Seddon|Seddon]], who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bourke |first= Kevin |title= Kelburn, King Dick and the Kelly Gang: Richard Seddon & Political Patronage |year= 2008 |publisher= Hit or Miss Publishing |location= Wellington |isbn= 978-0-473-13450-1 |pages= 81–84 }}</ref>

The foundation stone of the historic [[Hunter Building]] was laid in 1904. The original name was '''Victoria University College''', but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or "Vic" became the Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees.

An extramural branch was founded at [[Palmerston North]] in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became [[Massey University]] on 1 January 1964.<ref name="mas07-1">{{cite web|title=Massey University history|url=http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=2008-04-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218042620/http://calendar.massey.ac.nz/information/mu.htm#history <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-02-18}}</ref>

In 2004, Victoria celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building.

Victoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in [[Te Aro]] (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar.

In 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.<ref>{{cite web|title = Victoria University expands its presence in Auckland|url = http://www.victoria.ac.nz/news/2015/04/victoria-university-expands-its-presence-in-auckland|accessdate = 2015-06-17|quote = Victoria University of Wellington is opening expanded premises in Auckland, providing a central city base to service growing demand for its courses and expertise.|date = 16 April 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170607215018/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/news/2015/04/victoria-university-expands-its-presence-in-auckland|archive-date = 7 June 2017|url-status = live}}</ref>

On 24 September 2018 Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The Council also voted to adopt the new [[Māori language|Māori name]] of ''Te Herenga Waka''. The University's Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticized the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Pavious-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as "one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential".<ref>{{cite news |last1= Long |first1= Jessica |title= Wellington's Victoria University votes to change its name to University of Wellington |accessdate= 27 September 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |work= [[The Dominion Post (New Zealand)|The Dominion Post]] |date= 24 September 2018|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/107262536/wellingtons-victoria-university-will-change-its-name-to-university-of-wellington|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181207002509/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/107262536/wellingtons-victoria-university-will-change-its-name-to-university-of-wellington|archive-date= 7 December 2018}}</ref><ref name="RNZ 24 Sep 2018" /> The Council would submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education to make the final decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.victoria.ac.nz/about/victorias-story/name-simplification|title= Name simplification|work= Victoria University of Wellington|language= en|access-date= 2018-09-20|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180920162603/https://www.victoria.ac.nz/about/victorias-story/name-simplification|archive-date= 20 September 2018|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="RNZ 24 Sep 2018" />

On 18 December 2018 the Minister for Education, [[Chris Hipkins]], announced that he had rejected the University Council's recommendation, stating that the proposed change did not have sufficient support from Victoria's staff, students or alumni, and that such a change would not be in keeping with institution accountability or be in the national interest.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Long |first1= Jessica |last2= Williams |first2= Katarina |title= Victoria University of Wellington name change rejected by Minister |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/109441495/victoria-university-of-wellington-name-change-rejected-by-minister |accessdate= 21 March 2019 |work= [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date= 19 December 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190305132935/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/109441495/victoria-university-of-wellington-name-change-rejected-by-minister |archive-date= 5 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Victoria University of Wellington name change declined by education minister |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/378534/victoria-university-of-wellington-name-change-declined-by-education-minister |accessdate= 21 March 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date= 18 December 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190131165534/https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/378534/victoria-university-of-wellington-name-change-declined-by-education-minister|archive-date= 31 January 2019}}</ref> On 6 May 2019 Victoria University's Council announced that it would not contest the Education Minister's decision to reject its name-change proposal.

In 2012 a Facebook page that is associated with Victoria University of Wellington students, [https://www.facebook.com/groups/overheardvic/ ''Overheard @ Vic''], was in the media for the many rape comments that were made.<ref name="Kavanagh-Hall">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/7860178/Rape-Crisis-appalled-by-sick-jokes|title=Rape Crisis appalled by 'sick jokes'|last=Kavanagh-Hall|first=Erin|date=2012-10-25|work=Stuff.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2016-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104152322/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/7860178/Rape-Crisis-appalled-by-sick-jokes|archive-date=4 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> These included comments like "you've got to rape the paper, man, you can't let the paper rape you" and "at least ugly girls don't get raped".<ref name="Kavanagh-Hall"/> In response to this, a spokesperson for Victoria University of Wellington said that "student safety was a key focus, and the university had partnered with police and Wellington City Council to promote awareness of personal safety".<ref name="Kavanagh-Hall"/>

In 2010 there was widespread condemnation of Victoria University of Wellington removing the Gender Studies department.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4407891/Axing-gender-studies-setback-to-rights|title=Axing gender studies 'setback to rights'|last=Fisher|first=Amanda|date=2010-12-01|work=Stuff.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2016-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017172254/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4407891/Axing-gender-studies-setback-to-rights|archive-date=17 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, a minor in Gender Studies was made available.

In April 2020, during the [[COVID-19]] outbreak, the university came under fire from students, politicians, and media for suddenly announcing at 48 hours notice that they would be charging students a "placeholder fee" ($150 per week) for student accommodation that they had been forcibly removed from, despite emails from the university previously telling those same students that they would not have to pay. Instead ensuring that the university kept its word regarding their initial claims about there being no fee payments (which many students are unable to afford due to losing part-time jobs), Vice Chancellor Grant Guilford threatened to fire staff from the university if the students failed to comply.<ref>https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/victoria-university-students-blindsided-student-accommodation-holding-fee accessed 27/04/2020</ref><ref>https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/university-staff-may-fired-if-student-accommodation-holding-fees-arent-paid-victoria-vice-chancellor accessed 27/04/2020</ref><ref>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/415141/victoria-university-students-pay-fee-for-rooms-they-cannot-access</ref>
