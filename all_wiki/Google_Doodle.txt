[[File:The first Google Doodle.png|thumb|350px|The first Google Doodle, on August 30, 1998, celebrated [[Burning Man]]|alt=Jubillee]]
A '''Google Doodle''' is a special, temporary alteration of the [[Google logo|logo]] on [[Google]]'s [[home page|homepage]]s intended to commemorate [[holiday]]s, events, achievements, and notable historical figures. The first Google [[Doodle]] honored the 1998 edition of the long-running annual [[Burning Man]] event in [[Black Rock City, Nevada]], and was designed by co-founders [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodle4google/history.html |title=Doodle 4 Google |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/burning-man-festival |title=Burning Man Festival |date=August 30, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Megan |first1=Garber |title=The First Google Doodle Was a Burning Man Stick Figure |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-first-google-doodle-was-a-burning-man-stick-figure/279416/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref> Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor until 2001, when Page and Brin asked [[public relations officer]] [[Dennis Hwang]] to design a logo for [[Bastille Day]]. Since then, a team of employees called "'''Doodlers'''"<!-- Bold per MOS:BOLDSYN --> have organized and published the Doodles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/12/meet-people-behind-google-doodles-logo|title=Meet the people behind the Google Doodles|work=The Guardian|date=April 12, 2014|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

Initially, Doodles were neither animated nor [[hyperlink]]ed—they were simply images with [[hover text]] describing the subject or expressing a holiday greeting. Doodles increased in both frequency and complexity by the beginning of the 2010s. In January 2010 the first animated Doodle honored [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6933008/Isaac-Newtons-birth-marked-by-Google-Doodle.html|work=The Telegraph|date=January 4, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2014|title=Isaac Newton's birth marked by Google Doodle}}</ref> The first interactive Doodle appeared shortly thereafter celebrating ''[[Pac-Man]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nelson |first=Randy |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/05/21/google-celebrates-pac-mans-30th-with-playable-logo/ |title=Google celebrates Pac-Man's 30th anniversary with playable logo |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 21, 2010 |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref> and hyperlinks also began to be added to Doodles, usually linking to a [[search engine results page|search results]] page for the subject of the Doodle.

==Interactive and video doodles==
[[File:Pacman10-hp.png|thumb|Google's interactive Pac-Man logo]]
In May 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the 1980 [[arcade game]] ''[[Pac-Man]]'', Google unveiled worldwide their first [[interactive media|interactive logo]], created in association with [[Namco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-20005528-52.html |title=Google gets Pac-Man fever |author=Daniel Terdiman |date=May 21, 2010 |work=Geek Gestalt |publisher=CNET |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref> Anyone who visited Google could play Pac-Man on the logo, which featured the letters of the word "Google" on the Pac-Man maze. The logo also mimicked the sounds the original arcade game made. The "[[I'm Feeling Lucky]]" button was replaced with an "Insert Coin" button. Pressing this once enabled you to play the Pac-Man logo. Pressing it once more added a second player, [[Ms. Pac-Man]], enabling two players to play at once, controlled using the W, A, S, D keys, instead of the arrows as used by Player 1. Pressing it for a third time performed an "I'm Feeling Lucky" search. It was then removed on May 23, 2010, initially replacing Pac-Man with the normal logo. Later on that day, Google released<ref name="released">{{cite web|last=Mayer |first=Marissa |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/pac-man-rules.html |work=Official Google Blog |title=PAC-MAN rules! |via=Blogspot|date=May 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> a [https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man permanent site to play Google Pac-Man (accessed by clicking on top icon)], due to the popular user demand for the playable logo.<ref name="released" /> ''Pac-Man Doodle'' drew an estimated 1{{nbsp}}billion players worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fricker |first=Martin |title=Google gives Pac-Man boost with over 1 billion playing Goggle Doodle game in three days |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/google-gives-pac-man-boost-with-over-223613 |work=Mirror Online |date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> 

Since that time, Google has continued to post occasional interactive and video doodles:

* Google displayed an interactive electric guitar doodle starting June 9, 2011, to celebrate the would-be 96th birthday of [[Les Paul]]. Apart from being able to hover the cursor over the doodle to strum the strings just like one of Les Paul's [[Gibson guitars]], there was also a keyboard button, which when enabled allowed interaction with the doodle via the keyboard. The doodle still maintained some resemblance to the Google logo. In the U.S, the doodle also allowed the user to record a 30-second clip, after which a URL is created and can be sent to others. The doodle remained on the site an extra day due to popularity in the U.S. It now has its own page linked to the Google Doodles archives.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jun/09/google-doodle-les-paul |title=Les Paul: Google's best doodle yet? |work=The Guardian |date=June 9, 2011 |author=Jemima Kiss |accessdate=June 9, 2011 }}</ref>
*On May 23, 2012, for what would have been instrument inventor and synthesizer pioneer [[Robert Moog]]’s 78th birthday, the Doodle team pulled off their own feat of engineering: a fully playable and recordable Google logo resembling a vintage [[Minimoog]] Model D synthesizer. Electronic analog [[Moog synthesizer|Moog Synthesizer]] timbre and tones would come to define a generation of music, featuring heavily in songs by The Beatles, The Doors, Stevie Wonder, Kraftwerk and many others. Much like the musical machines Bob Moog created, this doodle was synthesized from a number of smaller components to form a unique instrument. Mouse or computer keyboard was used to control the mini-synthesizer’s keys and knobs and fiddle with oscillators and envelopes.

==Controversy and criticism==
{{see also|Criticism of Google}}

On September 13, 2007, Google posted a doodle honoring author [[Roald Dahl]] on the anniversary of his birth. This date also happened to coincide with the first day of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] holiday of [[Rosh Hashanah]], and Google was immediately criticized by some groups for this decision due to the fact that Dahl has been accused of anti-Semitism. <sup>[citation needed]</sup> Google removed the Doodle by 2:00&nbsp;p.m. that day, and there remains no evidence of its existence in Google's official Doodle archive to this date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/national/google-criticized-for-honoring-anti-israel-author/62602/|title=Google Criticized for Honoring 'Anti-Israel' Author on Rosh Hashanah|author=Brown, Eliot|date=September 13, 2007|work=New York Sun|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles?q=Roald%20Dahl|title=Google Doodles}}</ref>

In 2007, Google was also criticized for not featuring versions of the Google logo for American [[patriotism|patriotic]] holidays such as [[Memorial Day]] and [[Veterans Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google9oct09,0,2321354.story?coll=la-home-center|title=Tweaks send Google critics into orbit|author=Puzzanghera, Jim|date=October 9, 2007|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Google featured a logo commemorating Veterans Day that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/holidaylogos07.html|title=More Google: Holiday Logos|date=|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

In 2014, Google received some criticism for failing to honor the 70th anniversary of the [[D-Day]] invasion with a Doodle and instead honoring Japanese [[Go (game)|Go]] player [[Honinbo Shusaku]].<ref name="dday">Mulshine, Molly [http://betabeat.com/2014/06/doh-google-deletes-non-d-day-doodle/ "D'oh: Google Deletes Non-D-Day Doodle{{spaced ndash}} They accidentally honored a Japanese Go player instead"]  ''The New York Observer'', June 6, 2015; Retrieved June 17, 2015</ref> In response to the criticism, Google removed the logo from their homepage and added a series of links to images of the invasion of [[Normandy]].<ref name="dday" />

On May 19, 2016, Google honored [[Yuri Kochiyama]], an Asian American activist and member of the [[Maoism|Maoist]]-based [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] group [[Revolutionary Action Movement]], with a Doodle on its main U.S. homepage.<ref name="Vox">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/19/11713686/yuri-kochiyama|title=Yuri Kochiyama, today's Google Doodle, fought for civil rights — and praised Osama bin Laden|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=May 19, 2016|publisher=Vox|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="WaPo">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/19/google-commemorates-a-very-controversial-civil-rights-figure-yuri-kochiyama/|title=Google commemorates a very controversial civil-rights figure, Yuri Kochiyama|last=Ross|first=Janell|date=May 19, 2016|work= Washington Post|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref> This choice was criticized due to some of Kochiyama's controversial opinions, such as an admiration for [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name="Vox" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recode.net/2016/5/19/11713478/google-civil-rights-yuri-kochiyama-radicalism|title=Google celebrated civil rights leader Yuri Kochiyama and some people think it's promoting radicalism|last1=Lee|first1=Edmund|date=May 19, 2016|website=Recode|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref> U.S. Senator [[Pat Toomey]] called for a public apology from Google.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/280674-gop-senator-knocks-google-for-celebrating-controversial-civil-rights|title=GOP senator slams Google for tribute to controversial civil rights figure|last=Trujillo|first=Mario|date=May 20, 2016|work=The Hill]|accessdate=May 28, 2016}}</ref> Google did not respond to any criticism, nor did it alter the presentation of the Doodle on its homepage or on the Doodle's dedicated page.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yuri Kochiyama's 95th Birthday|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/yuri-kochiyamas-95th-birthday|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=May 19, 2016}}</ref>

=== Gender ===
In 2014, a report published by [[SPARK Movement]], an activist organization, stated that there was a large gender and race imbalance in the number of Doodles shown by Google, and that most Doodles were honoring white males.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparkmovement.org/doodleus/|title=#DoodleUs: Gender & Race in Google Doodles|last=|first=|date=|website=SPARK Movement|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref> The report was widely reported in the media, and Google made a commitment to increase the proportion of women and racial minorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/04/living/google-doodles-diversity/index.html|title=Why you're seeing more women and people of color Google Doodles|first=Emanuella |last=Grinberg|publisher=CNN|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2015/03/23/google-and-spark-are-putting-notable-women-on-the-map/|title=Google and SPARK put Notable Women on the Map|last=Connolly|first=Amanda|date=March 23, 2015|work=The Next Web|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref>

===Religious holidays===
Google typically abstains from referencing or celebrating [[religious holiday]]s specifically in Doodles, or in cases when they do, [[religion|religious themes]] and [[icon]]ography are avoided. Google has acknowledged this as an official policy, stating in April 2018 that they "don't have Doodles for religious holidays", according to "current Doodle guidelines." Google further explained that Doodles may appear for some "non-religious celebrations that have grown out of religious holidays", citing [[Valentine's Day]] (Christianity), [[Holi]] (Hinduism), and [[Tu B'Av]] (Judaism) as examples, but that the company does not include "religious imagery or symbolism" as part of those Doodles.<ref name="FoxEaster">{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/01/google-snubbed-easter-with-no-doodle-for-18th-year-in-row-christians-say.html|title=Google snubbed Easter with no doodle for 18th year in a row|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 2, 2018|date=April 1, 2018|last=Miles|first=Frank}}</ref>

Google has been criticized for what has been perceived as its inconsistency regarding the implementation of its religious holiday policy, notably its lack of Doodles for major [[Christianity|Christian]] holidays. Critics have pointed to its yearly recognition of the Jewish and Hindu festivals of Tu B'av and Holi, while Easter only received an official Doodle once in 2000 (and a themed homepage in 2019).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/4151594/no-google-doodle-for-easter-google-snubs-easter-for-17th-year-in-a-row/|title=No Google Doodle For Easter: Google Snubs Easter For 17th Year In A Row|date=April 17, 2017|work=The Inquisitr|access-date=April 1, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Easter2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/theres-hidden-easter-egg-googles-14433100|title=There's a hidden 'Easter egg' on Google's UK home page today - here's how to find it|last=Curtis|first=Sophie|work=Mirror Online|accessdate=April 21, 2019|date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> [[Christmas]] is not specifically celebrated by name,{{efn|name=Xmas}} although a Doodle with a seasonally festive and/or winter theme has always been present on December 25 since 1999. Since the mid-2010s, Google has also repeated their December 25 doodle on January 7, which is the date for Christmas [[Christmas#Date according to Julian calendar|in the Eastern Orthodox Church]], but the word "Christmas" has never explicitly been used; the terminology "holidays" and "Eastern Europe" are used instead of "Christmas" or "Eastern Orthodox Church".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/holiday-series-2-eastern-europe|title=Holiday Series 2 - Eastern Europe|accessdate=April 23, 2019|date=January 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/holidays-2016-eastern-europe|title=Holidays 2016 (Eastern Europe)|accessdate=April 23, 2019|date=January 7, 2016}}</ref>

====Easter====
Google first created a Doodle for [[Easter]] in 2000, and did not acknowledge the holiday on its homepage again until 2019. In March 2013, Google was criticized for celebrating American activist [[Cesar Chavez]] on Easter Sunday with a Doodle instead of Easter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/cesar-chavez-doodle-google-criticized-for-not-marking-easter-company-says-its-difficult-for-us-to-choose/2013/03/31/ce3da35a-9a3b-11e2-9bda-edd1a7fb557d_blog.html|title=Google criticized for not marking Easter; company says 'it's difficult for us to choose'| work =Washington Post |accessdate= June 17, 2015|date=March 31, 2013|last=Cavna|first=Michael}}</ref>

In 2019, after an 18-year hiatus, Google presented an atypical "Doodle" for Easter, for the [[desktop computer|desktop version]] of their homepage only. Unlike what is seen in virtually all other Doodles, the Google logo itself was unaltered in the presentation of the Doodle, and users had to click on the "[[Google Search#"I'm Feeling Lucky"|I'm Feeling Lucky]]" button where "Lucky" is replaced with an anthropomorphic Easter egg,<ref name="Easter2019" /> which triggered a falling array of Easter-themed items such as eggs, bunnies, and [[hot cross bun]]s. Some of these items were hyperlinked, leading to a detailed page about Easter customs. Google's official Doodle archive page originally contained an unlisted entry for the 2019 Easter Doodle, which has since been removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Notably, the 2019 Easter-themed homepage was not visible from [[mobile device]]s unless the "Desktop mode" option was triggered on the mobile browser, leading to the majority of users not ever seeing the "Doodle". [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]], technologist with Google involved with the Easter-themed homepage, responded to an inquiry about its absence on mobile by saying it was "hard to do the interactivity dependably [on mobile]".<ref>{{cite tweet |user=dannysullivan|number=1119992034864107522|date=April 21, 2019|title=I believe it's hard to do the interactivity dependably on mobile. I found requesting a desktop page on mobile can work though the tap targets don't always register|author=Danny Sullivan}}</ref>

In 2020, Google once again celebrated Easter atypically on its homepage, but not as a Doodle. An [[Easter egg]] was placed below the "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons, with hovertext indicating "Happy Easter".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/04/10/google-search-easter-eggs/|title=Google Search gains actual Easter eggs to mark Easter|accessdate=April 12, 2020|date=April 12, 2020|last=Li|first=Abner|website=9to5Google}}</ref> When clicked, the egg led to a search results page for "Easter". This is similar to how [[Memorial Day]] and [[Remembrance Day]] have been recognized by the company in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/memorial-day-google-flag-bing-23918.html|title=Memorial Day: Google Tiny Flag, Bing Arlington Cemetery & More|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|accessdate=April 12, 2020|date=May 29, 2017|website=Search Engine Roundtable}}</ref>
