[[File:Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signs the declaration of war against Japan on December 8, 1941]]
A [[declaration of war]] is a formal declaration issued by a national government indicating that a state of war exists between that nation and another.  The document [https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications] gives an extensive listing and summary of statutes which are automatically engaged upon the [[United States]] declaring war.

For the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article One, Section Eight]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] says "[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall have power to ... declare War." However, that passage provides no specific format for what form legislation must have in order to be considered a "[[declaration of war]]" nor does the Constitution itself use this term. In the courts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], in ''[[Doe v. Bush]]'', said: "[T]he text of the [[Iraq Resolution|October Resolution]] itself spells out justifications for a war and frames itself as an 'authorization' of such a war."<ref>{{cite web|title=''Doe v. Bush'', 03-1266, (March 13, 2003)|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1171416.html|work=FindLaw|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref> in effect saying an authorization suffices for declaration and what some may view as a formal Congressional "Declaration of War" was not required by the Constitution.

The last time the United States formally declared war, using specific terminology, on any nation was in 1942, when war was declared against [[Axis powers#Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact|Axis-allied]] Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, because President Franklin Roosevelt thought it was improper to engage in hostilities against a country without a formal declaration of war.  Since then, every American president has used military force without a declaration of war.<ref>Cooke, Alistair, ''Alistair Cooke's America'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1973.</ref>

This article will use the term "formal declaration of war" to mean Congressional legislation that uses the phrase "declaration of war" in the title. Elsewhere, this article will use the terms "authorized by Congress," "funded by Congress" or "undeclared war" to describe other such conflicts.

==History==
The United States has formally declared war against foreign nations five separate times, each upon prior request by the President of the United States. Four of those five declarations came after hostilities had begun.<ref name="Henderson2000">{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Phillip G. |title=The presidency then and now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zscghb2szdAC|year=2000|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9739-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zscghb2szdAC&pg=PA51 51]}}</ref> James Madison reported that in the Federal Convention of 1787, the phrase "make war" was changed to "declare war" in order to leave to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks but not to commence war without the explicit approval of Congress.<ref>''[https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_817.asp The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 reported by James Madison : August 17]'',The Avalon Project, [http://www.law.yale.edu Yale Law School], retrieved Feb 13, 2008</ref> Debate continues as to the legal extent of the President's authority in this regard. Public opposition to American involvement in foreign wars, particularly during the 1930s, was expressed as support for a Constitutional Amendment that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24200391|title=Petition for a Constitutional Amendment to Hold National Referendums on Declarations of War from Danville, Ohio|date=1938|publisher=The National Archives of the United States|access-date=July 29, 2016}}</ref> Several Constitutional Amendments, such as the [[Ludlow Amendment]], have been proposed that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.

After Congress repealed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in January 1971 and President [[Richard Nixon]] continued to wage war in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] ({{USPL|93|148}}) over the veto of Nixon in an attempt to rein in some of the president's claimed powers. The War Powers Resolution proscribes the only power of the president to wage war which is recognized by Congress.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=War Powers: Return to Congress|url=https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/03/01/war_powers_return_them_to_congress_113136.html|accessdate=2 March 2018|agency=RealClear Media Group|publisher=RealClearDefense|date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

==Declarations of war==

===Formal===
The table below lists the five wars in which the United States has formally declared war against eleven foreign nations.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/WarDeclarationsbyCongress.htm Official Declarations of War by Congress]</ref> The only country against which the United States has declared war more than once is Germany, against which the United States has declared war twice (though a case could be made for [[Hungary]] as a [[successor state]] to [[Austria-Hungary]]).

In World War II, the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], led respectively by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], declared war on the United States, and the U.S. Congress responded in kind.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3532000/3532401.stm BBC News, ''On This Day'']</ref><ref>Whereas the Government of Germany has formally declared war against the government and the people of the United States of America... the state of war between the United States and the Government of Germany which has thus been thrust upon the United States is hereby formally declared.

===Other undeclared wars===

On at least 125 occasions, the President has acted without prior express military authorization from Congress.<ref>[https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2001/09/31/op-olc-v025-p0188_0.pdf The President's Constitutional Authority To Conduct Military Operations Against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them]</ref> These include instances in which the United States fought in the [[Philippine–American War]] from 1898–1903, in [[Nicaragua]] in 1927, as well as the NATO bombing campaign of Yugoslavia in 1999, and the 2017 missile strikes on Syria.

The United States' longest war, against the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan, began in 2001 and is still ongoing {{as of|2020|lc=on}}.

The [[Indian Wars]] comprise at least 28 conflicts and engagements.  These localized conflicts, with Native Americans, began with European colonists coming to North America, long before the establishment of the United States. For the purpose of this discussion, the Indian Wars are defined as conflicts with the United States of America.  They begin as one front in the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775 and had concluded by 1918. The [[United States Army]] still maintains a [[Campaign streamers|campaign streamer]] for [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Pine Ridge 1890–1891]] despite opposition from certain Native American groups.<ref>[http://www.ncai.org/ncai/resource/documents/governance/wounkneeban.htm Army Continues to Parade Wounded Knee Battle Streamer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510063941/http://www.ncai.org/ncai/resource/documents/governance/wounkneeban.htm |date=May 10, 2010 }}, [http://www.ncai.org National Congress of American Indians].</ref>

The [[American Civil War]] was not an international conflict under the laws of war, because the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) was not a government that had been granted full diplomatic recognition as a [[sovereignty|sovereign nation]] by other sovereign states<ref name="history-state-gov">{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy |title=Preventing Diplomatic Recognition of the Confederacy, 1861–1865 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828005906/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/Confederacy |archive-date=August 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="McPherson">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195313666|url-access=registration|quote=confederacy recognition.|title=This Mighty Scourge: Perspectives on the Civil War |first=James M. |last=McPherson |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-531366-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195313666/page/65 65]}}</ref> or by the government of the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Julius Goebel|title=The Recognition Policy of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZkrAQAAMAAJ|year=1915|publisher=Columbia University|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZkrAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA172 172–174]|quote=The Confederate States did not constitute a new state and they were not independent, hence they were not entitled to treatment by the United States as a foreign state.}}</ref>

==The War Powers Resolution==
{{main|War Powers Resolution}}
In 1973, following the withdrawal of most American troops from the Vietnam War, a debate emerged about the extent of presidential power in deploying troops without a declaration of war. A compromise in the debate was reached with the [[War Powers Resolution]]. This act clearly defined how many soldiers could be deployed by the President of the United States and for how long. It also required formal reports by the President to Congress regarding the status of such deployments, and limited the total amount of time that American forces could be deployed without a formal declaration of war.

Although the constitutionality of the act has never been tested, it is usually followed, most notably during the [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada Conflict]], the [[Operation Just Cause|Panamanian Conflict]], the [[Somalia Conflict]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], and the [[Iraq War]]{{clarify|date=August 2015}}.  The only exception was President Clinton's use of U.S. troops in the 78-day NATO air campaign against [[Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo#Kosovo War|Kosovo War]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  In all other cases, the President asserted the constitutional authority to commit troops without the necessity of Congressional approval, but in each case the President received Congressional authorization that satisfied the provisions of the War Powers Act.

On March 21, 2011, a number of lawmakers expressed concern that the decision of President Barack Obama to order the U.S. military to join in attacks of [[Libya]]n air defenses and government forces exceeded his constitutional authority because the decision to authorize the attack was made without Congressional permission.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/africa/22powers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss Obama Attacked for No Congressional Consent on Libya], [https://www.nytimes.com New York Times].</ref> Obama explained his rationale in a two-page letter, stating that as commander in chief, he had constitutional authority to authorize the strikes, which would be limited in scope and duration, and necessary to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Libya.
