===Elections===
{{See also|2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio#District 13}}
After [[Jim Traficant]] was convicted on criminal charges in 2002, Ryan declared his candidacy for the 17th district. As the result of [[redistricting]] following the 2000 [[census]], the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed to the west and now included much of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]] and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th district, represented by eight-term Democrat [[Thomas C. Sawyer|Tom Sawyer]]. The 14th had been eliminated in the year 2000 redistricting; most of it was drawn into the 13th district of fellow Democrat [[Sherrod Brown]], but Sawyer's home was drawn into the 17th. Ryan was initially seen as an underdog in a six-way Democratic primary that included Sawyer.<ref name="simonich"/>

In the 2002 Democratic primary, Ryan defeated Sawyer, who was seen as insufficiently labor-friendly in the newly drawn district. In the November 2002 general election, he faced Republican Insurance Commissioner [[Ann Womer Benjamin]] as well as Traficant, who ran as an independent from his prison cell.  Ryan won with 51 percent of the vote, besting Benjamin by a solid 14-point margin. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age. He has been reelected five times,<ref>[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2005/20050113mur.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701191103/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2005/20050113mur.html |date=July 1, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Dubail |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2008/04/congressman_tim_ryan_endorses_1.html |title=Congressman Tim Ryan endorses Clinton &#124; cleveland.com |website=Blog.cleveland.com |date=April 19, 2008 |access-date=December 26, 2015}}</ref> only once facing a contest nearly as close as his first. In 2010, he was held to 53 percent of the vote; Traficant, running as an independent, took 16 percent.  In every other election since his first run for the district, Ryan has won at least 67 percent of the vote.

His district was renumbered as the 13th in 2012 and was pushed westward, absorbing most of Akron.
