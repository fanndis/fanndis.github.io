'''''Der Tagesspiegel''''' (meaning '''''The Daily Mirror'''''; motto: ''"[[Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas|rerum cognoscere causas]]"'', or "to know the causes of things") is a German daily [[newspaper]]. It has regional correspondent offices in [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Potsdam]]. It is the only major newspaper in the capital to have increased its circulation, now 148,000, since [[German reunification|reunification]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==History and profile==
Founded on 27 September 1945 by Erik Reger, Walther Karsch and Edwin Redslob, the ''Tagesspiegel's'' main office is based in Berlin<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Tagesspiegel|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-information/34121-der-tagesspiegel|work=VoxEurop|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> at Askanischer Platz in the district of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]], less than a mile from [[Potsdamer Platz]] and the former location of the [[Berlin Wall]].

For more than 45 years, ''Der Tagesspiegel'' was owned by an independent [[Financial endowment|trust]]. In 1993, in response to an increasingly competitive publishing environment, and to attract investments required for technical modernisation, such as commission of a new printing plant, and improved distribution, it was bought by the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]. Its current publisher is Dieter von Holtzbrinck with [[editors in chief]] Stephan-Andreas Casdorff and {{Interlanguage link multi|Lorenz Maroldt|de}}. Lorenz Maroldt was noted for using the unfortunate phrase 'entartete' (degenerated, which has connotations to Nazi Germany) Werkstatt der Kulturen, when describing a multi-ethnic cultural institution in Berlin.<ref>[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=bt&dig=2009%2F09%2F03%2Fa0182&cHash=9ae8dec7e1 Erinnerung teilen ist schwer] ''taz.de''. 3 September 2009.</ref> Pierre Gerckens, [[Giovanni di Lorenzo]] and Hermann Rudolph are editors of the newspaper. Some of the notable writers include [[Bas Kast]] and [[Harald Martenstein]].

The paper's main readership is in the western half of the city, due to the 1948 blockade having stopped its circulation in [[East Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]]. The paper has recently been redesigned, introducing more color and a clearer [[typeface]].  In 2005 it was awarded the ''World's Best-Designed Newspapers'' Award by the ''[[Society for News Design]]'' in New York.  It is owned by Verlag Der Tagesspiegel [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]], a member of the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]], and associated with the ''[[The Wall Street Journal Special Editions|Wall Street Journal]]''. In 2009, [[Dieter von Holtzbrinck]] bought ''Der Tagesspiegel'' and ''[[Handelsblatt]]'' from Holtzbrinck.<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Tagesspiegel|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=549|work=Eurotopics|accessdate=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224092409/http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=549|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From 2005 to 2008, American journalist Michael Scaturro edited the English-language version of ''Der Tagesspiegel'', which was known as ''[[The Berlin Paper]]''.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article142250/Medien-Mit-Steingart-auf-dem-Sofa.html Medien mit Steingart auf dem Sofa] ''Welt''</ref>

In 2007 and 2008 ''Der Tagesspiegel'''s [[Washington D.C.]] correspondent, [[Christoph von Marschall]], was noted in both Germany and the United States for his coverage of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign. He wrote a book entitled ''[[Barack Obama – Der schwarze Kennedy]]''. The literal translation of its German title is "Barack Obama – the Black [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/RheinMain/CGBZ4|title=Barack Obama - The Black Kennedy?!|publisher=My.barackobama.com|accessdate=14 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603182505/https://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/RheinMain/CGBZ4|archive-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> His book was a bestseller in Germany, where other commentators had also compared the two Americans.<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/germanys-got-a-crush-on-obama/?scp=2&sq=Christoph%20von%20Marschall&st=cse Germany’s Got a Crush on Obama], The Caucus: New York Times politics blog, 6 January 2008</ref>
