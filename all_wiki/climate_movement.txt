The '''climate movement''' is the collective of [[nongovernmental]] organizations engaged in activism related to the issues of [[global warming|climate change]]. It is a subset of the broader [[environmental movement]], but some regard it as a new [[social movement]] itself given its scope, strength, and activities.

==History==
The climate movement has rapidly evolved in the first decades of the 21st century, starting as one of the many causes of the environmental movement.

Activism related to [[climate change]] began in the 1990s, when major environmental organizations became involved in the discussions about climate, mainly in the [[UNFCCC]] framework. In the 2000s several climate-specific organizations were founded, such as [[350.org]], [[Energy Action Coalition]], and the Global Call for Climate Action.

===Mobilization for Copenhagen 2009===
The [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate.<ref name="protest">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |title=Climate activists condemn Copenhagen police tactics |date=13 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215101510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |archivedate=15 December 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> And activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/24/international.climate.change.demonstrations/ | work=CNN | title=International day of demonstrations on climate change | date=26 October 2009}}</ref>

The climate movement convened its largest single event on 21 September 2014, when it mobilized 400,000 activists in New York during the People’s Climate March (plus several thousand more in other cities), organized by the [[People's Climate Movement]], to demand climate action from the global leaders gathered for the 2014 UN Climate Summit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3415162/peoples-climate-march-new-york-manhattan-demonstration/ |title=Hundreds of Thousands Converge on New York to Demand Climate-Change Action |publisher=time.com |accessdate=December 30, 2014 | location=New York | first=Charlotte | last=Alter | date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://peoplesclimate.org/wrap-up/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014061824/http://peoplesclimate.org/wrap-up/ |archive-date=2014-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Climate Mobilization===
{{Main|The Climate Mobilization}}
Since 2014, growing portions of the climate movement, especially in the United States have been organizing for an international economic response to climate change on the scale of the mobilization of the American [[home front during World War II]], with the goal of rapidly slashing carbon emissions and transitioning to 100% clean energy faster than the free market is likely to allow. Throughout 2015 and 2016, [[The Climate Mobilization]] led grassroots campaigns in the U.S. for this scale of ambition, and in July 2016, activists succeeded in getting text adopted into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s national platform calling for WWII-scale climate mobilization.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Russell|title=Beyond Paris: Finding the Courage to Face the Climate Emergency|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/07/19/beyond-paris-finding-courage-face-climate-emergency|work=CommonDreams|date=19 July 2016}}</ref> In August 2015, environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] published an article in the [[The New Republic|New Republic]] rallying Americans to "declare war on climate change."<ref>{{cite news|last1=McKibben|first1=Bill|title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii|work=New Republic|date=15 August 2016}}</ref>[[File:"FridaysForFuture" protest Berlin 14-12-2018 07.jpg|thumb|A [[school strike for climate]] in [[Berlin]] (2018).]]

==Roles of other movements==
The climate movement is closely connected to other parts of the environmental movement, in particular groups aiming for a sustainable society and [[sustainable energy]].
Also, the faith community has been active in the climate movement, both at an interfaith level (such as in Our Voices) and at the specific level of each denomination (such as the Global Catholic Climate Movement). With this movement, new youth international organizations have emerged to join the climate change movement such as [[Fridays For Future|Fridays for Future]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/about|title=About - FridaysForFuture|website=www.fridaysforfuture.org|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> or [[Extinction Rebellion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/|title=About Us|website=Extinction Rebellion|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref> 

== Methods ==
These are several approaches that have been used in the past by climate advocates and advocacy campaigns:

* the provision of information, 
* framing of information about aspects of global climate change, and
* challenging the terms of political debates.

All three of these methods have been implemented in climate campaigns aimed at the general public. The information about the impacts of global climate change plays a role in forming climatic beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, while the effects of other approaches (e.g. provision of information about solutions to GCC, consensus framing, use of mechanistic information) is yet mostly unknown.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skalík|first=Jan|last2=Chabada|first2=Tomáš|last3=Urban|first3=Jan|date=2018-12-28|title=Effects of information-based interventions and framing interventions on attitudes to climate change and mitigation behavior|url=https://envigogika.cuni.cz/index.php/Envigogika/article/view/563|journal=Envigogika|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|doi=10.14712/18023061.563|issn=1802-3061|doi-access=free}}</ref> The third approach is to create space for discussions that move beyond questions of economic interests that often dominate political debates to emphasize ecological values and grass-roots democracy. This has been argued to be crucial to bringing about more significant structural change.

==Targeting of activists==
The United States government through its domestic intelligence services targeted, as "domestic terrorists," environmental activists and climate change organizations, including by investigating them, questioning them, and placing them on national [[No fly list|"watchlist]]s" that makes it more difficult for them to board airplanes and that could instigate local law enforcement [[surveillance|monitoring]].<ref>The Guardian, 24 Sept. 2019, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/revealed-how-the-fbi-targeted-environmental-activists-in-domestic-terror-investigations?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other "Revealed: How the FBI Targeted Environmental Activists in Domestic Terror Investigations: Protesters Were Characterized as a Threat to National Security in What One Calls an Attempt to Criminalize their Actions"]</ref> Unknown actors also secretly hired professional hackers to launch [[phishing]] hacking attacks against climate activists who were organizing the [[ExxonMobil climate change controversy|
