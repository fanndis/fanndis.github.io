==History==
===Universal Cable Productions===
In July 2008, Universal Cable Productions was split off from [[Universal Television|Universal Media Studios]] (UMS) and placed into NBCUniversal's NBCU Cable Entertainment division.  The unit was placed under the direction of a management team consisting of five executives.  Originally, UCP was set up to produce shows for NBCU and other cable channels.<ref name="tvw"/>

Formerly at UMS, Doug Liman and Dave Bartis' Hypnotic Films & Television moved to UCP after a few shows were turned down at UMS.<ref name="dl">{{cite news |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |title=NBCU's UMS And UCP Are Branching Out To Produce For Broadcast And Cable Networks |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/06/nbcus-ums-and-ucp-are-branching-out-to-produce-for-broadcast-and-cable-networks/|accessdate=15 August 2012 |newspaper=Deadline Hollywood |date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> Hypnotic signed a two-year overall deal with UCP.<ref name="dl0">{{cite news |last=Andreeva|first=Nellie |title=MTV Greenlights 'Pants' Drama Pilot from Universal Cable Prods. & Doug Liman |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/mtv-greenlights-pants-drama-pilot/ |accessdate=15 August 2012|newspaper=Deadline Hollywood |date=August 5, 2010}}</ref>   Hypnotic produced ''[[Covert Affairs]]'' with UCP for USA Network, then ''[[I Just Want My Pants Back]]'', its first non-NBCU channel production, for [[MTV]].  With Hypnotic and a first chief operating officer hired, UCP has expanded enough that they are moving to produce shows for any network or channel, broadcast or cable.  Its NBCU Broadcasting counterpart, [[Universal Television]], has also moved to be a full-service TV studio.<ref name=dl/>

In July 2011 through its affiliated company, NBCUniversal Domestic TV Distribution, ''Psych'' and ''Monk'', UCP shows, have been picked up for off network syndication on [[Ion Television]].<ref name="dl1">{{cite news|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie |title=ION Acquires 'Psych', 'Monk' & 'House' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/07/ion-acquires-psych-monk-house/ |accessdate=15 August 2012 |newspaper=Deadline|date=July 27, 2011}}</ref>

UCP signed a "pod deal", a complete development deal that includes ownership of all projects making it impossible to shop a rejected project around, with Tagline.  A third pod deal was signed with [[Gale Anne Hurd]]'s [[Valhalla Entertainment]] in April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=James|first=Meg|title=Universal Cable Productions signs deal with Gale Anne Hurd|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/04/universal-cable-productions-lands-deal-with-gale-anne-hurd.html|accessdate=15 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 16, 2012}}</ref>  In July of that year, the company signed an exclusive development deal with [[John Legend]]'s Get Lifted Film Company.<ref>{{cite news|last=Obenson|first=Tambay A.|title=John Legend Entering TV Business; Signs Development Deal With Universal Cable|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/john-legend-entering-tv-business-signs-development-deal-with-universal-cable|accessdate=15 August 2012|newspaper=indiewire.com|date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

===Universal Content Productions===
In early 2019, Universal Cable Productions changed its name to Universal Content Productions to reflect the move to streaming, with production of ''Umbrella Academy'' for Netflix and NBCUniversal's streaming service, which was eventually named [[Peacock (streaming service)|Peacock]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title=Sam Esmail Renews Overall Deal With Universal Content Productions |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sam-esmail-renews-deal-universal-cable-productions-1184281 |accessdate=June 3, 2019 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 8, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In October 2019, Universal Content Productions, along with [[Universal Television]],  was transferred from [[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News|NBCUniversal Broadcast, Cable, Sports and News]] to [[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal Content Studios|NBCUniversal Content Studios]].<ref name=vty>{{cite news |last1=Littleton |first1=Cynthia |last2=Low |first2=Elaine |title=NBCUniversal Shakeup: Bonnie Hammer to Head Studios, Paul Telegdy Goes Solo at NBC |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/nbc-tv-restructuring-bonnie-hammer-paul-telegdy-1203361054/ |accessdate=October 8, 2019 |work=Variety |date=October 7, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

In February 2019, it was announced that writer/producer/director [[Sam Esmail]] had signed his production company Esmail Corp. to a four-year exclusive deal with UCP with whom he had already produced ''Mr. Robot'', ''Homecoming'', and ''Briarpatch''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/sam-esmail-overall-deal-universal-content-productions-mr-robot-homecoming-1202552446/|title=Sam Esmail Inks Massive New Overall Deal With Universal Content Productions|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2019-02-08|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>
