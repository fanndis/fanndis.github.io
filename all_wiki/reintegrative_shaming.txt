In [[criminology]], the '''reintegrative shaming''' theory emphasizes the importance of [[shame]] in [[criminal punishment]]. The theory holds that [[punishment]]s should focus on the [[offender]]'s behavior rather than characteristics of the offender. It was developed by [[Australian]] [[criminologist]] [[John Braithwaite (academic)|John Braithwaite]] at [[Australian National University]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~cohne/Theory%20S09/Ch%208%20-%20Reintegrative%20Shaming.pdf|title=Site locations changed|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/infores/restorative_justice/restorative_justice_ascii_pdf/ncj176347.txt</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Braithwaite | first = John | title = Crime, Shame, and Reintegration | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-521-35668-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyc-net.org/quote/quote-99.html|title=Quote of the Day|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sgt.

An example of reintegrative shaming can be found in the case of ''[[United States v. Gementera]],'' wherein a 24-year-old [[Mail robbery|mail thief]] was sentenced to, among other things, wear a [[sandwich board]] sign stating, "I stole mail; this is my punishment", while standing outside of a [[San Francisco]] postal facility.<ref>''Gementera'', 379 F.3d at 599.</ref>
