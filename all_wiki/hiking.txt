'''Hiking''' is a long, vigorous walk, usually on [[trails]] or [[footpaths]] in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious [[pilgrimage]]s have existed much longer but they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.

"Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "[[walking]]" is used in these regions for shorter, particularly [[urban area|urban]] walks. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] in the [[Alps]]. The word hiking is also often used in the UK, along with '''rambling''' (a slightly old-fashioned term), '''[[hillwalking]]''', and '''fell walking''' (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). The term '''bushwalking''' is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbw.org.au/About-Us|title=Sydney Bush Walkers Club's history}}</ref> In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is called [[Tramping in New Zealand|'''tramping''']].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=HW|last1=Orsman|title=The Dictionary of New Zealand English|location=Auckland|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-558347-7}}</ref> It is a popular activity with numerous [[:Category:Hiking organizations|hiking organizations]] worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/health/for-good-health-take-a-hike-3862|title=For Good Health: Take a Hike!|first=John|last=McKinney|work=Miller-McCune|date=2009-03-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429134930/http://www.miller-mccune.com/health/for-good-health-take-a-hike-3862/|archivedate=2011-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Step in the Right Direction: The health benefits of hiking and trails|url=http://atfiles.org/files/pdf/AHShealthben.pdf|publisher=American Hiking Society|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage is impeded, a [[machete]] is used to clear a pathway.

==History==
The poet [[Petrarch]] is frequently mentioned as an early example of someone hiking. Petrarch recounts that on April 26, 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of [[Mont Ventoux]] ({{convert|1912|m|ft|sp=us}}, a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity.<ref>[[Marjorie Hope Nicolson|Nicolson, Marjorie Hope]]; ''Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite'' (1997), p. 49; {{ISBN|0-295-97577-6}}</ref> The exploit is described in a celebrated letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]], composed some time after the fact.

[[Jakob Burckhardt]], in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (in German in 1860) declared Petrarch "a truly modern man", because of the significance of nature for his "receptive spirit"; even if he did not yet have the skill to describe nature.<ref>Burckhardt, ''Civilization'', Part IV §3, beginning.

However, the idea of taking a walk in the countryside only really developed during the 18th century in Europe, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature associated with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|editor-first=MH|editor-last=Abrams|volume=2|edition=7th|year=2000|pages=9–10|isbn=9780393963380}}</ref> In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rebecca|last=Solnit|title=Wanderlust: A History of Walking|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|isbn=0670882097}}</ref>{{rp|pp=83,297}} In previous centuries long walks were undertaken as part of religious pilgrimages and this tradition continues throughout the world.

=== German speaking world ===
The Swiss scientist and poet [[Albrecht von Haller]]'s  poem ''Die Alpen'' (1732) is an historically important early sign of an awakening appreciation of the mountains, though it is chiefly designed to contrast the simple and idyllic life of the inhabitants of the [[Alps]] with the corrupt and decadent existence of the dwellers in the plains{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=855}}

Numerous travellers explored Europe on foot in the last third of the 18th century and recorded their experiences. A significant example is [[Johann Gottfried Seume]], who set out on a foot from [[Leipzig]] to Sicily in 1801, and returned to Leipzig via Paris after nine months.<ref> Arnd Krüger: "Historie des Wanderns", in: A.

[[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English priest, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed <blockquote>to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.<ref name=West2>{{cite book |first=Thomas|last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |year=1780|page=2|isbn=9780371947258}}</ref> </blockquote> To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to enjoy the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.<ref name=development>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.<ref name=NPA>{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &mdash; Viewing Stations |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District National Park Authority |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212541/http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref>
 
[[File:Travels-map.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Map of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s walking route in the [[Cévennes]], France, taken from ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879), a pioneering classic of [[outdoor literature]].]]
Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the English poet [[William Wordsworth]]. In 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1850). His famous poem ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' was inspired by a visit to the [[Wye Valley]] made during a [[walking tour]] of [[Wales]] in 1798 with his sister [[Dorothy Wordsworth]]. Wordsworth's friend [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three-week tour of the Lake District. [[John Keats]], who belonged to the next generation of [[Romantic poets]] began, in June 1818, a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District with his friend Charles Armitage Brown.

More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th century, of which the most famous is probably [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s journey through the [[Cévennes]] in France with a donkey, recorded in his ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay "Walking Tours". The subgenre of [[travel writing]] produced many classics in the subsequent 20th century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist [[John Muir]]'s ''A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf'' (1916), a posthumously published account of a long botanizing walk, undertaken in 1867.

Due to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]], was privately owned and [[trespass]] was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the [[North of England|north]] and began politically campaigning for the legal '[[right to roam]]'. One of the first such clubs was 'Sunday Tramps' founded by Leslie White in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronized by the [[peerage]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenlandstr0000step|url-access=registration|title=Forbidden Land: The Struggle for Access to Mountain and Moorland|author=Stephenson, Tom|year=1989|publisher= Manchester University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/forbiddenlandstr0000step/page/78 78]|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>

Access to Mountains [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s, that would have legislated the public's 'right to roam' across some private land, were periodically presented to [[Parliament]] from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932, the Rambler’s Right Movement organized a [[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|mass trespass]] on [[Kinder Scout]] in [[Derbyshire]]. Despite attempts on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead, it was successfully achieved due to massive publicity. However, the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers' organizations, including [[The Ramblers]], who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Stephenson | first1=T. | last2=Holt | first2=A. | last3=Harding | first3=M. |chapter=The 1939 Access to Mountains Act | title=Forbidden Land: The Struggle for Access to Mountain and Moorland | publisher=Manchester University Press | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-7190-2966-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenlandstr0000step | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/forbiddenlandstr0000step/page/165 165] }}</ref>

The effort to improve access led after World War II to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in 1951 to the creation of the first [[national park]] in the UK, the [[Peak District National Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |title=Quarrying and mineral extraction in the Peak District National Park |publisher=Peak District National Park Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127055057/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/79227/factsheet4-quarrying.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}</ref> The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-52/kinder-trespass/|title=Kinder Trespass.

===United States===

{{See|Category:Hiking in the United States}}
An early example of an interest in hiking in the United States is [[Abel Crawford]] and his son Ethan's clearing of a trail to the summit of [[Mount Washington, New Hampshire]] in 1819.<ref>{{cite book|title=Condensed Facts About Mount Washington|publisher=Atkinson News Co|year=1912}}</ref> This 8.5-mile path is the oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States. The influence of British and European [[Romanticism]] reached North America through the [[transcendentalist movement]], and both [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–82) and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in North America. Thoreau's writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published "Walking" (1862)".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=Walking|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1862/06/walking/304674/|accessdate=24 July 2017|issue=June 1862|magazine=The Atlantic}}</ref> His earlier essay  "[[A Walk to Wachusett]]" (1842) describes a four-day [[walking tour]] Thoreau took with a companion from Concord, Massachusetts to the summit of [[Mount Wachusett]], [[Princeton, Massachusetts]] and back. In 1876 the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]], America’s earliest recreation organization, was founded to protect the trails and mountains in the northeastern United States.

The Scottish-born, American naturalist [[John Muir]] (1838 –1914), was another important early advocate of the preservation of wilderness in the United States. He petitioned the [[U.S. Congress]] for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. The [[Sierra Club]], which he founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired others, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/|title=The Life and Contributions of John Muir |publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}</ref> He is today referred to as the "Father of the National Parks".<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Barbara Kiely|title=John Muir|publisher=Gareth Stevens|year=2008|page=10|isbn=978-0836883183}}</ref> In 1916, the National Park Service was created to protect national parks and monuments.

In 1921, [[Benton MacKaye]], a forester, conceived the idea of the America's first National Trail, the [[Appalachian trail]], and this was completed in August 1937, running from [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Franklin County, Maine)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] in Maine to Georgia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.appalachiantrail.org/home/about-us/history|title=Appalachian Trail Conservancy|accessdate=May 31, 2020}}</ref> The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] ("PCT") was first explored in the 1930s by the [[YMCA]] hiking groups and was eventually registered as a complete border to border trail from Mexico to Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e2e.com/featured/the-top-10-hiking-trails-in-the-us/|title=The Top 10 Hiking Trails in the US|publisher=e2e.com|access-date=2014-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223095352/http://www.e2e.com/featured/the-top-10-hiking-trails-in-the-us|archive-date=2014-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Pilgrimages ===
{{See|Category:Japanese pilgrimages}}
[[Pilgrimage]] routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long-distance routes, and the route taken by the British [[National Trail]] the [[North Downs Way]] closely follows that of the [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120728131235/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/info/paths/name/n/northdowns North Downs Way National Trail.] Page archived (as at 2012-07-28) from the Ramblers' Association, accessed 2013-04-29</ref>
 
[[File:Spain Santiago de Compostela - Cathedral.jpg|left|thumb| [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]]]
The ancient pilgrimage, the [[Camino de Santiago]], or Way of St. James, has become more recently the source for a number of long distance hiking route. This is a network of [[pilgrims' way]]s  leading to the shrine of the [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James the Great]] in the [[cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northwestern [[Spain]]. Many follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. 

The [[French Way]] is the most popular of the routes and runs from [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] on the French side of the [[Pyrenees]] to [[Roncesvalles]] on the Spanish side and then another {{convert|780|km}} on to Santiago de Compostela through the major cities of [[Pamplona]], [[Logroño]], [[Burgos]] and [[León, Spain|León]]. A typical walk on the ''Camino francés'' takes at least four weeks, allowing for one or two rest days on the way. Some travel the Camino on bicycle or on horseback. Paths from the cities of [[Tours]], [[Vézelay]], and [[Le Puy-en-Velay]] meet at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.<ref name=Starkie>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xJGrnvuNW4C|last=Starkie|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Starkie|title=The Roads to Santiago: Pilgrims of St. James|publisher=University of California Press|year=1965|orig-year=1957}}</ref> The French long distance path [[GR 65]] (of the [[GR footpath|Grande Randonnée]] network), is an important variant route of the old [[Christians|Christian]] [[pilgrimage]] way.

[[National park]]s are often important hiking destinations, such as [[National Parks of England and Wales]]; [[National Parks of Canada|of Canada]]; [[National parks of New Zealand|of New Zealand]], [[National Parks of South Africa|of South Africa]], etc.

Frequently nowadays long-distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long-distance paths, including the [[National Trails]] in England and Wales, the [[Kungsleden]] (Sweden) and the [[National Trail System]] in the United States. The [[Grande Randonnée]] (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (The Netherlands), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of [[long-distance footpaths]] in [[Europe]], mostly in France, Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long-distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours can be made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of [[mountain hut]]s.

In the late 20th-century, there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long-distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long-distance way (Britain), trail (US), ''The Grande Randonnée'' (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long-distance paths include the [[Appalachian Trail]] in the US and the [[Pennine Way]] in Britain.

In [[Latin America]] [[Peru]] and [[Hiking in Chile|Chile]] are important hiking destinations. The [[Inca Trail to Machu Picchu]] in Peru is very popular and a [[Inca Trail to Machu Picchu#Inca Trail Permits|permit is required]]. The longest hiking trail in Chile is the informal 3,000&nbsp;km (1,850&nbsp;mi) [[Greater Patagonia Trail]] that was created by a non-governmental initiative.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dudeck|first1=Jan|title=Greater Patagonian Trail|url=http://www.wikiexplora.com/index.php/Greater_Patagonian_Trail|website=Wikiexplora|accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>

==Equipment==
{{main|Hiking equipment}}
[[File:Sacs à dos avant la randonnée.jpg|thumb|right|Backpacks are commonly used on hikes]]

The equipment required for hiking depends on a variety of factors. Day hikers generally can carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear.<ref name=hikebook/> Hikers have traditionally worn sturdy [[hiking boots]] <ref name=hikebook/> for stability over rough terrain. In recent decades this has become less common as some [[long-distance trail|long distance hikers]] have switched to [[trail running#Equipment|trail running shoes]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Grady |first1=Kyle |url=https://thetrek.co/trail-runners-or-boots/ |website=The Trek |accessdate=28 July 2020 |title=The Footwear Debate: Are Trail Runners Superior to Boots?}}</ref> Boots are still commonly used in mountainous terrain. [[The Mountaineers (club)|The Mountaineers]] club recommends a list of "[[Ten Essentials]]" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a [[flashlight]], a first aid kit, a [[Making fire|fire starter]], and a knife.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills|edition=6th|publisher=The Mountaineers|pages=35–40|year=1997|isbn=0-89886-427-5}}</ref> Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an [[space blanket|emergency blanket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.sierraclub.org/dallas/page.asp?10essentialgroups|title=Ten Essential Groups Article|publisher=Texas Sierra Club|accessdate=2011-01-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yUf4mhtH?url=http://texas.sierraclub.org/dallas/page.asp?10essentialgroups|archivedate=2011-05-07}}</ref> A [[GPS navigation device]] can also be helpful and [[route card]]s may be used as a guide. [[Trekking poles]] are also recommended, especially when carrying a heavy backpack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhiking.org/resources/trekking-poles/|title=Trekking Poles|publisher=American Hiking Association|accessdate=2020-11-13}}</ref> Winter hiking requires a higher level of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons {see winter hiking below). 

Proponents of [[ultralight backpacking]] argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury.<ref name="Jardine">{{Cite book |last=Jardine |first=Ray |title=Beyond Backpacking: Ray Jardine's Guide to Lightweight Hiking |publisher=AdventureLore Press |year=2000|isbn=0963235931}}</ref> Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.<ref name=Jardine/>

Hiking times can be estimated by [[Naismith's rule]] or [[Tobler's hiking function]], while distances can be measured on a map with an [[opisometer]]. A [[pedometer]] is a device that records the distance walked.

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:Mohonk Mountain House 2011 Hiking Trail against Guest Rooms 2 FRD 3281.jpg|thumb|Parts of many hiking trails around [[Lake Mohonk]], New York State, US, include stairways which can prevent erosion]]

[[Natural environment]]s are often fragile and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients, and can cause deforestation;<ref name=impact>{{cite journal| last =Cole| first =David| title =Impacts of Hiking and Camping on Soils and Vegetation: A Review| url =http://leopold.wilderness.net/research/fprojects/docs12/Ecotourism.pdf| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020403/http://leopold.wilderness.net/research/fprojects/docs12/Ecotourism.pdf| archivedate =2010-07-06}}</ref> and some species, such as [[marten]]s or [[Bighorn Sheep|bighorn sheep]], are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact.<ref name=impact /> Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting [[camping]] to established campsites, disposing or packing out [[Human feces|faecal matter]], and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of [[Leave No Trace]], following strict practices on dealing with [[food waste]], food packaging, and other impacts on the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lnt.org/about/|title=About Our Mission|publisher=Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics}}</ref>
Human feces are often a major source of environmental impact from hiking,<ref name=impact/> and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. '[[Cathole]]s' dug 10 to 25&nbsp;cm (4 to 10&nbsp;inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200&nbsp;feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.

Fire is a particular source of danger, and an individual hiker can have a large impact on an ecosystem. For example, in 2005, a Czech backpacker accidentally started a fire that burnt 5% of [[Torres del Paine National Park]] in Chile.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.mercopress.com/2009/09/30/chile-and-czech-republic-work-to-restore-torres-del-paine-park|title=Chile and Czech Republic work to restore Torres del Paine Park|newspaper=MercoPress|date=2009-09-30}}</ref>

== Etiquette ==
{{main|Trail ethics}}

Because hikers may come into conflict with other users of the land or may harm the natural environment, hiking etiquette has developed. 
* When two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]].<ref name=etiquette>{{cite web|title=Trail Etiquette|first=Melissa|last=Devaughn|work=Backpacker Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|accessdate=22 January 2011|date=April 1997|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=40|issn=0277-867X}}</ref>
* Various organizations recommend that hikers generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, playing music, or the use of mobile phones.<ref name=etiquette/> However, in bear country, hikers use intentional noise-making as a safety precaution to avoid startling bears.
* The [[Leave No Trace]] movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: "Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories".
* Hikers are advised not to feed wild animals, because they will become a danger to other hikers if they become habituated to human food, and may have to be killed, or relocated.<ref>[http://thamesriver.on.ca/watershed-health/native-species/dont-feed-wildlife/ "Do not feed wildlife", Upper Thames River Conservation Authority]</ref>

==Hazards==
{{See|Hazards of outdoor recreation|Survival skills|Sure-footedness}}
[[File:Striding Edge.jpg|thumb|Striding Edge, [[Helvellyn]], [[Lake District]], England. An example of a hiking route that involves some easy [[scrambling]], [[sure-footedness]], and a [[head for heights]]]]
[[Hazards of outdoor recreation|Hiking can be hazardous]] because of terrain, inclement weather, becoming lost, or pre-existing medical conditions. The dangerous circumstances hikers can face include specific accidents or physical ailments. It is especially hazardous in high mountains, crossing rivers and glaciers, and when there is snow and ice. At times hiking may involve [[scrambling]], as well as the use of ropes, ice axes and crampons and the skill to properly use them.

Potential hazards involving physical ailments may include dehydration, frostbite, hypothermia, sunburn, sunstroke, or [[wilderness acquired diarrhea|diarrhea]],<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01494-8|last=Boulware|first=D.R.|year=2003|title=Medical Risks of Wilderness Hiking|journal=American Journal of Medicine|volume=114|issue=4|pages=288–93|pmid=12681456|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and such injuries as ankle sprains, or broken bones.<ref name=Goldenberg>{{cite book|title=Hiking and Backpacking| page=104| first1=Marni| last1=Goldenberg| first2=Bruce| last2=Martin |publisher=Wilderness Education Association| year=2007| isbn=978-0-7360-6801-7}}</ref> [[Hypothermia]] is a danger for all hikers and especially inexperienced hikers. Weather does not need to be very cold to be dangerous since ordinary rain or mist has a strong cooling effect. In high mountains a further danger is [[altitude sickness]]. This typically occurs only above {{convert|2500|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, though some are affected at lower altitudes.<ref name=Mer2018Pro>{{cite web |title=Altitude Diseases - Injuries; Poisoning |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/injuries-poisoning/altitude-diseases/altitude-diseases |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=3 August 2018 |date=May 2018}}</ref><ref name=Sim2018>{{cite journal |last1=Simancas-Racines |first1=D |last2=Arevalo-Rodriguez |first2=I |last3=Osorio |first3=D |last4=Franco |first4=JV |last5=Xu |first5=Y |last6=Hidalgo |first6=R |title=Interventions for treating acute high altitude illness. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=30 June 2018 |volume=6 |pages=CD009567 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009567.pub2 |pmid=29959871|pmc=6513207 }}</ref> Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation.<ref name=Mer2018Pro/>

Other threats include attacks by animals (e.g., bears, snakes, and [[insects]] or [[ticks]] carrying [[Tick-borne disease|diseases]] such as [[Lyme]]) or contact with noxious plants that can cause rashes (e.g., [[poison ivy]], [[poison oak]], [[poison sumac]], or [[stinging nettles]]). Attacks by humans are also a reality in some places. Lightning is also a threat, especially on high ground.

Walkers in high mountains, and during winter in many countries, can encounter hazardous snow and ice conditions, and the possibility of [[avalanches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/backcountry-basics/snow/avalanche/|title=Avalanche danger|publisher=Pacific Crest Trails Association|accessdate=2020-11-13}}</ref> Year round [[glaciers]] are potentially hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wta.org/go-outside/trail-smarts/how-to/how-to-cross-a-glacier|title=How to cross a glacier|publisher=Washington Trails Association|accessdate=2020-11-13}}</ref> Fast flowing rivers pose another danger that requires special techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/backcountry-basics/water/stream-crossing-safety/|title=Stream crossing safety while hiking and backpacking|publisher=Pacific Crest Trail Association}}</ref>

In various countries, borders may be poorly marked. In 2009, Iran imprisoned three Americans for hiking across the Iran-Iraq border.<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report Asserts|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23hikers.html?_r=1|date=2010-10-23|first1=Michael R.|last1=Gordon|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Lehren}}</ref> It is illegal to cross into the US on the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] from Canada. Going south to north it is more straightforward and a crossing can be made, if advanced arrangements are made with [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canada Border Services]]. Within the [[Schengen Area]], which includes most of the [[E.U.]], and associated nations like Switzerland and Norway, there are no impediments to crossing by path, and borders are not always obvious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.via-alpina.org/en/page/771/questions-answers#And_what_else_should_I_know_about_walking_in_the_Alps_|title=Hiking the Via Alpina - Questions / Answers|website=www.via-alpina.org|accessdate=May 31, 2020}}</ref>
