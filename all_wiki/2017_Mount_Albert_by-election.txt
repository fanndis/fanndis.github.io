The '''2017 Mount Albert by-election''' was a [[List of New Zealand by-elections|New Zealand by-election]] held in the {{NZ electorate link|Mount Albert }}electorate on 25 February 2017 during the [[51st New Zealand Parliament]]. The seat was vacated following the resignation of [[David Shearer]], a former [[Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11762554|title=David Shearer to quit for UN job: Mt Albert byelection looms|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Audrey Young|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="mt albert greens">{{Cite web|url=https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/87898480/green-party-to-stand-against-labour-in-mt-albert-byelection|title=Green Party to stand against Labour in Mt Albert by-election|publisher=[[stuff.co.nz]]|date=23 December 2016|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>

The by-election was avoided by all right and centre-right parties, and turnout was low. The electorate was won by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] list MP [[Jacinda Ardern]] by a large margin. Another Labour member, [[Raymond Huo]], filled Ardern's list seat.

==Background==
The Mount Albert electorate includes the communities of [[Point Chevalier]], [[Owairaka]], [[Mount Albert, New Zealand|Mount Albert]], part of [[Sandringham, New Zealand|Sandringham]], [[Kingsland, New Zealand|Kingsland]], and is home to [[Eden Park]]. As a result of boundary changes in 2014, the electorate gained the suburbs of [[Grey Lynn]] and [[Westmere, New Zealand|Westmere]], but lost [[Waterview, New Zealand|Waterview]] and the areas alongside Rosebank Road to the [[Kelston (New Zealand electorate)|Kelston]] electorate. Mount Albert (known as Owairaka from 1996 to 1999) was held between 1981 and 2009 by [[Helen Clark]], ending with her retirement from parliament.<ref name="Electorate profile">{{cite web |title= Mount Albert electorate profile|url= https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/DBHOH_Lib_EP_Mt_Albert_Electoral_Profile/d69818aee8013fc446fa8ae8a170c2d57b1a279e |date= June 2015 |publisher= Parliamentary Library |accessdate= 19 December 2016}}{{CC-notice|cc=by3|author=the Parliamentary Library}}</ref>

Although just 23.0% of the Mount Albert electorate is over 50 (the fifth-lowest proportion among general electorates), the share of those aged 30–49 (34.1%) is the highest in New Zealand. The largest sector of those working is in the professions, science and technical industries (16.7%); a further 5.4% work in the media and communications sectors, the largest share of any general electorate. Compared to the rest of New Zealand in 2013, Mount Albert had low levels of those who were married (33.5%, 5th lowest), owned their own home (36.4%, 7th lowest), and who declared a Christian religious affiliation (38.5%, 3rd lowest).<ref name="Electorate profile" />

The winning candidate in the 2014 election, [[David Shearer]] ([[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]), captured a majority (58.7%) of the 35,716 valid electorate votes cast for candidates in the Mount Albert electorate. The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] captured a plurality (39.1%) of the party votes in Mount Albert, up 2.4 percentage points on its party vote share in 2011. The Labour Party captured 29.4% of the party votes, while the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] was third with 21.8% of the party votes. No other party gained more than 5% of the party votes. Turnout (total votes cast as a proportion of enrolled electors) in 2014 was 80.4%.<ref name="Electorate profile" />

===Resignation of David Shearer===
On 8 December 2016, David Shearer, a former [[New Zealand Labour Party#Leaders|leader of Labour]], announced that he was going to head the [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan]]. He officially resigned from the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 31 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11762554|title=David Shearer to quit for UN job: Mt Albert byelection looms|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Audrey Young|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>
