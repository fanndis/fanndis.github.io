'''TOM Online''' is a mobile Internet company in [[China]], operating the popular [[Chinese-language]] Internet portal (www.tom.com) and offering a variety of online and [[cellular phone|mobile services]], including [[wireless internet]] and [[online advertising]]. The [[TOM Group]] is the majority shareholder. It is a subsidiary of the [[TOM Group]], controlled by [[Li Ka Shing]].

The company, then named TOM.com, was first listed on the [[HKGEM]] on March 1, 2000,<ref>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong [http://www.hkgem.com/aboutgem/e_release000313tom.pdf "The Growth Enterprise Market & tom.com limited IPO"], March 2000</ref> and on the [[NASDAQ]] on March 10, 2004. It set a record in [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Hong Kong]] when it listed: shares closed at 3.35 times its offer price on the first day of trade.<ref>Bonnie Chen, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=2&art_id=56439&sid=16170486&con_type=1&d_str=20071107&sear_year=2007 "It's a steal!"], ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'', November 7, 2007</ref>

Tom Group, which owned 66 percent of the company, announced in March 2007 that it would pay HK$1.57 billion to buy out minority shareholders in the company, valuing each share at HK$1.52. A vote on the deal was scheduled for June 8, but was postponed to August 10.<ref>Steven Lee, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&art_id=49725&sid=14622094&con_type=1&d_str=20070725&sear_year=2007 "Wireless net woes put Tom Online into red"], ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'', July 25, 2007</ref> [[Morgan Stanley]] said in a report in March that the [[fair value]] for Tom Online would be HK$1.90 per share. The delay in the vote was seen by an analyst that the company was "not confident about getting approval from majority shareholders for the deal... The general feedback in the market is that the price suggested is quite low."<ref>Steven Lee, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&art_id=46333&sid=13966687&con_type=1&d_str=20070608&sear_year=2007 "Tom Online tries to save delisting bid"], ''The Standard'', June 8, 2007</ref>

The company has since been taken private.<ref>Ben Kwok, "Bigger pond for Li firm", 'Lai See' ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', July 04, 2008</ref>

TOM Online exclusively offers the Chinese version of [[Skype]], which has been modified for the Chinese market and seems to include a text filter for political keywords.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/875630d4-cef9-11da-925d-0000779e2340.html | title=Skype says texts are censored by China | publisher=Financial Times | work=FT.com |date=April 18, 2006}}</ref>
