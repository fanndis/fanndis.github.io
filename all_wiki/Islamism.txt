'''Islamism''' is a concept whose meaning has been debated in both public and academic contexts.<ref name="Poljarevic-def">{{cite encyclopedia|year=2015|title=Islamism|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://www.academia.edu/6916999|access-date=1 February 2017|author=Emin Poljarevic|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|quote=Islamism is one of many sociopolitical concepts continuously contested in scholarly literature. It is a neologism debated in both Muslim and non-Muslim public and academic contexts. The term "Islamism" at the very least represents a form of social and political activism, grounded in an idea that public and political life should be guided by a set of Islamic principles. In other words, Islamists are those who believe that Islam has an important role to play in organizing a Muslim-majority society and who seek to implement this belief.}}</ref> The term can refer to diverse forms of social and political activism advocating that public and political life should be guided by [[Fiqh|Islamic principles]]<ref name=Poljarevic-def/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Islamist|editor=John L.

[...] Today it is one of the recognized alternatives to "fundamentalist," along with "political Islam" in particular. [...] Current terminology usually distinguishes between "Islam," [...] and "Islamism," referring to the ideology of those who tend to signal openly, in politics, their Muslim religion. [...] the term has often acquired a quasi-criminal connotation close to that of political extremism, religious sectarianism, or bigotry. In Western mainstream media, "Islamists" are those who want to establish, preferably through violent means, an "Islamic state" or impose sharīʿah (Islamic religious law)—goals that are often perceived merely as a series of violations of human rights or the rights of women. In the Muslim world, insiders use the term as a positive reference. In the academic sphere, although it is still debated, the term designates a more complex phenomenon. |isbn=9780195305135}}</ref>

==Terminology==
The term ''Islamism'', which originally denoted the religion of Islam, first appeared in the English language as ''Islamismus'' in 1696, and as ''Islamism'' in 1712.<ref name=OED>{{cite web|title= Islamism, n.|url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/99982|work= Oxford English Dictionary|publisher= Oxford University Press|access-date= 27 December 2012}}</ref>  The term appears in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''In Re Ross'' (1891). By the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely Arabic term "Islam" had begun to  displace it, and by 1938, when Orientalist scholars completed ''The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', ''Islamism'' seems to have virtually disappeared from English usage.<ref name="KramerTerms"/><ref>Compare: [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Islamism%2C+Islam&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CIslamism%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CIslam%3B%2Cc0 Google Books Ngram Viewer]</ref>

The term "Islamism" acquired its contemporary connotations in French academia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. From French, it began to migrate to the English language in the mid-1980s, and in recent years has largely displaced the term [[Islamic fundamentalism]] in academic circles.<ref name="KramerTerms"/>

The new use of the term "Islamism" at first functioned as "a marker for scholars more likely to sympathize" with new Islamic movements; however, as the term gained popularity it became more specifically associated with political groups such as the [[Taliban]] or the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group]], as well as with highly publicized acts of violence.<ref name="KramerTerms"/>

"Islamists" who have spoken out against the use of the term, insisting they are merely "Muslims", include [[Ayatollah]] [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]] (1935-2010), the spiritual mentor of [[Hezbollah]], and [[Abbassi Madani]] (1931- ), leader of the Algerian [[Islamic Salvation Front]].<ref name="KramerTerms"/>

A 2003 article in the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' states:
<blockquote>In summation, the term Islamism enjoyed its first run, lasting from Voltaire to the [[World War I|First World War]], as a synonym for Islam. Enlightened scholars and writers generally preferred it to [[Mohammed]]anism. Eventually both terms yielded to Islam, the Arabic name of the faith, and a word free of either pejorative or comparative associations. There was no need for any other term, until the rise of an ideological and political interpretation of Islam challenged scholars and commentators to come up with an alternative, to distinguish Islam as modern ideology from Islam as a faith... To all intents and purposes, Islamic fundamentalism and Islamism have become synonyms in contemporary American usage.<ref name="KramerTerms"/></blockquote>

The [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] complained in 2013 that the [[Associated Press]]'s definition of "Islamist"—a "supporter of government in accord with the laws of Islam [and] who view the Quran as a political model"—had become a pejorative shorthand for "Muslims we don't like".<ref name=cair-5-4-2013/> Mansoor Moaddel, a sociologist at [[Eastern Michigan University]], criticized it as "not a good term" because "the use of the term Islamist does not capture the phenomena that is quite heterogeneous."<ref>Briggs, David (June 29, 2012). [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/islamist-is-it-time-to-reconsider-the-term_b_1624319.html Is It Time to Reconsider the Term Islamist?]. ''[[Huffington Post]]''.

=== Varieties ===
Islamism takes different forms and spans a wide range of strategies and tactics towards the powers in place—"destruction, opposition, collaboration, indifference"<ref name=Roy-24>{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=The Failure of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/failureofpolitic00royo|url-access=registration|date=1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/failureofpolitic00royo/page/24 24]}}</ref> that have varied as "circumstances have changed"<ref name=Roy-109>{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=The Failure of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/failureofpolitic00royo|url-access=registration|date=1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/failureofpolitic00royo/page/109 109]}}</ref>—and thus is not a united movement.

Moderate and reformist Islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the Tunisian [[Ennahda Movement]]. [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] of Pakistan is basically a socio-political and democratic [[Vanguard party]] but has also gained political influence through military [[coup d'état]]s in the past.<ref name=Roy-24/> Other Islamist groups like [[Hezbollah]] in [[Lebanon]] and [[Hamas]] in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] participate in the democratic and political process as well as armed attacks. [[Jihadist]] organizations like [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], and groups such as the [[Taliban]], entirely reject [[democracy]], often declaring as ''[[kafir|kuffar]]'' those Muslims who support it (see ''[[takfir]]ism''), as well as calling for violent/[[offensive jihad]] or urging and conducting [[Islamic terrorism|attacks]] on a religious basis.

Another major division within Islamism is between what [[Graham E. Fuller]] has described as the fundamentalist "guardians of the tradition" ([[Salafism|Salafis]], such as those in the [[Wahhabi]] movement) and the "vanguard of change and Islamic reform" centered around the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].<ref name="Fuller, 2003 pp. 194">Fuller, ''The Future of Political Islam'', (2003), pp. 194–95</ref> [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] argues that "Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of [[pan-Arabism]] was eclipsed by the [[Salafi]] movement with its emphasis on "sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions," and rejection of Shia Islam.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''The Politics of Chaos in the Middle East'', Columbia University Press, (2008), pp. 92–93</ref> Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as "increasingly interdependent" with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that "neither can now survive without the other."  While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.<ref name="foreignpolicy1"/>

===Relation to Islam===
{{further|Political aspects of Islam}}
The relationship between the notions of Islam and Islamism has been subject to disagreement.

Hayri Abaza argues that the failure to distinguish between Islam and Islamism leads many in the West to support illiberal Islamic regimes, to the detriment of progressive moderates who seek to separate religion from politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/it-islamic-or-islamist-73961|title=Is It Islamic or Islamist?|date=October 22, 2010|newspaper=Newsweek|author=Hayri Abaza}}</ref>
In contrast, [[Abid Ullah Jan]], writes "If Islam is a way of life, how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal, social, political, economic, and political spheres of life are not Muslims, but Islamists and believe in Islamism, not [just] Islam."<ref name="Abid Ullah Jan 2006">{{Cite web|title=Wikipedia: Good Intentions, Horrible Consequences By Abid Uallah Jan |author=Abid Ullah Jan |author-link=Abid Ullah Jan |publisher=Al-Jazeerah |date=February 27, 2006 |access-date=November 16, 2015 |url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2006%20Opinion%20Editorials/February/27o/Wikipedia%20Good%20Intentions,%20Horrible%20Consequences%20By%20Abid%20Uallah%20Jan.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204415/http://www.aljazeerah.info/Opinion%20editorials/2006%20Opinion%20Editorials/February/27o/Wikipedia%20Good%20Intentions%2C%20Horrible%20Consequences%20By%20Abid%20Uallah%20Jan.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> A writer for the [[International Crisis Group]] maintains that "the conception of 'political Islam'" is a creation of Americans to explain the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] and apolitical Islam was a historical fluke of the "short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970", and it is [[Political quietism|quietist]]/non-political Islam, not Islamism, that requires explanation.<ref name="ICGUnderstandingIslam">{{cite web|title=Understanding Islamism|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/North%20Africa/Understanding%20Islamism.pdf|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808200810/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/North%20Africa/Understanding%20Islamism.ashx|archive-date=August 8, 2010|date=2 March 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another source distinguishes Islamist from Islamic "by the fact that the latter refers to a religion and culture in existence over a millennium, whereas the first is a political/religious phenomenon linked to the great events of the 20th century". Islamists have, at least at times, defined themselves as "Islamiyyoun/Islamists" to differentiate themselves from "Muslimun/Muslims".<ref>''Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, The 9/11 Commission Report'', W.W. Norton & Company, New York, (2004), p. 562</ref> [[Daniel Pipes]] describes Islamism as a modern ideology that owes more to European utopian political ideologies and "isms" than to the traditional Islamic religion.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://nationalinterest.org/article/islam-and-islamism-faith-and-ideology-748|title=Islam and Islamism: Faith and Ideology|date=March 1, 2000|journal=The National Interest|issue=Spring 2000|author=Daniel Pipes|access-date=March 12, 2014|author-link=Daniel Pipes}}</ref>

===Influence===
Few observers contest the influence of Islamism within the [[Muslim world]].<ref name=murphy-160>Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam'', (c. 2002), p. 160</ref><ref name="cook"/><ref name=murphy-161>Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam: Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience,'' Scribner, (c. 2002), p. 161</ref> Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], political movements based on the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideology of free expression and democratic rule have led the opposition in other parts of the world such as [[Latin America]], [[Eastern Europe]] and many parts of [[Asia]]; however "the simple fact is that political Islam currently reigns as the most powerful ideological force across the Muslim world today".<ref>Fuller, ''The Future of Political Islam'', (2003), p. 67</ref><ref>Referring to the success of radical transnational Islamism and specifically the party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], [[Zeyno Baran]] writes that "all religions have radicals, but in contemporary Islam the radicals have become the mainstream, and the moderates are pushed to the sides of the debate." (source: {{cite web |last1=Baran |first1=Zeyno |url=http://www.bits.de/public/documents/US_Terrorist_Attacks/Hizbut-ahrirIslam'sPoliticalInsurgency.pdf |title=Hizb ut-Tahrir: Islam's Political Insurgency |publisher=Nixon Center |date=December 2004 |access-date=2016-03-30 |page=13 |ref=ZBHTIPI2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214407/http://www.bits.de/public/documents/US_Terrorist_Attacks/Hizbut-ahrirIslam'sPoliticalInsurgency.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-10 |url-status=dead }})</ref>

People see the unchanging socioeconomic condition in the Muslim world as a major factor. Olivier Roy believes "the socioeconomic realities that sustained the Islamist wave are still here and are not going to change: poverty, uprootedness, crises in values and identities, the decay of the educational systems, the North-South opposition, and the problem of immigrant integration into the host societies".<ref>Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'' (1994) p. 27</ref>

The strength of Islamism also draws from the strength of religiosity in general in the Muslim world.

In the example of democracy, [[Islamic democracy]] as an Islamized form of the system has been intellectually developed. In Islamic democracy, the concept of ''[[shura]]'', the tradition of consultation which considered as [[Sunnah]] of the [[Islamic prophet|prophet]] [[Muhammad]], is invoked to Islamically reinterpret and legitimatize the institution of democracy.<ref name="Om"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alhewar.com/SadekShura.htm|title=The Shura Principle in Islam - by Sadek Sulaiman|website=www.alhewar.com}}</ref><ref>Esposito, J. & Voll, J.,2001, Islam and Democracy, ''Humanities'', Volume 22, Issue 6</ref>

Performance, goal, strategy, and outcome of moderate Islamist movements vary considerably depending on the country and its socio-political and historical context. In terms of performance, most of the Islamist political parties are oppositions. However, there are few examples they govern or obtain the substantial amount of the popular votes. This includes [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress]] of [[Sudan]], [[National Iraqi Alliance]] of Iraq and [[Justice and Development Party (Morocco)|Justice and Development Party]] (PJD) of Morocco. Their goal also ranges widely.

Moderate Islamism within the democratic institution is a relatively recent phenomenon.<ref name="Is"/> Throughout the 80s and 90s, major moderate Islamist movements such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the Ennahda were excluded from democratic political participation. Islamist movements operated within the state framework were markedly scrutinized during the [[Algerian Civil War]] (1991-2002) and after the increase of [[terrorism in Egypt]] in the 90s. Reflecting on these failures, Islamists turned increasingly into revisionist and receptive to democratic procedures in the 21st century.<ref name="Is"/> The possibility of accommodating this new wave of modernist Islamism has been explored among the Western intellectuals, with the concept such as [[Turkish model]] was proposed. The concept was inspired by the perceived success of Turkish [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) led by [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] in harmonizing the Islamist principles within the secular state framework.<ref>[http://carnegieendowment.org/2011/12/19/can-turkish-model-gain-traction-in-new-middle-east Can the Turkish Model Gain Traction in the New Middle East?]  Sinan Ülgen, Marwan Muasher, Thomas de Waal, Thomas Carothers |  carnegieendowment.org| 19 December 2011</ref> Turkish model, however, has been considered came "unstuck" after [[Gezi Park protests|recent purge and violations of democratic principles by the Erdoğan regime]].<ref name=surreal>{{cite journal|last=de Bellaigue|first=Christopher|title=Turkey: 'Surreal, Menacing…Pompous'|journal=New York Review of Books|date=December 19, 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/dec/19/turkey-surreal-menacing-pompous/?pagination=false|access-date=12 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="NYT-23-7-16">{{cite news|last1=Akyol|first1=Mustafa|title=Who Was Behind the Coup Attempt in Turkey?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/opinion/who-was-behind-the-coup-attempt-in-turkey.html|access-date=23 July 2016|agency=New York Times|date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Critics of the concept hold that Islamist aspirations are fundamentally incompatible with the democratic principles, thus even moderate Islamists are [[totalitarian]] in nature.

====Post-Islamism====
{{main|Post-Islamism}}
[[Post-Islamism]] is a term proposed by Iranian political sociologist [[Asef Bayat]], referring to the Islamist movements which marked by the critical departure from the traditional Islamist discourses of the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Badamchi|2017}}|first=Meysam|last=Badamchi|title=Post-Islamist Political Theory: Iranian Intellectuals and Political Liberalism in Dialogue|volume=5|series=Philosophy and Politics - Critical Explorations|publisher=Springer|date=2017|isbn=978-3319594927|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3YpDwAAQBAJ}}</ref>{{rp|4}} Bayat explained it as "a condition where, following a phase of experimentation, the appeal, energy, symbols and sources of legitimacy of Islamism get exhausted, even among its once-ardent supporters. As such, post-Islamism is not anti-Islamic, but rather reflects a tendency to resecularize religion." It originally pertained only to Iran, where "post-Islamism is expressed in the idea of fusion between Islam (as a personalized faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-Islamism is associated with the values of democracy and aspects of [[modernity]]".<ref>{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Bayat|1996}}|title=The Coming of a Post-Islamist Society|journal=Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies|volume=5|number=9|date=Fall 1996|pages=43–52|first=Asef|last=Bayat|doi=10.1080/10669929608720091}}</ref>{{rp|45}} A 2008 [[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] paper suggests that PKS of Indonesia and AKP of Turkey are post-Islamist.<ref>{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Bubalo|Fealy|Mason|2002}}|title=Zealous Democrats: Islamism and Democracy in Egypt, Indonesia and Turkey|number=25|year=2008|publisher=Lowy Institute for International Policy|place=Australia|first1=Anthony|last1=Bubalo|first2=Greg|last2=Fealy|first3=Whit|last3=Mason|isbn=978-1921004353|url=http://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/pubfiles/Bubalo,_Zealous_democrats_web_1.pdf|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305023918/https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/pubfiles/Bubalo,_Zealous_democrats_web_1.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|51, 76}} The characterization can be applied to [[Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS)]],<ref>{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Muller|2013}}|title=Post-Islamism or Pop-Islamism?

===Salafi movement===
{{Salafi|Related}}
{{main|Salafi movement}}
The contemporary [[Salafi movement]] encompasses a broad range of ultraconservative Islamist doctrines which share the reformist mission of [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]. From the perspective of political Islam, the Salafi movement can be broadly categorized into three groups; the [[Political quietism in Islam#Salafists|quietist]] (or the purist), the activist (or ''haraki'') and the jihadist ([[Salafi jihadism]], see below). The quietist school advocates for societal reform through religious education and proselytizing rather than political activism. The activist school, to the contrary, encourages political participation within the constitutional and political framework. The jihadist school is inspired by the ideology of [[Sayyid Qutb]] ([[Qutbism]], see below), and rejects the legitimacy of secular institutions and promotes the revolution in order to pave the way for the establishment of a new [[Caliphate]].<ref name="Mo">Mohie-Eldin, Fatima. ''The Evolution of Salafism A History of Salafi Doctrine''. Al-Noor, Fall 2015. pp. 44-47.</ref>

The quietist Salafi movement is stemming from the teaching of [[Nasiruddin Albani]], who challenged the notion of ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation, conformity to the legal precedent) as a blind adherence. As such, they alarm the political participation as potentially leading to the division of the Muslim community.<ref name="Mo"/> This school is exemplified by [[Madkhalism]] which based on the writings of [[Rabee al-Madkhali]].<ref>Omayma Abdel-Latif, "Trends in Salafism."

The politically active Salafi movement, Salafi activism or ''harakis'', is based on the religious belief that endorses non-violent political activism in order to protect God's Divine governance. This means that politics is a field which requires Salafi principles to be applied as well, in the same manner with other aspects of society and life.<ref name="Mo"/> Salafi activism was originated in the 50s to 60s Saudi Arabia, where many Muslim Brothers had taken refuge from the prosecution by the [[Nasser]] regime.<ref name="Co"/> There, Muslim Brothers' Islamism had synthesized with Salafism, and led to the creation of the Salafi activist trend exemplified by the [[Sahwa movement]] in the 80s,<ref name="Mo"/> promulgated by [[Safar Al-Hawali]] and [[Salman al-Ouda]]. Today, the school makes up the majority of Salafism.<ref name=jof>George Joffé, ''Islamist Radicalisation in Europe and the Middle East: Reassessing the Causes of Terrorism'', p. 317. London: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2013.</ref> There are many active Salafist political parties throughout the Muslim world, including [[Al Nour Party]] of Egypt, [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al Islah]] of [[Yemen]] and [[Al Asalah]] of [[Bahrain]].

====Wahhabism====
{{main|Wahhabism}}
The antecedent of the contemporary Salafi movement is [[Wahhabism]], which traces back to the 18th-century reform movement in [[Najd]] by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]. Although having different roots, Wahhabism and Salafism are considered more or less merged in the 60s Saudi Arabia.<ref name=Dillon-3-4>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Michael R.|title=Wahabism: Is it a Factor in the Spread of Global Terrorism?|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a509109.pdf|date=September 2009|publisher=Naval Post-Graduate School|access-date=2 April 2014|pages=3–4|quote=Hamid Algar ... emphasizes the strong influence of the Saudi petrodollar in the propagation of Wahhabism, but also attributes the political situation of the Arab world at the time as a contributing factor that led to the co-opting of Salafism ...

This attachment of Wahhabism to Salafism was needed as Salafism was a much more 'credible paradigm in Islam'; making it an ideal medium for Wahhabism ... The co-opting of Salafism by Wahhabism was not completed until the 1970s when the Wahhabis stripped away some of their extreme intolerance and co-opted the symbolism and language of Salafism; making them practically indistinguishable.}}</ref><ref>Stephane Lacroix, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17210/ISIM_21_Al-Albani-s_Revolutionary_Approach_to_Hadith.pdf?sequence=1 Al-Albani's Revolutionary Approach to Hadith] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010091919/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17210/ISIM_21_Al-Albani-s_Revolutionary_Approach_to_Hadith.pdf?sequence=1 |date=2017-10-10 }}.

The obvious use of this concept was to declare secular rulers, officials or organizations, or any Muslims that opposed the Islamist agenda a takfir thereby justifying assassinations and attacks against them. Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who was later convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center attack, invoked Qutb's takfirist writings during his trial for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat.

Qutbism is considered a product of the extreme repression experienced by Qutb and his fellow Muslim Brothers under the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] regime, which was resulted from the 1954 Muslim Brothers plot to assassinate Nasser.

[[Salafi jihadism]] is a term coined by [[Gilles Kepel]] in 2002, referring to the ideology which actively promotes and conducts violence and [[terrorism]] in order to pursue the establishment of an [[Islamic state]] or a new [[Caliphate]].<ref name=kepel-orig>"Jihadist-Salafism" is introduced by Gilles Kepel, ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 2002)</ref><ref name=deneoux>Deneoux, Guilain (June 2002).

Distinct characteristics of Salafi Jihadism noted by Robin Wright include the formal process of taking ''[[bay'ah]]'' (oath of allegiance) to the leader, which is inspired by the Wahhabi teaching.<ref name="wright-12-12-16">{{cite journal |last=Wright|first=Robin|title=AFTER THE ISLAMIC STATE |journal=The New Yorker |date=December 12, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/12/after-the-islamic-state |access-date=9 December 2016 }}</ref> Another characteristic is its flexibility to cut ties with the less-popular movements when its strategically or financially convenient, exemplified by the relations between [[al-Qaeda]] and [[al-Nusra Front]].<ref name="wright-12-12-16" /> Other marked developments of Salafi Jihadism include the concepts of "near enemy" and "far enemy". "Near enemy" connotes the despotic regime occupying the Muslim society, and the term was coined by [[Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag]] in order to justify the assassination of [[Anwar al-Sadat]] by the Salafi Jihadi organization [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ) in 1981.<ref name="No">Noah, Timothy (February 26, 2009).

Salafi Jihadism emerged out during the 80s when the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invaded Afghanistan]].<ref name="By"/> Local [[mujahideen]] had extracted [[Operation Cyclone|financial, logistical and military support]] from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States. Later, [[Osama bin Laden]] established al-Qaeda as a transnational Salafi Jihadi organization in 1988 to capitalize this financial, logistical and military network and to expand their operation.<ref name="By">Byman, Daniel L and Williams, Jennifer R.

==History==
===Predecessor movements===
Some Islamic revivalist movements and leaders pre-dating Islamism include:
* [[Ahmad Sirhindi]] (~1564–1624) was part of a reassertion of orthodoxy within [[Islamic Mysticism]] (Taṣawwuf) and was known to his followers as the 'renovator of the second millennium'. It has been said of Sirhindi that he 'gave to Indian Islam the rigid and conservative stamp it bears today.'<ref>Massington, L., Radtke, B. Chittick, W.C., Jong, F. de., Lewisohn, L., Zarcone, Th., Ernst, C, Aubin, Françoise and J.O. Hunwick, “Taṣawwuf”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs</ref><ref>Qamar-ul Huda (2003), Striving for Divine Union: Spiritual Exercises for Suhraward Sufis, RoutledgeCurzon, pp. 1–4.</ref><ref>Mortimer, ''Faith and Power'', (1982) p. 58. Quoting Aziz Ahmad, ''Studies in Islamic Culture in the Indian Environment'', Oxford University Press, (1964), p. 189</ref>
* [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a Syrian Islamic jurist during the 13th and 14th centuries who is often quoted by contemporary Islamists. Ibn Taymiyya argued against the shirking of Sharia law, was against practices such as the celebration of Muhammad's birthday, and "he believed that those who ask assistance from the grave of the Prophet or saints, are mushrikin (polytheists), someone who is engaged in [[shirk (Islam)|shirk]]."<ref>Haque 1982, pp. 78–81.</ref>
* [[Shah Waliullah]] of India and [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]] of Arabia were contemporaries who met each other while studying in [[Mecca]].  [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]] advocated doing away with the later accretions like grave worship and getting back to the letter and the spirit of Islam as preached and practiced by [[Muhammad]]. He went on to found [[Wahhabism]]. Shah Waliullah was a forerunner of reformist Islamists like [[Muhammad Abduh]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]] and [[Muhammad Asad]] in his belief that there was "a constant need for new [[ijtihad]] as the Muslim community progressed and expanded and new generations had to cope with new problems" and his interest in the social and economic problems of the poor.<ref>Mortimer, ''Faith and Power'', (1982) pp. 67–68.</ref>
* [[Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi]] was a disciple and successor of Shah Waliullah's son who emphasized the 'purification' of Islam from un-Islamic beliefs and practices. He anticipated modern militant Islamists by leading an [[Islamic extremism|extremist]], [[jihadist]] movement and attempted to create an Islamic state based on the enforcement of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. While he battled [[Sikh Empire|Sikh fundamentalist rule]] in Muslim-majority North-Western India, his followers fought against [[British Raj|British colonialism]] after his death and allied themselves with the [[Indian Mutiny]].<ref>Mortimer, ''Faith and Power'', (1982), p. 69</ref>
* After the failure of the Indian Mutiny, some of Shah Waliullah's followers turned to more peaceful methods for preserving India's Islamic heritage and founded the [[Dar al-Ulum]] seminary in 1867 in the town of [[Deoband]]. From the school developed the [[Deobandi|Deobandi movement]] which became the largest [[philosophical movement]] of traditional Islamic thought on the subcontinent and led to the establishment of thousands of [[madrasah]]s throughout modern-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.<ref>''Islam and the Muslim World'', (2004) p. 374</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:HypnoDude.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jamal-al-Din al-Afghani]]]]

The end of the 19th century saw the dismemberment of most of the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire]] by non-Muslim European colonial powers.<ref>Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power'', (1982), p. 85</ref>  The empire spent massive sums on Western civilian and military technology to try to modernize and compete with the encroaching European powers, and in the process went deep into debt to these powers.

In this context, the publications of Jamal ad-din [[al-Afghani]] (1837–97), [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905) and [[Rashid Rida]] (1865–1935) preached Islamic alternatives to the political, economic, and cultural decline of the empire.<ref>Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power'', (1982), pp. 93, 237–40, 249</ref> Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida formed the beginning of the Islamist movement,<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'', Macmillan Reference, 2004, v.2, p. 609</ref><ref>''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' by Cyril Glasse, Rowman and Littlefield, 2001, p. 19</ref><ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' by John L. Esposito, OUP, 2003, p. 275
</ref><ref>''Historical Dictionary of Islam'' by Ludwig W. Wadamed, Scarecrow Press, 2001, p. 233</ref> as well as the reformist Islamist movement.

Their ideas included the creation of a truly Islamic society under sharia law, and the rejection of [[taqlid]], the blind imitation of earlier authorities, which they believed deviated from the true messages of Islam.<ref>''Passion for Islam: Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'' by Caryle Murphy, p. 46</ref>  Unlike some later Islamists, [[Islamic modernism|Early Salafiyya]] strongly emphasized the restoration of the [[Caliphate]].<ref>Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'' (1994), p. 33</ref>

While studying law and philosophy in England and Germany, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the [[All India Muslim League]].<ref name="Iqbal Academy Pakistan"/> He came back to [[Lahore]] in 1908. While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Maulana Mohammad Ali|Muhammad Ali Johar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian Nationalism|Indian nationalist]] and [[Secularism|secularist]] [[Indian National Congress]]. Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by [[Oxford University press]] in 1934 in a book titled [[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]].<ref name="bio-iqbalsworks">{{cite web|title=Allama Iqbal – biography – Iqbal's works|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/biography/biotxtread.html|publisher=Iqbal Academy|date=26 May 2006|format=PHP|access-date=6 August 2012}}</ref> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name="bio-iqbalsworks"/>

Iqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] and secular [[nationalism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and [[Muslim]] society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Syria]], he promoted ideas of [[Pan-Islamism|greater Islamic political co-operation and unity]], calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. Sir Mummad Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] as well as for the session in [[Lahore]] in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address]] on 29 December 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India. This address later inspired the [[Pakistan movement]].

The thoughts and vision of Iqbal later influenced many [[Reformism|reformist]] Islamists, e.g., [[Muhammad Asad]], [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] and [[Ali Shariati]].

Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law. Maududi founded the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising. His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative [[ulema]] but liberal modernizer Islamists such as [[al-Faruqi]], whose "[[Islamization of Knowledge]]" carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.

Maududi believed that Islam was all-encompassing: "Everything in the universe is 'Muslim' for it obeys God by submission to His laws... The man who denies God is called [[Kafir]] (concealer) because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/alummah2000/MeaningOfIslam.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026215131/http://geocities.com/alummah2000/MeaningOfIslam.html|archive-date=2009-10-26|title=A. Maududi's 'Towards Understanding Islam'|date=2009-10-26|access-date=2012-04-21}}</ref>

Maududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state. This state should be a "theo-democracy,"<ref>Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, "Political Theory of Islam," in Khurshid Ahmad, ed., ''Islam: Its Meaning and Message'' (London: Islamic Council of Europe, 1976), pp. 159–61.</ref> based on the principles of: ''[[tawhid]]'' (unity of God), ''[[risalah (fiqh)|risala]]'' (prophethood) and ''[[khilafa]]'' (caliphate).<ref>Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi, ''Islamic Way of Life'' (Delhi: Markazi Maktaba Islami, 1967), p. 40</ref><ref>Esposito and Piscatori, "Democratization and Islam," pp. 436–37, 440</ref><ref>Esposito, ''The Islamic Threat'', pp. 125–26; Voll and Esposito, ''Islam and Democracy'', pp. 23–26.</ref>

====Muslim Brotherhood====
{{main|Muslim Brotherhood}}
Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah, Egypt in 1928 by [[Hassan al Banna]]. His was arguably the first, largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization. Under the motto "the Qur'an is our constitution,"<ref>[http://www.youngmuslims.ca/online_library/books/tmott/ The Message of the Teachings – Hasan al-Banna] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928233732/http://www.youngmuslims.ca/online_library/books/tmott/ |date=September 28, 2008 }}</ref>
it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops. Like Maududi, Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the Muslim world.<ref>*{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=A genealogical inquiry into early Islamism: the discourse of Hasan al-Banna |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=61–85 |doi= 10.1080/13569317.2012.644986|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MURAGI }}</ref>

Some elements of the Brotherhood, though perhaps against orders, did engage in violence against the government, and its founder [[Hassan al Banna|Al-Banna]] was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi three months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/timeline_egypt.html|title=Egypt, A Timeline of Recent Events|publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com|access-date=2012-04-21}}</ref>  The Brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in Egypt and has been banned several times, in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], who jailed thousands of members for several years.

====Sayyid Qutb====
[[File:Sayyid Qutb.jpg|thumb|right|Sayyid Qutb]]
{{main|Sayyid Qutb}}
{{see also|Qutbism|Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq}}
Maududi's political ideas influenced Sayyid Qutb a leading member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] movement, and one of the key philosophers of Islamism and highly influential thinkers of Islamic universalism.<ref>*{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2014 |title=The Inclusive Dynamics of Islamic Universalism: From the Vantage Point of Sayyid Qutb's Critical Philosophy |journal=Comparative Philosophy |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=29–54 }}</ref> Qutb believed things had reached such a state that the Muslim community had literally ceased to exist. It "has been extinct for a few centuries,"<ref>Qutb, Sayyid, ''Milestones,'' The Mother Mosque Foundation, (1981), p. 9</ref> having reverted to Godless ignorance ([[Jahiliyya]]).

To eliminate jahiliyya, Qutb argued Sharia, or Islamic law, must be established. Sharia law was not only accessible to humans and essential to the existence of Islam, but also all-encompassing, precluding "evil and corrupt" non-Islamic ideologies like communism, nationalism, or secular democracy.

Qutb preached that Muslims must engage in a two-pronged attack of converting individuals through [[Dawah|preaching Islam]] peacefully and also waging what he called [[Offensive jihad|militant jihad]] so as to forcibly eliminate the "power structures" of Jahiliyya—not only from the Islamic homeland but from the face of the earth.

Qutb was both a member of the brotherhood and enormously influential in the Muslim world at large. Qutb is considered by some (Fawaz A. Gerges) to be "the founding father and leading theoretician" of modern jihadists, such as [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref>Fawaz A.

===Ascendance on international politics===
Islamic fervor was understood as a weapon that the United States could use as a weapon in its [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]] and its communist allies because communism professes [[atheism]]. In a September 1957 White House meeting between [[President of the United States | U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower | Eisenhower]] and senior U.S. foreign policy officials, it was agreed to use the communists' lack of religion against them by setting up a secret task force to deliver weapons to Middle East despots, including the Saudi Arabian rulers. "We should do everything possible to stress the 'holy war' aspect" that has currency in the Middle East, President Eisenhower stated in agreement.<ref>Annie Jacobsen, "Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins," (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 88</ref> 

====Six-Day War (1967)====
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
The quick and decisive defeat of the Arab troops during the Six-Day War by Israeli troops constituted a pivotal event in the Arab Muslim world. The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular [[Arab nationalism]] of the ruling regimes. A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics ensued. [[Ba'athism]], [[Arab socialism]], and [[Arab nationalism]] suffered, and different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements inspired by [[Maududi]] and [[Sayyid Qutb]] gained ground.<ref name="Mayer1">Mayer, p. 110</ref>

====Iranian Revolution (1978–1979)====
[[File:Roollah-khomeini.jpg|thumb|[[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]]]

{{Main|History of fundamentalist Islam in Iran}}
{{See also|Iranian Revolution|Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists}}
The first modern "Islamist state" (with the possible exception of Zia's Pakistan)<ref>"The Islamic Resurgence: Prospects and Implications" by Kemal A. Faruki, from ''Voices of Resurgent Islam'', ed. by John L. Esposito, OUP, (1983), p. 283</ref> was established among the [[Shia]] of Iran. In a major shock to the rest of the world, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] led the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in order to overthrow the oil-rich, well-armed, Westernized and pro-American secular monarchy ruled by Shah [[Muhammad Reza Pahlavi]].

The views of [[Ali Shariati]], the ideologue of the [[Iranian Revolution]], resembled those of [[Mohammad Iqbal]], the ideological father of the [[State of Pakistan]], but Khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of Shia Islam and the beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb. He believed that complete imitation of the [[Prophet Mohammad]] and his successors such as [[Ali]] for the restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West and therefore serving Western interests, and that acts such as the "plundering" of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by Western governments.<ref name="autogenerated6">Khomeini (1981), p. 54</ref>

His views differed from those of Sunni scholars in:
* As a [[Shia]],  Khomeini looked to [[Ali]] ibn Abī Tālib and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] Imam, but not Caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|Omar]] or [[Uthman]].
* Khomeini talked not about restoring the [[Caliphate]] or [[Sunni]] [[Islamic democracy]], but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or  the dictatorial political system was performed by Shia jurists (''[[ulama]]'') as the successors of [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|Shia Imams]] until the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] returns from [[occultation]]. His concept of ''[[velayat-e-faqih]]'' ("guardianship of the [Islamic] jurist"), held that the leading Shia Muslim cleric in society—which Khomeini's mass of followers believed and chose to be himself—should serve as the supervisor of the state in order to protect or "guard" Islam and ''Sharia'' law from "innovation" and "anti-Islamic laws" passed by dictators or democratic parliaments.<ref name="autogenerated6" />

The revolution was influenced by [[Marxism]] through Islamist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter Marxism ([[Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr]]'s work) or to integrate socialism and Islamism  ([[Ali Shariati]]'s work). A strong wing of the revolutionary leadership was made up of leftists or "radical populists", such as [[Ali Akbar Mohtashami-Pur]].<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997) pp. 103, 126</ref>

While initial enthusiasm for the Iranian revolution in the Muslim world was intense, it has waned as critics hold and campaign that "purges, executions, and atrocities tarnished its image".<ref>Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad,'' Harvard University Press, (2002), p. 118</ref>

The Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of [[United States-Iran relations|US economic sanctions]], and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan ([[SCIRI]])<ref>[[Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq#History]]</ref><ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', Basic Books, (1984), p. 233</ref> and Lebanon ([[Hezbollah]])<ref>"Hezbollah Terrorist Shia group is coy about revealing the sums it has received from Iran. ...

During the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], the Iranian government enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity amongst the predominantly Sunni "[[Arab street]],"<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=35720 'Removing Saddam strengthened Iran'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605124425/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=35720 |date=2011-06-05 }} Quote: "They went directly for the kind of things that make them very unpopular in the West and very popular on the Arab streets.

====Grand Mosque seizure (1979)====
{{further|Grand Mosque seizure}}
The strength of the Islamist movement was manifest in an event which might have seemed sure to turn Muslim public opinion against [[fundamentalism]], but did just the opposite. In 1979 the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] [[Saudi Arabia]] was seized by an armed fundamentalist group and held for over a week. Scores were killed, including many pilgrim bystanders<ref>Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p. 148</ref> in a gross violation of one of the most holy sites in Islam (and one where arms and violence are strictly forbidden).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdialogue.com/m22.htm |title=Masjid-ul-Haram: Sacred and forbidden |publisher=Ourdialogue.com |access-date=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420195838/http://www.ourdialogue.com/m22.htm |archive-date=20 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11''. New York: Knopf, (2006), pp.  103–04</ref>

Instead of prompting a backlash against the movement from which the attackers originated, however, Saudi Arabia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundamentalist credentials with even more Islamic restrictions. Crackdowns followed on everything from shopkeepers who did not close for prayer and newspapers that published pictures of women, to the selling of dolls, teddy bears (images of animate objects are considered [[haraam]]), and dog food (dogs are considered unclean).<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam,'' p. 155</ref>

In other Muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundamentalists, but against Islamic fundamentalism's foremost geopolitical enemy—the United States. Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] sparked attacks on American embassies when he announced:
<blockquote>It is not beyond guessing that this is the work of criminal [[American imperialism]] and international Zionism</blockquote> despite the fact that the object of the fundamentalists' revolt was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, America's major ally in the region. Anti-American demonstrations followed in the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Kuwait]]. The US Embassy in [[Libya]] was burned by protesters chanting pro-Khomeini slogans and the embassy in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan was burned to the ground.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'', p. 149</ref>

====Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979–1989)====
In 1979, the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan]], attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]]. The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims ([[mujahideen]]) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith. Leading this pan-Islamic effort was Palestinian sheikh [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam#Life in Pakistan and Afghanistan|Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]]. While the military effectiveness of these "[[Afghan Arabs]]" was marginal, an estimated 16,000<ref name=Atkins>{{cite book|last1=Atkins |first1=Stephen E.|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Worldwide Extremists and Extremist Groups|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofmo0000atki/page/35 35] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofmo0000atki|url-access=registration |quote=abdullah azzam afghanistan. |access-date=5 October 2014|isbn=978-0-313-32485-7}}</ref> to 35,000 Muslim volunteers<ref name=Commins-174 /> came from around the world to fight in Afghanistan.<ref name=Commins-174>{{cite book|last1=Commins|first1=David |title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia|url=https://archive.org/details/wahhabimissionsa0000comm|url-access=registration|date=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris & Co Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/wahhabimissionsa0000comm/page/174 174]|quote=In all, perhaps 35,000 Muslim fighters went to Afghanistan between 1982 and 1992, while untold thousands more attended frontier schools teeming with former and future fighters.}}</ref><ref name=rashid-129>Rashid, Ahmed, ''Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia'' (New Haven, 2000), p. 129.</ref>

When the Soviet Union abandoned the Marxist Najibullah regime and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 (the regime finally fell in 1992), the victory was seen by many Muslims as the triumph of Islamic faith over superior military power and technology that could be duplicated elsewhere.

<blockquote>The jihadists gained legitimacy and prestige from their triumph both within the militant community and among ordinary Muslims, as well as the confidence to carry their jihad to other countries where they believed Muslims required assistance.|<ref name=for-aff-bergen>[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101facomment84601/peter-bergen-alec-reynolds/blowback-revisited.html "blowback revisited"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129203155/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101facomment84601/peter-bergen-alec-reynolds/blowback-revisited.html |date=2007-11-29}} ''Foreign Affairs'' 2005 Peter Bergen</ref></blockquote>

The "veterans of the guerrilla campaign" returning home to [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], and other countries "with their experience, ideology, and weapons," were often eager to continue armed jihad.

The collapse of the Soviet Union itself, in 1991, was seen by many Islamists, including Bin Laden, as the defeat of a superpower at the hands of Islam. Concerning the $6&nbsp;billion in aid given by the US and Pakistan's military training and intelligence support to the mujahideen,<ref>{{cite news |title=How the CIA created Osama bin Laden |url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/24198 |date=2001-09-19 |newspaper=[[Green Left Weekly]] |access-date=2007-01-09}}</ref> bin Laden wrote: "[T]he US has no mentionable role" in "the collapse of the Soviet Union&nbsp;... rather the credit goes to God and the mujahidin" of Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anusha.com/osamaint.htm |title=bin Laden interview with Peter Arnett, March 1997 |publisher=Anusha.com |access-date=2012-06-08}}</ref>

====Persian Gulf War (1990–1991)====
Another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the Islamist movement was the [[Gulf War]], which brought several hundred thousand US and allied non-Muslim military personnel to Saudi Arabian soil to put an end to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s occupation of Kuwait. Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] dictator of neighboring [[Iraq]], attacked Kuwait (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy. Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.

These attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] pp. 205–17</ref>  One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Egypt]], a bloody civil war in [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|Algeria]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]'s terror attacks climaxing in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attack]].<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] p. 207</ref>

===Rise of Islamism by country===
====Afghanistan (Taliban)====
[[File:Flag of Taliban.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Taliban]]]]
{{main|Taliban}}
[[File:Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan (2015–present).svg|thumb|Military situation, as of 2017
{{legend|#ffffff|Under control of the Taliban, [[Al-Qaeda]], and [[Islamic Jihad Union|Allies]]}}]]
In Afghanistan, the mujahideen's victory against the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity, due to a vicious and destructive [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] between political and tribal warlords, making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth. In 1992, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] ruled by communist forces collapsed, and [[Islamic democracy|democratic Islamist]] elements of mujahdeen founded the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]. In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the [[Taliban]] rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.

The Taliban were spawned by the thousands of [[madrasah]]s the [[Deobandi]] movement established for impoverished [[Afghan refugees]] and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp. 26, 32</ref> The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading "an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs" under the label of Sharia to an entire country.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/447 Is Islamism a Threat? A Debate] ''Middle East Quarterly'', December 1999</ref> Their ideology was also described as being influenced by [[Wahhabism]], and the [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] [[jihadism]] of their guest [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'', (2000), pp. 132, 139</ref><ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World,'' (2004)</ref>

The Taliban considered "politics" to be against Sharia and thus did not hold elections. They were led by Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] who was given the title "[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]" or Commander of the Faithful, and a pledge of loyalty by several hundred Taliban-selected [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] clergy in April 1996. Taliban were overwhelmingly Pashtun and were accused of not sharing power with the approximately 60% of Afghans who belonged to other ethnic groups. (see: [[Taliban#Ideology]])<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp. 98, 101</ref>

The Taliban's hosting of [[Osama bin Laden]] led to an American-organized attack which drove them from power following the [[9/11 attacks]].<ref name=bbc-98-11-21>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/217947.stm |title=BBC article stating that bin Laden is "a man without sin" |work=BBC News |date=1998-11-21 |access-date=2012-06-08}}</ref>
Taliban are still very much alive and fighting a vigorous [[Taliban#Resurgence|insurgency]] with suicide bombings and armed attacks being launched against [[NATO]] and Afghan government targets.

====Algeria====
{{see also|Algerian Civil War|List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s}}
[[File:Islamic Salvation Front logo.jpg|thumb|The [[Islamic Salvation Front|FIS]] emblem]]
An Islamist movement influenced by Salafism and the jihad in Afghanistan, as well as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], was the FIS or Front Islamique de Salut (the [[Islamic Salvation Front]]) in Algeria. Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by [[Abbassi Madani]], and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, [[Ali Belhadj]]. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men. The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'état.

As Islamists took up arms to overthrow the government, the FIS's leaders were arrested and it became overshadowed by Islamist guerrilla groups, particularly the [[Islamic Salvation Army]], MIA and [[Armed Islamic Group]] (or GIA). A bloody and devastating [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] ensued in which between 150,000 and 200,000 people were killed over the next decade.

The civil war was not a victory for Islamists. By 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or had surrendered. The popularity of Islamist parties has declined to the point that "the Islamist candidate, Abdallah Jaballah, came a distant third with 5% of the vote" in the 2004 presidential election.<ref>"International: Freer and more peaceful; An election in Algeria," ''The Economist'', April 17, 2004. V.371, n. 8371; p. 56</ref>

====Bangladesh====
[[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] is the largest Islamist party in the country and supports the implementation of [[Sharia]] law and promotes the country's main right-wing politics. Since 2000, the main political opposition [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) has been allied with it and another Islamic party, [[Islami Oikya Jote]]. Some of their leaders and supporters, including former ministers and MPs, have been hanged for alleged war crimes during Bangladesh's [[Bangladesh Liberation War|struggle for independence]] and speaking against the ruling [[Bangladesh Awami League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Five men to die by hanging for Bangladesh 1971 war crimes |url=https://punchng.com/five-men-to-die-by-hanging-for-bangladesh-1971-war-crimes/ |access-date=30 December 2018 |work=Punch Newspapers |date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

==== Denmark ====
{{See also|Islam in Denmark|Terrorism in Denmark}}
The Islamist movements gradually grew since the 1990s. The first Islamist groups and networks were predominantly influenced by [[Immigration to Denmark|the countries they immigrated from]]. Those involved had close contact with militant Islamists in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. Their operations had supporting militant groups financially as their first priority. Since the 1990s, people from the Islamist movements joined several conflicts to train with or participate in fighting with Islamist militants.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=28 May 2014|title=Danske islamistiske miljøer med betydning for terrortruslen mod Danmark|url=https://pet.dk/Center%20for%20Terroranalyse/~/media/CTA/CTAanalyseMiljoeerDKpdf.ashx|access-date=16 August 2020|website=pet.dk|publisher=Danish Security and Intelligence Service Danish: Politiets Efterretningstjeneste (PET)}}</ref>

In the 2000s the Islamist movements grew and by 2014 there were militants among the Islamist movements in [[Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus]] and [[Odense]]. Several people from crime gangs join Islamist movements that sympathise with militant Islamism. The militant Islamist movement were estimated to encompass some hundreds in 2014.<ref name=":5" />

The Danish National Centre for Social Research released a report commissioned by the Ministry of Children, Integration and Social Affairs documenting 15 extremist groups operating in Denmark. The majority of these organizations were non-Muslim far-right or far-left groups, but five were Sunni Islamist groups. These Sunni Islamist groups include [[Hizb ut-Tahrir#Denmark|Hizb ut-Tahrir Denmark]], ''Dawah-bærere'' (Dawah Carriers), ''Kaldet til Islam'' (The Call to Islam), ''Dawah-centret'' (The Dawah Centre), and the ''Muslimsk Ungdomscenter'' (The Muslim Youth Centre). All of these Sunni Islamist groups operate in Greater Copenhagen with the exception of ''Muslimsk Ungdomscenter'', which operates in Aarhus. Altogether, roughly 195 to 415 Muslims belong to one of these organizations and most are young men.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobsen|2015|p=188}}</ref>

====Egypt (Jihadism)====
{{main|Islamic extremism in the 20th-century Egypt}}
While Qutb's ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in 1966, the leadership of the Brotherhood, led by [[Hasan al-Hudaybi]], remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism. Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s (particularly the manifesto ''Milestones'', a.k.a. ''[[Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq]]'') did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction.<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p. 332</ref> By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.

The path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization responsible for the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981. Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] group directed its attacks against what it believed were "apostate" leaders of Muslim states, leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies. Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag, in which he states:
<blockquote>...there is no doubt that the first battlefield for jihad is the extermination of these infidel leaders and to replace them by a complete Islamic Order...</blockquote>

Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was  [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] (Islamic Group). Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker ([[Rifaat al-Mahgoub]]), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/timeline_egypt.html |title=Timeline of modern Egypt |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |access-date=2012-06-08}}</ref>  Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]), renounced violence in 2003.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2006/04/200841010710321761.html |title=Egypt frees 900 Islamist militants |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |access-date=2012-04-21}}</ref> Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, [[Salvation from Hell]] and [[Takfir wal-Hijra]], and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.<ref>Mazih Ayubi, ''Political Islam'', 1991, p. 73</ref>

====Pakistan====
{{see also|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Objectives Resolution}}
Early in the history of the state of Pakistan (12 March 1949), a parliamentary resolution (the [[Objectives Resolution]]) was adopted in accordance with the [[Two nation theory|vision]] of founding fathers of [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistan]] ([[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]).<ref>"[http://therepublicofrumi.com/archives/liaquat19490309.html]"Objectives Resolution, Republic of Rumi {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107131744/http://therepublicofrumi.com/archives/liaquat19490309.html|date=November 7, 2014}}</ref> proclaiming:

{{quote |[[Sovereignty]] belongs to [[Allah]] alone but He has delegated it to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him as a sacred trust.
* The State shall exercise its powers and authority through the elected representatives of the people.
* The principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed.
* Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings of Islam as set out in the Quran and Sunnah.
* Provision shall be made for the religious minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures.}}

This resolution later became a key source of inspiration for writers of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], and is included in the constitution as preamble.

In July 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] overthrew Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]'s regime in Pakistan. Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.<ref>''Asian Survey'', 6, n. 29, William L. Richter, "The Political Dynamics of Islamic Resurgence in Pakistan."</ref> Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and "[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]]" or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his "official state ideology". Zia ul Haq was an admirer of [[Mawdudi]] and Mawdudi's party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] became the "regime's ideological and political arm".<ref>Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), pp. 98, 100–01</ref> In Pakistan this Islamization from above was "probably" more complete "than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan," but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing "symbols" rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power.<ref>Fuller, ''Future of Political Islam'', (2003), p. 131</ref> Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to "avoid revolutionary excess", and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies.<ref>Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), p. 98</ref> Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society.

====Sudan====
{{main|National Islamic Front|National Congress (Sudan)}}
For many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. His [[National Islamic Front]] first gained influence when strongman General [[Gaafar al-Nimeiry]] invited members to serve in his government in 1979. Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia. He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.<ref name="Fuller, Graham E. 2003 p. 108"/>

After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military. Turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power, but strict application of sharia law, torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition,<ref name="Human Rights Watch Report"/> and an intensification of the long-running war in southern Sudan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Sudan.htm#TopOfPage |title=Human Rights Watch 1989 Sudan |publisher=Hrw.org |access-date=2012-06-08}}</ref> once in power. The NIF regime also harbored [[Osama bin Laden]] for a time (before 9/11), and worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 [[Gulf War]].

After Sudanese intelligence services were implicated in an [[Hosni Mubarak#Assassination attempt in Ethiopia|assassination attempt]] on the President of Egypt, UN economic sanctions were imposed on Sudan, a poor country, and Turabi fell from favor.<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), pp. 213–15</ref> He was imprisoned for a time in 2004–05. Some of the NIF policies, such as the war with the non-Muslim south, have been reversed, though the National Islamic Front still holds considerable power in the government of [[Omar al-Bashir]] and [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]], another Islamist party in country.

==== Switzerland ====
Switzerland is not normally seen as a center of Islamism, especially when compared to countries such as Belgium or France. However, from 2012 to 2018, the majority of the country's jihadist and would-be jihadist population were radicalized in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/10/28/neutral-switzerlands-growing-islamist-and-jihadist-challenge/|title=Neutral Switzerland's Growing Islamist and Jihadist Challenge|website=Algemeiner.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>

[[Turkey]] had a number of Islamist parties, often changing names as they were banned by the constitutional court for anti-secular activities.  [[Necmettin Erbakan]] (1926–2011) was the leader of several of the parties, the [[National Order Party]] (''Milli Nizam Partisi'', 1970–1971), the [[National Salvation Party]] (''Milli Selamet Partisi'', 1972–1981), and the [[Welfare Party]] (''Refah Partisi'', 1983-1998); he also became a member of the [[Felicity Party]] (''Saadet Partisi'', 2003–2011). Current Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has long been considered a champion of political Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkish-leaders-political-star-rebounds-with-syria-invasion-11572372751|title=Turkish Leader's Political Star Rebounds With Syria Invasion|last=Gauthier-Villars|first=David|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>

These characterizations do not reflect the truth, and they sadden us,' Çelik said.}}</ref>

====Hizb ut-Tahrir====
{{main|Hizb ut-Tahrir}}
[[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] is an influential international Islamist movement, founded in 1953 by an Islamic [[Qadi]] ''(judge)'' [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]]. HT is unique from most other Islamist movements in that the party focuses not on implementation of Sharia on local level or on providing social services, but on unifying the Muslim world under its vision of a new Islamic [[caliphate]] spanning from North Africa and the Middle East to much of central and South Asia.

To this end it has drawn up and published a 186-article constitution for its proposed caliphate-state specifying specific policies such as sharia law, a "unitary ruling system" headed by a caliph elected by Muslims, an economy based on the [[gold standard]], public ownership of utilities, public transport, and energy resources, death for [[murtadd|apostates]] and Arabic as the "sole language of the State."<ref name = "The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State1">{{cite book |author=Hizb ut-Tahrir |title=The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State|url=http://www.hizb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Draft-Constitution.pdf |publisher=Khilafah|date=February 2011 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State2">{{cite web|title=Draft Constitution by Hizb ut-Tahrir|url=http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|publisher=Media Office of Hizb ut-Tahrir|access-date=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200116/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

In its focus on the Caliphate, the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as [[Muhammad Qutb]]. HT sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of [[Ali]], or one of the other four [[Rashidun|rightly guided Caliphs]] in the 7th century, but with the [[Caliph#Abolition of the institution|abolition]] of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1924. This is believed to have ended the true Islamic system, something for which it blames "the disbelieving (Kafir) colonial powers" working through Turkish modernist [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].<ref>an-Nabhani, Taqiuddin, ''The System of Islam'' (Nidham ul Islam), Al-Khilafa Publications, www.khilafah.com, 1423 AH – 2002 CE p. 58</ref>

HT does not engage in armed [[jihad]] or work for a democratic system, but works to take power through "ideological struggle" to change Muslim public opinion, and in particular through elites who will "facilitate" a "change of the government," i.e., launch a "bloodless" [[Coup d'état|coup]]. It allegedly attempted and failed such coups in 1968 and 1969 in Jordan, and in 1974 in Egypt, and is now banned in both countries.<ref>"Fighting the War of Ideas", Zeyno Baran. ''Foreign Affairs,'' Nov/December 2005</ref>

The party is sometimes described as "Leninist" and "rigidly controlled by its central leadership,"<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/148823 |title=For Allah and the caliphate |first=Malik |last=Shiv | date=13 September 2004 | work=New Statesman}}</ref> with its estimated one million members required to spend "at least two years studying party literature under the guidance of mentors ''([[Murshid]])''" before taking "the party oath."<ref name="autogenerated3" /> HT is particularly active in the ex-soviet republics of [[Central Asia]] and in [[Europe]].

Leiken and Steven Brooke) to have outpaced the Muslim Brotherhood in both membership and radicalism.<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62453/robert-s-leiken-and-steven-brooke/the-moderate-muslim-brotherhood "The Moderate Muslim Brotherhood"], Robert S.

====Post-Arab Spring (2011-present)====

One observer (Quinn Mecham) notes four trends in Islamism rising from the Arab Spring of 2010-11:
* The [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt#Post-2013 Egyptian coup d'état|repression]] of the Muslim Brotherhood. Primarily by the Egyptian military and courts following the forcible removal of [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|Morsi from office in 2013]]; but also by Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries (not Qatar).<ref name=Mecham>{{cite news|last1=Mecham|first1=Quinn|title=The evolution of Islamism since the Arab uprisings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/the-evolution-of-islamism-since-the-arab-uprisings/|access-date=28 October 2015|agency=Washington Post|date=October 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=brookings>{{cite web|title=Rethinking Political Islam|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/rethinking-political-islam|website=brookings.edu|publisher=Brookings|access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref>
* Rise of Islamist "[[state-building]]" where "state failure" has taken place—most prominently in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.  Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure, by securing external funding, weaponry and fighters—"many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity". The norms of governance in these Islamist areas are militia-based, and the population submit to their authority out of fear, loyalty, other reasons, or some combination.<ref name=Mecham/> The "most expansive" of these new "models" is the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].<ref name=Mecham/>
* Increasing sectarianism at least in part from [[Proxy War]]s. Fighters are proxies primarily for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states and for Iran. Islamists are fighting Islamists across sectarian lines in Lebanon (Sunni militants targeting [[Hezbollah]] positions), Yemen (between mainstream Sunni Islamists of [[Islah]] and the Shiite [[Zaydi]] [[Houthi]] movement), in Iraq (Islamic State and Iraqi Shiite militias)<ref name=Mecham/>
* Increased caution and political learning in countries such as Algeria and Jordan where Islamist have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments. In Yemen Islah "has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy".<ref name=Mecham/>
Another observer (Tarek Osman) notes with concern that
* the failure to take power during the Arab Spring has led not to "soul-searching" in major Islamist groups about what went wrong, but instead to "antagonism and fiery anger" and a thirst for revenge. Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [[Rached Ghannouchi]] but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose perpetrators are not just "individual conspirators but entire social groups".<ref name="osman-2016-244">{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Tarek|title=Islamism: What It Means for the Middle East and the World|date=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKZ5CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&q=fiery%20anger|access-date=18 October 2016|isbn=978-0300197723}}</ref>

==Background==
===Charitable work===
Islamist movements such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], "are well known for providing shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women's groups."  All this compares very favourably against incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric.<ref>Fuller, Graham E., ''The Future of Political Islam'', Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), p. 28</ref>

===Dissatisfaction with the status quo===
The [[Arab world]]—the original heart of the Muslim world—has been afflicted with [[economic stagnation]]. For example, it has been estimated that in the mid 1990s the exports of Finland, a country of five million, exceeded those of the entire Arab world of 260&nbsp;million, excluding oil revenue.<ref>''Commentary,'' "Defeating the Oil Weapon," September 2002</ref> This economic stagnation is argued to have commenced with the demise of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, with trade networks being disrupted and societies torn apart with the creation of new nation states; prior to this, the Middle East had a diverse and growing economy and more general prosperity.<ref name="autogenerated8">{{cite web|last=Thought |first=Enlightened |url=http://www.muslimdecline.blogspot.com/ |title=What went wrong in the Muslim World? |publisher=Muslimdecline.blogspot.com |date=2008-04-23 |access-date=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213180856/http://muslimdecline.blogspot.com/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 }}</ref>
[[File:Aksi 31 Maret 1.jpg|thumb|Protests against [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], Christian governor of Jakarta, 31 March 2017]]

Strong population growth combined with economic stagnation has created [[urban agglomerations]] in Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, [[Karachi]], [[Dhaka]], and [[Jakarta]] each with well over 12&nbsp;million citizens, millions of them young and unemployed or underemployed.<ref>Fuller, Graham E., ''The Future of Political Islam'', Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), p. 68</ref> Such a demographic, alienated from the [[Westernization|westernized]] ways of the urban elite, but uprooted from the comforts and more passive traditions of the villages they came from, is understandably favourably disposed to an Islamic system promising a better world<ref>Kepel, Gilles, ''Muslim extremism in Egypt: the prophet and Pharaoh'', Berkeley: University of California Press, (c2003), p. 218</ref>—an ideology providing an "emotionally familiar basis for group identity, solidarity, and exclusion; an acceptable basis for legitimacy and authority; an immediately intelligible formulation of principles for both a critique of the present and a program for the future."<ref>Lewis, Bernard, ''The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror'', (2003), p. 22</ref>

===Identity politics===
Islamism can also be described as part of [[identity politics]], specifically the religiously-oriented nationalism that emerged in the Third World in the 1970s: "[[Hindu nationalism|resurgent Hinduism]] in [[India]], [[Religious Zionism]] in [[Israel]], [[Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war|militant Buddhism in Sri Lanka]], resurgent [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale|Sikh nationalism]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], '[[Liberation Theology]]' of [[Catholicism]] in [[Latin America]], and Islamism in the Muslim world."<ref>Fuller, Graham E., ''The Future of Political Islam'', Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), pp. 70–71</ref>

===Islamic revival===
{{further|Islamic revival|Islam and modernity}}

The modern revival of Islamic devotion and the attraction to things Islamic can be traced to several events.

By the end of World War I, most Muslim states were seen to be dominated by the Christian-leaning Western states. It is argued that either the claims of Islam were false and the Christian or post-Christian West had finally come up with another system that was superior, or Islam had failed through not being true to itself. Thus, a redoubling of faith and devotion by Muslims was called for to reverse this tide.<ref>Edward Mortimer in ''Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam'', in Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', Simon & Schuster, (1985), pp. 64–66</ref>

The connection between the lack of an Islamic spirit and the lack of victory was underscored by the disastrous defeat of Arab nationalist-led armies fighting under the slogan "Land, Sea and Air" in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], compared to the (perceived) near-victory of the [[Yom Kippur War]] six years later. In that war the military's slogan was "God is Great".<ref>Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', pp. 64–66</ref>

Along with the Yom Kippur War came the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] where the (Muslim) Persian Gulf oil-producing states' dramatic decision to cut back on production and quadruple the price of oil, made the terms oil, Arabs and Islam synonymous—with power—in the world, and especially in the Muslim world's public imagination.<ref>Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', p. 66 from Pipes, Daniel, ''In the Path of God'', Basic Books, (1983), p. 285</ref>  Many Muslims believe as Saudi Prince Saud al Faisal did that the hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth obtained from the Persian Gulf's huge oil deposits were nothing less than a gift from God to the Islamic faithful.<ref>from interview by Robin Wright of UK Foreign Secretary (at the time) Lord Carrington in November 1981, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'', by Robin Wright, Simon & Schuster, (1985), p. 67</ref>

As the [[Islamic revival]] gained momentum, governments such as Egypt's, which had previously repressed (and was still continuing to repress) Islamists, joined the bandwagon. They banned alcohol and flooded the airwaves with religious programming,<ref name="Mu">Murphy, ''Passion for Islam'', (2002), p. 36</ref> giving the movement even more exposure.

===State-sponsorship===
====Saudi Arabia====
{{see also|International propagation of conservative Sunni Islam}}
Starting in the mid-1970s the Islamic resurgence was funded by an abundance of money from Saudi Arabian oil exports.<ref>Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam'', Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, (2002), pp. 69–75</ref> The tens of billions of dollars in "[[petro-Islam]]" largesse obtained from the recently heightened price of oil funded an estimated "90% of the expenses of the entire faith."<ref>Dawood al-Shirian, 'What Is Saudi Arabia Going to Do?' ''Al-Hayat'', May 19, 2003</ref>

Throughout the Muslim world, religious institutions for people both young and old, from children's [[madrasah|maddrassas]] to high-level scholarships received Saudi funding,<ref>Abou al Fadl, Khaled, ''The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, pp. 48–64</ref>
"books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques" (for example, "more than 1500 [[mosque]]s were built and paid for with money obtained from public Saudi funds over the last 50 years"),<ref>Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam'', Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, (2002), p. 72</ref>  along with training in the Kingdom for the preachers and teachers who went on to teach and work at these universities, schools, mosques, etc.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 155</ref>

The funding was also used to reward journalists and academics who followed the Saudis' strict interpretation of Islam; and satellite campuses were built around Egypt for [[Al-Azhar University]], the world's oldest and most influential Islamic university.<ref>Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam'', (2002) p. 32</ref>

The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based [[Wahhabism]] or [[Salafism]]. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only "always oppose" infidels "in every way," but "hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake," that democracy "is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century," that [[Shia]] and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were [[Apostasy in Islam|infidels]], etc.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/saudi-publications-hate-ideology-invade-american-mosques Saudi Publications on Hate Ideology] January 2006</ref> While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the "gold standard" of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25472708_ITM |title=An interview with Minister Mentor of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2004-09-24 |access-date=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713151408/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25472708_ITM |archive-date=July 13, 2009 }}</ref>

==== Qatar ====
[[Qatar]] stands out among state sponsors of Islamism as well. Over the past two decades, the country has exerted a semi-formal patronage for the international movement of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Former Qatari Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]] in particular has distinguished himself as one of the most dedicated supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and of Islamist movements in general both in the Middle Eastern region and across the globe.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/qatar-muslim-brotherhood.htm|title=Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

In 1999 the Muslim Brotherhood was disbanded in Qatar. The country's longstanding support for the group has been often explained as determined by a strategic calculus that limited the role played by religion in Qatar.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/0418/Behind-Qatar-s-bet-on-the-Muslim-Brotherhood|title=Behind Qatar's bet on the Muslim Brotherhood|last=Bryant|first=Christa Case|date=2014-04-18|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|issn=0882-7729|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref> As the director of the Center for International and Regional Studies at the Doha-based branch of Georgetown University, Mehran Kamrava, posited, Qatar presenting itself as the state patron of the Muslim Brotherhood has caused religion in Qatar to not "play any role in articulating or forming oppositional sentiments."<ref name=":0" />

Qatar's patronage has been primarily expressed through the ruling family's endorsement of Muslim Brotherhood's most representative figures, especially [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]. Qaradawi is a prominent, yet controversial Sunni preacher and theologian who continues to serve as the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. An Egyptian citizen, Qaradawi fled Egypt for Qatar in 1961 after being imprisoned under President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]]. In 1962 he chaired the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies, and in 1977 he founded and directed the Shariah and Islamic Studies department at the [[University of Qatar]]. He left Qatar to return to Egypt shortly before the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfis.edu.qa/files/pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20QFIS_Scholarships%202009-2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306151209/http://www.qfis.edu.qa/files/pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20QFIS_Scholarships%202009-2010.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-06 }}</ref>

For twenty years, Qaradawi has hosted a popular show titled Shariah and Life  on the Qatari-based media channel [[Al-Jazeera]], a government sponsored channel notoriously supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamism and often designated as a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Oren|date=2012-01-01|title=The Two Faces of Al Jazeera|url=http://www.meforum.org/3147/al-jazeera|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/02/19/why-egypt-hates-al-jazeera/|title=Why Egypt Hates Al Jazeera|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html|title=Qatar's Support of Islamists Alienates Allies Near and Far|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|date=2014-09-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref> From that platform, he has promoted his Islamist—and often radical views—on life, politics, and culture.

His positions, as well as his controversial ties to extremist and terrorist individuals and organizations, made him [[persona non grata]] to the U.S., UK and French governments respectively in 1999, 2008, and 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7232398.stm|title=Muslim cleric not allowed into UK|date=2008-02-07|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17512436|title=France election: Sarkozy vows ban on militant preachers|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

Beyond the visibility and political protection granted to Yussuf al-Qaradawi, Qatar has historically hosted several Muslim Brothers especially after Egyptian President [[Mohammed Morsi]], a Muslim Brotherhood representative, was overthrown in July 2013.<ref name=":1" /> Before 2013, however, Qatar had made a substantial investment on Morsi's leadership and had devolved about $10&nbsp;million to Egypt since Morsi was elected, allegedly also to "buy political advantage" in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23185441|title=Egypt crisis: Fall of Morsi challenges Qatar's new emir |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/af5d068a-e3ef-11e2-b35b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz49s9GGRrO|title=Fall of Egypt's Mohamed Morsi is blow to Qatari leadership|last=Kerr|first=Simeon|date=2013-07-03|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

Qatar's political and financial support for Islamist movements and factions was not limited to the Egyptian case. Qatar is known to have backed Islamist factions in Libya, Syria and Yemen.

In Libya in particular, Qatar has supported the Islamist government established in Tripoli.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://intpolicydigest.org/2015/12/13/uae-qatar-wage-proxy-war-libya/|title=The UAE and Qatar Wage a Proxy War in Libya|date=2015-12-13|website=International Policy Digest|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref> During the 2011 revolution that ousted President Muammar Gaddafi, Qatar provided "tens of millions of dollars in aid, military training and more than 20,000 tons of weapons" to anti-Gaddafi rebels and Islamist militias in particular.

Hamas, as well, has been among the primary beneficiaries of Qatar's financial support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/119705/why-does-qatar-support-known-terrorists|title=Qatar Is a U.S. Ally.

More recently, Qatar has channeled material support to Hamas' terrorist operations by exploiting its official commitment to finance [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] reconstruction. Mostly through "truckloads of construction material being shipped into Gaza", Qatar has funneled dual-use substances that could be employed to produce explosives into Gaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopterrorfinance.org/blog/510641507-is-gaza-reconstruction-aid-rearming-hamas|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010091756/http://stopterrorfinance.org/stories/510641507-is-gaza-reconstruction-aid-rearming-hamas|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-10-10|title=Is Gaza Reconstruction Aid Rearming Hamas?|first=CATF|last=Reports}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2016/Pages/goAttempt-to-smuggle-ammonium-chloride-into-Gaza-foiled-3-May-2016.aspx|title=Attempt to smuggle ammonium chloride into Gaza foiled 3 May 2016|website=GxMSDev|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/15/israel-lied-about-isil-soldiers-entering-gaza-to-justify-its-sie/|title=Israel lied about Isil soldiers entering Gaza to justify its siege, Hamas claims|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

Although it is a strong opponent of Israel's existence, [[Hamas]], officially created in 1987, traces back its origins to institutions and clerics supported by Israel in the 1970s and 1980s.

Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]{{spaced ndash}}whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (''[[infitah]]''); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|making peace with Israel]]—released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists.

:In the words of [[Bernard Lewis]]:

:<blockquote>For almost a thousand years, from the first Moorish landing in Spain to the second Turkish siege of Vienna, Europe was under constant threat from Islam. In the early centuries it was a double threat—not only of invasion and conquest, but also of conversion and assimilation. All but the easternmost provinces of the Islamic realm had been taken from Christian rulers, and the vast majority of the first Muslims west of Iran and Arabia were converts from Christianity ... Their loss was sorely felt and it heightened the fear that a similar fate was in store for Europe.<ref>Lewis, Bernard, ''Islam and the West'' Oxford University Press, p. 13, (1993)</ref></blockquote>

:The [[Islamic world]] was aware of this European fear and hatred{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and also felt its own anger and resentment at the much more recent technological superiority of westerners who,

:<blockquote>are the perpetual teachers; we, the perpetual students. Generation after generation, this asymmetry has generated an [[inferiority complex]], forever exacerbated by the fact that their innovations progress at a faster pace than we can absorb them. ... The best tool to reverse the inferiority complex to a [[superiority complex]] ... Islam would give the whole culture a sense of dignity.<ref>Hassan Hanafi, Islamist philosophy professor at Cairo University quoted in ''Passion for Islam''  by Caryle Murphy, p. 172</ref></blockquote>

:For Islamists, the primary threat of the West is cultural rather than political or economic. Cultural dependency robs one of faith and identity and thus destroys Islam and the Islamic community (''[[ummah]]'') far more effectively than political rule.<ref name="Haddad/Esposito1">Haddad/Esposito p. xvi</ref>

===Counter-response===
The U.S. government has engaged in efforts to counter militant Islamism ([[Jihadism]]), since 2001. These efforts were centred in the U.S. around [[public diplomacy]] programmes conducted by the State Department. There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Jihadism. Christian Whiton, an official in the [[George W.
