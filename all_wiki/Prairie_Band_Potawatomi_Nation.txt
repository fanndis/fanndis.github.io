'''Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation''' (formerly the '''Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians''') is a [[federally recognized tribe]] of '''[[Anishinaabe|Neshnabé]]''' ([[Potawatomi]] people), headquartered near [[Mayetta, Kansas]].

==History==
The '''''Mshkodésik'''''<!--Unsyncoped PO: Meshkodésik; OJ: Mashkodensiig--> ("People of the Small Prairie") division of the Potawatomi were originally located around the southern portions of [[Lake Michigan]], in what today is southern [[Wisconsin]], northern [[Illinois]] and northwestern [[Indiana]]. Due to their name in the [[Potawatomi language]], the ''Mshkodésik'' were often confused with another tribe, the [[Mascoutens]]. As part of the [[Council of Three Fires]], the Prairie Band were signatories to the 1829 [[Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien]] ({{USStat|7|320}}). Independently of the Council of Three Fires, the Prairie Band were also signatories to the 1832 [[Treaty of Tippecanoe]] ({{USStat|7|378}}) as the '''Potawatomi Tribe of Indians of the Prairie'''.

Under the [[Indian Removal Act]], the Prairie Band were forcibly relocated west, first to [[Missouri]]'s Platte Country in the mid-1830s and then to the vicinity of [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] in the 1840s, where they were known as the '''Bluff Indians'''. The tribe controlled up to five million acres (20,000&nbsp;km²) at both locations. After 1846, the tribe moved to present-day Kansas. At that time, the reservation was thirty square miles which included part of present-day [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]].

During the period from the 1940s - 1960s, in which the [[Indian termination policy]] was enforced, four [[Kansas]] tribes, including the Potawatomi were targeted for termination. One of the first pieces of legislation enacted during this period was the [[Kansas Act of 1940]] which transferred all jurisdiction for crimes committed on or against Indians from federal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas. It did not preclude the federal government from trying native people, but it allowed the state into an area of law in which had historically belonged only to the federal government.<ref name="Kansas Law Review, Vol 59 (2011)">

On 1 August 1953, the [[US Congress]] passed [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]] which called for the immediate termination of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Klamath people|Klamath]], [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]], as well as all tribes in the states of [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], and [[Texas]].  Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.<ref>''US Statutes at Large'' 67:B132</ref> A memo issued by the [[Department of the Interior]] on 21 January 1954 clarified that the reference to "Potawatomi" in the Resolution meant the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation, the [[Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas|Kickapoo]], the [[Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska|Sac and Fox]] and the [[Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska|Iowa]] tribes in Kansas.<ref name="bia.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc012737.pdf |title=Data |website=www.bia.gov |access-date=2014-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610043006/http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc012737.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the [[Kansas Act of 1940]] the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination.<ref name="bia.gov"/> In February, 1954 joint hearings for the Kansas tribes were held by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs.<ref name="Davis: Native America (1996)">{{cite book
