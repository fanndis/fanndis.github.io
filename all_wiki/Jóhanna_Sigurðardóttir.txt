==Political career==
Jóhanna was [[1978 Icelandic parliamentary election|elected to the Althing in 1978]] on the list of the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]] for the Reykjavík constituency.<ref name="CVAlthingi">{{cite web |url=http://www.althingi.is/cv_en.php4?ksfaerslunr=17 |title=Members of Parliament: Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir |website=Secretariat of Althingi |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> She enjoyed early success in her parliamentary career, serving as deputy speaker of the [[Althing]] (Iceland's parliament) in 1979 and in 1983–84. She was elected vice-chairman of the Social Democratic Party in 1984, a post she held until 1993. She was also [[Minister of Social Affairs (Iceland)|Minister of Social Affairs]] in four separate [[Cabinet of Iceland|Cabinets]] from 1987 to 1994,<ref name="CVMinistry"/> when she left the Social Democratic Party after losing the leadership contest to form a new party, [[National Awakening (Iceland)|National Awakening]]; the two parties remerged in 2000 to form the present [[Social Democratic Alliance]]. Her 1994 declaration ''Minn tími mun koma!'' ("My time will come!"), after she lost the contest for the leadership of the Social Democratic party, has become an iconic phrase in the [[Icelandic language]].<ref name="Indy">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/world-gets-its-first-gay-leader-1519068.html |title=World gets its first gay leader |first=Peter |last=Popham |date=29 January 2009 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London, UK |accessdate=23 March 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011143310/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/world-gets-its-first-gay-leader-1519068.html |archive-date=11 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/johanna-sigurdardottir-profile |title=Profile: Johanna Sigurdardottir |first=Valur |last=Gunnarsson |date=30 January 2009 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, UK |accessdate=23 March 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905180749/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/iceland-elects-gay-prime-minister |archive-date=5 September 2013}}</ref>

The [[2007 Icelandic parliamentary election|2007 elections]], in which she stood in the Reykjavík North constituency, saw the return of the Social Democratic Alliance to government in coalition with the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], and Jóhanna was named [[Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security (Iceland)|Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security]].<ref name="CVAlthingi" />

===Prime Minister===
====Icelandic financial crisis, protests and elections====
On 26 January 2009, Prime Minister [[Geir Haarde]] tendered the coalition government's resignation to the [[President of Iceland]], [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/news-and-articles/nr/3348 |title=Prime Minister Formally Tenders Government's Resignation |date=26 January 2009 |website=Prime Minister's Office |accessdate=23 March 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515015710/http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/news-and-articles/nr/3348 |archive-date=15 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.utanrikisraduneyti.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4746 |title=Iceland's coalition government resigns |date=26 January 2009 |website=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |access-date=23 March 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006100958/http://eng.utanrikisraduneyti.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4746 |archive-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> The move followed [[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests|fourteen weeks of protests]] over the government's handling of the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|financial crisis]], protests that had intensified from 20 January.

After talks with the leaders of the five parties represented in the Althing, the President asked the Social Democratic Alliance and the [[Left-Green Movement]] to form a new government and to prepare for elections in the spring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2009/01/27/new-icelandic-government-being-negotiated/ |title=New Icelandic government under negotiation |date=27 January 2009 |website=[[IceNews]] |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref>

Jóhanna was proposed as Prime Minister for the new government; two reasons for this were her popularity among the general public and her good relations with the Left-Green Movement. An opinion poll by [[The Gallup Organization|Capacent Gallup]] in December 2008 found 73% approval of her actions as a minister, more than any other member of the [[Cabinet of Iceland|Cabinet]]: she was also the only minister to have improved her approval ratings over 2008.<ref name="IceRev">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&ew_0_a_id=319005 |title=Sigurdardóttir Ready to Become Iceland's PM |date=27 January 2009 |magazine=[[Iceland Review]] |accessdate=23 March 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114072010/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&ew_0_a_id=319005 |archive-date=14 January 2010}}</ref>

The new government needed the support of the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] in the Althing.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Hörður Kristjánsson |title=Ríkisstjórn Jóhönnu Sigurðardóttur tekur við völdum klukkan sex í dag |url=https://www.vb.is/frettir/rikisstjorn-johonnu-sigurardottur-tekur-vi-voldum-/8764/?q=Innlent |accessdate=26 October 2020 |work=[[Viðskiptablaðið]] |date=1 February 2009 |language=Icelandic}}</ref> Negotiations continued up to the evening of 31 January, and the new Cabinet was appointed on 1 February. Independent polling showed that Jóhanna and [[Steingrímur J.

The Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, which formed the outgoing [[coalition government]] under Jóhanna, both made gains and together had an overall majority of seats in the Althing. The Progressive Party also made gains, and the new [[Citizens' Movement (Iceland)|Citizens' Movement]], formed after the January 2009 protests, gained four seats. The Independence Party, which had been in power for eighteen years until January 2009, lost a third of its support and nine seats in the Althing. On 10 May 2009, the new government was announced, with Jóhanna staying on as Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=40764&ew_0_a_id=323845 |title=New Government Agreement for Iceland Announced |date=10 May 2009 |magazine=Iceland Review |accessdate=17 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217172749/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=40764&ew_0_a_id=323845 |archive-date=17 February 2012}}</ref>

====Overcoming the financial crisis====
There were several referenda to decide about the [[Icesave dispute|Icesave]] Icelandic bank debts, center of the country's financial crisis. The first [[2010 Icelandic loan guarantees referendum|Icesave referendum]] ({{lang-is|Þjóðaratkvæðagreiðsla um Icesave}}), was held on 6 March 2010.<ref name="bbc6march">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8467936.stm |title=Icesave referendum set for 6 March |date=19 January 2010 |website=BBC News |accessdate=19 January 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121032416/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8467936.stm |archivedate=21 January 2010}}</ref> The proposal was resoundingly defeated, with 93% voting against and less than 2% in favor.

After the referendum, new negotiations commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Althing agreed to a repayment deal to pay back the full amount starting in 2016, finalising before 2046, with a fixed interest rate of 3%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/economie/2448585/ijslandse-parlement-stemt-in-met-icesave-deal.html |title=IJslandse parlement stemt in met Icesave-deal |trans-title=Icelandic parliament approves Icesave deal |date=16 February 2011 |website=[[NU.nl]] |language=nl |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref> The Icelandic president once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February, calling for a new referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/20/iceland-president-referendum-icesave |title=Iceland president triggers referendum on Icesave repayments |last=Kollewe |first=Julia |date=20 February 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/economie/2451318/president-ijsland-tekent-icesave-akkoord-niet.html |title=President IJsland tekent Icesave-akkoord niet |trans-title=President of Iceland does not sign Icesave agreement |date=20 February 2011 |website=NU.nl |language=nl |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref> Thus, a [[2011 Icelandic loan guarantees referendum|second referendum]] would be held on 9 April 2011 also resulting in "no" victory with a lesser percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/uk/news/article_1622043.php/Iceland-to-hold-April-referendum-on-overseas-bank-compensation-plan |title=Iceland to hold April referendum on overseas bank compensation plan |date=25 February 2011 |website=[[Monsters and Critics]] |accessdate=12 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092618/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/uk/news/article_1622043.php/Iceland-to-hold-April-referendum-on-overseas-bank-compensation-plan |archivedate=27 February 2011}}</ref> After the referendum failed to pass, the British and Dutch governments said that they would take the case to the [[EFTA Court|European courts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ph.msn.com/business/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4770184 |title=Iceland government says not threatened by referendum defeat |website=[[MSN]] |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2011 |archive-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404150347/http://www.msn.com/en-ph/news?cp-documentid=4770184 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

At a session on 28 September 2010, the Althing voted 33–30 to indict the former Prime Minister Geir Haarde, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=368276 |title=Iceland's Former PM Taken to Court |date=28 September 2010 |magazine=Iceland Review |accessdate=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325065640/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=368276 |archive-date=25 March 2011}}</ref> He stood trial before the ''[[Landsdómur]]'', a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office, used for the first time since it was established in the 1905 [[Constitution of Iceland|Constitution]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3831879.ece |title=Islands tidligere statsminister stilles for riksrett |trans-title=Iceland's former prime minister prepared for impeachment |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency|NTB]] |date=28 September 2010 |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |location=Oslo, Norway |language=no |accessdate=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001222900/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3831879.ece |archivedate=1 October 2010}}</ref> He was convicted of one charge.

====New Icelandic constitution process====

Once in power, the left coalition led by Jóhanna—comprising the Social Democratic Alliance, the Left-Green Movement, the Progressive Party and the [[Liberal Party (Iceland)|Liberal Party]]—inspired largely by the citizen protests, agreed to convene a constitutional assembly to discuss changes to the [[Constitution of Iceland|Constitution]], in use since 1905.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=319192 |title=Iceland to Convene Constitutional Parliament |date=30 January 2009 |magazine=Iceland Review |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223214139/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=319192 |archive-date=23 February 2009}}</ref>

Taking its cue from nationwide protests and lobbying efforts by civil organisations, the new governing parties decided that Iceland's citizens should be involved in creating a new constitution and started to debate a bill on 4 November 2009 about that purpose. Parallel to the protests and parliament deliverance, citizens started to unite in grassroots-based think-tanks. A National Forum was organised on 14 November 2009, [[Þjóðfundur 2009]], in the form of an assembly of Icelandic citizens at the [[Laugardalshöll]] in [[Reykjavík]], by a group of [[grassroots]] citizen movements collectively called "the Anthill". 1,500 people were invited to participate in the assembly; of these, 1,200 were chosen at random from the national registry. On 16 June 2010 the Constitutional Act was finally accepted by parliament and a new Forum was summoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thjodfundur2010.is/other_files/2010/doc/Act-on-a-Constitutional-Assembly.pdf |title=Act on a Constitutional Assembly |date=16 June 2010 |website=Thjodfundur 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thjodfundur2010.is/frettir/lesa/item32858/ |title=The main conclusions from the National Forum 2010 |website=Thjodfundur 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> The Constitutional Act prescribed that the participants of the Forum had to be randomly sampled from the National Population Register. The Forum 2010 came into being due to the efforts of both governing parties and the Anthill group. A seven-member Constitutional Committee, appointed by the parliament, was charged with the supervision of the forum and the presentation of its results, while the organization and facilitation of the National Forum 2010 was done by the Anthill group that had organized the first Forum 2009.

The process continued in the [[2010 Icelandic Constitutional Assembly election|election of 25 people]] of no political affiliation on 26 October 2010.
