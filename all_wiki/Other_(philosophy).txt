[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], identified the Other as one of the conceptual bases of [[intersubjectivity]], of the relations among people.]]

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the terms '''the Other''' and '''the Constitutive Other''' identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the [[self-image]] of a person; as acknowledgement of [[Reality|being real]]; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.<ref name="Philosophy p. 637">''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.</ref><ref>"The Other", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, (1999) p. 620.</ref> The Constitutive Other is the relation between the [[personality]] (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; the relation of [[Essentialism|essential]] and superficial characteristics of [[personal identity]] that corresponds to the relationship between opposite, but correlative, characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hegel, G.

The condition and quality of '''Otherness''' (the characteristics of the Other) is the state of being different from and alien to the [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] of a person and to the [[identity (philosophy)|identity of the Self]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Miller, J.|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods|chapter-url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/research/n304.xml|chapter=Otherness|website=The SAGE encyclopedia of qualitative research methods.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=588–591|doi=10.4135/9781412963909.n304|date=2008|isbn=9781412941631}}</ref> In the [[discourse]] of philosophy, the term Otherness identifies and refers to the characteristics of ''Who?'' and ''What?'' of the Other, which are distinct and separate from [[the Symbolic]] order of things; from [[the Real]] (the authentic and unchangeable); from the [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] ([[art]], [[beauty]], [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]); from [[political philosophy]]; from [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s and [[identity (social science)|social identity]]; and from the [[Self]]. Therefore, the condition of Otherness is a person's non-conformity to and with the social norms of society; and Otherness is the condition of [[disenfranchisement]] (political exclusion), effected either by the [[State (polity)|State]] or by the social institutions (e.g., the [[profession]]s) invested with the corresponding socio-political [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Therefore, the imposition of Otherness [[Social alienation|alienates]] the person labelled as "the Other" from the centre of society, and places him or her at the margins of society, for being the Other.<ref>"Otherness", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.</ref>

The term '''Othering''' describes the reductive action of labelling and defining a person as a [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]], as someone who belongs to the socially subordinate category of the Other. The practice of Othering excludes persons who do not fit the norm of the [[social group]], which is a version of the Self;<ref>"Othering", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.</ref> likewise, in [[human geography]], the practice of othering persons means to exclude and displace them from the social group to the margins of society, where mainstream social norms do not apply to them, for being the Other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=328}}</ref>

==Background==
===Philosophy===
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Idealism|idealist]] philosopher G. W. F. Hegel introduced the concept of the Other as constituent part of human preoccupation with the Self.]]
The concept of the [[Self]] requires the existence of '''the constitutive Other''' as the counterpart entity required for '''defining the Self'''; in the late 18th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of [[self-consciousness]] (preoccupation with the Self),<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 1, p. 76.</ref> which complements the propositions about [[self-awareness]] (capacity for introspection) proffered by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814).<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 8, p. 186.</ref> See: ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807)

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as the basis for [[intersubjectivity]], the psychological relations among people. In ''[[Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology]]'' (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an ''alter ego'', as an ''other self''. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.<ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/>

In ''[[Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]]'' (1943), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person's life, and not as a radical threat to the [[existence]] of the Self. In that mode, in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel's dialectic of the "[[Master–slave dialectic|Lord and Bondsman]]" (''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'', 1807) and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society's treatment and mistreatment of women.

===Psychology===
The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) and the philosopher of ethics [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the constitutive Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with [[The Symbolic|the symbolic order]] of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of [[scripture]] and [[tradition]]; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter (wherein a person is morally responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysical pure-presence]]. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of [[alterity]]) personified in a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas's analysis of the distinction between "[[the saying and the said]]"; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of [[ethics]] over [[metaphysics]].

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. [[R. D. Laing]]), the Other identifies and refers to [[The unconscious|the unconscious mind]], to [[silence]], to [[insanity]], and to language ("to what is referred and to what is unsaid").<ref>''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999 )p. 620.</ref> Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to [[relativism]] if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of [[truth]]. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce [[Ontology|ontological divisions]] of reality: of [[being]], of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and of [[existence]].<ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/>

===Ethics===
[[File:Emmanuel Levinas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The philosopher of [[ethics]] [[Emmanuel Lévinas]] said that the infinite demand the Other places on the Self makes ethics the foundation of human existence and philosophy.]]
In ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority]]'' (1961), Emmanuel Lévinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the constitutive Other to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute ''[[alterity]]'' — the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network, into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over [[ontology]] in real life.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) p. 637.</ref>

From that perspective, Lévinas described the nature of the Other as "insomnia and wakefulness"; an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, the Otherness of the person remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Lévinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

{{quotation|The others that obsess me in the Other do not affect me as examples of the same [[genus]] united with my neighbor, by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block. . . . The others concern me from the first. Here, fraternity precedes the commonness of a genus. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others. — [[Otherwise than Being|''Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence'']]<ref>Lévinas, E., ''Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence'' (Berlin / Heidelberg: Springer Science+Business Media, 1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3eLdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT232 p. 232].</ref>{{rp|232}}}}

===Critical theory===
Jacques Derrida said that the absolute ''[[alterity]]'' of the Other is compromised, because the Other person is ''other than'' the Self and the group. The logic of ''alterity'' (otherness) is especially negative in the realm of [[human geography]], wherein the native Other is denied [[Ethics|ethical priority]] as a person with the right to participate in the geopolitical discourse with an empire who decides the colonial fate of the homeland of the Other. In that vein, the language of Otherness used in [[Oriental Studies]] perpetuates the cultural perspective of the dominantor–dominated relation, which is characteristic of [[hegemony]]; likewise, the sociologic misrepresentation of ''the feminine'' as the sexual Other to man reasserts [[male privilege]] as the primary voice in social discourse between women and men.<ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/>

In ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), the geographer [[Derek Gregory]] said that the U.S. government's ideologic answers to questions about reasons for the terrorist attacks against the U.S. (i.e. 11 September 2001) reinforced the imperial purpose of the negative representations of the Middle-Eastern Other; especially when President G. W. Bush (2001–2009) rhetorically asked: "Why do they hate us?" as political prelude to the [[War on Terror]] (2001).<ref>''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 21.</ref> Bush's rhetorical interrogation of armed resistance to empire, by the non–Western Other, produced an Us-and-Them mentality in American relations with the non-white peoples of the Middle East; hence, as foreign policy, the War on Terror is fought for control of imaginary geographies, which originated from the [[Fetishism|fetishised]] cultural representations of the Other invented by Orientalists; the cultural critic [[Edward Saïd]] said that:

{{quotation|To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and natural—our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.|''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.<ref>Gregory, Derek. ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.</ref>}}

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] world system of nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European [[Imperialism|imperial system]] of economic and settler [[Colonialism|colonies]] in which "the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] and [[Hierarchy|subordination]]."<ref>Johnston, R.J., ''et al''., ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 4th Edition Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. p. 375.</ref> In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires "provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony]."<ref>Gelvin, James L. ''The Modern Middle East: A History'', 2nd ed. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 39–40.</ref>

=== Racism ===
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific racism of the Other: In the late-19th century, H. Strickland Constable justified anti-Irish racism by claiming similarity between the cranial features of "the Irish-Iberian" man (left) and "the Negro" man (right), as proof that each type of man is racially inferior to the Anglo-Teutonic man (centre) possessed of the cranial ideal.]]

The racialist perspective of 19th-century Europe was invented with the Othering of non-white peoples, which also was supported with the fabrications of [[scientific racism]], such as the pseudo-science of [[phrenology]], which claimed that, in relation to a white-man's head, the head-size of the non-European Other indicated inferior intelligence; e.g. the [[Apartheid|Apartheid-era]] cultural representations of [[coloured people]] in [[South Africa]] (1948–94).<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|page = 332}}</ref>

Consequent to the Nazi [[Holocaust]] (1941–1945), with documents such as ''[[The Race Question]]'' (1950) and the ''[[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'' (1963), the United Nations officially declared that racial differences are insignificant to anthropological likeness among human beings. Despite the UN's factual dismissal of [[racialism]], in the U.S., the institutional Othering continues in government forms that ask a citizen to identify and place him or herself into a [[Race (human categorization)|racial category]];<ref name=":0" /> thus, institutional Othering produces the cultural misrepresentation of political refugees as ''illegal immigrants'' (from overseas) and of immigrants as ''illegal aliens'' (usually from México).

===Orientalism===
To the European peoples, imperialism (military conquest of non-white peoples, annexation, and economic integration of their countries to the motherland) was intellectually justified by [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]], the study and [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of the [[Eastern world]] as "primitive peoples" requiring modernisation by way of the [[civilising mission]]. Colonial empire was justified and realised with essentialist and reductive [[Representation (arts)|representations]] (of people, places, and cultures) in books and pictures and fashion, which conflated different cultures and peoples into the binary relation of [[The Orient]] and [[The Occident]]. Orientalism creates the [[Reification (fallacy)|artificial existence]] of the Western Self and the non–western Other.<ref>Orientalism, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory'' Third Edition (1991), Ja.A. Cuddon, Ed., pp. 660–661.</ref> Orientalists rationalised the cultural artifice of a [[Essence|difference of essence]], between white and non-white peoples, in order to fetishize (identify, classify, subordinate) the peoples and cultures of Asia into "the Oriental Other" — who exists ''in opposition to'' the Western Self.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 27 January 2016|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography}}</ref> As a function of imperial ideology, [[Orientalism]] fetishizes people and things in three actions of [[cultural imperialism]]: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are one folk); (ii) Feminization (the Oriental always is subordinate in the East–West relation); and (iii) Essentialization (a people possess universal characteristics); thus established by Othering, the empire's [[cultural hegemony]] reduces to inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, as measured against the West, the standard of superior civilisation.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Patheon Books|year = 1978|location = New York}}</ref>

===The subaltern native===
[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|right|The ''subaltern native'' is a colonial identity for the Other, which conceptually derives from the [[Cultural hegemony]] work of [[Antonio Gramsci]], an Italian Marxist intellectual.]]

Colonial stability requires the [[Cultural imperialism|cultural subordination]] of the non-white Other for transformation into the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]]; a colonised people who facilitate the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation of their labour]], of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country. The practise of Othering justifies the physical domination and cultural subordination of the native people by degrading them — first from being a national-citizen to being a colonial-subject — and then by displacing them to the periphery of the colony, and of geopolitical enterprise that is imperialism.<ref>Ashcroft, B., [[Gareth Griffiths (academic)|Griffiths, G.]], & [[Helen Tiffin|Tiffin, H.]], ''Post-Colonial Studies: The Key Concepts'' (London and New York: [[Routledge]], 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jCSCAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA142 p. 142].</ref>

Using the false dichotomy of "colonial strength" (imperial power) against "native weakness" (military, social, and economic), the coloniser invents the non-white Other in an artificial dominator-dominated relationship that can be resolved only through [[racialist]] ''noblesse oblige'', the "moral responsibility" that psychologically allows the colonialist Self to believe that imperialism is a [[civilising mission]] to educate, convert, and then culturally assimilate the Other into the empire — thus transforming the "civilised" Other into the Self.<ref>Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) pp. 76–77.</ref> See: ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942), by [[Albert Camus]]

In establishing a colony, Othering a non-white people allows the colonisers to physically subdue and "civilise" the natives to establish the [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchies of domination]] (political and social) required for exploiting the subordinated natives and their country.<ref name="Mountz, A. 2016">Mountz, A. (n.d.). ''The Other''. Key Concepts in Political Geography, pp. 328–338. Retrieved 2 February 2016.</ref> As a function of empire, a settler colony is an economic means for profitably disposing of two demographic groups: (i) the colonists (surplus population of the motherland) and (ii) the colonised (the subaltern native to be exploited) who antagonistically define and represent the Other as separate and apart from the colonial Self.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikiwash.metronews.ca/other/703349669-703223196|title=WikiWash|website=wikiwash.metronews.ca}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> See: ''[[Burmese Days]]'' (1934), by [[George Orwell]]

Othering establishes unequal relationships of power between the colonised natives and the colonisers, who believe themselves [[Essence|essentially superior]] to the natives whom they othered into racial inferiority, as the non-white Other.<ref name="Colonialism. 2016">"Colonialism", ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', pp. 94–98. Retrieved 2 February 2016.</ref> That dehumanisation maintains the false binary-relations of social class, [[caste]], and [[race (human categorization)|race]], of sex and gender, and of nation and religion.<ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"/> The profitable functioning of a colony (economic or settler) requires continual protection of the cultural demarcations that are basic to the unequal [[socioeconomic status|socio-economic relation]] between the "civilised man" (the colonist) and the "savage man", thus the transformation of the Other into the colonial subaltern.<ref name="Colonialism. 2016"/> See ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1994), by Edward Saïd

==Gender and sex==

===LGBT identities ===
The [[social exclusion]] function of Othering a person or a social group from mainstream society to the social margins — for being essentially different from the [[societal norm]] (the plural Self) — is a socio-economic function of gender. In a society wherein man–woman [[heterosexuality]] is the sexual norm, the Other refers to and identifies [[lesbian]]s (women who love women) and [[gay]]s (men who love men) as people of [[Homosexuality|same-sex orientation]] whom society has othered as "sexually deviant" from the norms of binary-gender heterosexuality.<ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/> In practise, sexual Othering is realised by applying the negative denotations and connotations of the terms that describe lesbian and gay, [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people, in order to diminish their personal social status and [[political power]], and so displace their LGBT communities to the legal margin of society. To neutralise such cultural Othering, LGBT communities ''queer'' a city, by creating social spaces that use the spatial and temporal plans of the city to allow the LGBT communities free expression of their [[social identity|social identities]], e.g. a [[Boystown, Chicago|boystown]], a [[Pride parade|gay-pride parade]], etc.; as such, ''queering'' urban spaces is a political means for the non-binary sexual Other to establish themselves as citizens integral to the [[reality]] (cultural and socio-economic) of their city's [[body politic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=335}}</ref>

=== ''Woman'' as identity ===
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The philosopher of existentialism Simone de Beauvoir developed the concept of The Other to explain the workings of the Man–Woman binary gender relation, as a critical base of the Dominator–Dominated relation, which characterises sexual inequality between men and women.]]

The [[feminist philosophy|philosopher of feminism]], [[Cheshire Calhoun]] identified the female Other as the female-half of the binary-gender relation that is the Man and Woman relation. The [[deconstruction]] of the word ''Woman'' (the subordinate party in the Man ''and'' Woman relation) produced a [[Reconstructivism|conceptual reconstruction]] of the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition, as [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalised]] by patriarchy. That the female Other is a self-aware Woman who is [[autonomy|autonomous]] and independent of the patriarchy's formal subordination of the female sex with the institutional limitations of [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], [[tradition]], and [[customary law]]; the social subordination of women is communicated (denoted and connoted) in the [[Sexism|sexist usages]] of the word ''Woman''.<ref>McCann, p. 339.</ref>

In 1949, the philosopher of [[existentialism]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]'s conception of "the Other" (as a constituent part of [[Self-awareness]]) to describe a male-dominated culture that [[Representation (arts)|represents]] Woman as the sexual Other to Man. In a patriarchal culture, the Man–Woman relation is society's normative binary-gender relation, wherein ''the sexual Other'' is a social [[minority (philosophy)|minority]] with the least [[Agency (philosophy)|socio-political agency]], usually the women of the community, because patriarchal [[semantics]] established that "a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] ''Man'' to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] ''Woman'' represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity" from the first sex, from Man.<ref>McCann, p. 33.</ref> See: ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), by Simone de Beauvoir

In 1957, [[Betty Friedan]] reported that a woman's social identity is formally established, by the sexual politics of the Ordinate–Subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation, the social norm in the patriarchal West. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves by their social roles (wife, mother, lover) in the private sphere of life; and did not identify themselves by their own achievements (job, career, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had acted [[convention (norm)|convention]]ally, and automatically identified and referred to themselves as the social Other to men.

Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society's social constructs ([[social class]], [[sex]], [[gender]]), as a human organisation, society holds the [[Power (philosophy)|socio-political power]] to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and ''Woman'', the sexual Other, who is not male.<ref>Haslanger</ref> See: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963), by Betty Friedan.

In feminist definition, women are the Other to men (but not the Other proposed by Hegel) and are not existentially defined by masculine demands; and also are the social Other who unknowingly accepts social subjugation as part of [[subjectivity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com|title=Sense & Sensuality|website=sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com}}</ref> because the gender identity of woman is constitutionally different from the gender identity of man. The harm of Othering is in the asymmetric nature of unequal roles in sexual and gender relations; the inequality arises from the social mechanics of [[intersubjectivity]].<ref>Jemmer, Patrick. "The O(the)r (O)the(r)", ''Engage Newcastle'', Vol. 1, August 2010 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}), Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YlN_kz8th4cC&oi=fnd&pg=PA7 p. 7].</ref>

==Knowledge==
===Cultural representations===
About the production of [[knowledge]] of the Other who is not [[Personal identity|the Self]], the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] said that '''Othering''' is the creation and maintenance of imaginary “knowledge of the Other” — which comprises cultural representations in service to [[Power (social and political)|socio-political power]] and the establishment of [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchies of domination]]. That [[Representation (arts)|cultural representations]] of the Other (as a metaphor, as a metonym, and as an anthropomorphism) are manifestations of the xenophobia inherent to the European historiographies that defined and labelled non–European peoples as the Other who is not the European Self. Supported by the reductive discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) of the empire's [[dominant ideology]], the colonialist misrepresentations of the Other explain the Eastern world to the Western world as a binary relation of native weakness against colonial strength.<ref>Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 76.</ref>

[[File:YellowTerror.jpg|thumb|300px|A cultural representation of the non-white Other: ''The Yellow Terror in all His Glory'' (1899) represents a rebellious Chinese man, armed to the teeth, rejecting the [[civilising mission]] of Western imperial colonialism, represented by the fallen white woman.]]

In the 19th-century [[Historiography|historiographies]] of the Orient as a cultural region, the Orientalists studied only what they said was the [[high culture]] (languages and literatures, arts and philologies) of the Middle East, but did not study that geographic space as a place inhabited by different nations and societies.<ref>Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 71.</ref> About that Western version of the Orient, Edward Saïd said that:

 {{quotation|the Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was, itself, a product of certain political forces and activities.<br><br> Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilisations, peoples, and localities. Its objective discoveries – the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced [[Positivism|positivistically]] verifiable learning – are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language, and, what is the truth of language?, Nietzsche once said, but a mobile army of [[metaphor]]s, [[metonym]]s, and [[anthropomorphism]]s – in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which, after long use, seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.|''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.<ref name=Said>Saïd, Edward W. ''Orientalism'', 25th Anniversary Ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 1978.</ref>{{rp|202}}}}

In so far as The Orient occurred in the [[Existentialism|existential]] awareness of the Western world, as a term, The Orient later accrued many meanings and associations, denotations and connotations that did not refer to the real peoples, cultures, and geography of the Eastern world, but to [[Oriental Studies]], the academic field about The Orient as a word.<ref>Saïd, Edward W.

Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006. pp. 19–21.</ref> In the [[Postmodernism|postmodern era]], the Orientalist practices of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical negationism]], the writing of distorted histories about the places and peoples of "The East", continues in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice Othering with fabricated facts about threat-reports and non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to politically delegitimise opponent political parties composed of people from the social and ethnic groups designated as the Other in that society.<ref>Sehgal, Meera. "Manufacturing a Feminized Siege Mentality." ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' '''36''' (2) (2007): p. 173.</ref>

The Othering of a person or of a social group — by means of an ideal [[ethnocentricity]] (the ethnic group of the Self) that evaluates and assigns negative, cultural [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] to the ethnic Other — is realised through [[cartography]];<ref name=Fellman>Fellmann, Jerome D., et al. ''Human Geography: Landscapes of Human Activities'', 10th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.</ref>{{rp|179}} hence, the maps of Western cartographers emphasised and bolstered artificial representations of the national-identities, the natural resources, and the cultures of the native inhabitants, as culturally inferior to the West.

Historically, Western cartography featured the distortion (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of places and true distances by placing the cartographer's [[Geopolitics|homeland]] in the centre of the ''mapamundi''; thus, British cartographers placed Great Britain in the centre of their maps of the world, by misrepresenting the British islands as larger than geographic reality. In contemporary cartography, the polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by U.S. cartographers, feature distorted spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia that emphasise the perceived inferiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) of the Russian Other.<ref name=Fellman/>{{rp|10}}

In ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and as a term within [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]; as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, "the colonizing powers narrated an 'Other' whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize . . . [in order to] extract resources through colonization" of the country whose people the colonial power designated as the Other.<ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009">Gallagher, Carolyn, Dahlman, Carl T., Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz, Alison, Shirlow, Peter. ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.</ref> As facilitated by [[Orientalism|Orientalist representations]] of the non–Western Other, [[Colonialism|colonization]] — the [[economic exploitation]] of a people and their land – is misrepresented as a [[civilizing mission]] launched for the material, cultural, and spiritual benefit of the colonized peoples. See: [[The White Man's Burden|The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands]] (1899).

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, postmodern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] progress for Man and Society. Public knowledge of the [[social identity]] of peoples [[Social class|classified]] as "Outsiders" is ''de facto'' acknowledgement of their being [[reality|real]], thus they are part of the [[body politic]], especially in the cities. As such, "the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] that moves sites once conceived of as 'marginal' to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis" of the [[Intersubjectivity|human relations]] between the Outsiders and the Establishment.<ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/>
