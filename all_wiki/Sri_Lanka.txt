Sri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of [[Suratissa of Anuradhapura|Suratissa]], who was defeated by two horse traders named [[Sena and Guttika]] from [[South India]].<ref name="mahav1" /> The next invasion came immediately in 205 BCE by a [[Chola]] named [[Elara (monarch)|Elara]], who overthrew [[Asela of Anuradhapura|Asela]] and ruled the country for 44 years.

The [[Fourth Buddhist Council]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] was held at the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]] in Sri Lanka under the patronage of [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura]] in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] subsequently died of starvation. Because the [[Pāli Canon]] was at that time [[oral literature]] maintained in several recensions by ''dhammabhāṇaka''s ([[dharma]] reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=200}} After the council, [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]].

Soon, coffee became the primary commodity export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices as a result of the [[Panic of 1847|depression of 1847]] stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of ''rajakariya'', requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent.<ref name="Nubin 2002 115"/> These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and [[Matale Rebellion|another rebellion]] broke out in 1848.<ref name="matale1">{{cite web | url = http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/gongalegoda.htm | title = Gongale Goda Banda (1809–1849) : The leader of the 1848 rebellion | work = Wimalaratne, K.D.G. | access-date = 15 July 2014}}</ref> A devastating leaf disease, ''[[Hemileia vastatrix]]'', struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lennox A.

The [[Donoughmore Constitution|Donoughmore reforms]] of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]] (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms).

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map LKA present.svg|thumb|left|Sri Lanka map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate is [[Tropical climate|tropical]] and warm, because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from {{convert|17|°C|°F|1}} in the [[Central Highlands of Sri Lanka|central highlands]], where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of {{convert|33|C|F|1|abbr=on}} in other low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from {{convert|28|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} to nearly {{convert|31|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}.

The rainfall pattern is influenced by [[monsoon]] winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The "wet zone" and some of the windward slopes of the central highlands receive up to {{convert|2500|mm|in|1}} of rain each year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of Sri Lanka comprise the "dry zone", which receives between {{convert|1200|and|1900|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain annually.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.mysrilanka.com/travel/theland/rainfall.htm | title = Sri Lanka Rainfall | work = mysrilanka.com | access-date = 15 July 2014}}</ref>

The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain at {{convert|800|to|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes [[tropical cyclone]]s bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island.

[[Yala National Park]] in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks. The [[Wilpattu National Park]] in the northwest, the largest national park, preserves the habitats of many water birds such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills.

Sinharaja is home to 26 endemic birds and 20 rainforest species, including the elusive [[red-faced malkoha]], the [[green-billed coucal]] and the [[Sri Lanka blue magpie]]. The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Of the 211 woody trees and lianas within the reserve, 139 (66%) are endemic. The total vegetation density, including trees, shrubs, herbs, and seedlings, has been estimated at 240,000 individuals per hectare. The Minneriya National Park borders the [[Minneriya Tank]], which is an important source of water for elephants inhabiting the surrounding forests. Dubbed "The Gathering", the congregation of elephants can be seen on the tank-bed in the late dry season (August to October) as the surrounding water sources steadily disappear. The park also encompasses a range of micro-habitats which include classic dry zone tropical monsoonal evergreen forest, thick stands of giant bamboo, hilly pastures (patanas), and grasslands (talawas).<ref name="Minneriya">{{cite web | url = http://trabanatours.com/locations/minneriya/ | title = Minneriya National Park | publisher = www.trabanatours.com | access-date = 15 July 2014 }}</ref>

'''Provinces'''
There have been provinces in Sri Lanka since the 19th century, but they had no legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 1978 constitution established provincial councils after several decades of increasing demand for a [[Devolution|decentralisation]] of the government.<ref name="official">{{cite web | url = http://www.priu.gov.lk/ProvCouncils/ProvicialCouncils.html | title = Provincial Councils | work = The Official Website of the Government of Sri Lanka | date = 3 September 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090707214924/http://www.priu.gov.lk/ProvCouncils/ProvicialCouncils.html | archivedate = 7 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any ministry.

'''Districts and local authorities'''
Each district is administered under a [[Government Agent (Sri Lanka)|district secretariat]]. The districts are further subdivided into 256 [[Divisional Secretariats of Sri Lanka|divisional secretariats]], and these to approximately 14,008 [[Grama Niladhari]] divisions.<ref name="tstasgov">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/GNcode/introduction.pdf |page=3 |title=List of Codes for the Administrative Divisions of Sri Lanka 2001 |publisher=Department of Census and Statistics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519151751/http://www.statistics.gov.lk/GNcode/introduction.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2011 }}</ref> The districts are known in Sinhala as ''disa'' and in Tamil as ''māwaddam''. Originally, a ''disa'' (usually rendered into English as Dissavony) was a [[duchy]], notably Matale and Uva.

There are three other types of local authorities: municipal councils (18), urban councils (13) and pradeshiya sabha, also called pradesha sabhai (256).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Commonwealth Secretariat | year = 2004 | title = Commonwealth Local Government Handbook | place = London | isbn = 978-0-9542917-9-2 | page = 146| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WNM1oHe3eTIC | author-link = Commonwealth Secretariat }}</ref> Local authorities were originally based on feudal counties named ''korale'' and ''rata'', and were formerly known as "D.R.O. divisions" after the divisional revenue officer.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Dilesh Jayanntha | year = 2006 | title = Electoral Allegiance in Sri Lanka | place = London | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-521-02975-9 | pages = 82–85| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nkr3ra6gR2YC }}</ref> Later the D.R.O.s became "assistant government agents," and the divisions were known as "A.G.A. divisions". These divisional secretariats are currently administered by a divisional secretary.

[[Buddhism]] is the largest and is considered as an "[[Official religion]]" of Sri Lanka under Chapter II, Article 9, "The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana".<ref name="lawnet.gov.lk">https://www.lawnet.gov.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/018-SLLR-SLLR-2007-V-1-ASHIK-v.-BANDULA-AND-OTHERSNoise-Pollution-Case.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90234.htm | title = Sri Lanka | work = International Religious Freedom Report 2007 | publisher = [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] | date = 14 September 2007 }}</ref> 
Buddhism is practiced by 70.2% of the Sri Lankan's population with most being predominantly from [[Theravada]] school of thought.<ref name="bisl-sn"/> Most Buddhists are of the Sinhalese ethnic group with minority Tamils. Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 2nd century BCE by venerable [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda Maurya]].<ref name="bisl-sn"/> A sapling of the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[the Buddha]] attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka during the same time. The [[Pāli Canon]] (''Thripitakaya''), having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE.<ref name="ph-tbas">{{cite web | url = http://www.peacehall.com/news/gb/english/2005/03/200503280400.shtml | title = Theravada Buddhism and Shan/Thai/Dai/Laos Regions Boxun News | publisher = Peacehall.com | date = 28 March 2005 }}</ref> Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any predominantly Buddhist nation.<ref name="bisl-sn">{{cite web | url = http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/lanka-txt.htm | title = Theravada: Buddhism in Sri Lankan | publisher = Buddhanet.net | accessdate = 15 July 2014 }}</ref> During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Thailand and Burma.<ref name="ph-tbas" />
Hinduism was the dominant religion in Sri Lanka before the arrival of Buddhism in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka by Mahinda, the son of the Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of King [[Devanampiya Tissa]].<ref>Asian Religions in British Columbia, UBC Press 2011, p. 125.</ref> The Sinhalese embraced Buddhism and Tamils remain Hindus in Sri Lanka. However it was activity from across the [[Palk Strait]] that truly set the scene for [[Hinduism]]'s survival in [[Sri Lanka]].  [[Shaivism]] (devotional worship of Lord Shiva) was the dominant branch practiced by the Tamil peoples, thus most of the traditional [[Hindu temple architecture]] and [[philosophy]] of Sri Lanka drew heavily from this particular strand of [[Hinduism]]. Thirugnanasambanthar mentioned the names of a number of Sri Lankan Hindu temples in his works.<ref>[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/events/611-lecture-on-hindu-sculpture-and-architecture-of-sri-lanka Lecture on Hindu sculpture and architecture of Sri Lanka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012234629/http://www.sundaytimes.lk/events/611-lecture-on-hindu-sculpture-and-architecture-of-sri-lanka |date=2012-10-12 }} Sunday Times – September 29, 2010</ref>
