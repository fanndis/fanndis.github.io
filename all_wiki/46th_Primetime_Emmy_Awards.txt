The '''46th Primetime Emmy Awards''' were held on Sunday, September 11, 1994. The ceremony was hosted by [[Patricia Richardson]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]]. It was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. [[Comedy Central]] received its first major nomination at this ceremony.

For its first season, the ''[[Cheers]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Frasier]]'' won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and four total major awards. For the second straight year ''[[Picket Fences]]'' won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]], it too won four major awards on the night, but the more impressive drama series was newcomer ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', which took home three major awards.

''NYPD Blue'' came into the ceremony with 19 major nominations. This broke ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' record for most nominations by a drama or comedy series of 16 set in [[34th Primetime Emmy Awards|1982]], and put it in second place all time behind ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' which gained 21 major nominations in [[29th Primetime Emmy Awards|1977]]. ''NYPD Blue'' set another milestone when it received every nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series|Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series]], this marked only the ninth time that a show had received every nomination in a category. This feat has not been accomplished since.

The [[television film]] ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]'' also made Emmy history. It set a new record when it received nine major nominations, the most ever for a television movie. The record was maintained for twenty years, until ''[[The Normal Heart (film)|The Normal Heart]]'' received nine major nominations in [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards|2014]]. Both films won the top prize, but each lost all six of their acting nominations, directing, and writing to other projects.
