Apart from the recurring themes relating to global economic growth, [[international trade]] and [[financial market]] regulation,<ref name="auto">{{cite news |url=https://www.g20.org/Webs/G20/EN/G20/Agenda/agenda_node.html |work=G20.org |location=Berlin |title=The G20 Presidency 2017 at a Glance |first=of Germany |last=The Federal Government |date=1 December 2016 |accessdate=6 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706224916/https://www.g20.org/Webs/G20/EN/G20/Agenda/agenda_node.html |archivedate=6 July 2017}}</ref> the G20 Hamburg summit was expected to focus on the following "[[global issue|issues of global significance]]":<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1">{{cite news |url=http://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/G20-Nations-Shifting-the-Trillions__RAF__Q3-2017.pdf |work=Revue Analyse Financière |location=Paris |title=G20 Nations Shifting the Trillions: Impact Investing, Green Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth |first=M.

On 7 July terrorism, free trade and the United States' withdrawal from the [[Paris Agreement]] were on the agenda, on 8 July Africa was supposed to be a topic.<ref name="heute.de 07.07.2017">{{cite web |url=http://www.heute.de/g20-suche-nach-kompromissen-beginnt-47520966.html |title=G20: Suche nach Kompromissen beginnt |work=heute.de |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=8 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707101935/http://www.heute.de/g20-suche-nach-kompromissen-beginnt-47520966.html |archivedate=7 July 2017}}</ref>

The 30-page summary paper stayed vague in many sections.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-angela-merkel-billigt-us-sonderweg-zum-klima-a-1156774.html ''Merkel billigt US-Sonderweg zum Klima.''] In: ''Spiegel Online''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref> The communique of the 20 participants itself was seen as a success.<ref>Julian Heißler: [https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/g20-merkel-abschluss-101.html ''Ein bisschen mehr als nichts.''] In: ''tagesschau.de''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.(German:"A little bit more than nothing")</ref> The resolutions are not legally binding.<ref>Anja Günther: [https://www.tagesschau.de/kommentar/gzwanzig-abschluss-101.html ''"Knapp an einer Pleite vorbei"''.] In: ''ndr.de''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref> Many additional documents were agreed upon, barely noticed by the public.(Annex in Weblink-PDF)

[[Wolfgang Schäuble]], German [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]], insisted on the interconnected nature of many issues facing G20 nations and the need to reach effective, [[cross-cutting cleavage|cross-cutting]] policy measures: "Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, but there is also a growing rise in frustration in some quarters […] development, [national] security and migration are all interlinked"<ref name="auto1"/>

===Trade===
The disagreement in steel production and trade remained. The 45th President of the United States Donald J. Trump has accused [[steel production in China|steel producers in China]] and Europe of [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] and have been threatening with [[antidumping duty]]. The G20 demanded a report of overcapacities by November 2017.<ref>David Böcking: [http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/g20-gipfel-in-hamburg-absage-an-protektionismus-handelskrieg-vertagt-a-1156816.html ''Handelsregister vertagt.''] In: ''Spiegel Online''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref>

===Sustainable development=== 
There was no consensus with the USA regarding [[climate protection]]: a dissent with communalities in the deployment of renewable energy was formulated. The other 19 participants agreed to stick with the Paris agreement, to view it as irreversible and to swiftly put it into practice. After the summit finished, the Turkish president, Erdoğan said his country would not ratify the Paris agreement; Turkey was no industrialized nation but a developing country like other neighboring countries of the region and that François Hollande as then President had assured international assistance funds. President Macron has now invited members for further negotiations at another climate summit in Paris on 12 December.<ref>Christoph Seidler: [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mang20-gipfel-in-hamburg-erdogan-trump-und-der-klimaschutz-a-1156839.html ''Von oben herab''.]{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=Trade |fix-attempted=yes }} In: ''Spiegel Online''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref><ref name=zeit>[http://www.zeit.de/politik/2017-07/g20-einigt-sich-auf-abschlusserklaerung-usa-beim-klimaschutz-isoliert ''G20-Teilnehmer einigen sich auf Abschlusserklärung.''] In: ''Zeit Online''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref> In spite of the United States' dissent, the German presidency wanted to make the most of the "renewed public policy interest for environmental sustainability, [[gender equity]] and social inclusiveness, in the spirit of the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs)" – notably by promoting [[renewable energy]] and further [[fossil fuel divestment]] in all nations.<ref name="auto1"/>

===More inclusive growth===
The G20 final communique placed a new emphasis on the need for trade deals to be reciprocal and non-discriminatory towards [[developing countries]], reducing the previous emphasis on the primacy of liberalization and the promotion of [[free market]] economics across the board.<ref>"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/08/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-g20-summit-us-theresa-may Trump Left in Cold over Paris Climate Agreement at End of G20 Summit]".

India's Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] invited Norwegian [[pension funds]] to invest in his country's National Infrastructure Investment platform as he met Norway's Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]], who, in a gesture symbolising renewed cooperation towards the attainment of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], offered him a round leather football embroidered with the initials 'SDGs'<ref>"[http://www.news18.com/news/india/g20-summit-pm-invites-norway-pension-funds-to-invest-in-india-1455689.html G20 Summit: PM Invites Norway Pension Funds to Invest in India]".

The [[World Bank Group]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|White House]], represented by First Daughter [[Ivanka Trump]], confirmed they would soon roll out a new fund that aims to help female entrepreneurs access capital, financing and managerial support in the developing world. [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]] said the ''Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative'' fund had so far raised $325&nbsp;million from various governments, and that he hoped to leverage that into a multibillion-dollar investment framework.<ref>"[https://nypost.com/2017/07/08/ivanka-trump-world-bank-launch-fund-for-female-entrepreneurs/ Ivanka Trump, World Bank Launch Fund for Female Entrepreneurs]".

===Refugee crisis and migration=== 
{{See also|European migrant crisis}}International migration effectively entered the G20 agenda only in 2015 when the final leader's declaration<ref>[https://www.g20.org/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G7_G20/2015-g20-abschlusserklaerung-eng.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 G20 Leaders’ Communiqué — Antalya Summit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904154036/https://www.g20.org/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G7_G20/2015-g20-abschlusserklaerung-eng.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 |date=4 September 2017 }}, 15–16 November 2015. Retrieved 4 September 2017.</ref> of the [[2015 G20 Antalya summit|Antalya Summit]] described the "ongoing refugee crisis" as a global concern. Nearly one year later at the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|Hangzhou Summit]] in September 2016, G20 leaders reiterated their call for more burden sharing, humanitarian assistance and development funding.<ref>[https://www.g20.org/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G7_G20/2016-09-04-g20-kommunique-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 G20 Leaders’ Communique — Hangzhou Summit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904153837/https://www.g20.org/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G7_G20/2016-09-04-g20-kommunique-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1 |date=4 September 2017 }}, 4–5 September 2016. Retrieved 4 September 2017.</ref> They also agreed to "address forced displacement in 2017 with a view to developing concrete actions" and to examine migration issues. However, although the Hamburg Declaration<ref>[https://www.g20.org/gipfeldokumente/G20-leaders-declaration.pdf G20 Leaders’ Declaration — Shaping an interconnected world] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709215806/https://www.g20.org/gipfeldokumente/G20-leaders-declaration.pdf |date=9 July 2017 }}, Hamburg, 7/8 July 2017. Retrieved 4 September 2017.</ref> in July 2017 mentions both migration and forced displacement in general terms, it does not propose any "concrete actions" in either area.

===Counter-terrorism and national security=== 
[[File:Cumbre de Líderes del G20 (34935893964).jpg|thumb|Leaders having chat at the photo-session]]
All agreed to continue regulating financial markets and to combat financing terrorism and tax evasion. Trade was intensely discussed and participants agreed to keep markets open and combat protectionism and unfair trade practises. The USA took a special stand as Trump supports protectionism. Participants agreed to a G20-Africa-Partnership and passed a special paper about the relationships to the African nations.<ref name=zeit/> 
In a joint statement, G20 leaders vowed to take steps to prevent the internet from being used to spread propaganda. Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] indirectly targeted Pakistan (which is not a member of G20) by naming terrorist organisations that operate from its soil and saying that the groups all share the same ideology and purpose – of spreading hate and killing people. Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] urged member states to unite to fight against terrorism and emphasized on preventive as well as de-radicalization programs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2017/07/08/055889809/Jokowi-Discusses-Counterterrorism-in-G20-Summit|title=Jokowi Discusses Counterterrorism in G20 Summit|newspaper=Tempo|accessdate=2017-07-09}}</ref>

Trump and Putin "discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe." Trump later said he does not think this will happen.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40552571 Donald Trump backtracks on Russia joint cybersecurity unit] BBC News, 10 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref>

More than 320 police officers were injured in the riots.

Of the 1135 far-left violent incidents in that year in Germany, 832 occurred during the summit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/pressemitteilungen/DE/2018/07/vsb-2017.html|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2017 vorgestellt|website=Bundesministerium des Innern, für Bau und Heimat|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref>[[File:Block G20 – colour the red zone 03.jpg|thumb|A burnt BMW car after the first night of riots.]]

Around one thousand performance artists called ''1000 Gestalten'' covered themselves in grey pigment and slowly walked through the streets like zombies.

The riots prompted debates in the Hamburg Senate on violence from leftist militants and how to mitigate further violence in the future. Researchers concluded that methods that had been successful in reducing violence from right-wing and Islamist militants could not be re-used against left-wing militants.<ref>{{Cite web|last=NDR|title=Hamburger Senat legt Konzept gegen linke Gewalt vor|url=https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/Hamburger-Senat-legt-Konzept-gegen-linke-Gewalt-vor,konzept106.html|access-date=2020-07-29|website=www.ndr.de|language=de}}</ref>
