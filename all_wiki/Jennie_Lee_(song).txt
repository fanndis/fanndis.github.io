"'''Jennie Lee'''" is a song whose music was composed and written by [[Jan and Dean|Jan Berry]] and Arnie Ginsburg, which was recorded by Jan and Arnie. Jan & Arnie were the precursor to [[Jan & Dean]]. The song was recorded and released as the band's first single in April, 1958. The B-side of the single is "Gotta Getta Date. "Jennie Lee" reached No. 3 on the Cash Box charts on June 21, 1958, and No. 8 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. This is generally regarded as the earliest example of elements that would become instrumental in the famous [[California sound]] of surf pop in the 60's.

Berry adapted the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] tune "[[Aura Lea]]" and arranged the harmonies.  After weeks of practice, Berry, Ginsburg, and Torrence planned to record a [[demo (music)|demo recording]] in Berry's garage, but Torrence was conscripted into the [[United States Army Reserve]], forcing Berry and Ginsburg to record "Jennie Lee" without Torrence,<ref name="ReferenceB">Ben Marcus, ''Surfing USA!: An Illustrated History of the Coolest Sport of All Time'' (MVP Books, 2005):89.</ref> with Berry's friend and fellow University High student Donald J.

Berry and Ginsburg, now christened "Jan & Arnie", re-recorded their vocals on a professional recording system.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Produced by Lubin, "Jennie Lee" (Arwin 108), backed with "Gotta Get a Date" (credited to Ginsburg, Berry & Lubin), became a surprise commercial success. According to Berry's biographer Mark A. Moore, "The song (with backing vocals, plus additional instruments added by the [[Ernie Freeman|Ernie Freeman combo]]) had a raucous [[R&B]] flavor, with a bouncing bomp-bomp vocal hook that would become a signature from Jan on future recordings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/main/index.php/jdhistory/58-62|title=Jan & Dean - Official Jan Berry Website - 1958-1962 - Barons & Bomps|last=Administrator|website=Jananddean-janberry.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> Distributed by [[Dot Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/photogalleries/displayimage.php?album=15&pos=25Ad |title=Jan & Dean Photo Galleries - Jan & Arnie/Jennie Lee |publisher=Jananddean-janberry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> "Jennie Lee" was released in mid-April,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jananddean-janberry.com/photogalleries/displayimage.php?album=15&pos=19 |title=Jan & Dean Photo Galleries - Jan & Arnie/Jan & Arnie |publisher=Jananddean-janberry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> entered the charts on May 10, 1958, the same day they appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Dick Clark Show|Dick Clark Show]]''.
