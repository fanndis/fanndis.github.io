==Development history==
In the introduction to a 2009 interview with ''Forbes.com'', former general manager Nathan Richardson was said to have built "annual revenue from $10 million to $110 million and expanded the site's content partners from 10 to 200. In 2005 ''Institutional Investor'' ranked [Richardson] the most influential person in online finance." In the interview, Richardson described the process of building the financial-information modules and creating a "moat" around the content (to keep visitors sticking to the site).<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/03/nathan-richardson-yahoo-business-media-0203_richardson.html Nathan Richardson's Modest Proposal] Q&A by Dirk Smillie, ''Forbes.com'', 2-3-09.
