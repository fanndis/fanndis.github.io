==Early career==
In 1963, Sharaa became a member of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]]’s central committee.<ref name=alarab9july/> He served as regional manager of the state-run [[Syrian Arab Airlines]] in [[London]] from 1968 to 1972 and as commercial director in Damascus from 1972 to 1976.<ref name="alarab9july" /> Between 1977 and 1980, he served as Syria's ambassador to [[Italy]].<ref name=alarab9july/> In 1980 he was named deputy foreign minister. In 1984 Sharaa was appointed acting minister of information. In March 1984, [[Hafez al-Assad]], then president of Syria, named him [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (Syria)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], a position that he held until February 2006.<ref name=Kechichian/>

==Old guard of the Assad government==
Sharaa has remained an old guard of the Assad administration. He has been very active in negotiating with many countries to gain better relations for Syria. Much of this negotiation has involved Syria's relationships with [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]]. Sharaa maintains that Israel should give back all of the [[Golan Heights]], the territory it took from Syria in the [[Six-Day War|1967 War]]. He was involved in two attempts to negotiate a reconciliation with Israel, in 1991 and 2000.

==Political career==
Since Hafez Assad's death in 2000, his son [[Bashar al-Assad]] reshuffled his cabinet several times to remove several long-time members. Sharaa, however, remained in office, and became one of the longest-serving foreign ministers in the world. It was believed that Sharaa might be forced to resign when, in October 2005, he was accused of misleading international investigators in letters about the investigation of possible Syrian involvement in the [[Assassination of Rafic Hariri|assassination]] of former Lebanese prime minister [[Rafic Hariri|Rafik Hariri]]. Along with President Bashar al-Assad, Sharaa was interviewed in April 2006 during the course of a UN investigation into the death in February 2005 of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

He finally did leave his post as foreign minister on 11 February 2006, when he became vice president of Syria in charge of foreign affairs. This position had been vacant for months, since the departure of [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]]. Some saw his appointment as vice president as a demotion, since he was expected to have less of a public role in Syrian politics and to lose contact with many diplomats and world leaders. The vice president in Syria is generally a ceremonial role. However, others believed that Sharaa would now have a greater role in decision-making, since he would be in Syria more often. In the event, Sharaa engaged in high-profile foreign travel as vice president, indicating that his role is envisaged as an active one on the international scene. He will also become the acting president of Syria if President Assad resigns or dies while Sharaa is still vice president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/18/world/meast/syria-unrest/index.html|title=Rebels say Syrian vice president defects, regime denies claim|publisher=CNN|date=18 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref>

Sharaa met with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in September 2007 to discuss the plight of Iraqi Christian refugees in Syria, the Mideast peace processes, and the role and status of the Church in Syria. Sharaa is the chairman of the "national dialogue" committee in Syria.<ref name=cg11>{{cite web|title=Popular Protest in North Africa and the Middle East (VII): The Syrian Regime's Slow-Motion Suicide|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Syria/109%20Popular%20Protest%20in%20North%20Africa%20and%20the%20Middle%20East%20VII%20--%20The%20Syrian%20Regimes%20Slow-motion%20Suicide.pdf|publisher=Crisis Group|access-date=21 July 2012|format=Report (No: 109)|date=13 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725095930/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Syria/109%20Popular%20Protest%20in%20North%20Africa%20and%20the%20Middle%20East%20VII%20--%20The%20Syrian%20Regimes%20Slow-motion%20Suicide.pdf|archive-date=25 July 2011|df=}}</ref>

In 2000 Sharaa was also appointed to the Ba'ath party’s leadership and his term ended in July 2013.<ref name=alarab9july>{{cite news|title=Farouk al-Sharaa, Syrian leader who wanted compromise|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/profiles/2013/07/09/Farouk-al-Sharaa-Syrian-leader-who-wanted-compromise-.html|accessdate=29 July 2013|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=9 July 2013|agency=AFP|location=Beirut}}</ref>

==Reports of escape==
Following his absence at a high-level meeting in July 2012, Sharaa was rumored to either be under house-arrest, or to have fled to Jordan.<ref name=ttofi1112>{{cite news|title=Syrian vice president’s absence raises questions of his whereabouts|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/farouk-al-sharaa/|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=11 July 2012}}</ref> These reports came amidst a wave of fugitives from the Assad government after an increase in violence in the [[Syrian civil war]]. However, these reports were proven to be false, since Sharaa represented Bashar al-Assad at the funerals of three senior officials [[18 July 2012 Damascus bombing|assassinated on 18 July 2012]] in Damascus.<ref name=ctreu>{{cite news|title=Funeral held for Syria officials killed in bombing|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-rt-syria-crisisfuneral-update-2-tvl6e8ikfg9-20120720,0,6973157.story|access-date=21 July 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=20 July 2012|agency=Reuters|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171009220703/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-20/business/sns-rt-syria-crisisfuneral-update-2-tvl6e8ikfg9-20120720_1_minister-daoud-rajha-dominic-evans-bomb-attack|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
