'''Plano''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|PLAY|noh}}) is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], located approximately 20 miles (32.2&nbsp;km) north of downtown [[Dallas]]. As of the [[census]] of 2010, Plano had 259,841 residents.<ref name="GR2" /> The city of Plano is a part of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]]. Plano lies mostly within [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]], but includes a small portion that extends into [[Denton County, Texas|Denton County]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Plano, Texas}}
[[File:Old map-Plano-1891.jpg|thumb|left|Plano, Texas in 1891. Toned [[Lithography|lithograph]] by A.E. Downs, [[Boston]]. Published by T. M. Fowler & James B. Moyer. [[Amon Carter Museum]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]]]]

European settlers came to the area near present-day Plano in the early 1840s.<ref name="Timeline" /> Facilities such as a [[sawmill]], a [[gristmill]], and a store soon brought more people to the area. A mail service was established, and after rejecting several names for the nascent town (including naming it in honor of then-President [[Millard Fillmore]]),<ref name="Schell" /> residents suggested the name ''Plano'' (from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for "flat"), as a reference to the local terrain, unvaried and devoid of any trees. The name was accepted by the post office.<ref name="Schell" />

In 1872, the completion of the [[List of Texas railroads|Houston and Central Texas Railway]] helped the city to grow, and it was incorporated in 1873.<ref name="Schell" /> By 1874, the population had grown to more than 500.<ref name="Timeline" /> In 1881, a fire raged through the business district, destroying most of the buildings.<ref name="Timeline" /><ref name="Schell" /> The town was rebuilt and business again flourished through the 1880s. Also in 1881, the city assumed responsibility for what would eventually become [[Plano Independent School District]] (PISD), ending the days of it being served only by private schools.<ref name="Timeline" />

At first, the population of Plano grew slowly, reaching 1,304 in 1900, and rising to 3,695 in 1960.<ref name="Timeline" /> By 1970, Plano began to feel some of the boom its neighbors had experienced after [[World War II]]. A series of [[public works]] projects and a change in taxes that removed the farming community from the town helped increase the overall population. In 1970, the population reached 17,872,<ref name="Timeline" /> and by 1980, it had exploded to 72,000.<ref name="Timeline" /> Sewers, schools, and street development kept pace with this massive increase, largely because of Plano's flat topography, grid layout, and planning initiatives.

During the 1980s, many large corporations moved their headquarters to the city, including [[J. C. Penney]] and [[Frito-Lay]], which encouraged further growth. By 1990, the population reached 128,713,<ref name="Timeline" /> dwarfing the [[county seat]] of [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]]. In 1994, the city was recognized as an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]].<ref name="AllAmerica" /> By 2000, the population grew to 222,030,<ref name="Timeline" /> making it one of Dallas' largest suburbs. Plano is surrounded by other municipalities and therefore cannot expand in area, and there is little undeveloped land remaining within the city limits.  However, as of July 2012, one large tract of land was being developed: Turnpike Commons<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130807111920/http://www.theretailconnection.net/uploaded/property/20080813114241164.pdf ]</ref> at the intersection of Renner Road and the George Bush Turnpike (bordered also by Shiloh Road to the east). The development is expected to feature apartments, medical facilities, restaurants, a Race Trac gas station, and a hotel.

In 2013, Plano received top-scoring nationally in a livability index according to an algorithm created by AreaVibes.com, a Toronto-based company specializing in such data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.areavibes.com/best-places/america/|title=Best Places To Live In The US - Top Cities In America 2019|website=www.areavibes.com|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> AreaVibes ranked Plano at the top of the list of U.S. cities with populations between 100,000 and 10 million. Another chart, "Best Places to Live in 2013", also has Plano ranked number 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.areavibes.com/library/top-10-best-cities-to-live-2013/|title=Top 10 Cities - Best Places To Live 2013|website=Areavibes.com|language=en|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plano DART Transit Service.JPG|thumb|The tracks and adjacent platforms at the [[Parker Road (DART station)|Parker Road]] DART station]] -->
Plano is one of 12 suburbs of Dallas that opt into the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) public transportation system. During most of its membership in DART, Plano was lightly served by [[bus]] lines, but in 2002, the [[Red Line (Dallas Area Rapid Transit)|Red Line]] of the [[DART Light Rail]] project opened stations in [[Downtown Plano (DART station)|Downtown Plano]] and at [[Parker Road (DART station)|Parker Road]], which provide access to commuters traveling to work elsewhere in the Dallas area. The [[Orange Line (Dallas Area Rapid Transit)|Orange Line]] traverses the same route for selected weekday/peak hour trips. The [[Silver Line (Dallas Area Rapid Transit)|Silver Line]] is also planned to run through Southern Plano. Approximately 1% of the city's population uses DART. The Parker Road station charged for parking for non-member city residents from April 2, 2012 – April 3, 2014 as a part of the Fair Share Parking initiative. Two DART park-and-ride bus facilities, separate from the rail lines, are within Plano: [[Jack Hatchell Transit Center]] and [[Northwest Plano Park & Ride]].

Plano was the first city in Collin County to adopt a master plan for its road system. The use of multi-lane, divided highways for all major roads allows for higher speed limits, generally {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, but sometimes up to {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on the northern section of [[Texas State Highway 289|Preston Road]]. Plano is served directly by several major roadways and freeways. Central Plano is bordered to the east by [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|U.S. Highway 75]], the west by [[Dallas North Tollway]], the south by [[President George Bush Turnpike]] ([[Texas State Highway 190]] (east of Coit Road)), and the north by [[Sam Rayburn Tollway]] ([[Texas State Highway 121]]). Preston Road ([[Texas State Highway 289]]) is a major thoroughfare that runs through the city. Plano is the largest city in Texas without an [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]].

Plano opened a new interchange at Parker Rd. and U.S. 75 in December 2010.  The [[single point urban interchange|single-point interchange]] is the first of its kind in Texas.  The design is intended to reduce severe congestion at this interchange.  According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20120220225248/http://tti.tamu.edu/conferences/tsc11/program/presentations/traffic-ops-2/young.pdf reports] traffic congestion has been reduced 50-75%.

Plano is roughly 30 miles northeast of [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]; it is the primary airport serving Plano residents and visitors.
