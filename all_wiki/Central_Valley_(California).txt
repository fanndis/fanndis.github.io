The '''Central Valley''' is a flat [[valley]] that dominates the interior of [[California]]. It is {{convert|40|to|60|mi|km|-1}} wide and stretches approximately {{convert|450|mi|km}} from north-northwest to south-southeast, inland from and parallel to the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast.

The valley is bounded by the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] to the west and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east.

It is California's most productive [[Agriculture|agricultural]] region and one of the most productive in the world, providing more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=368934 |title=California's Central Valley: Producing America's Fruits and Vegetables |publisher=House Committee on Natural Resources|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623012337/http://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=368934 |archive-date=June 23, 2015|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> More than 7 million acres (28,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the valley are irrigated via an extensive system of reservoirs and canals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=11261|title=Federal Agencies Release Data Showing California Central Valley Idle Farmland Doubling During Drought|website=landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410112943/http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=11261|archive-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref> The valley also has many major cities, including the state capital [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]; as well as [[Chico, California|Chico]], [[Redding, California|Redding]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]].

The Central Valley [[Drainage basin|watershed]] comprises {{convert|60000|mi2|km2}}, or over a third of California. It consists of three main drainage systems: the [[Sacramento Valley]] in the north, which receives well over {{convert|20|in|mm}} of rain annually; the drier [[San Joaquin Valley]] in the south; and the [[Tulare Lake|Tulare Basin]] and its [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid desert]] climate at the southernmost end. The [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River|San Joaquin]] river systems drain their respective valleys and meet to form the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]], a large expanse of interconnected [[canal]]s, [[stream bed]]s, [[Slough (hydrology)|slough]]s, [[marsh]]es, and peat islands.<ref name="every" /> The delta empties into the [[San Francisco Bay]], and then ultimately flows into the Pacific.<ref name="every">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Bittman |title=Everyone Eats There |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/magazine/californias-central-valley-land-of-a-billion-vegetables.html |quote=Central Valley, which is really two valleys: the San Joaquin to the south and Sacramento to the north.

The valley encompasses all or parts of 19 California counties: [[Butte County, California|Butte]], [[Colusa County, California|Colusa]], [[Glenn County, California|Glenn]], [[Fresno County, California|Fresno]], [[Kern County, California|Kern]], [[Kings County, California|Kings]], [[Madera County, California|Madera]], [[Merced County, California|Merced]], [[Placer County, California|Placer]], [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]], [[Shasta County, California|Shasta]], [[Solano County, California|Solano]], [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus]], [[Sutter County, California|Sutter]], [[Tehama County, California|Tehama]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]], [[Yolo County, California|Yolo]], and [[Yuba County, California|Yuba]].<ref name=overview/>

==Name==
Older names include "the Great Valley," a name still often seen in scientific references (e.g. [[Great Valley Sequence]]), and "Golden Empire," a [[boosterism|booster]] name that is still referred to by some organizations (e.g. [[Golden Empire Transit]], [[Golden Empire Council]], etc.).

==Boundaries and population==
The Central Valley is roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline, outlined by the southern end of the [[Cascade Range]] in the north, [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the east, and [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south, and the [[California Coast Ranges]] and [[San Francisco Bay]] in the west.  The broad valley floor is carpeted by [[alluvial plain]]s forming vast agricultural regions, and dotted with numerous population centers.

==Geography==
The flatness of the valley floor contrasts with the rugged hills or gentle mountains that are typical of most of California's terrain. The valley is thought to have originated below sea level as an offshore area depressed by [[subduction]] of the [[Farallon Plate]] into a trench further offshore. The [[San Joaquin Fault]] is a notable seismic feature of the Central Valley.

[[File:I-5 between Tracy and Patterson CA.jpg|thumb|right|An example of the differences between the geology of the valley floor and that of the rugged hills of the Coast Ranges (Between Tracy and Patterson, CA:Interstate 5)]]
The valley was enclosed by the uplift of the [[Coast Ranges]], with its original outlet into [[Monterey Bay]]. Faulting moved the Coast Ranges, and a new outlet developed near what is now [[San Francisco Bay]]. Over the millennia, the valley was filled by the sediments of these same ranges, as well as the rising [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east; that filling eventually created an extraordinary flatness just barely above sea level; before California's massive flood control and aqueduct system was built, the annual snow melt turned much of the valley into an inland sea.

The one notable exception to the flat valley floor is [[Sutter Buttes]], the remnants of an extinct volcano just to the northwest of [[Yuba City]], which is {{convert|44|mi|km}} north of [[Sacramento]].

Another significant geologic feature of the Central Valley lies hidden beneath the delta. The [[Stockton Arch]] is an upwarping of the crust beneath the valley sediments that extends southwest to northeast across the valley.

The Central Valley lies within the California Trough physiographic section, which is part of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the [[Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System|Pacific Mountain System]].<ref name="USGS-Water">{{cite web | title = Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U.

==Environment==

[[File:Central Valley STS040-609-38.jpg|thumb|right|Central Valley seen from space.]]
The "Central Valley grassland" is the [[Nearctic]] [[Grassland#Temperate grasslands|temperate and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrub lands]] [[ecoregion]] that was once a diverse grassland containing areas of desert grassland (at the southern end), [[prairie]], [[savanna]], riverside [[woodland]], [[marsh]], several types of seasonal [[vernal pool]]s, and large lakes such as now-dry [[Tulare Lake]] (which was the largest freshwater lake in the United States west of the Mississippi), [[Buena Vista Lake]] and [[Kern Lake (Kern County)|Kern Lake]]. However, much of the Central Valley environment has been removed or altered by human activity including the introduction of [[exotic plant]]s, especially grasses. The oak woodlands and [[chaparral]] that fringe the valley have been categorized as the [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]] ecoregion.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0801 |name=California Central Valley grasslands|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

The wetlands have been the target of rescue operations to restore areas nearly destroyed by agriculture.<ref>Philip Garone, ''The Fall and Rise of the Wetlands of California's Great Central Valley'' (University of California Press; 2011)</ref>

===Flora===
The dominant grass of the valley was ''[[Nassella pulchra]]'' mixed with other species, but today only 1% of the grassland in the valley is original and intact. Grassland flowers include [[California poppy]] (''Eschscholzia californica''), [[lupin]]s, and purple owl's clover (''[[Castilleja exserta]]''), which can still be seen, especially in [[Antelope Valley]] in the Tehachapi hills. Riverside trees include willows, western sycamore (''[[Platanus racemosa]]''), box elder (''[[Acer negundo]]''), Fremont cottonwood (''[[Populus fremontii]]''), and the endemic valley oak (''[[Quercus lobata]]'').

===Fauna===
The Central Valley was once home to large populations of [[pronghorn]] antelope (''Antilocapra americana''), [[elk]] including the endemic [[tule elk]] subspecies (''Cervus elaphus nannodes''), [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[California ground squirrel]]s, [[gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, mice, hare, rabbits and [[kangaroo rat]]s, along with their predators including the [[San Joaquin kit fox]], which is now an endangered subspecies surviving on the hillsides of the San Joaquin Valley. The wetlands of the Valley were an important habitat for wintering waterbirds and migrating birds of other kinds. Reptiles and amphibians of the valley include the endemic San Joaquin coachwhip snake (''[[Masticophis flagellum]] ruddocki''), [[Gambelia sila|blunt-nosed leopard lizard]] (''Gambelia sila''), [[Gilbert's skink]] (''Eumeces gilberti'') and the [[western aquatic garter snake]] (''Thamnophis couchii''). There are also a number of endemic invertebrates. The Central Valley is also home to a wide variety of endemic fish species, including the [[Sacramento Pikeminnow]], [[Sacramento Perch]], [[Sacramento Blackfish]], and [[Sacramento Splittail]], among others.

===Threats and preservation===
The [[Great Valley Grasslands State Park]] preserves an example of the [[:Category:Native grasses of California|native grass]] [[habitat]] in the valley, while oak savanna habitats remain near [[Visalia, California|Visalia]]. There are areas of wetland and riverside woodland in the north especially on the Sacramento River system including the [[Nature Conservancy]]'s [[Cosumnes River Preserve]] just south of Sacramento, [[Gray Lodge Wildlife Area]], [[Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area]], and other patches in the delta area. Remaining vernal pools include [[Pixley National Wildlife Refuge]] between [[Tulare, California]], and Bakersfield and [[Jepson Prairie Preserve]] in the delta. There are large blocks of desert scrubland in the southern San Joaquin Valley and in the [[Carrizo Plain]], which is just outside the valley but has a similar landscape.

All these patches of natural habitat are disconnected and this is particularly damaging for wildlife that is used to migrating along the rivers of the valley. Agriculture, the creation of grazing land, and the draining of lakes and rivers have radically altered the habitats of the Valley. Most of the grassland has been overtaken by new species, most of the vernal pools have been destroyed with only those on the higher slopes remaining, the marshland has  been drained, and the riverbank woodlands have nearly all been affected.

===Health===
The valley gives its name to [[Coccidioidomycosis|Valley fever]], which is primarily a disease of the lungs that is common in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is caused by the fungus ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', which grows in soils in areas of low rainfall, high summer temperatures, and moderate winter temperatures. These fungal spores become airborne when the soil is disturbed by winds, construction, or farming. This illness frequently takes many weeks or months to resolve. Occasionally Valley Fever is life-threatening and even fatal.

Additionally, Central Valley farm laborers are often unable to afford or physically access healthy foods, which is a form of [[Food Insecurity in the Central Valley|food insecurity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Minkoff-Zern|first=Laura-Anne|year=2014|title=Hunger Amidst Plenty: Farmworker Food Insecurity and Coping Strategies in California|journal=Local Environment|volume=19|issue=2|pages=204–219|doi=10.1080/13549839.2012.729568|s2cid=154653581|via=ESBCO Host}}</ref>

Due to the agricultural industry's large presence in the Valley, there are concerns about the pesticide drift and leaching in the Central Valley of California. Residents of the Central Valley experience risk of contamination from pesticides when living in proximity of application sites.

==Climate==
[[File:Dense Tule fog in Bakersfield, California.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tule fog]] in [[Kern County]]]]The northern Central Valley has a hot [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''); the more southerly parts in [[rainshadow]] zones are dry enough to be Mediterranean steppe (''BShs'', as around [[Fresno]]) or even low-latitude desert (''BWh'', as in areas around [[Bakersfield]]). It is very hot and dry during the summer and cool and damp in winter, when frequent ground fog known regionally as "[[tule fog]]" can obscure vision. Summer daytime temperatures frequently surpass {{convert|100|°F|abbr=on}}, and common [[heat wave]]s might bring temperatures exceeding {{convert|115|°F|abbr=on}}. Mid-autumn to mid-spring is the ''rainy season'' — although during the late summer, southeasterly winds aloft can bring thunderstorms of tropical origin, mainly in the southern half of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] but occasionally to the [[Sacramento Valley]]. The northern half of the Central Valley receives greater precipitation than the [[semidesert]] southern half. Frost occurs at times in the fall months, but snow is extremely rare.<ref>{{cite web

===Tule fog===
{{Main|Tule fog}}
[[Tule fog]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|l|iː}} is a thick ground [[fog]] that settles along the length of the Great Central Valley. Tule fog forms during the late fall and winter (California's [[rain season|rainy season]]), after the first significant rainfall. The official time frame for tule fog to form is from November 1 to March 31. This phenomenon is named after the [[Tule|tule grass]] wetlands (''tulares'') of the Central Valley. Accidents caused by the tule fog are the leading cause of weather-related casualties in California.

In the south part of the San Joaquin Valley, the [[alluvial fan]] of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] and another one from Coast Ranges streams have created a divide and resultantly the currently dry Tulare basin of the Central Valley, into which flow four major Sierra Nevada rivers, the Kings, [[Kaweah River|Kaweah]], [[Tule River|Tule]] and [[Kern River|Kern]]. This basin, usually [[endorheic]], formerly filled during heavy snowmelt and spilled out into the San Joaquin River.

The rivers of the Central Valley converge in the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta]], a complex network of marshy channels, distributaries and sloughs that wind around islands mainly used for agriculture. Here the freshwater of the rivers merges with tidewater, and eventually reach the [[Pacific Ocean]] after passing through [[Suisun Bay]], [[San Pablo Bay]], upper [[San Francisco Bay]] and finally the [[Golden Gate]]. Many of the islands now lie below sea level because of intensive agriculture, and have a high risk of flooding, which would cause salt water to rush back into the delta, especially when there is too little fresh water flowing in from the Valley.<ref>{{cite web

The Sacramento River carries far more water than the San Joaquin, with an estimated {{convert|22|e6acre.ft|km3}} of virgin annual runoff, as compared to the San Joaquin's approximately {{convert|6|e6acre.ft|km3}}. Intensive agricultural and municipal water consumption has reduced the present rate of outflow to about {{convert|17|e6acre.ft|km3}} for the Sacramento and {{convert|3|e6acre.ft|km3}} for the San Joaquin; however, these figures still vary widely from year to year. Over 25 million people, living both in the valley and in other regions of the state, rely on the water carried by these rivers.<ref>{{cite web

Runoff from the Sierra Nevada flows into the Central Valley and provides one of the largest water resources of California. The Sacramento River is the second largest river to empty into the Pacific from the [[Continental United States]], behind only the [[Columbia River]] and greater than the [[Colorado River]].<ref>The Columbia is the largest, with an average discharge of {{convert|265000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The Sacramento comes next with a flow of {{convert|30215|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, and even though the Colorado is much longer, its discharge is only about {{convert|10000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|22000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} (that is before diversions started; the river is currently dry at the mouth). Other significant rivers include the Klamath {{convert|17010|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, Skagit {{convert|16598|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, Snohomish {{convert|13900|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, and San Joaquin {{convert|10397|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.</ref> Combined with the fertile and expansive area of the Central Valley's floor, the Central Valley is ideal for agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news

Post-World War II demand for urban development in California's urban areas, most notably the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and the [[Los Angeles]]/[[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]/[[San Diego]], required water resources to support it. Moreover, rapid development of agriculture in the southern Central Valley required far more water than available locally. The [[Feather River]] in the Sacramento Valley was looked to as a water source, leading to public financing of the [[California State Water Project]]. This transports water to the southern San Joaquin Valley and vast urban lands south of the Tehachapi Mountains.<ref>{{cite web

===Flooding===
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}
Most lowlands of the Central Valley are prone to flooding, especially in the old [[Tulare Lake]], [[Buena Vista Lake]], and [[Kern Lake (Kern County)|Kern Lake]] rivers. The [[Kings River (California)|Kings]], [[Kaweah River|Kaweah]], [[Tule River|Tule]] and [[Kern River|Kern]] rivers originally flowed into these seasonal lakes, which would expand each spring to flood large parts of the southern San Joaquin Valley. Due to the construction of farms, towns and infrastructure in these lakebeds while preventing them from flooding with levee systems, the risk of floods damaging properties increased greatly.

The [[Great Flood of 1862#Central Valley|Great Flood of 1862]] was the worst flood that the Central Valley has experienced in recorded history, flooding most of the valley and putting some places as much as 20 feet under water.

Major public works projects beginning in the 1930s sought to reduce the amount of snowmelt flooding by the building of large dams. In 2003, it was determined that Sacramento had both the least protection against and nearly the highest risk of flooding. Congress then granted a $220 million loan for upgrades in Sacramento County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-705251/Sacramento-flood-protection.html|title=Sacramento Flood Protection|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809012610/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-705251/Sacramento-flood-protection.html|archive-date=August 9, 2011}}</ref>
Other counties in the valley that face flooding often are [[Yuba County, CA|Yuba]], [[Stanislaus County, CA|Stanislaus]], and [[San Joaquin County, CA|San Joaquin]].

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
;Music
The '''Central Valley''' has been home to many [[Country (music)|country]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[nu metal]], and [[doo-wop]] musicians. The Valley has many influences in [[American music]] mainly through the "[[Bakersfield Sound]]", the "[[Doowop|Doowop Era]]" of the 1950s and 1960s, through the [[R&B]] music scene of the 1980s and also through the [[List of hip hop genres|Bakersfield rap]] music scene often referred to as [[underground hip hop]], [[List of hip hop genres|Central California hip hop]], [[West Coast hip hop]], or [[List of hip hop genres|Central Valley hip hop]].

The Central Valley is known for many famous musicians from country, R&B, and doo-wop to jazz and funk artist such as: [[Buck Owens]], [[Korn]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Billy Mize]], [[Red Simpson]], [[The Maddox Brothers and Rose]], [[The Paradons]], [[The Colts (Vocal Group)|The Colts]] and the [[Sons of the San Joaquin]]. The Central Valley is also home to many west coast bands from [[Bakersfield]], [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], and [[Fresno]] to as far as [[Sacramento]] bands.

The Central Valley also houses many rappers, DJs, and R&B hip hop artist such as [[DRS (group)|DRS]], [[C-BO]], [[Brotha Lynch]], [[T-Nutty]], [[Planet Asia]], [[X-Raided]], [[The Def Dames]], [[Marvaless]], [[Fashawn]], [[Blackalicious]], [[Mozzy]] and many more.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the primary industry in most of the Central Valley. A notable exception to the predominance of agriculture has been the Sacramento area, where there is a large and stable workforce of government employees. Despite state hiring cutbacks and the closure of several military bases, Sacramento's economy has continued to expand and diversify and now more closely resembles that of the nearby San Francisco Bay Area. Primary sources of population growth are people migrating from the San Francisco Bay Area seeking lower housing costs, as well as immigration from Asia, Central America, Mexico, Ukraine and the rest of the former Soviet Union.<ref name=overview/>

Early farming was concentrated close to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where the water table was high year round and water transport more readily available, but subsequent irrigation projects have brought many more parts of the valley into productive use. For example, the [[Central Valley Project]] was formed in 1935 to redistribute and store water for agricultural and municipal purposes with dams and canals. It was intended to serve smaller farmers, with a 160-acre maximum size limit. However, this was largely ignored under pressure from large landowners.<ref>{{cite journal|title=They Rule the Valley: The Story of How Large Central Valley Landholders Became the Primary Beneficiaries of the Central Valley Project|last=Flores|first=Christina|date=March 1, 2011|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7s79r340}}</ref>  The even larger [[California State Water Project]] was formed in the 1950s and construction continued throughout the following decades.

===National Farmworkers Association (NFWA)===
In the 1960s, farm labor leaders [[Cesar Chavez]] and [[Dolores Huerta]] organized [[Mexican American]] grape pickers into a [[trade union|union]], the [[National Farmworkers Association]] (NFWA), in order to improve their working conditions. This organizing took place primarily in the Central Valley, especially in and around [[Delano, California|Delano]], because of the extensive agriculture.

===San Joaquin Valley congestion===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Since the 1980s, [[Bakersfield]], [[Porterville, California|Porterville]], [[Fresno]], [[Visalia, California|Visalia]], [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] and many other towns and cities have developed rapidly in both area and population, satisfying demand for residential housing by people who are priced out of the more costly coastal areas. Many people from [[Los Angeles]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] relocated to growing San Joaquin Valley suburbs in search of more affordable housing, while retaining employment outside the Valley. [[Traffic congestion]] has accompanied these changes, producing [[air pollution]], as thousands of people commute between their Valley residences and their LA or Bay Area employment.

Air pollution was identified as a national environmental and health concern in the 1960s. In 1967 the legislature established the [[California Air Resources Board]] in an effort to reduce pollution. technological and program advances have struggled against an increasing state population and farflung residential communities.

==Highways and other transportation==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Central valley in august.JPG|thumb|left|The valley in late August, looking at [[Tracy, California|Tracy]]]]
Highways [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|CA 99]] run, roughly parallel, north–south through the valley, meeting at only its south end. The Interstate 80 Business Loop connects the two highways at their closest point. [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] crosses it northeast–southwest from [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]] to [[Vacaville]].  Interstate 80 and [[California State Route 58]] are the two major routes east out of the Central Valley, over the Sierra Nevada.  Other routes east over the Sierra Nevada include [[California State Route 178]], [[California State Route 41]] to [[California State Route 120]] via Yosemite National Park, [[California State Route 88]], and [[U.S. Route 50 in California|US Route 50]]. Westbound routes out of the valley are [[California State Route 166]], [[California State Route 46]], [[California State Route 152]], [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]], and Interstate 80. The major ones west out of the valley are [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]], [[California State Route 152|State Route 152]] and [[California State Route 46|State Route 46]], over the [[Diablo Range]]. Other routes include [[California State Route 33]], [[California State Route 198]], [[California State Route 4]], [[California State Route 130]], and other smaller back roads and trails.

[[BNSF]] (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway) and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] both have railway lines in the Central Valley. The BNSF Bakersfield Subdivision runs from [[Bakersfield]] to Calwa, four miles (6&nbsp;km) south of [[Fresno]]. From Calwa the BNSF Stockton Subdivision continues to [[Port Chicago, California|Port Chicago]], west of Antioch. The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] Martinez Subdivision runs from Port Chicago through Martinez, [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to [[Oakland]]. The UP's Fresno Subdivision runs from [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] to [[Bakersfield]]. Traffic passes through a large, historical yard in [[Roseville, California|Roseville]] before heading north to Oregon or east to Nevada. [[Amtrak]] operates six daily ''[[San Joaquins]]'' trains over these lines. 
The Central Valley has major connections to other regions: The [[Mojave Desert]] via [[Tehachapi Pass|Tehachapi]] and [[Walker Pass|Walker]] passes, [[Eastern California]] via [[Tioga Pass|Tioga]], [[Sonora Pass|Sonora]] and [[Carson Pass|Carson]] passes, the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] via [[Polonio Pass|Polonio]] and Cottonwood passes, and [[California State Route 198|State Route 198]], The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] via [[Pacheco Pass|Pacheco]] and [[Altamont Pass|Altamont]] passes, Nevada via [[Donner Pass]], Lake Tahoe via [[Echo Summit]], Susanville region via [[Beckwourth Pass|Beckwourth]] and [[Fredonyer Pass|Fredonyer]] passes, [[Shasta Lake]] via [[Interstate 5]], and [[Southern California]] via [[Tejon Pass]] and the [[Grapevine, California|Grapevine]]

[[California High-Speed Rail]], linking northern and southern California, broke ground in the Central Valley in 2015.

==Utilities==
The state water project's [[Oroville Dam]] in the Sacramento Valley provides water and power for the [[California Aqueduct]] in the San Joaquin Valley. The aqueduct runs from Clifton Court Forebay in the Delta southwards across the [[Transverse Ranges]]. The federal ([[Central Valley Project]]) includes numerous facilities between [[Shasta Dam]] in the north and Bakersfield in the south. [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas and Electric]], [[Western Area Power Administration]], and [[Southern California Edison]] have interconnected electric transmission systems connecting the north and south ends of the Central Valley (examples include [[Path 15]], [[Path 26]], and [[Path 66]]).
