Wright attended a lecture by Frederick G. Sampson in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in the late 1980s, on the [[G.&nbsp;F. Watts]] painting ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', which inspired him to give a sermon in 1990 based on the subject of the painting&nbsp;– "with her clothes in rags, her body scarred and bruised and bleeding, her harp all but destroyed and with only one string left, she had the audacity to make music and praise God.... To take the one string you have left and to have the audacity to hope... that's the real word God will have us hear from this passage and from Watt's painting."<ref>[http://www.preachingtoday.com/sermons/sermons/audacityofhope.html Sermon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725202135/http://www.preachingtoday.com/sermons/sermons/audacityofhope.html |date=2010-07-25 }} printed in Preaching Today, 1990.</ref>  Having attended Wright's sermon, [[Barack Obama]] later adapted Wright's phrase "audacity ''to'' hope" to "audacity ''of'' hope" which became the title for his [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address]], and the title of his [[The Audacity of Hope|second book]].

On June 9, 2009, in an interview with the ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press of Newport News]]'', Wright indicated that he hadn't had contact with Obama up to that point because "Them Jews aren't going to let him talk to me. I told my baby daughter, that he'll talk to me in five years when he's a lame duck, or in eight years when he's out of office." Wright also suggested that Obama did not send a delegation to the [[Durban Review Conference]] in [[Geneva]] on racism because of Zionist pressure saying: "[T]he Jewish vote, the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|A-I-P-A-C]] vote, that's controlling him, that would not let him send representation to the Durban Review Conference, that's talking this craziness on this trip, cause they’re Zionists, they would not let him talk to someone who calls a spade what it is."<ref name=jew>{{cite news|title=Rev.
