'''John Ellis''' "'''Jeb'''" '''Bush''' (born February 11, 1953) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd Governor]] of [[Florida]] from 1999 to 2007. Bush, who grew up in [[Houston]], is the second son of the late former [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and former [[First Lady]] [[Barbara Bush]], and a younger brother of former President [[George W. Bush]]. He graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], and attended the [[University of Texas|University of Texas at Austin]], where he earned a degree in Latin American affairs. In 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in [[real estate development]], and in 1986 became Florida's Secretary of Commerce until 1988.  At that time, he joined his father's [[1988 United States presidential election|successful campaign]] for the Presidency.

In [[1994 Florida gubernatorial election|1994]], Bush made his first run for office, losing the election for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent [[Lawton Chiles]]. Bush ran again in [[1998 Florida gubernatorial election|1998]] and defeated Lieutenant Governor [[Buddy MacKay]] with 55 percent of the vote. He ran for reelection in [[2002 Florida gubernatorial election|2002]], defeating [[Bill McBride (politician)|Bill McBride]] and winning with 56 percent, to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush pushed an ambitious [[Everglades conservation]] plan, supported [[Non-economic damages caps|caps]] for [[medical malpractice]] litigation, launched a [[Medicaid]] [[privatization]] pilot program, and instituted reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting [[school choice]].

Bush announced [[Jeb Bush presidential campaign, 2016|his presidential candidacy]] on June 15, 2015. He suspended his campaign on February 20, 2016, shortly after the [[2016 South Carolina Republican primary|South Carolina primary]] and endorsed Senator [[Ted Cruz]] on March 23, 2016.

Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and his family moved to [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]].

=== 1998 gubernatorial election ===
{{Main|1998 Florida gubernatorial election}}
In 1998, Bush defeated his Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay, by over 418,000 votes (2,191,105; 55% to 1,773,054; 45%) to become [[List of Governors of Florida|Governor of Florida]]. He campaigned as a "consensus-building pragmatist".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Simultaneously, his brother, George W. Bush won a re-election victory for a second term as Governor of Texas, and they became the first siblings to govern two states simultaneously since [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]] and [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] governed [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Arkansas]] from 1967 to 1971.<ref>{{cite news |author=Richard L.

=== Education policy ===
Bush's administration emphasized public education reform. His "A+ Plan" established heightened standards, required testing of all students, and graded all Florida schools.  From 1998 to 2005, reading scores of 4th grade students in Florida on the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] increased 11 points, compared to 2.5 points nationally, according to the [[Maine Heritage Policy Center]], a conservative think tank which opposes standardized testing.<ref name=policy>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/sites/default/files/PN2007-15.pdf |title=Governor Jeb Bush: A Record of Leadership and Policy Accomplishment |publisher=[[Washington Policy Center]] |access-date=May 10, 2014 |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222253/http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/sites/default/files/PN2007-15.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bush has been a proponent of [[school voucher]]s and [[charter school]]s, especially in areas of the state with failing public schools, although to date very few schools have received failing grades from the state. He established the McKay Scholarship Program which provides vouchers for students with learning disabilities to attend a school of their choice.  He also established the A+ Opportunity Scholarship Program which provided vouchers to students.  This program was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court in 2006.<ref>Thomas, Robert.

Bush helped create the Corporate Income Tax Credit Scholarship which provides corporations with tax credits for donations to Scholarship Funding Organizations.  Those organizations must spend 100% of the donations on scholarships for low income students.<ref name=policy />

Bush declined to raise taxes for education, which led him to oppose a ballot initiative to amend the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]] so as to cap growing school class sizes.

=== Health policy ===
As governor, Bush proposed and passed into law major reform to the medical liability system. The [[Florida Senate]], a majority of which were Republican, opposed Bush's proposed caps on non-economic damages for injury and [[wrongful death]]. Bush insisted, and called the legislature into five special sessions. The contentious debate even included a senior Bush staffer calling for primary opposition to Republicans who disagreed with the Governor on the reforms. Eventually, the legislature agreed to the caps and Bush's reforms passed. In 2014, after Bush left office, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] ruled the damage cap – the "centerpiece" of the 2003 legislation that Bush had pushed for – to be a violation of the [[Florida Constitution|state Constitution's]] [[equal protection clause]], discriminating against "those who are most grievously injured, those who sustain the greatest damage and loss, and multiple claimants."<ref>Mary Ellen Klas, [http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/article1961331.html Fla.

In 1995, the Florida state legislature created the [[Florida high speed rail|High Speed Rail Authority]] (HSRA) and came up with a public-private partnership model. Government would build the system leveraging state dollars with federal funds and tax-free bonding. The private sector was to invest money in the project, help design and build the network, and be given the franchise to operate the trains (known as [[Project delivery method#Types of Project Delivery Methods|design-build-maintain-operate, or DBOM]]). Trains would be privately owned, similar to how the airline industry operates in a publicly financed airport.<ref name="Florida Bullet Train">[http://www.floridabullettrain.org/fhsra/1_overview.html Florida High Speed Rail – Overview] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130414175403/http://www.floridabullettrain.org/fhsra/1_overview.html |date=April 14, 2013 }}. Florida Bullet Train.org. Retrieved on 2010-11-09.</ref>

The rail system and its planning was estimated to cost $7–$8 billion. The Florida HSRA and the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] (FDOT) reached an agreement with a consortium that included the [[Fluor Corporation]] and [[Bombardier Transportation]]. The consortium agreed to invest $300 million and utilize the DBOM functionality. The state of Florida would float state bonds, and FDOT would commit $70 million annually (increasing three percent yearly to account for inflation) to service the bonds for the next thirty years. Federal monies would pay for the interest on the bonds, and the state monies would satisfy the principal. When the high-speed railroad was running, operating surpluses would also be applied to the debt.<ref name=wait>{{cite book | last = McCommons | first = James | title = Waiting on a Train | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing Company | year = 2009 | location = [[White River Junction, Vermont]] | pages = 258–259 | url = http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/waiting_on_a_train:paperback/ | isbn = 978-1-60358-064-9 | access-date = September 9, 2013 | archive-date = August 30, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130830132519/http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/waiting_on_a_train:paperback/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

The high-speed rail project nearly came to fruition until Bush became governor in 1999 and ended the project his second day in office,<ref name=wait /> stating that the venture posed too much risk and cost for Florida taxpayers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-01-14/news/9901140221_1_jeb-bush-bullet-train-overland-express |title=Bullet train hits a big obstacle – Jeb Bush |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=January 14, 1999 |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |archive-date=May 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521041036/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-01-14/news/9901140221_1_jeb-bush-bullet-train-overland-express |url-status=live }}</ref> State legislators reacted by adding the project on the 2000 ballot as a constitutional amendment which was ultimately passed by voters. The amendment directed Bush and legislature to start building the railroad system by 2003. Bush vetoed funding for both the project and the board, and led a high-profile campaign to repeal the constitutional requirement that mandated the construction of the high-speed system.<ref name="Florida Bullet Train" /><ref name=wait /> Voters repealed the constitutional amendment. Many who voted believed they were supporting the train, though in fact a "yes" vote was to approve the repeal.<ref name=wait />

FDOT spokesperson Nazih Haddah commented that "the rhetoric was inflammatory and misleading. It was really exaggerating tactics that were used to defeat this. The financing and the project were sound. It really squandered a great opportunity for this state."<ref name=wait /> Other public officials stated that Bush's underhanded tactics were emblematic of his willingness to protect moneyed interests –  including developers, energy producers and highway builders – who opposed a shift toward mass transit and helped fund the repeal effort.

=== Economic issues ===
Bush supports a decrease in capital gains taxes and property taxes. He supports cutting taxes for all Americans and believes they do better with less government interference.

Kennedy]]'s 1955 book ''[[Profiles in Courage]]''.
