==History==

Together with the [[Hunkpapa]] and [[Sihasapa]] bands, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is part of what was known as the [[Great Sioux Nation]]. The peoples were highly decentralized. In 1868 the lands of the Great Sioux Nation were reduced in the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]] to the east side of the [[Missouri River]] and the state line of [[South Dakota]] in the west. The [[Black Hills]], considered by the Sioux to be sacred land, are located in the center of territory awarded to the tribe.

In 1874, in direct violation of the treaty,  General [[George A. Custer]] and his 7th Cavalry entered the Black Hills and discovered gold, starting a [[gold rush]].  The United States government wanted to buy or rent the Black Hills from the Lakota people, but led by their spiritual leader [[Sitting Bull]], they refused to sell or rent their lands.  The [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] was a series of battles and negotiations that occurred between 1876 and 1877, with the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne warring against the United States. Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], often known as Custer's Last Stand, the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Native Americans. It was an overwhelming Native American victory. The U.S. with its superior resources was soon able to force the Native Americans to surrender, primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property.  The Agreement of 1877 (19 Stat. 254, enacted February 28, 1877) officially annexed Sioux land and permanently established Native American reservations. Under the Agreement of 1877 the U.S. government [[Black Hills Land Claim|took the Black Hills from the Sioux Nation]].<ref name="Standing Rock Sioux Tribe">{{cite web | url=http://standingrock.org/environmental-profile/ | title=ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE | publisher=Standing Rock Sioux Tribe | access-date=2 October 2016 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170049/http://standingrock.org/environmental-profile/ | archive-date=6 June 2017 }}</ref>

In February 1890, the United States government broke a Lakota treaty by breaking up the [[Great Sioux Reservation]], an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state. It reduced it and divided it into five smaller reservations.<ref>Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 15.</ref>  The government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern United States; in addition, it intended to "break up tribal relationships" and "conform Indians to the white man's ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must".<ref>Wallace, Anthony F. C. "Revitalization Movements: Some Theoretical Considerations for Their Comparative Study", ''American Anthropologist'' n.s. 58(2):264-81. 1956</ref> On the reduced reservations, the government allocated family units on {{convert|320|acre|km2|adj=on}} plots for individual households.

Although the Lakota were historically a [[nomadic people]] living in [[tipi]]s, and their Plains Native American culture was based strongly upon buffalo and [[horse culture]], they were expected to farm and raise livestock. With the goal of assimilation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were forced to send their children to [[Native American boarding school|boarding schools]]; the schools taught English and Christianity, as well as American cultural practices. Generally, they forbade inclusion of Native American traditional culture and language. The children were beaten if they tried to do anything related to their native culture.

The farming plan failed to take into account the difficulty that Lakota farmers would have in trying to cultivate crops in the semi-arid region of South Dakota. By the end of the 1890 growing season, a time of intense heat and low rainfall, it was clear that the land was unable to produce substantial agricultural yields. As the bison had been virtually eradicated a few years earlier, the Lakota were at risk of starvation. The people turned to the [[Ghost Dance]] ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. [[James McLaughlin (Indian agent)|Agent James McLaughlin]] asked for more troops. He claimed that spiritual leader Sitting Bull was the real leader of the movement. A former agent, [[Valentine McGillycuddy]], saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying: "The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-Day Adventists]] prepare the ascension robes for the Second Coming of the Savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why should not the Indians have the same privilege? If the troops remain, trouble is sure to come."<ref>{{cite book |last=Brands |first=H.W. |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOBpgsNQMwQC&pg=PA18 |title=The Reckless Decade: America in the 1890s |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=18}}</ref>

Thousands of additional U.S. Army troops were deployed to the reservation. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull was arrested for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance.<ref>Kehoe, ''The Ghost Dance'', p. 20.</ref> During his arrest, one of Sitting Bull's men, Catch the Bear, fired at Lieutenant "Bull Head", striking his right side. He instantly wheeled and shot Sitting Bull, hitting him in the left side, and both men subsequently died.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWsittingB.htm |title=Sitting Bull: Biography |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |access-date=2012-05-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525001229/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWsittingB.htm |archive-date=2012-05-25 }}</ref><ref>"The Taming of the Sioux", by [[Frank Bennett Fiske]], 1917, Bismarck Tribune, Bismarck ND</ref>

The Hunkpapa who lived in Sitting Bull's camp and relatives fled to the south. They joined the Big Foot Band in Cherry Creek, South Dakota, before traveling to the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] to meet with [[Chief Red Cloud]]. The 7th Cavalry caught them at a place called [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] on December 29, 1890. The 7th Cavalry, claiming they were trying to disarm the Lakota people, killed 300 people, including women and children at Wounded Knee.<ref name="Standing Rock Sioux Tribe" />

==Governance and districts==
[[File:Standing Rock Administrative Service (14235787848).jpg|thumb|Standing Rock Administrative Service building, Fort Yates]]
According to its constitution,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standingrock.org/sites/default/files/uploads/standing_rock_sioux_tribe_constitution.pdf |title=Standing Rock Constitution, approved 1958, with amendments through 2008 |publisher=Standing Rock Tribe | access-date=2015-10-01}}</ref> Standing Rock's governing body is the elected 17-member Tribal Council, including the Tribal Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and 14 representatives. As of 2018, the current chairman is [[Mike Faith (Lakota leader)|Mike Faith]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standingrock.org/content/tribal-council |title=Tribal Council |publisher=Standing Rock Tribe | access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref>

They serve terms of four years, with elections providing for staggered replacement of members. Six members are elected [[at-large]] and eight from the regional [[single-member district]]s: 
 
* [[Fort Yates, North Dakota|Fort Yates]]  (Long Soldier)
* [[Porcupine, North Dakota|Porcupine]]
* Kenel
* [[Wakpala]]
* [[Running Antelope]] ([[Little Eagle, South Dakota|Little Eagle]])
* Bear Soldier ([[McLaughlin, South Dakota|McLaughlin]])
* Rock Creek ([[Bullhead, South Dakota|Bullhead]])
* Cannonball

== Environmental issues ==

In the 1960s, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]] built five large dams on the [[Missouri River]], and implemented the [[Pick–Sloan Missouri Basin Program]], forcing Native Americans to relocate from large areas to be flooded behind the dams. These dams were for flood control and hydroelectric power generation in the region. More than {{cvt|200000|acres|km2}} on the Standing Rock Reservation and the [[Cheyenne River Reservation]] in South Dakota were flooded by the [[Oahe Dam]] alone.

As of 2015, poverty remains a problem for the displaced populations in the Dakotas. They have sought compensation for their towns submerged under [[Lake Oahe]], and the loss of traditional ways of life.<ref>{{cite web|title = No Man's Land: The Last Tribes of the Plains.

== Dakota Access Pipeline ==
[[File:"Happi" American Horse direct action against DAPL, August 2016.png|thumb|[[Lakota people|Lakota]] man locks himself to construction equipment to stop progress of the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] near the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, Summer 2016]]
{{further|Dakota Access Pipeline protests}}

The [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] (DAPL) was rerouted near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation after a proposed route near the state capital [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] was denied as being deemed too risky for Bismarck's water supplies. The tribe opposed the pipeline to be constructed under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River.

On April 1, 2016, [[LaDonna Brave Bull Allard]], an elder member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and her grandchildren established the Sacred Stone Camp to protest the DAPL, which they said threatens the upper Missouri River, the only water supply for the Standing Rock Reservation. The camp was on Allard's private land and served as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the DAPL.<ref name="BACKGROUND ON THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE">{{cite web|url=http://standingrock.org/data/upfiles/media/Backgrounder%20DAPL%20SRST%20FINAL.pdf|title=BACKGROUND ON THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909050159/http://standingrock.org/data/upfiles/media/Backgrounder%20DAPL%20SRST%20FINAL.pdf|archive-date=9 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Yes!

On the weekend of December 2, 2016, approximately 2000 United States military veterans arrived in North Dakota in support of the activists. The veterans pledged to form a human shield to protect the protesters from police.<ref>{{cite web|website=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/30/veterans-give-protesters-break-standing-rock/94698198/|title=2,000 veterans to give protesters a break at Standing Rock|date=December 2, 2016|first=Melanie|last=Eversley|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref>

In January 2017, an executive order was issued by President Donald Trump to streamline the approval to construct the pipeline, on the basis of creating more jobs. The order provoked a new wave of protests and response from leaders of the Sioux tribe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/trump-keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipelines-executive-actions/index.html|title=Trump advances controversial oil pipelines with executive action|author=Athena Jones, Jeremy Diamond and Gregory Krieg|website=CNN|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref>

On February 3, 2017, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would close lands where protesters were camped near Lake Oahe by February 22, 2017.  Over 4,000 U.S. veterans under the name Veterans Stand were camped at Standing Rock along with hundreds of protesters as well as the members of the Sioux Tribe.  The veterans  vowed to oppose the pipeline and protect the land of the American Indians and the water of the United States.  Since August 2016, the total number of protesters arrested had surpassed 700, and on February 3, 2017, 39-year-old American Indian activist Chase Iron Eyes and more than 70 peaceably assembled protesters were arrested in a police raid ordered by the Trump administration, on charges of "inciting a riot" which is considered a felony and carries up to 5 years in prison.  At that time more than 9.2&nbsp;million Americans had signed a petition against DAPL.

On February 7, 2017, President Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending its environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period.[12] The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.[13]

The tribe sued and in March 2020 a federal judge sided with them and ordered  [[USACE]] to do a full [[environmental impact statement]].  In a 42-page decision Judge [[James Boasberg]] said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the Corps was severely lacking.  “In projects of this scope, it is not difficult for an opponent to find fault with many conclusions made by an operator and relied on by the agency, but here, there is considerably more than a few isolated comments raising insubstantial concerns.  The many commenters in this case pointed to serious gaps in crucial parts of the Corps’ analysis — to name a few, that the pipeline's leak-detection system was unlikely to work, that it was not designed to catch slow spills, that the operator's serious history of incidents had not been taken into account, and that the worst-case scenario used by the Corps was potentially only a fraction of what a realistic figure would be."  The case will continue.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beitsch |first1=Rebecca |title=Court sides with tribes in Dakota Access Pipeline case, ordering full environmental review |url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489488-court-sides-with-tribes-in-dakota-access-pipeline-case-ordering |website=The Hill |access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref>

Two days later Energy Transfer Partners purchased the property where protests were being staged, from David and Brenda Meyer of [[Flasher, North Dakota]].
