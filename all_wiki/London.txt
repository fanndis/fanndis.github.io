==Toponymy==
{{main|Etymology of London}}
''London'' is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form {{lang|la|[[Londinium]]}};<ref name="mills_139">{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139}}</ref> for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70–80 include the word {{lang|la|Londinio}} ('in London').<ref name=NameTablets>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36415563 |title=UK's oldest hand-written document 'at Roman London dig' |publisher=BBC News |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>

Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}, written around 1136.<ref name="mills_139"/> This had it that the name originated from a supposed [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.<ref name=london_009>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html |title=London |last=Ackroyd |first=Peter |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2008 |date=2 December 2001 |isbn=978-0-7011-7279-4}}</ref>

Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: [[Latin]] (usually {{lang|la|Londinium}}), [[Old English]] (usually {{lang|ang|Lunden}}), and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (usually {{lang|cy|Llundein}}), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from [[Common Brittonic|Common Brythonic]]; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as {{lang|cel-x-proto|*Londonjon}} or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as {{lang|la|Londinium}} and borrowed into [[Old English]], the ancestor-language of English.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal |last1=Bynon |first1=Theodora |year=2016 |title=London's Name |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=114 |issue= 3|pages=281–97 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.12064}}</ref>

The toponymy of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was [[Richard Coates]]'s 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] *{{PIE|''(p)lowonida''}}, meaning "river too wide to ford". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, {{lang|cel-x-proto|*Lowonidonjon}}.<ref name=coates>{{cite journal |last=Coates |first=Richard |year=1998 |title=A new explanation of the name of London |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=203–229 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027 }}</ref> However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of a [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *{{PIE|''lend<sup>h</sup>-''}} ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix {{lang|cel-x-proto|*-injo-}} or {{lang|cel-x-proto|*-onjo-}} (used to form place-names). [[Peter Schrijver]] has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.<ref>Peter Schrijver, ''Language Contact and the Origins of the Germanic Languages'', Routledge Studies in Linguistics, 13 (New York: Routledge, 2014), p. 57.</ref><ref name="auto"/>

Until 1889, the name "London" applied officially to the [[City of London]], but since then it has also referred to the County of London and [[Greater London]].<ref name="mills_140">{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=140}}</ref>

In writing, "London" is, on occasion, [[colloquial]]ly [[contraction (grammar)|contracted]] to "LDN".<ref>{{cite web |title=LDN Flood Week 2017 |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/ldn-flood-week-2017 |accessdate=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912022230/https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/ldn-flood-week-2017 |archive-date=12 September 2018 |url-status=live |date=9 November 2017}}</ref>{{clarify|date=February 2020}} Such usage originated in [[SMS language]], and is often found, on a [[social media]] [[user profile]], [[suffix]]ing an [[pseudonym|alias]] or handle.

===Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London===
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early [[5th century]], London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of [[Londinium]] was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the area of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] until around 450.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108092449/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm |archive-date=8 January 2009 |publisher=Museum of London |title=The last days of Londinium |accessdate=31 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> From around 500, an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement known as [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] developed slightly west of the old Roman city.<ref name=london_011>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |title=The early years of Lundenwic |publisher=The [[Museum of London]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610043903/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production.

The [[Vikings]] established [[Danelaw]] over much of eastern and northern England; its boundary stretched roughly from London to [[Chester]]. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the [[Danes|Danish]] [[warlord]], [[Guthrum]] and the [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] king [[Alfred the Great]] in 886. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.<ref name="blackwell">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vince |first=Alan |year=2001 |title=London |editor=Lapidge, Michael |editor2=Blair, John |editor3=Keynes, Simon |editor4=Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}</ref>

By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. [[Westminster Abbey]], rebuilt in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by King [[Edward the Confessor]], was one of the grandest churches in Europe.

In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the [[Westminster|City of Westminster]] developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.<ref name=london_019>{{Cite book |last1=Schofield |first1=John |last2=Vince |first2=Alan|author2-link=Alan Vince |title=Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8264-6002-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu7QLC7g7VgC&pg=PA26 |page=26 }}</ref> Disaster struck in the form of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml |title=Black Death |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live |magazine=BBC History |accessdate=3 November 2008 }}</ref> London was the focus of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.<ref name=london_020>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/richard_ii_king.shtml |title=Richard II (1367–1400) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191132/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/richard_ii_king.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

London was also a centre of England's [[History of the Jews in England (1066–1290)|Jewish population]] before their [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290.

[[File:London - John Norden's map of 1593.jpg|thumb|Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.]]

During the [[Tudor period]] the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.<ref name=pevsner>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, Nikolaus]]. ''London I: The Cities of London and Westminster'' rev. edition, 1962. Introduction p. 48.</ref> In 1475, the [[Hanseatic League]] set up its main trading base (''[[kontor]]'') of England in London, called the ''Stalhof'' or ''[[Steelyard]]''. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] sold the property to [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].<ref name=EB>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Steelyard, Merchants of the}}</ref> [[Woollen]] cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the [[Low Countries]], where it was considered indispensable.<ref>J.

But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the [[Mediterranean]] Sea normally lay through [[Antwerp]] and over the [[Alps]]; any ships passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to or from England were likely to be Italian or [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]]. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.<ref>Ramsay, George Daniel (1986).

London became the principal [[North Sea]] port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.<ref name=pevsner/>

In the 16th century [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]]. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on [[James I of England|James I]] in Westminster, in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605.<ref name=london_023>{{Cite book |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-07779-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jamesi0000durs/page/59 59] |url=https://archive.org/details/jamesi0000durs/page/59 }}</ref>

In 1637, the government of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to reform administration in the area of London. The plan called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city.  Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the [[Liberties of London]], a lack of interest in administering these additional areas, or concern by city guilds of having to share power, the Corporation refused.  Later called "The Great Refusal", this decision largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the [[City of London|City]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Doolittle | first1 = Ian | year = 2014 | title = 'The Great Refusal': Why Does the City of London Corporation Only Govern the Square Mile? | journal = The London Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 21–36 | doi = 10.1179/0305803413Z.00000000038 | s2cid = 159791907 }}</ref>

In the [[English Civil War]] the majority of Londoners supported the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] cause. After an initial advance by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] in 1642, culminating in the battles of [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]] and [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the [[Lines of Communication (London)|Lines of Communication]]. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.<ref>David Flintham.

The [[coffeehouse]] became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing [[literacy]] and the development of the [[printing press]] making news widely available; and [[Fleet Street]] became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London international issue{{clarify|date=January 2017}} was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the [[Royal Navy]] became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yor4DAAAQBAJ |title=Finance Masters: A Brief History of International Financial Centers in the Last Millennium |last=Coispeau |first=Olivier |date=2016 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-310-884-4 }}</ref> In 1888, London became home to a series of murders by a man known only as [[Jack the Ripper]] and It has since become one of the world's most famous unsolved mysteries.

The headquarters of the GLA is [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], [[Southwark]].

Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018.

The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. Historically London grew up at the [[lowest bridging point]] on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marsh]]lands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.<ref name=london_065>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&pg=PR11 |title=London: A History |first=Francis |last=Sheppard |page=10 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-285369-1 |accessdate=6 June 2008}}</ref>

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[Tributaries of the River Thames|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]].

In 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat.

London has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb ''). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is {{Convert|189|mm|in|order=flip|abbr=}} in November 1755 and the least is {{Convert|0|mm|in|order=flip|abbr=}} in both December 1788 and July 1800.

===Districts===
{{main|List of districts of London|London boroughs}}

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as [[Mayfair]], [[Southwark]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.<ref name=london_071>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |title=London boroughs&nbsp;— London Life, GLA |publisher=London Government |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213025156/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |archive-date=13 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=london_072>{{Cite book |last1=Dogan |first1=Mattei |first2=John D. |last2=Kasarda |title=The Metropolis Era |publisher=Sage |year=1988 |page=99 |isbn=978-0-8039-2603-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GFPAAAAMAAJ&q=1965,+32+boroughs+of+london }}</ref> The City of London is the main financial district,<ref name=london_073>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |title=London as a financial centre |publisher=Mayor of London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106051217/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |archive-date=6 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Canary Wharf]] has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] to the east.

London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, these being a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the [[Tudor period|Tudor-period]] [[Hampton Court Palace]], England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] {{circa}}1515.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |magazine=BBC History |date=29 March 2011 |author=Foyle, Jonathan |accessdate=16 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430191119/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by [[Christopher Wren|Wren]], neoclassical financial institutions such as the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]].

The disused – but soon to be rejuvenated – 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].<ref name=london_078>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |title=Paddington Station |publisher=Great Buildings |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525164017/http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]] and [[Canary Wharf]], high residential densities in [[inner London]], and lower densities in [[Outer London]].

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]].<ref name=london_077>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1&xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml |title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=12 October 2008 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Lonsdale |date=27 March 2008 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130308205754/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/greenproperty/3360810/Eco-homes-Wooden-it-be-lovely...-.html |archive-date=8 March 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

London's skyscrapers, such as [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]], are mostly in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London (see [[Tall buildings in London]]), including the 95-storey [[Shard London Bridge]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United Kingdom|tallest building in the United Kingdom]].

Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,<ref name=london_079>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |title=Inside London's new 'glass egg' |date=16 July 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528025840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |archive-date=28 May 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> the [[Art Deco]] [[BBC Broadcasting House]] plus the [[Postmodernism|Postmodernist]] [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] and [[No 1 Poultry]] by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

===Natural history===
The London Natural History Society suggest that London is "one of the World's Greenest Cities" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the [[Tideway|tidal Thames]] supports 120 species of fish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lnhs.org.uk/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212143739/http://www.lnhs.org.uk/Index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2007 |title=Wildlife in London, England: LNHS Home page |website=lnhs.org.uk }}</ref> They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in [[central London]] and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's [[wetland]] areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), two [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s and 76 [[List of local nature reserves in Greater London|local nature reserve]]s.<ref>London Natural History Society.</ref>

[[Amphibians]] are common in the capital, including [[smooth newt]]s living by the [[Tate Modern]], and [[common frog]]s, [[common toad]]s, [[palmate newt]]s and [[great crested newt]]s. On the other hand, native reptiles such as [[slowworm]]s, [[common lizard]]s, [[barred grass snake]]s and [[Vipera berus|adders]], are mostly only seen in [[Outer London]].<ref>Laurie Tuffrey (27 July 2012).

Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 [[red fox]]es, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the [[Houses of Parliament]], where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]], reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth{{nbsp}}II's prized [[pink flamingo]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}  Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based [[Mammal Society]] found that 80 per cent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around.

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world.

===Accents===
The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of [[Cockney]] with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular [[Caribbean]], which help to form an accent labelled [[Multicultural London English]] (MLE).<ref name="MCLE">{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html |title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |work=The Independent |location=London |date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513074846/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.

Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,<ref name=london_121>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |title=Transport for London |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=27 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104235448/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/ |archive-date=4 January 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL).

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref name=stat_tfl>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp |archive-date=19 October 2007 |title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=5 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Suburban====
There are more than 360 [[railway stations]] in the [[London fare zones|London Travelcard Zones]] on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines.

Some international railway services to [[Continental Europe]] were operated during the 20th century as [[boat train]]s, such as the ''[[Admiraal de Ruijter (train)|Admiraal de Ruijter]]'' to [[Amsterdam]] and the ''[[Night Ferry]]'' to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing [[Eurostar]] services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras International]] with [[Lille]], [[Calais]], [[Paris]], [[Disneyland Paris]], [[Brussels]], [[Amsterdam]] and other European tourist destinations via the [[High Speed 1]] rail link and the [[Channel Tunnel]].<ref name=london_128>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.jsp;ERSPRDSession=LJqZB7nyKlW9lVLvZzK534LvMjL519fPDS4R0QGn51CprylVmjH8!685848002 |title=Eurostar |publisher=Eurostar |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429060917/http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.jsp;ERSPRDSession=LJqZB7nyKlW9lVLvZzK534LvMjL519fPDS4R0QGn51CprylVmjH8!685848002 |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The first [[Southeastern (train operating company)|high-speed domestic]] trains started in June 2009 linking [[Kent]] to London.<ref name="Southeastern Highspeed">{{cite web |url=http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/highspeed/ |title=Highspeed |publisher=Southeastern |accessdate=5 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501110057/http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/highspeed/ |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> There are plans for a [[High Speed 2|second high speed line]] linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.

====Freight====
Although [[rail freight]] levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and [[landfill]] waste.<ref name="Freight Plan">August 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150529165228/https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/rail-freight-strategy-aug-2007.pdf Rail Freight Strategy], [[London Rail]]</ref> As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as [[containerisation|container freight]] from the Channel Tunnel and [[English Channel]] ports, and [[nuclear waste]] for [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] at [[Sellafield]].<ref name="Freight Plan"/>

London's coach hub is [[Victoria Coach Station]], an [[Art Deco]] building opened in 1932. The coach station was initially run by a group of coach companies under the name of London Coastal Coaches; however, in 1970 the service and station were included in the nationalisation of the country's coach services, becoming part of the National Bus Company. In 1988, the coach station was purchased by London Transport which then became [[Transport for London]]. Victoria Coach Station has weekly passenger numbers of over 200,000 and provides services across the UK and Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Matters|first=Transport for London {{!}} Every Journey|title=Victoria Coach Station - Celebrating 75 years of service|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/|access-date=2020-08-16|website=tfl.gov.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The cable car crosses the [[River Thames]], and links [[Greenwich Peninsula]] and the [[Royal Docks]] in the east of the city. It is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares are charged.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} It cost £60&nbsp;million to build and carries more than 3,500 passengers every day. Similar to the [[Santander Cycles]] bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].

===Port and river boats===
The [[Port of London]], once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.<ref name=handling>{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2009 |title=ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Provisional Port Statistics 2009 |publisher=Department for Transport&nbsp;– Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110203090417/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2009 |archive-date=3 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most of this cargo passes through the [[Port of Tilbury]], outside the boundary of Greater London.<ref name="handling" />

===Roads===
Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/london-roads-to-nowhere-2207351.html |title=London: Roads to nowhere |date=2011-02-08 |website=The Independent |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at {{convert|117|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Highways Agency |date=25 June 2018 |url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/key-roads/m25/ |accessdate=25 June 2018 |title=M25 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/70RoYooMF?url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/our-network/key-roads/m25/ |archive-date= 25 June 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[M1 motorway|M1]] connect London to [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]].

London is [[List of museums in London|home to many museums]], galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major [[tourist attraction]]s as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the [[British Museum]] in [[Bloomsbury]], in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7&nbsp;million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the [[National Gallery]] was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in [[Trafalgar Square]].

The [[British Library]] is one of the [[List of largest libraries|largest libraries in the world]], and the [[national library]] of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/british-library |publisher=HM Government |title=British Library |access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref> There are many other research libraries, including the [[Wellcome Library]] and [[Dana Library and Research Centre|Dana Centre]], as well as [[academic library|university libraries]], including the [[British Library of Political and Economic Science]] at [[London School of Economics|LSE]], the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]] at [[Imperial College London|Imperial]], the [[Maughan Library]] at [[King's College London|King's]], and the [[Senate House Libraries]] at the [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aim25.com/which_inst.htm |title=List of repositories |access-date=3 January 2020 |publisher=Archives in London and the M25 area}}</ref><ref>{{cite-news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/futurelondon/culturecity/best-libraries-in-london-wellcome-trust-british-library-canada-water-victoria-and-albert-guildhall-a4072696.html |title=Best libraries in London |work=[[Evening Standard]] |access-date=3 January 2020 |date=21 February 2019}}</ref>

Three major national museums are there: the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (for the [[applied arts]]), the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], and the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]]. The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/about/organisation.php |title=Organisation |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000, this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which was built by the [[Basel]]-based architecture firm of [[Herzog & de Meuron]].<ref>https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/126-150/126-tate-modern.html</ref>
