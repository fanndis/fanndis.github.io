'''National Junior College (NJC)''' (Simplified Chinese: 国家初级学院) is the first junior college to be established in Singapore. Founded on 20 January 1969, National Junior College offers a two-year course for pre-university students and a six-year [[Integrated Programme]], both leading up to the [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level]] qualification.

==History==
First announced by Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in May 1965 as a "super secondary boarding school", it was the first specialised co-educational government school established in independent Singapore for top pre-university students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650503-1.2.119|title=Lee plans a super Eton-style boarding school|date=3 May 1965|work=The Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="historysg">{{cite web |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/6db0a432-163b-4fd0-a0cd-dba930954d52#9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141125022954/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/6db0a432-163b-4fd0-a0cd-dba930954d52 |archivedate= 25 November 2014 | title= Establishment of Singapore's First Junior College |year=2014 |accessdate= 25 November 2014| website = National Library Board, Singapore|publisher= HistorySG }}</ref>

It was announced in December 1965 by then Minister for Education [[Ong Pang Boon]] that a centralised "junior college" system would be established to optimise the use of teachers and laboratory facilities and to create more educational opportunities for [[pre-university]] students. This system replaced the previous pre-university education conducted at various secondary schools across the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19680116-1.2.61.aspx|title=Singapore builds a new step in higher education|last=W.|first=Campbell|date=16 January 1968|work=The Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref> In 1967, construction began on the first institution that operated under this arrangement, which was named National Junior College.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wong|first1=Moh Keed|title=And they called us car park attendants : Singapore's first JC|date=2009|publisher=National Junior College|location=Singapore|isbn=9789810827175|page=8}}</ref> On 20 January 1969, an inaugural assembly was held with the pioneer batch of 572 students. The college was officially declared open by Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] on 14 May 1970.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b7d4a996-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad|title=Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew talking with students at  …|website=nas.gov.sg|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>

Unlike other pre-university schools of the time, students were given the freedom and flexibility to opt for their subjects under the college's lecture and tutorial system. This resulted in over 40 different subject combinations. Besides General Paper, which was compulsory, other subjects offered to students included Art, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, English Literature, Geography, History and Mathematics.<ref name=":1" />

In keeping with its name and philosophy, the College claims no affiliation with any secondary school but instead draws its students from a wide spectrum. In addition, Singapore students learn alongside students from India, China, Hong Kong, Korea as well as [[ASEAN]] countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. NJC also plays host to German, PRC, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and Japanese students in exchange programmes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nationaljc.moe.edu.sg/programmes/researchnjc/#IREAP|title=IREP – Research@NJC|website=nationaljc.moe.edu.sg|publisher=National Junior College, Singapore|access-date=25 December 2016}}</ref>

In January 1985, National Junior College introduced the [[Art Elective Programme (Singapore)|Art Elective Programme]], and subsequently rolled out the Humanities Scheme in 1987 with experienced British teachers specially arranged to tutor students in various humanities subjects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850117-1.2.27.38|title=Art scheme's expat teacher|date=17 January 1985|work=The Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861023-1.2.21.31|title=3 more JCs added to list of centres|date=23 October 1986|work=The Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref> In 1992, NJC became the first junior college to offer German as part of its Language Elective Programme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19910929-1.2.62.36.1.7|title=NJC to have A-level German|date=29 September 1991|work=The Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>
