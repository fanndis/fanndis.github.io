Lisicki's serve is among the most powerful on the WTA Tour, having been described variously as a "cannon" and a "howitzer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisearth.com/news/tennisNews/Wimbledon-2013-Serena-Williams-vs-Sabine-Lisicki-Match-Preview-176031.htm|title=Wimbledon 2013: Serena Williams vs Sabine Lisicki Match Preview|work=Tennis Earth|first=Abhimanyu|last=Nagpal|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> She is known to hit serves at speeds of over 120&nbsp;mph,<ref name=serve>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/10153086/Wimbledon-2013-top-seed-and-defending-champion-Serena-Williams-toppled-by-Sabine-Lisicki.html|title=Wimbledon 2013: top seed and defending champion Serena Williams toppled by Sabine Lisicki|work=The Telegraph|first=Jim|last=White|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/tennis/news/12111/8784356/Wimbledon-Sky-Sports-tennis-expert-Raz-Mirza-talks-to-Sabine-Lisicki|title=Wimbledon: Sky Sports' tennis expert Raz Mirza talks to Sabine Lisicki|work=Sky Sports|first=Razwan|last=Mirza|date=22 June 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> and at the [[2014 Bank of the West Classic]] she broke the WTA fastest serve record with a speed of 131&nbsp;mph, a record previously held by [[Venus Williams]] at 129&nbsp;mph.<ref name="BBC131"/>

Her serve is often regarded as her main weapon and with it, for the year up to November 2013, she was ranked fifth in the WTA for first service points won, 70.7%, and fifth for service games won, 73.7%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Rankings_Stats/match_stats_2013.pdf|title=WTA Tour Matchfacts|author=WTA Championships|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref>  She was ranked second in the aces count in 2013, only behind Serena Williams, and was ranked fifth in 2014.
