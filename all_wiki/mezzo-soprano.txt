{{Voice type}}
A '''mezzo-soprano''' or '''mezzo''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|s|oʊ|}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|z|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|ˈmɛddzo soˈpraːno|language}} meaning "half soprano") is a type of [[classical music|classical]] female [[singing]] [[human voice|voice]] whose [[vocal range]] lies between the [[soprano]] and the [[contralto]] [[voice type]]s. The mezzo-soprano's vocal range usually extends from the A below [[middle C]] to the A two octaves above (i.e. A<sub>3</sub>–A<sub>5</sub> in [[scientific pitch notation]], where middle C = C<sub>4</sub>; 220–880 Hz). In the lower and upper extremes, some mezzo-sopranos may extend down to the F below middle C (F<sub>3</sub>, 175 Hz) and as high as "high C" (C<sub>6</sub>, 1047 Hz).<ref name=Appelman>{{cite book

The mezzo-soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic mezzo-soprano.

== History ==
While mezzo-sopranos typically sing secondary roles in operas, notable exceptions include the title role in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', Angelina ([[Cinderella]]) in [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', and Rosina in Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Barber of Seville]]'' (all of which are also sung by sopranos, and the latter two by contraltos). Many 19th-century [[French-language operas]] give the leading female role to mezzos, including ''[[Béatrice et Bénédict]]'', ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', ''[[Don Quichotte]]'', ''[[La favorite]]'', ''[[Dom Sébastien]]'', ''[[Charles VI (opera)|Charles VI]]'', ''[[Mignon]]'', ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', ''[[Les Troyens]]'', and ''[[Werther]]'', as well as ''Carmen''.

Typical roles for mezzo-sopranos include the stereotypical triad associated with contraltos of "witches, bitches, and britches": witches, nurses, and wise women, such as Azucena in Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]''; villains and seductresses such as Amneris in Verdi's ''[[Aida]]''; and "[[breeches role]]s" or "trouser roles" (male characters played by female singers) such as Cherubino in Mozart's ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]''. Mezzo-sopranos are well represented in [[baroque music]], [[early music]], and [[baroque opera]].<ref name=Appelman /> Some roles designated for lighter [[soubrette]] sopranos are sung by mezzo-sopranos, who often provide a fuller, more dramatic quality. Such roles include Despina in Mozart's ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and Zerlina in his ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.<ref name=Caldwell>{{cite book

The [[vocal range]] of the mezzo-sopranos lies between the [[soprano]] and the [[contralto]] [[voice type]]s. Mezzo-sopranos generally have a heavier, darker tone than sopranos. The mezzo-soprano voice resonates in a higher range than that of a contralto. The terms ''[[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre|Dugazon]]'' and ''[[Célestine Galli-Marié|Galli-Marié]]'' are sometimes used to refer to light mezzo-sopranos, after the names of famous singers. Usually men singing within the female range are called [[countertenor]]s since there is a lighter more breathy tonal (falsetto) quality difference.<ref name=Stark>{{cite book

==Subtypes and roles in opera==
Within the mezzo-soprano voice type category are three generally recognized subcategories: coloratura mezzo-soprano, lyric mezzo-soprano, and dramatic mezzo-soprano.

=== Coloratura ===
A coloratura mezzo-soprano has a warm lower register and an agile high register. The roles they sing often demand not only the use of the lower register but also leaps into the upper tessitura with highly ornamented, rapid passages. They have a range from approximately the G below middle C (G<sub>3</sub>, 196 Hz) to the B two octaves above middle C (B<sub>5</sub>, 988 Hz). Some coloratura mezzo-sopranos can sing up to high C (C<sub>6</sub>, 1047 Hz) or high D (D<sub>6</sub>, 1175 Hz), but this is very rare.<ref name=Appelman />
What distinguishes these voices from being called sopranos is their extension into the lower register and warmer vocal quality. Although coloratura mezzo-sopranos have impressive and at times thrilling high notes, they are most comfortable singing in the middle of their range, rather than the top.<ref name=Boldrey />

Many of the hero roles in the operas of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], originally sung by male castrati, can be successfully sung today by coloratura mezzo-sopranos. Rossini demanded similar qualities for his comic heroines, and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] wrote roles frequently for this voice as well. Coloratura mezzo-sopranos also often sing lyric-mezzo-soprano roles or soubrette roles.<ref name=Caldwell />

Coloratura mezzo-soprano roles in operas ('''*'''''denotes a lead role''):
{{column list|colwidth=30em|
* Angelina (Cenerentola), ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' ([[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]])*

=== Lyric ===
The lyric mezzo-soprano has a range from approximately the G below middle C (G<sub>3</sub>, 196 Hz) to the A two octaves above middle C (A<sub>5</sub>, 880 Hz).<ref name=Appelman /> This voice has a very smooth, sensitive and at times lachrymose quality. Lyric mezzo-sopranos do not have the vocal agility of the coloratura mezzo-soprano or the size of the dramatic mezzo-soprano. The lyric mezzo-soprano is ideal for most [[trouser role]]s.<ref name=Boldrey />

=== Dramatic ===
A dramatic mezzo-soprano has a strong medium register, a warm high register and a voice that is broader and more powerful than the lyric and coloratura mezzo-sopranos. This voice has less vocal facility than the coloratura mezzo-soprano. The range of the dramatic mezzo-soprano is from approximately the F below middle C (F<sub>3</sub>, 175 Hz) to the G two octaves above middle C (G<sub>5</sub>, 784 Hz).<ref name=Appelman /> The dramatic mezzo-soprano can sing over an orchestra and chorus with ease and was often used in the 19th century opera, to portray older women, mothers, witches and evil characters. Verdi wrote many roles for this voice in the Italian repertoire and there are also a few good roles in the French Literature. The majority of these roles, however, are within the German Romantic repertoire of composers like [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. Like coloratura mezzos, dramatic mezzos are also often cast in lyric mezzo-soprano roles.<ref name=Boldrey />
