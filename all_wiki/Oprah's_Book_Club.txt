'''Oprah's Book Club''' was a [[book discussion club]] segment of the [[United States|American]] [[talk show]] ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', highlighting books chosen by host [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Winfrey started the book club in 1996, selecting a new book, usually a [[novel]], for viewers to read and discuss each month.<ref name=minzesheimer>Bob Minzesheimer, [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-05-22-Oprah-Winfrey-Book-Club_n.htm "How the 'Oprah Effect' changed publishing"], ''[[USA Today]]'', May 23, 2011.</ref><ref name=flamm>Matthew Flamm, [http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110520/FREE/110529985/1072 "Publishers say farewell to Oprah Book Club boon"], ''[[Crain's New York Business]]'', May 20, 2011.</ref><ref name=kellogg/> In total the club recommended 70 books during its 15 years.

Due to the book club's widespread popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular [[bestseller]]s, increasing sales in some cases by as many as several million copies.<ref name="oprah effect">{{cite news | last =Wyatt | first =Edward | title = Tolstoy's Translators Experience Oprah's Effect | newspaper =[[The New York Times]] | date =June 7, 2004 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6D81131F934A35755C0A9629C8B63 | access-date =October 5, 2007 }}</ref> Al Greco, a [[Fordham University]] marketing professor, estimated the total sales of the 70 "Oprah editions" at over 55&nbsp;million copies.<ref name=minzesheimer/>

The club has seen several literary controversies, such as [[Jonathan Franzen]]'s public dissatisfaction with his novel ''[[The Corrections]]'' having been chosen by Winfrey,<ref name=minzesheimer/> and the now infamous incident of [[James Frey]]'s memoir, ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a 2005 selection, being outed as almost entirety fabricated.<ref name=minzesheimer/> The latter controversy resulted in Frey and publisher [[Nan Talese]] being confronted and publicly shamed by Winfrey in a highly praised live televised episode of Winfrey's show.<ref name="truthiness">{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | author-link = David Carr (journalist) | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | newspaper =[[The New York Times]] | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html | access-date =October 5, 2007 }}</ref>

On Friday, June 1, 2012, Oprah announced the launch of [[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]] with ''[[Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail|Wild]]'' by [[Cheryl Strayed]]. The new version of Oprah's Book Club, a joint project between [[OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network]] and ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'', will incorporate the use of various social media platforms and e-readers.

On March 25, 2019, [[Apple Inc.]] and Oprah announced a [[Oprah's Book Club (TV series)|revival of Oprah's Book Club]] that will air on [[Apple TV+]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/03/apple-original-tv-series-first-look-sizzle-reel-video-1202582279/|title=Apple Shows Off Original Series For First Time With Sizzle Reel – Watch |last= Hipes |first=Patrick|date=2019-03-25|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |language=en|access-date=2019-03-27 |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18281188/oprah-apple-tv-plus-book-club-streaming-service-announcement-event-2019|title=Oprah will release two documentaries on Apple TV Plus along with a new book club |last= Gartenberg |first=Chaim|date=2019-03-25|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=2019-03-27 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==History==
The book club's first selection on September 17, 1996, was the then recently published novel ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]].<ref name=minzesheimer/> Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading while still searching for contemporary novels that she enjoyed.<ref name="turns page">{{cite news | last =Lacayo | first =Richard | title =Oprah Turns the Page | work =[[Time Magazine]] | date =April 7, 2002 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002228,00.html | access-date =October 5, 2007 }}</ref> After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year).

Winfrey returned to fiction with her 2007 selections of ''[[The Road]]'' by [[Cormac McCarthy]] in March and ''[[Middlesex (novel)|Middlesex]]'' by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] in June. Shortly after its being chosen, ''The Road'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]. Winfrey conducted the first ever television interview with McCarthy, a famously reclusive author, on June 5, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/road/road_book_synopsis/1 |title= Readers' Guide to The Road by Cormac McCarthy |publisher=[[Oprah.com]] |date= March 28, 2007 |access-date= October 13, 2013 }}</ref>

The October 2007 selection was ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'', a 1985 novel by [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Gabriel García Márquez]], greatly furthering not only the influence of the author in North America, but that of his translator [[Edith Grossman]]. Another work by Márquez, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', was a previous selection for the book club in 2004.<ref name="marquez">{{cite news | title =Oprah Winfrey chooses Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera' as next book club pick | work =[[The International Herald Tribune]] | date =October 5, 2007 | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/arts/NA-A-E-BKS-US-Winfreys-Book-Club.php | access-date = October 5, 2007 }}</ref>

The last club selection was a special edition of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]''.<ref name=kellogg>Carolyn Kellogg, [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/books/la-ca-oprah-books-20110522,0,193254.story "Oprah's Book Club: She spoke, we read"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 22, 2011.</ref> It had disappointingly low sales figures.<ref name=minzesheimer/>

==Influence==
In ''Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America'', [[Kathleen Rooney]] describes Winfrey as "a serious American [[intellectual]] who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically [[television]] and the [[Internet]], to take reading&mdash;a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act&mdash;and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rooney |first=Kathleen |date=2005 |title=Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America |url=https://archive.org/details/readingwithoprah00kath |url-access=registration |quote=american intellectual. |location=Fayetteville |publisher=University of Arkansas Press |page=xii |isbn=9781557287823|oclc= 57498613|author-link=Kathleen Rooney}}</ref>

''[[Business Week]]'' stated:
<blockquote>Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that [[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include [[Fox News]]'s [[Sean Hannity]], [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Terry Gross]], [[radio]] personality [[Don Imus]], and [[CBS]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]''. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.<ref name="wallet">{{cite news | title =Why Oprah Opens Readers' Wallet | publisher =Business Week | date =October 10, 2005 | url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954059.htm | access-date =October 5, 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 2009 it was reported that the influence of Winfrey's book club had even spread to [[Brazil]] with picks like [[A New Earth]] dominating Brazil's best-seller list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=87978 |title=Oprah’s Favorite Authors Dominate Bestseller Lists In Brazil |publisher=Webwire.com |date=February 23, 2009 |access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref>

The club generated so much success for some books that they went on to be adapted into films.  This subset includes ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' and ''[[The Reader]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

At the show's conclusion in May 2011, [[Nielsen BookScan]] created a list of the top-10 bestsellers from the club's final 10 years (prior data was unavailable).<ref name=flamm/> The top four with sales figures as of May 2011:<ref>Jason Boog.

In a 2014 paper by economist [[Craig L. Garthwaite]] published in ''[[American Economic Journal: Applied Economics]]'', it was reported that while the book club increased sales of individual titles in the list, it caused a short-term overall decrease in sales for the book industry as a whole after each selection was announced.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Demand Spillovers, Combative Advertising, and Celebrity Endorsements |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |author1=Garthwaite, Craig L. |date=April 2014 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76 |url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.6.2.76}}</ref> Since Oprah's selections were longer and more difficult classics that demanded greater time and energy to read, those people who were reading Oprah's books were not buying their usual fare of genre books, "there were statistically significant decreases for mysteries and action/adventure novels. Romances also saw a sales decline," following an Oprah endorsement. In the 12 weeks following an endorsement, "weekly adult fiction book sales decreased by a statistically significant 2.5 percent."<ref name=drum>{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/03/unintended-consequences-oprahs-book-clubs|title=The Unintended Consequences of Oprah's Book Club|date=Mar 1, 2012|access-date=Mar 1, 2012|author=Kevin Drum}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
The club has received critical commentaries from the literary community.

[[Scott Stossel]], an editor at ''[[The Atlantic]]'', wrote:
:"There is something so relentlessly ''therapeutic'', so consciously ''self-improving'' about the book club that it seems antithetical to discussions of serious literature. Literature should disturb the mind and derange the senses; it can be palliative, but it is not meant to be the easy, soothing one that Oprah would make it."<ref name=minzesheimer/>

==Controversies==
=== Jonathan Franzen ===
[[Jonathan Franzen]] felt conflicted about his book ''[[The Corrections]]'' being chosen as a book club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being in the company of other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had "picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think she's really smart and she's really fighting the good fight."<ref name="franzen">{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/franzen.html%20Powells.com |title= Jonathan Franzen Uncorrected  |access-date=October 5, 2007 }}</ref> Franzen added that his novel was a "hard book for that audience."<ref name="people1">{{cite web|last=Schindehette |first=Susan |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20135698,00.html |title=Novel Approach - Feuds, The Corrections, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jonathan Franzen, Oprah Winfrey |publisher=People.com |access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref>

Following the criticism Franzen was uninvited from the televised book club dinner, and he apologized profusely.<ref name="mediabistro1">{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/reading/books/0374100128/ |title=Content: Reading Room |publisher=mediabistro |access-date=October 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011021219/http://www.mediabistro.com/reading/books/0374100128/ |archive-date=October 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When Franzen was not invited back, he suggested that perhaps he and Winfrey could still have dinner but not on TV, but Winfrey was all booked up, and her spokesperson said she was moving on.<ref name="people1"/>

Other writers were critical of Franzen. Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', author [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] suggested that "lurking behind Mr. Franzen's rejection of Ms. Winfrey is an elemental distrust of readers, except for the ones he designates."<ref name=Klinkenborg-NYT>{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=The Not-Yet-Ready-for-Prime-Time Novelist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/opinion/editorial-observer-the-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time-novelist.html|access-date= July 4, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 October 2001}}</ref>  [[Andre Dubus III]] wrote that, "It is so elitist it offends me deeply. The assumption that high art is not for the masses, that they won't understand it and they don't deserve it – I find that reprehensible. Is that a judgment on the audience? Or on the books in whose company he would be?" <ref name="mediabistro1"/>

In 2010, Oprah chose another of Franzen's books, ''[[Freedom (Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'', for her book club.  She says that after she read a copy of the book Franzen had sent her with a note, she called the author and gained his permission.<ref name=announce>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Oprahs-Book-Club-Announcement-Video |title=Oprah's Book Club Announcement - Video |publisher=Oprah.com |date=September 17, 2010 |access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref>  Oprah said "we have a little history this author and I", but called the book "a masterpiece", and according to an article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', she "seems to have forgiven the bestselling author after their 2001 kerfuffle".<ref name=announce/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0918-franzen-oprah-20100918,0,245001,print.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Carolyn | last=Kellogg | date=September 18, 2010 | title=Oprah's book club christens Franzen's 'Freedom'}}</ref>

=== James Frey ===

In late 2005 and early 2006, Oprah's Book Club was again embroiled in controversy. Winfrey selected [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' for the September 2005 selection. ''Pieces'' is a book billed as a [[memoir]]&mdash;a true account of Frey's life as an [[alcoholic]], [[drug addict]], and criminal. It became the Book Club's greatest selling book up to that point, and many readers spoke of how the account helped free them from drugs as well. But the additional attention focused on Frey's memoir soon led to critics questioning the validity of Frey's supposedly true account, especially regarding his treatment while in a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility and his stories of time spent in [[Prison|jail]]. Initially, Frey convinced [[Larry King]] that the embellishments in his book were of a sort that could be found in any literary memoir; Winfrey encouraged debate about how creative non-fiction should be classified, and cited the inspirational impact Frey's work had had on so many of her viewers. But as more accusations against the book surfaced, Winfrey invited Frey on the show to find out directly from him whether he had lied to her and her viewers. During a heated live televised debate, Winfrey forced Frey to admit that he had indeed lied about spending time in jail, and that he had no idea whether he had two [[root canal]]s without painkillers or not, despite devoting several pages to describing them in excruciating detail. Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher [[Nan Talese]] to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

The media feasted over the televised showdown. [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs."<ref name="truthiness"/> "Oprah annihilates Frey," proclaimed Larry King.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=May 1, 2007 |access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref> ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into [[Swift boating]] and swift bucks, into [[George W. Bush|W]].'s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying,"<ref name="bunk">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/opinion/oprahs-bunk-club.html|title=Oprah's Bunk Club|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=January 28, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 5, 2007|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s [[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Richard Cohen]] was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey "[[Mensch]] of the Year."<ref>{{cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.
