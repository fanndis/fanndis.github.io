==Early life==
Anita Baker was born on January 26, 1958, in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. When she was two, her mother abandoned her and Baker was raised by a [[foster care|foster family]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=19}} 

When Baker was 12, her foster parents died and her foster sister raised her afterwards.{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=19}} By the time Baker was 16, she began singing R&B at Detroit nightclubs. After one performance, she was discovered by bandleader David Washington, who gave her a card to audition for the funk band, [[Chapter 8 (band)|Chapter 8]].{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Baker joined [[Chapter 8 (band)|Chapter 8]] in 1975 and the group toured until securing a deal with [[Ariola Records]] in 1979. The group's first album, ''[[Chapter 8 (Chapter 8 album)|Chapter 8]],'' was released that year and featured the singles "[[Ready for Your Love (Chapter 8 song)|Ready for Your Love]]", a duet between Baker and bandmate Gerald Lyles, and the Baker-led "I Just Want to Be Your Girl."<ref>{{cite book|author=David Nathan|title=The Soulful Divas: Personal Portraits of Over a Dozen Divine Divas|publisher= Billboard Books|date= 1999|page=348}}</ref> 

After Ariola was bought out by [[Arista Records]] in 1979, Chapter 8 was dropped by the label who were convinced that Baker, as the group's lead singer, didn't have "star potential."{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=20}} Baker returned to Detroit, working as a waitress and a receptionist until, in 1982, Otis Smith, a former associate of Ariola, convinced Baker to start a solo career under his Beverly Glen label.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

==Music career==
{{Moresources|section|date=June 2020}}
Baker released her debut solo album, ''[[The Songstress]]'', in 1983.<ref name="Huey"/> The album produced four singles: "No More Tears" and its [[B-side]], "Will You Be Mine", "Angel" and "You're the Best Thing Yet". "Angel" became Baker's first top ten single, reaching number five on the R&B charts in late 1983. "You're the Best Thing Yet" followed it in the R&B top 40 early the following year. 

Despite this early success, Baker later complained that she hadn't received any royalties from the work. In addition, the label delayed work on Baker's follow-up of ''The Songstress''. By 1984, after two years, Baker sought to leave the label but was sued by Smith for breach of contract in 1985. After months in court debating the matter, it was concluded that Baker should be allowed to record for other labels, winning the case against Smith. Baker then signed with the [[Warner Music Group]]-associated [[Elektra Records]] label in 1985 and began working on her next album. Her Elektra contract allowed the singer to have creative control and produce her own music.{{cn|date=June 2020}} 

Baker used her old Chapter 8 bandmate, songwriter and producer [[Michael J. Powell]] on her first Elektra album, though label execs were initially unhappy with her choice of Powell over more established producers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In March 1986, Baker released her second album, ''[[Rapture (Anita Baker album)|Rapture]]''. While sales were initially slow following the release of the album's debut single, "Watch Your Step", Elektra released the mid-tempo ballad, "[[Sweet Love (Anita Baker song)|Sweet Love]]", which became her first pop hit, reaching number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and also reaching the UK Top 20. The album eventually launched three further hit singles, including "[[Caught Up in the Rapture]]", "[[No One in the World]]" and "[[Same Ole Love (365 Days a Year)]]". 

Throughout 1986 and 1987, Baker promoted the album by touring, headlining her first tour, ''[[The Rapture Tour]]'', a show from which was later released on home video as ''[[The Rapture Tour#VHS/DVD/CD release|A Night of Rapture]]''. By 1988, the album had sold over 8 million copies worldwide, 5&nbsp;million of which were sold in the United States alone. The album resulted in Baker's winning two Grammy Awards at the [[1987 Grammy Awards|1987 ceremony]].{{cn|date=June 2020}} 

In 1987, Baker collaborated with [[The Winans]] on their song, "[[Ain't No Need to Worry]]", which gave Baker a third Grammy, this time in the [[Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus|Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus]] category.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Baker's follow-up, ''[[Giving You the Best That I Got (album)|Giving You the Best That I Got]]'', was released in October 1988 and immediately became a success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and selling 5 million copies worldwide, 3&nbsp;million of which sold alone in the United States. [[Giving You the Best That I Got (song)|The title track]] reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the R&B and adult contemporary charts, becoming her most successful charted single.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 6th Edition (Billboard Publications)</ref> The follow-up, "[[Just Because (Anita Baker song)|Just Because]]", reached the top 20 on the pop chart while also becoming an R&B chart-topper, while a third single, "Lead Me Into Love", became a top ten R&B hit. The album resulted in three more Grammy Awards for the singer.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

In 1990, Baker released ''[[Compositions (album)|Compositions]]'', which had Baker more involved in the songwriting and production process and the first in which she began incorporating more jazz elements than in previous albums. The album launched the singles "[[Talk to Me (Anita Baker song)|Talk to Me]]", "[[Soul Inspiration]]" and "[[Fairy Tales (Anita Baker song)|Fairy Tales]]", and eventually sold over a million copies.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

After the end of the album's touring and promotion schedule in 1991, Baker took a break from the business to settle down with her husband at the time, later having two children with him. Meanwhile, Elektra bought the rights to, and reissued, her first album, ''The Songstress''. It has since sold more than 300,000 copies.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

After appearing on [[Frank Sinatra]]'s ''[[Duets (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets]]'' album, Baker returned to the charts with ''[[Rhythm of Love (Anita Baker album)|Rhythm of Love]]'' in 1994. The album featured "[[Body and Soul (Anita Baker song)|Body and Soul]]", her first top 40 pop hit since 1989. The second single, the mid-tempo "I Apologize", won Baker an eighth Grammy. The album eventually sold over two million copies: her fourth consecutive platinum-selling album. Baker undertook the ''[[Rhythm of Love World Tour]]'' from December 14, 1994 to November 14, 1995. Baker was transferred to another label within the [[Warner Music Group]], [[Atlantic Records]], in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songstress Anita Baker Successfully Orchestrates Unprecedented Record Label Transfer; Leaves Elektra Records for Atlantic Records|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Songstress+Anita+Baker+Successfully+Orchestrates+Unprecedented+Record...-a018652397|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|date=1996-09-06| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115063015/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Songstress+Anita+Baker+Successfully+Orchestrates+Unprecedented+Record...-a018652397 | archive-date=2014-01-15 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

Taking a hiatus after the end of the ''Rhythm of Love Tour'' to care for her two sons, Baker returned to the studio in 2000. In May 2001, she filed a lawsuit against Zomba Recording and its Dreamhire division for alleged damage to her recordings by a hired 24-track tape machine.<ref name="Huey"/><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Anita Baker Sues Over Allegedly Ruined Tracks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/79686/anita-baker-sues-over-allegedly-ruined-tracks|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 18, 2001|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> Due to a label restructuring, Baker was let go from Atlantic that November without releasing any material with the company.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Stewart, Baker, O'Connor Latest To Leave Atlantic|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77571/stewart-baker-oconnor-latest-to-leave-atlantic|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 18, 2001|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> 

During this hiatus, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released the compilation, ''[[The Best of Anita Baker]]'' (named ''[[The Best of Anita Baker#Sweet Love: The Very Best of Anita Baker track listing|Sweet Love: The Very Best of Anita Baker]]'' in the UK) in June 2002. The album eventually was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], denoting sales in excess of 1,000,000 units in the US. That year, Baker returned to live performing, signing with [[Blue Note Records]] in March 2004. That September, Baker released the album, ''[[My Everything (Anita Baker album)|My Everything]]''. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and number-one on the R&B charts, eventually being certified gold.

In 2005, Baker released ''[[Christmas Fantasy]]'', winning a Grammy nomination for the song, "Christmas Time Is Here". In May 2005, Baker was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=14736 | title=Anita Baker, Ron Carter, and Kevin Eubanks to Receive Honorary Doctor of Music Degrees at Berklee College of Music Commencement May 7, 2005}}</ref> Starting in 2007, Baker embarked on a two-year concert tour titled ''An Evening with Anita Baker''. She occasionally sang the American national anthem at sports events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/anita-baker-sings-national-anthem-at-nba-finals-10885518 |title=National Anthem Hits a Bad Note, Twitter users blast Anita Baker's singing of the Star-Spangled Banner |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref> 

"I met Anita at the [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] in 2007," said [[Mary J. Blige]]. "I told [her] how much she meant to me. She said, 'I'm glad that you picked up the ball where I left off.' That meant a lot."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Women in music|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=May 2008|issue=262|page=103}}</ref>

In August 2012, Baker released her version of [[Tyrese]]'s hit, "[[Lately (Tyrese song)#Anita Baker version|Lately]]". The song made headlines for Baker after the song was played every hour, on the hour, throughout the day on urban adult contemporary radio, making her the first artist to make this kind of debut. Baker had been working on the album featuring the single, "Only Forever", since 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twanatells.com/2010/07/17/anita-baker-hit-the-studio-with-snoop-dogg/ |title=Anita Baker Hit The Studio With Snoop Dogg |publisher=Twanatells.com |date=July 18, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063230/http://twanatells.com/2010/07/17/anita-baker-hit-the-studio-with-snoop-dogg/ |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though Blue Note set release dates for the album in October and December 2012, Baker decided she still needed to work on the album, causing delays. The album never materialized. In February 2013, Baker returned to the national spotlight, performing "Lately" and "Same Ole Love" on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. That same month, she appeared at the Grammys where "Lately" was nominated for a Grammy Award. In January 2017, Baker confirmed she had retired.<ref name="retirement">{{cite web|title=R&B Legend Anita Baker Confirms Retirement – R&B News|url=http://singersroom.com/content/2017-01-16/aw-man-anita-baker-hangs-up-the-mic-confirms-retirement-on-twitter/|website=Singersroom.com|accessdate=May 20, 2017|date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> She emerged from retirement in 2018.
