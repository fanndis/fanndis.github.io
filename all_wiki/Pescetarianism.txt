== Etymology ==
''Pescetarian'' is a [[neologism]] formed as a [[portmanteau]] of the Italian word {{wiktit|pesce}} ('[[fish]]') and the English word ''vegetarian''.<ref name=m-w>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pescatarian |title=Definition of Pescatarian by Merriam-Webster |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}</ref> The English pronunciation of both ''pescetarian'' and its variant ''pescatarian'' is {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛ|s|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|n}}, with the same {{IPA|/sk/}} sequence present in {{lang|it|pescato}} ({{IPA-it|peˈskaːto|lang}}),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dizionari.repubblica.it/Italiano/P/pescato.php |title=Pescato: significato e definizione |newspaper=[[la Repubblica]]}}</ref> although {{lang|it|pesce}} is originally pronounced {{IPA-it|ˈpeʃʃe|}}, with a {{IPAslink|ʃ}} sound.

== History ==
{{See also|History of vegetarianism}}

The first [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] in written western history were the Pythagoreans, a title derived from the Greek philosopher [[Pythagoras]], creator of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Though Pythagoras loaned his name to the meatless diet, some suspect he may have eaten fish as well, which would have made him a not a vegetarian, but a pescatarian by today's standards.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/evolution-vegetarianism/</ref>

== Motivations and rationale ==
===Sustainability and environmental concerns<!--'Environmental pescetarianism' redirects here-->===
{{See also|Sustainable diet}}

Ecological [[sustainability]] and [[food security]] are growing concerns. [[Livestock]] is the world’s largest user of land, representing some 80% of total agricultural land. Beef consumption is 24% of the world's total intake of meat, but accounts for less than 2% of calories consumed worldwide.<ref name="auto4">{{cite web| title=Agriculture at a crossroads: Meat and animal feed| url=https://www.globalagriculture.org/report-topics/meat-and-animal-feed.html| publisher=Global Agriculture |date=2018|accessdate=2019-04-27}}</ref> The environmental impact and amount of energy needed to feed livestock greatly exceeds its nutritional value.<ref>{{cite news| title=U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell ecologist advises animal scientists| url=https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat| newspaper=Cornell Chronicle |date=1997-08-07|accessdate=2019-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title= Tackling climate change through livestock| url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/en/publications/tackling_climate_change/index.htm|date=21 October 2014 | publisher=United Nations}}</ref> People may adopt a pescetarian diet out of desire to lower their dietary [[carbon footprint]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Carbon footprint factsheet |url=http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet |publisher=Center for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan |accessdate=19 May 2019 |date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | title= Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK| journal= Climatic Change| volume= 125| issue= 2| pages= 179–192| publisher=Springer | date=June 11, 2014| pmc= 4372775| last1= Scarborough| first1= P.| last2= Appleby| first2= P.

Some pescetarians may regard their diet as a transition to vegetarianism, while others may consider it an ethical compromise,<ref>Ronald L. Sandler, ''Food Ethics: The Basics'', Routledge, 2014, p. 74.</ref> often as a practical necessity to obtain nutrients absent or not easily found in plants.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rohrer|first=Finlo|title=The rise of the non-veggie vegetarian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8341002.stm|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> Pescetarianism may be perceived as a more ethical choice because fish and other seafood may not associate pain and fear as more complex animals like mammals do.<ref name="sciencedaily.com">{{cite web|title=Do fish feel pain?

===Health===

A common reason for adoption of pescetarianism is perceived health, such as fish consumption increasing intake of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s which are associated with reduced risk of [[cerebrovascular disease]].<ref name="Chowdhury">{{cite journal | last=Chowdhury | first=R. | last2=Stevens | first2=S. | last3=Gorman | first3=D. | last4=Pan | first4=A. | last5=Warnakula | first5=S. | last6=Chowdhury | first6=S. | last7=Ward | first7=H. | last8=Johnson | first8=L. | last9=Crowe | first9=F. | last10=Hu | first10=F.

===Other considerations===
{{further|Mercury in fish}}
Concerns have been raised about consuming some fish varieties containing toxins such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]],<ref>Committee on the Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury, Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, National Research Council, {{cite book | title=Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/9899.html| isbn=978-0-309-07140-6|year=2000| last1=Council| first1=National Research| last2=Studies| first2=Division on Earth Life| last3=Sciences| first3=Commission on Life| last4=Toxicology| first4=Board on Environmental Studies and| last5=Methylmercury| first5=Committee on the Toxicological Effects of}}</ref> although it is possible to select fish that contain little or no mercury and moderate the consumption of mercury-containing fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/02/030210080251.htm|title=Experts Say Consumers Can Eat Around Toxins In Fish|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>

==Abstinence in religion==
{{Further|Vegetarianism and religion}}

===Christianity===

In both the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, pescetarianism is referred to as a form of [[abstinence]]. During fast periods, Eastern Orthodox and Catholics often abstain from meat, dairy, and fish, but on holidays that occur on fast days (for example, 15 August on a Wednesday or Friday), fish is allowed, while meat and dairy remain forbidden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbamoses.com/fasting.html|title=The Fasting Rule of the Orthodox Church|website=www.abbamoses.com}}</ref>

===Judaism===
Pescetarianism (provided the fish is ruled [[Kashrut|kosher]]) conforms to Jewish dietary laws, as kosher fish is "[[pareve]]"—neither "milk" nor "meat". In essence, aquatic animals such as mammals like [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s are not kosher, nor are [[cartilaginous fish]] such as sharks and rays, since they all have dermal denticles and not bony-fish scales.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 2015, members of the Liberal Judaism synagogue in [[Manchester]] founded The Pescetarian Society, citing pescetarianism as originally a Jewish diet, and pescetarianism as a form of vegetarianism.<ref name="thepescetariansociety.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepescetariansociety.org|title=Pescetarian Society Home Page|publisher=The Pescetarian Society|date=2019}}</ref>

===Hinduism===
By tradition, most Hindu [[Brahmin]] communities follow a strict [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet. However, there are Brahmin sub-groups allowing the consumption of fish, such as the [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]] community of coastal south-western India.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Axelrod|first1=P|last2=Fuerch|first2=MA|title=Portuguese Orientalism and the making of the village communities of Goa|journal=Ethnohistory|date=1998|volume=45|issue=3|doi=10.2307/483320|pages=439|jstor=483320}}</ref> This community regards seafood in general as "vegetables from the sea", and refrains from eating land-based animals. Other Hindu Brahmin communities who consume seafood are the [[Maithili Brahmin]], [[Vishwakarma_(caste)|Viswa Brahmin]], and the [[Bengali Brahmin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chakravarti|first1=A.
