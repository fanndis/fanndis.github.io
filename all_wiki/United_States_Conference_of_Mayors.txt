The '''United States Conference of Mayors''' ('''USCM''') is the official [[non-partisan]] organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more. The cities are each represented by their mayors or other chief elected officials.  The organization was founded in light of the [[Great Depression]] and was formed under [[Herbert Hoover]] until its original [[charter]] was signed at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] on the eve of the inauguration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].

The organization is part of the “[[Big Seven (United States)|Big Seven]]”, a group of organisations that represent local and state governments in the United States.

==Mission==
[[File:Mayors-obama.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Barack Obama]] in a U.S Conference of Mayors meeting in the East Room of the White House, Jan. 21, 2010]]
The organization serves the following functions: Help develop and promote effective national urban/suburban policy; build stronger and more effective federal-city relationships; monitor the effectiveness of federal policy in terms of its service to urban needs; help mayors develop leadership and management tools; and to create a forum in which mayors can share ideas and information.<ref name="ATUCoM">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmayors.org/the-conference/about/|title=About the Conference|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The United States Conference of Mayors|accessdate=2017-03-24}}</ref> By representing all large municipalities and their leaders in these ways, the conference is speaking for vast majority of the components of the nations economy.  According to one of the Conference's own reports, [[metropolitan area]]s accounted for 84 percent of the nation's [[gross domestic product]] and at the same time generated 84 percent of the nation's employment opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2DC113BF937A35752C1A96F958260|title=Report Shows the Economic Might of Urban Areas|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=1999-11-04|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

In 1932, [[Mayor of Detroit]] [[Frank Murphy]] called a conference of mayors to meet in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] in June.  In the shadow of the [[Great Depression|depression]], he felt it was worthwhile to pursue federal aid for cities. Forty-eight mayors of cities in excess of 100,000 attended.<ref name=TAM81>Holli, p. 81.</ref>  On June 3, two days after the [[Adjournment sine die]] of the first conference, Murphy appointed a seven-person commission (including himself) to lobby Washington using the powers vested in him by the conference.   Murphy along with [[Mayor of Boston]] [[James Michael Curley]], [[List of mayors of Cleveland|Mayor of Cleveland]] [[Raymond T. Miller]], [[Mayor of Milwaukee]] [[Daniel Hoan]], [[Mayor of New Orleans]] [[T. Semmes Walmsley]], [[Mayor of Minneapolis]] [[William A. Anderson]], and [[Mayor of Grand Rapids]] [[George W. Welsh]] traveled to [[Washington, DC]] to lobby the federal government for aid.<ref name=FRitUS50>Gunther, p. 50.</ref> The mayors that went with him urgently pleaded for relief.  On June 6 at 10:00&nbsp;a.m., they met with [[United States Speaker of the House]] [[John Nance Garner]] (D), [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Henry T. Rainey]] (D) and [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Bertrand H. Snell]]  (R). They held out hope for a [[US$]]5 billion prosperity loan, but made it clear their true need for any relief for the despair of their constituents.<ref name=FRitUS50/> At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., they met with [[United States Vice President]]/[[President of the United States Senate]] [[Charles Curtis]] and other Senate leaders.<ref name=FRitUS51>Gunther, p. 51.</ref>  The presence of the Mayors was unprecedented and despite some Democratic defections, a band of 12 Republicans led by [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] enabled the passage of a relief bill by a 205&ndash;189 margin.<ref name=FRitUS51/> Unfortunately [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]] was not receptive to the $1.9 billion scale of the public works plan. However, the mayors were able to convince the President that federal support for local relief efforts was reasonable and this is considered a watershed event.<ref name=FRitUS52>Gunther, p. 52.</ref> 42 of the 48 states benefited from the newly empowered [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]].<ref name=FRitUS53>Gunther, p. 53.</ref> After the [[Emergency Relief and Construction Act]] of 1932 was signed into law by Hoover, the Conference wrote its charter at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] on the eve of the inauguration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].<ref name=ATUCoM/> It held its second meeting in 1933 and formed the permanent United States Conference of Mayors with Murphy as its president.<ref name=TAM81/>

In 1972, USCM President [[Mayor of Milwaukee]] [[Henry Maier]] led the crusade for municipal resources at a time when federal grants to state and local governments was escalating rapidly. [[Richard Nixon]] started allowing cities to participate in federal revenue sharing. This source of municipal funding relieved cities until the mid-1980s. [[Jimmy Carter]] capped revenue payments and Reagan discontinued everything except for CDBGs.<ref>Norquist, pp. 12-13</ref> The CDBG program has consistently allocated over $4 billion/year to state and local jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/budget/disbursementreports/profiles/National_Expenditure_FY08.xls |title=Use of CDBG Funds by All Grantees |accessdate=2009-01-31 |date=2008-09-30 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Currently, CDBG's are being used by 1180 local governments and states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/programs/|title=Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG|accessdate=2009-01-31|date=2008-12-09|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]|work=Homes & Communities|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208200733/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/programs/|archive-date=2009-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Using provisions in the 1995 Crime Bill, Clinton paid for municipal enforcement authorities on behalf of cities.<ref>Norquist, p. 14.</ref>

==Current issues==
During the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama]] in December 2008, The Conference held a news conference along with [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]] Chairman [[Charlie Rangel]], [[United States House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee]] Chairman [[James Oberstar]] and [[Congressional Urban Caucus]] Chairman [[Chaka Fattah]]. [[Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] announced that the meeting sought support of the Conferences survey of 11,391 "ready-to-go" infrastructure projects that they hoped to see in a Main Street recovery plan during Obama's first 100 days. According to [[New York City Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]], the $73.1 billion projects had completed the design and approval process and met all political requirement except for the need for funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/08/mayors.economy/index.html|title=Mayors want funds to fix their cities|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-12-08|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122887075956093233|title=Stimulus Shouldn't Be an Excuse for Pork: The nation's mayors have presented a revealing wish list to Washington.|accessdate=2009-02-06|date=2008-12-10|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Poole, Robert}}</ref> At the same time the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] called for support for more 5,148 road and bridge infrastructure projects that they categorized as "ready-to-go."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/08/road.projects/index.html|title=Report: Road projects could spur 1.8 million jobs|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-12-08|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|author1=Boudreau, Abbie  |author2=Scott Zamost  |name-list-style=amp }}</ref> Many of the ideas in the mayor proposal became part of the stimulus package.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123369271403544637|title=Stimulus Brings Out City Wish Lists: Neon for Vegas, Harleys for Shreveport: Most Ask for Roads, Sewers, but Some Want the Kitchen Sink -- and a Frisbee Golf Course|accessdate=2009-02-06|date=2009-02-04|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company, Inc.]]|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author1=Levitz, Jennifer  |author2=Philip ShiShkin |name-list-style=amp }}</ref>

Another issue that the Conference took issue with in 2008 include the misappropriation of federal funds for municipal anti-terrorism emergency equipment through the [[Homeland Security Department]], which was created in 2003, instead of for municipal police forces and other enforcement officials. On this issue, they stood by the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]] who feel common domestic anti-crime expenditure might better serve the public interest. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] federally funded municipal purchases of bomb robots, chem-bio suits and other anti-terrorism equipment have often gone unused while crime is underserved. These organizations are calling for a re-evaluation of the federal grant system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-10-01-terrormoney_n.htm|title=Rethink spending on anti-terrorism, report says|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-10-01|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Hall, Mimi}}</ref> Along with various foreign governments, [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[Travel Industry Association]], the conference also stood against the 2008 Homeland Security Department initiative to [[fingerprint]] foreign visitors before they leave the country by airplane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2008-07-01-fingerprint_n.htm|title=Lawmakers, airlines oppose Bush fingerprinting plan|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-07-01|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Frank, Thomas}}</ref> These complaints came a few years after the conference complained that their cities were not receiving an equitable proportion of counterterrorism funding in the first few years after the attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E0DB153AF93BA2575AC0A9659C8B63|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730102752/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E0DB153AF93BA2575AC0A9659C8B63|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-30|title=Counterterror Aid Is Tied Up by the States, Mayors Assert|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=2003-09-18|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Shenon, Philip}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E6DB1E3BF937A15752C0A9649C8B63|title=A NATION CHALLENGED: CITIES; Mayors Seek Payback of Spending on Security|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=2002-01-24|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Brinkley, Joel}}</ref>

The conference has been active in fighting [[foreclosure]]s and [[predatory lending]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2008-06-21-cities-foreclosures_n.htm|title=Cities fight foreclosures with unusual tactics|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-06-21|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> During the formulation and debate of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] in response to the [[global financial crisis of 2008]], a conference spokesperson was cited for being in support of the inclusion of $4 billion for the purchase, rehabilitation and resale of low- and moderate-income family distressed property. The money would produce profits that would be used to develop neighborhoods. Another important feature to municipalities was $180 million devoted to grants for pre-foreclosure and legal counseling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2008-07-26-housing-bailout-bill_n.htm|title=Housing rescue bill may fall short; who benefits?|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-07-28|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Bahney, Anna}}</ref>

Also in 2008, the conference unanimously both supported single-payer [[national health insurance]] and City-coordinated drug overdose prevention efforts.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.pnhp.org/news/2008/june/us_conference_of_m.php|title=U.S. Conference of Mayors Backs Single-Payer National Health Insurance|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-06-23|publisher=Physicians for a National Health Program|author=Prensky, David, Quentin Young, and Alison Landes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2008/0625-16.htm|title=United States Conference of Mayors Unanimously Passes Resolution Calling for City-Coordinated Drug Overdose Prevention Efforts|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-06-25|publisher=Common Dreams NewsCenter|author1=Robelo, Daniel|author2=Reena Szczepanski|name-list-style=amp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524163730/http://www.commondreams.org/news2008/0625-16.htm|archive-date=2011-05-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> After calling for a study on [[bottled water]] in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/painter/2007-08-26-painter-yourhealth_n.htm|title=Water wars: Bottled vs tap|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2007-08-26|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Painter, Kim}}</ref> in 2008, the conference came out against bottled water which consumes 1.5 million barrels of oil per year to produce its plastic bottles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2008-06-07-bottled-water_n.htm|title=Thirst for bottled water unleashes flood of environmental concerns|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=2008-06-07|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Gashler, Krisy}}</ref>

In 2009, the conference adopted a sweeping proposal for lesbian and gay equality by mayors [[Christopher Cabaldon]], [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]], and [[David Cicilline]], making it the first national organization of American elected officials to call for marriage equality, passage of [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|ENDA]], and the repeal of [[Don't ask, don't tell]].<ref>http://www.edgeprovidence.com/news////92742/us_conference_of_mayors_endorses_marriage_equality</ref>

In 2013, the conference adopted a resolution urging the federal government to give states leeway in establishing marijuana policies. “Voters in states and cities that wish to break the stranglehold of organized crime over the distribution and sale of marijuana in their communities by legalizing, regulating and taxing marijuana should have the option of doing so,” stated Mayor [[Stephen H. Cassidy]] of [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2013/06/24/nations-mayors-want-state-control-of-pot-policies/|title=Nation's mayors want state control of pot policies|date=2013-06-24|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Activities==
The organization convenes for its winter meeting each January in Washington, D.C. and an Annual Meeting each June in a different U.S. city in addition to ad hoc meetings.<ref name=ATUCoM/> At the annual meeting, members vote on policy resolutions. The results are distributed to the [[President of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]].

On January 11, 2007, the Conference leadership approved the annual ten-point platform called "Strong Cities, Strong Families for a Strong America", including positions on [[energy policy]] and [[homeland security]], and support for [[Community development block grant]]s (CDBG), [[government sponsored enterprise]]s, the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIPS), and the [[Workforce Investment Act]]. In 2008, [[travel]] and [[tourism]] were part of the plan for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?959bd4c6-c7b0-4329-b830-e557b197533d|title=Honolulu Mayor Drives Travel and Tourism Action Plan of Nation's Mayors|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=2008-01-24|publisher=Hawaii Reporter, Inc.|work=[[Hawaii Reporter]]|author=Brennan, Bill}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In the past, the Conference has taken stances against [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1983 budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922734-3,00.html|title=A Line Drawn in the Dirt|accessdate=2008-12-13|date=1982-02-22|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Magnuson, Ed, Douglas Brew, and Laurence I.

At times, the unified voice of Mayors has had significant impact on federal policies. An example was the controversy over the decision by investigators from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]] to carry out an examination of waste, fraud and abuse in the housing programs in three cities led by black mayors ([[Kurt L. Schmoke]], [[Marc H. Morial]] and [[Willie L. Brown Jr.]]).  Eventually, the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies|housing subcommittee]] of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]] Chairman, [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]], in response into the collective voice of the mayors, with the support of President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Andrew M. Cuomo]], the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]], mandated a clarification of selection criteria for investigation subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E0DF143CF932A15755C0A96E958260|title=U.S. Retreats on Inquiries Into Urban Housing Offices|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=1998-06-21|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Janofsky, Michael}}</ref>

In determining their positions and policies, the Conference has had to balance difficult political choices. They once opposed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in a resolution which came out against enforcing stricter smog and soot limits. The conference members felt that the stricter standards for [[ozone]] and fine particles would have hampered the economies of many municipalities, especially those that are steel-, automobile- and [[fossil fuel]]-intensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E5DA1431F936A15755C0A961958260|title=Mayors Are Opposed To Air Quality Plan |accessdate=2008-12-14|date=1997-06-25|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Annual awards and grants==
