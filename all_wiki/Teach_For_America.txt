'''Teach For America''' ('''TFA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] whose stated mission is to "enlist, develop, and mobilize as many as possible of our nation's most promising future leaders to grow and strengthen the movement for educational equity and excellence."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=David|title=Teach for America has been educating south Louisiana students, producing community leaders for 25 years|url=https://www.businessreport.com/business/twenty-five-years-passed-since-teach-america-set-foot-south-louisiana-classrooms-made-difference|website=www.businessreport.com|publisher=Greater Baton Rouge Business Report|accessdate=13 December 2015|date=9 December 2015}}</ref>

The organization aims to accomplish this by recruiting and selecting college graduates from top universities around the [[United States]] to serve as teachers. The selected members, known as "corps members," commit to teaching for at least two years in a public or public charter K–12 school in one of the 52 low-income communities that the organization serves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roy|first1=Kathryn|title=Businesses investing in Teach For America|url=http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20120326/PRINTEDITION/303269992/businesses-investing-in-teach-for-america|website=Hartford Business|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=26 March 2015}}</ref>

==History==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
TFA was founded by [[Wendy Kopp]] based on her 1989 [[Princeton University]] undergraduate thesis. Members of the founding team include value investor [[Whitney Tilson]]; former U.S. Commissioner of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[Douglas Shulman]]; and President and CEO of [[Knowledge Is Power Program]] (KIPP), Richard Barth.

Since the first corps was established in 1990, more than 42,000 corps members have completed their commitment to Teach For America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raetz|first1=Mackenzie|title=FSU grads fight for educational equity with Teach For America|url=http://news.fsu.edu/More-FSU-News/FSU-grads-fight-for-educational-equality-with-Teach-for-America|website=FSU.edu|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=14 September 2015}}</ref> In September 2015, the organization reached a milestone of 50,000 corps members and alumni, who have collectively taught more than 5 million students across the nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=ML locals join Teach for America's 25th anniversary corps|url=http://www.thealmanac.net/article/20150902/LIFESTYLES02/150909990|website=The Almanac|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=2 September 2015|quote=These women join a network of 50,000 corps members and alumni working alongside parents, principals and communities for positive change.}}</ref>

The first 10 years of the organization are chronicled in Kopp's book ''[[One Day, All Children|"One Day, All Children: The Unlikely Triumph of Teach For America and What I Learned Along the Way"]]'' <!--(ISBN 1-58648-179-7)-->

In January 2011, Wendy Kopp released her second book, ''"[[A Chance To Make History]]"'', which outlines what she has learned over the last 20 years working in American education.<ref name="A Chance to Make History">{{cite web | author= Wendy Kopp| year=2011 | title= A Chance To Make History: What Works and What Doesn't in Providing an Excellent Education for All | url=http://www.achancetomakehistory.org | accessdate=1 April 2011 }}</ref>

== Approach ==
[[File:TFA corps members.jpg|thumb|right|Three Teach For America corps members at the 2008 Houston institute.]]

Teach For America recruits recent college graduates and professionals to teach for two years in urban and rural communities throughout the [[United States]]. The goal of Teach For America is for its corps members to make both a short-term and long-term impact by leading their students to reach their full potential and becoming lifelong leaders for [[educational equity]]. Corps members do not have to be certified teachers, although certified teachers may apply. Uncertified corps members receive [[alternative certification]] through coursework taken while completing the program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolfman-Arent|first1=Avi|title=In Delaware, a growing number of principal prep programs|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/delaware/88818-lead-for-delaware-among-growing-number-of-principal-prep-programs|website=Newsworks|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>

All corps members are required to attend an intensive summer training program to prepare for their commitment. Details vary by region, but typically include a five-day regional introduction, a five to seven week residential institute, including teaching summer school, and one to two weeks of regional orientation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tamburin|first1=Adam|title=Teach For America adds summer training from Lipscomb|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2015/07/08/teach-america-adds-summer-training-lipscomb/29849667/|website=The Tennessean|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=8 July 2015}}</ref>

Teach For America teachers are placed in public schools in urban areas such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Houston]], as well as in rural places such as eastern [[North Carolina]] and the [[Mississippi Delta]]. They then serve for two years and are usually placed in schools with other Teach For America corps members.

Teach For America teachers are full-fledged faculty members at their schools, receiving the normal school district salary and benefits as well as a modest [[AmeriCorps]] "education voucher" (which can be used to pay for credentialing courses, cover previous student loans or fund further education during or after the two-year commitment). They do not automatically join a union, but are not prohibited from doing so. They may join union strikes even if they are not union members, at the cost of losing pay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teach for America Corps Members are not prohibited from striking|url=http://ctulocal1.tumblr.com/post/30584898257/teach-for-america-corps-members-are-not-prohibited-from|publisher=Chicago Teachers Union|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>

== Retention ==
As of early 2015, Teach For America reported 88% of its first-year teachers return for a second year. The organization also reported that more than 11,000 of its more than 37,000 alumni at the time were still teaching and that 65% of its alumni were working full-time in education.

Additionally, the organization reported that 84% of its alumni were working full-time in roles impacting education or low-income communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Impact|url=https://www.teachforamerica.org/about-us/our-mission/our-impact|website=teachforamerica.org|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref> This includes more than 900 school leaders, more than 100 elected union leaders, and 250 school system leaders.

== Geographical reach ==
Teach For America's geographical impact has grown significantly over the past 25 years. Originally serving only six regions, Teach For America is active in 52 regions as of the 2015–16 school year.

The 52 regions are: [[Alabama]], [[Appalachia]], [[Arkansas]], [[Baltimore]], the [[Bay Area]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], Capital Valley (the [[Sacramento]] area), [[Charlotte]], [[Chicago|Chicago-Northwest Indiana]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Dallas]]-Ft. Worth, the [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] Region, [[Delaware]], [[Detroit]], [[Eastern North Carolina]], the Greater [[Nashville]] area, the Greater [[New Orleans]]-Louisiana Delta area, the Greater [[Philadelphia]] area, [[Hawai'i]], [[Houston]], [[Idaho]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Jacksonville]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], the [[Las Vegas Valley]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the Metro [[Atlanta]] area, the [[Miami-Dade]] area, [[Milwaukee]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York City]], the North Carolina [[Piedmont Triad]] area, Northeast Ohio (the [[Cleveland]] area), [[Oklahoma]], [[Orlando]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Rhode Island]], the [[Rio Grande Valley]], [[San Antonio]], [[San Diego]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], South [[Louisiana]], Southwest Ohio (the [[Cincinnati]] area), [[St. Louis]], the [[Twin Cities]], and [[Washington state]].

For the 2016 application season, five regions were classified as "High Priority Regions," or regions with an urgent need for corps members. The five regions are: the Las Vegas Valley, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Eastern North Carolina, and Northeast Ohio (the Cleveland area).

==Evaluation==
[[File:Houston TFA students.jpg|thumb|left|Classroom led by a Teach For America corps member during the 2008 Houston institute]]

Since the founding of the organization, several independent studies have been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of Teach For America corps members relative to teachers who entered the teaching profession via other channels.

A 2015 [[Mathematica Policy Research]] study found that Teach For America teachers produce 1.3 months of extra reading gains in pre-K through second grade classrooms when compared to non-TFA teachers in the same elementary schools. The same study also found that Teach For America teachers across 10 states are as effective as other teachers in math and reading.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Melissa|title=Impacts of the Teach For America Investing in Innovation Scale-Up|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/~/media/publications/pdfs/education/tfa_investing_innovation.pdf|website=mathematica-mpr.com|publisher=Mathematica Policy Research|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>

A study by the Calder Center and the American Institutes for Research found that Teach For America teachers provide students in Miami with the equivalent of three additional months of math instruction, based on analyses of test scores from state-mandated tests.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Michael|title=Examining Spillover Effects from Teach For America Corps Members in Miami-Dade County Public Schools|url=http://www.caldercenter.org/publications/examining-spillover-effects-teach-america-corps-members-miami-dade-county-public|website=caldercenter.org|publisher=Calder National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

The Harvard Strategic Data Project found in 2012 that Teach For America teachers in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] produce 1-2 extra months of English and math learning outcomes relative to the gains produced by other novice teachers.<ref>{{cite web|title=SDP Human Capital Diagnostic|url=http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SM_Harvard-LAUSD-teacher-study_11.14.12.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

Studies in North Carolina and Tennessee suggest that Teach For America is the most effective source of new teachers in the two states, based on student achievement across subjects and grade levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Tennessee Report Card on the Effectiveness of Teacher Training Programs|url=http://www.state.tn.us/thec/Divisions/AcademicAffairs/rttt/report_card/2014/report_card/14report_card.shtml|website=www.state.tn.us|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Gary|title=The Effects of Teacher Entry Portals on Student Achievement|journal=Journal of Teacher Education|date=January–February 2014|volume=65|issue=1|pages=7–23|doi=10.1177/0022487113503871|s2cid=145396478|url=http://intl-jte.sagepub.com/content/65/1/7|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

In a study by the [[Urban Institute]] and the Calder Center in March 2008, published in the ''Journal of Public Policy and Management'', the authors found "TFA teachers tend to have a positive effect on high school student test scores relative to non-TFA teachers, including those who are certified in-field. Such effects exceed the impact of additional years of experience and are particularly strong in math and science."<ref>Urban Institute http://www.urban.org/education/evaluations.cfm?page=2</ref>

Another study by Mathematica in 2013 found that students of Teach For America teachers in eight states learn 2.6 more months of secondary math compared with students taught by non-TFA teachers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Melissa|title=The Effectiveness of Secondary Math Teachers from Teach For America and the Teaching Fellows Program|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/~/media/publications/PDFs/Education/HSAC_final_rpt_9_2013.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}</ref>

A study conducted by Georgia's Department of Audits and Accounts in 2015 found that about 85 percent of the students taught by Teach For America beginning teachers met or exceeded the state's standards compared to 70-74 percent of those in the classes of traditional certified, rookie teachers. Only 77 percent of veteran teachers saw the same achievement in their students. The study countered the long-held belief that the organization's five-week training led to poor student outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Walter|title=Teach for America gets better results than colleges|url=http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2015-12-10/teach-america-gets-better-results-colleges|website=Online Athens|publisher=Athens Banner -erald|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=10 December 2015|quote=Some critics warned shortcutting teacher preparation would lead to poor classroom results. This study suggests that’s not the case.}}</ref>

According to an independent study by Policy Studies Associates in 2011, almost 90% of principals who work with Teach For America teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with Teach For America and noted that corps members are rated as effective as, and in some cases more effective than, veteran faculty in their schools. Additionally, 87% of principals said Teach For America corps members’ training is at least as effective as the training of other beginning teachers, and 53% found corps members’ training to be more effective.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teach For America's Role In Effective Educator Development: Identifying, Recruiting, and Preparing Highly Effective Teachers to Serve High-Need Students|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/edseed/tfanarrative.pdf|website=Ed.Gov|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>

Teach For America won the largest grant of nearly 1,700 applications to the U.S. Department of Education's Investing in Innovation (i3) grant competition in 2010. The 13 scale-up grants required applicants to provide demonstrated evidence of success through objective, methodologically sound studies (e.g., experimental and quasi-experimental research designs) of student achievement.<ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/eligibility.html Eligibility – Investing in Innovation Fund (i3)]. .ed.gov (2013-03-27).

A 2018 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' found that advantaged individuals who teach as part of TFA "adopt beliefs that are closer to those of disadvantaged Americans" as a result of their TFA participation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Cecilia Hyunjung|last2=Conn|first2=Katharine M.|date=2018|title=When Do the Advantaged See the Disadvantages of Others?

==Criticism==
Teach For America has been criticized by opponents who claim the program replaces experienced teachers with brand-new employees who have had only five weeks of training during the summer, which are brought in at beginners' salary levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Quit Teach for America|publisher=The Atlantic|date=2013-09-23|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/09/i-quit-teach-for-america/279724/|accessdate=2014-09-15}}</ref> This criticism applies to the vast majority of new Teach For America teachers, though a small percentage may have some previous experience in education or advanced degrees. Teach for America has responded to critics of its training program by introducing a new program that encourages juniors at undergraduate universities to complete education courses in their senior year before setting foot in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|title=This took Teach For America 24 years to figure out?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/03/11/this-took-teach-for-america-24-years-to-figure-out/}}</ref>

Teachers' unions regularly critique the organization, which they see as undermining the professionalization of the education sector by bringing in temporary amateurs to fill positions traditionally reserved for certified professionals. John Wilson, executive director of the [[National Education Association]], sent a memo in May 2009 stating that union leaders were "beginning to see school systems lay off teachers and then hire Teach For America college grads due to a contract they signed."  Wilson went on to say that Teach For America brings in "the least-prepared and the least-experienced teachers" into low-income schools and makes them "the teacher of record."<ref name="USATodayArticle">{{cite news | author=Greg Toppo| work=USA Today| title=Teach for America: Elite corps or costing older teachers jobs?| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-07-29-teach-for-america_N.htm | date=29 July 2009}}</ref>

''USA Today'' reported that in March 2009, Peter Gorman, the superintendent of [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina]] schools told board members that because of a commitment made to the program, 100 Teach For America teachers would be retained in spite of the fact that hundreds of other non-Teach For America teachers in the district would be laid off. However, Teach For America spokeswoman Kerci Marcello Stroud says it would be a mistaken notion to say that Teach For America corps members are displacing experienced teachers. "In every region where we send teachers, we're just one source," she says. "Once they land, corps members must interview for jobs just like everyone else."<ref name="USATodayArticle"/>

Critics of Teach For America have also cited the results of Mathematica Policy Research's 2004 study as an indication of Teach For America's lack of efficacy (see [[Teach For America#Educational Impact|Educational Impact]]).  These critics claim that while the study shows that students taught by Teach For America teachers perform better in [[mathematics]] than those taught by non-Teach For America teachers, the improvement is very small, and that furthermore there is no difference in reading performance between the two groups.<ref name="USATodayArticle"/>

A 2010 article published by Campus Progress suggested that "TFA’s breakneck training course leaves TFA teachers—or 'corps members,' as they’re called—with insufficient classroom experience, before throwing them headfirst into some of the most disadvantaged school districts in the country."<ref>Eaton, Kristi. (2010-01-05) [http://www.campusprogress.org/articles/teach_for_america_dropouts/ » Teach for America Dropouts | Generation Progress]. Campusprogress.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.</ref>

Deborah Appleman, a professor of Educational Studies at [[Carleton College]], wrote in a 2009 editorial for the ''[[Minneapolis Star-Tribune]]'' that "[i]mplicit in Teach for America's approach is the insidious assumption that anyone who knows a subject and is willing to be with kids can teach – with little training." She also challenged TFA's "elitist" structure. "The story of TFA becomes a kind of master narrative, a story of heroic and altruistic young people that focuses much more squarely on them than it does on the lives of the children they are committed to serve. There is an elitist overtone to the structure of TFA, a belief that the best and the brightest can make a difference in the lives of children who are less fortunate, even when they are not professionally prepared to do so."<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentary/49234672.html Counterpoint: Why I oppose Teach for America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707055850/http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentary/49234672.html |date=2009-07-07 }}. Star Tribune (2009-06-29). Retrieved on 2013-08-24.</ref>

Kopp said in a Seattle radio appearance in 2001 that outsiders often misunderstand the function of TFA. “We’re a leadership development organization, not a teaching organization,” she said. “I think if you don’t understand that, of course it’s easy to tear the whole thing apart.”  Critics claim this comment shows TFA exists more to advance the career of its recruits than of the students it claims to help.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hootnick|first1=Alexandra|title=Teachers Are Losing Their Jobs, But Teach For America's Expanding|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/teachers-are-losing-their-jobs-teach-americas-expanding-whats-wrong/|website=The Nation|accessdate=23 December 2015|date=15 April 2014}}</ref>

''[[Teach For America Counter-Narratives: Alumni Speak Up and Speak Out]]'' (Peter Lang, 2015), edited by T. Jameson Brewer and Kathleen deMarrais, was the first official collection of critical alumni voices. Each chapter of the book, written by TFA alumni, sheds light on the organization. With critical narratives covering the entire span of TFA's 25 years of operations, the chapters are organized into three broad categories: (1) TFA's Recruitment, Training, and Support Structure; (2) TFA's Approach to Diversity; and (3) TFA's Approach to Criticism and Critics.

In February 2019, over 300 TFA Alumni signed a letter objecting to the organization putting pressure on young teachers to cross the picket line during the Oakland teachers' strike. Because TFA corps members are often AmeriCorps members, and striking is a prohibited activity for AmeriCorps members, TFA educators risked losing their AmeriCorps award if they went on strike. <ref name="AP-20190213">{{cite news |last1=Ho |first1=Sally |title=APNewsBreak: Teach for America slammed over Oakland strike |url=https://www.apnews.com/b81e40a70d7245d595b670898ea0cd9f |accessdate=October 7, 2019 |work=AP NEWS |date=February 13, 2019}}</ref>
