Originally established in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Duchy that bears its namesake]]. When the Grand Duchy of Moscow evolved into the [[Tsardom of Russia]], Moscow still remained as the political and economic center for most of the Tsardom's history. When the Tsardom was reformed into the [[Russian Empire]], the capital was moved from Moscow to [[Saint Petersburg]], diminishing the influence of the city. The capital was then moved back to Moscow following the [[Russian Revolution]] and the city was brought back as the political centre of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. When the Soviet Union dissolved, Moscow remained as the capital city of the contemporary and newly established [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

As the northernmost and coldest [[Megacity|megacity]] in the world, and with a history that dates over eight centuries, Moscow is governed as a [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] that serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific centre of Russia and [[Eastern Europe]].

As the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions and theatres. The city is home to several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and is well known for its display of [[Russian architecture]], particularly its historic [[Red Square]], and buildings such as the [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] and the [[Moscow Kremlin]], of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the [[Government of Russia]]. Moscow is home to many [[List of companies of Russia|Russian companies]] in numerous industries, and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes [[Moscow Airport#Commercial passenger and cargo traffic airports|four international airports]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->, nine railway terminals, a [[Trams in Moscow|tram system]], a [[Moscow Monorail|monorail system]], the largest trolleybus fleet in Europe,<ref name="Trolleybus">{{cite web|title=В Москве вышел на линию 500-й электробус|url=https://www.mos.ru/mayor/themes/2299/6851050/|website=[[Mos.ru]]|access-date=October 8, 2020|language=ru|date=October 8, 2020}}</ref> the largest fleet of carsharing vehicles in the world,<ref name="Carsharing">{{cite web|url=https://stroi.mos.ru/city_news/moskva-vyshla-v-mirovyie-lidiery-po-parku-karshieringha|title=Москва вышла в мировые лидеры по парку каршеринга|date=January 10, 2020|work=stroi.mos.ru|access-date=October 18, 2020}}</ref> and most notably the [[Moscow Metro]], the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest [[rapid transit]] systems in the world.

==Etymology==
The name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the [[Moskva River]].<ref name="Vasmer">{{Vasmer|Москва}}</ref><ref name="Smol">{{cite book |last1=Smolitskaya |first1=G.P. |title=Toponimicheskyi slovar' Tsentral'noy Rossii |script-title=ru:Топонимический словарь Центральной России |date=2002 |pages=211–2017 |language=ru}}</ref> There have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river. [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[Volga Finns|Merya]] and [[Muroma]] people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly ''Mustajoki'', in English: ''Black river''. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=978-951-583-212-2|location=Helsinki|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/early-east-slavic-tribes-in-russia.html|title=Early East Slavic Tribes in Russia|website=Study.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>

The most linguistically well grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root *''mŭzg''-/''muzg''- from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''{{PIE|meu}}''- "wet",<ref name="Smol" /><ref name="Trubach">{{cite book |editor-last=Trubachyov |editor-first=O.N. |editor-link=Oleg Trubachyov |title=Etimologicheskyi slovar' slavyanskikh yazykov |script-title=ru:Этимологический словарь славянских языков |date=1994 |at=V. 20: pp. 19–20, 197, 202–203; V. 21: pp. 12, 19–20, 76–79 |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pokorny |first1=Julius |author-link=Julius Pokorny |title=Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch |chapter=meu |chapter-url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/U/P1312.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310064838/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/U/P1312.html |archivedate=March 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> so the name ''Moskva'' might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.<ref name="Vasmer" /> Its [[cognate]]s include {{lang-ru|музга}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|muzga}} "pool, puddle", {{lang-lt|mazgoti}} and {{lang-lv|mazgāt}} "to wash", {{lang-sa|májjati}} "to drown", {{lang-la|mergō}} "to dip, immerse".<ref name="Vasmer" /><ref name="Trubach" /> In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in [[Bulgaria]], Russia, [[Ukraine]] and [[North Macedonia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forebears.io/surnames/moskov|title=Moskov Surname Meaning, Origins & Distribution|website=forebears.io|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> There exist as well similar place names in [[Poland]] like [[Mozgawa]].<ref name="Vasmer" /><ref name="Smol" /><ref name="Trubach" />

The original [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] form of the name is reconstructed as *{{lang|orv|Москы}}, *{{lang|orv-Latn|Mosky}},<ref name=Vasmer/><ref name=Smol/> hence it was one of a few Slavic [[wikt:Category:Proto-Slavic v-stem nouns|''ū''-stem nouns]]. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were {{lang|orv|Московь}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskovĭ}} ([[accusative case]]), {{lang|orv|Москви}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskvi}} ([[locative case]]), {{lang|orv|Москвe/Москвѣ}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskve/Moskvě}} ([[genitive case]]).<ref name=Vasmer/><ref name=Smol/> From the latter forms came the modern Russian name {{lang|ru|Москва}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Moskva}}, which is a result of [[morphological leveling|morphological generalisation]] with the numerous Slavic [[wikt:Category:Proto-Slavic hard a-stem nouns|''ā''-stem nouns]].

However, the form ''Moskovĭ'' has left some traces in many other languages, such as {{lang-en|Moscow}}, {{lang-de|Moskau}}, {{lang-fr|Moscou}}, {{lang-ka|მოსკოვი}}, {{lang-lv|Maskava}}, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: {{lang|ota-Latn|Moskov}}, {{lang-tt|Мәскәү}}, {{lang|tt-latn|Mäskäw}}, {{lang-kk|Мәскеу}}, {{lang|kk-latn|Mäskew}}, {{lang-cv|Мускав}}, {{lang|cv-latn|Muskav}}, etc. In a similar manner the Latin name {{lang|la|Moscovia}} has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English ''Muscovy'' and ''muscovite''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geology.com/minerals/muscovite.shtml|title=Muscovite|website=geology.com|first=Hobart|last=King
|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

Various other theories (of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasic]] origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.<ref name=Vasmer/><ref name=Smol/>

===Other names===
Moscow has acquired a number of [[epithet]]s, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The ''[[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]]'' ({{lang|ru|Третий Рим}}), the ''Whitestone One'' ({{lang|ru|Белокаменная}}), the ''First Throne'' ({{lang|ru|Первопрестольная}}), the ''Forty Soroks'' ({{lang|ru|Сорок Сороков}}) ("sorok" meaning both "forty, a great many" and "a district or parish" in [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]]). Moscow is also one of the twelve [[Hero City|Hero Cities]]. The [[demonym]] for a Moscow resident is "{{lang|ru|москвич}}" (''moskvich'') for male or "{{lang|ru|москвич}}ка" (''moskvichka'') for female, rendered in English as ''Muscovite''. The name "Moscow" is abbreviated "MSK" ({{lang|ru|МСК}} in Russian).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==History==
{{main|History of Moscow|Timeline of Moscow}}

===Prehistory===
Archaeological digs show that the site of today's Moscow and the surrounding area have been inhabited since time immemorial. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the [[Neolithic]] period, the last phase of the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/22507073/|title=The origins of Moscow: What archaeological finds, chronicles and urban legends tell us|work=[[Mos.ru]]|date=April 5, 2017|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref>

They confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, [[Vyatichi]] and [[Krivichi]], settled here. Possibly the Vyatichi formed the core of Moscow's indigenous population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moskau.ru/moskau/lexikon/geschichte_moskaus_vom_dorf_zur_metropole_3.html|title=History of Moscow - from village to metropolis|work=moskau.ru|access-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref>

===Early history (1147–1283)===
{{further|Kievan Rus'|Vladimir-Suzdal}}

[[File:Kyivan Rus' 1220-1240.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Vladimir-Suzdal]], a principality on the northeastern periphery of [[Kievan Rus']], grew into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.]]

The first known reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of [[Yuri Dolgoruky]] and [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]]. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The chronicle says, "Come, my brother, to Moskov" (Original - Приди ко мне, брате, во Москов)<ref>{{cite web |url= https://bridgetomoscow.com/curious-fact-moscow-age|title= Moscow age|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2009|website= bridgetomoscow.com|publisher= Bridge to Moscow|access-date= 21 June 2020|quote= The year of the city foundation is generally accepted to be 1147 when prince Yuri Dolgorukiy called upon his brother, the prince of the Novgorod-Severski to "come to me, brother, to Moscow." This is the first record of Moscow in Russian chronicles.}}</ref>

In 1156, [[Knjaz]] [[Yury Dolgoruky]] fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]], the Mongols under [[Batu Khan]] burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The timber fort ''na Moskvě'' "on the Moscow River" was inherited by [[Daniel of Moscow|Daniel]], the youngest son of [[Alexander Nevsky]], in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.
Daniel was still a child at the time, and the big fort was governed by ''tiuns'' (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, [[Yaroslav of Tver]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Daniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother [[Dmitry of Pereslavl|Dmitry]] in his bid for the rule of [[Novgorod]]. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.
Daniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bronnitsky.)|first=Tikhon (Bishop of|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-_VAAAAMAAJ&q=history+of+Lord's+Epiphany+monastery+and+to+Saint+Daniel|title=The Orthodox Shrines of Moscow|date=1997|publisher=Publishing House of the Moscow Patriarchate|language=en}}</ref>

Daniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.

On the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the Kremlin, not later than in 1282, Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.

Moscow was quite stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing [[primogeniture]], whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, [[Yury of Moscow]] contested with [[Mikhail of Tver]] for the throne of the principality of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] eventually defeated [[Tver]] to become the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol]] rulers, making Moscow the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]].

[[File:Andronikov Monastery 18.jpg|thumb|Spassky Cathedral (Moscow's oldest extant building), built c. 1357|alt=|left]]

While the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. Afterwards, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] had [[Great standing on the Ugra river|finally broken the Russians free]] from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and [[Siberia]], and parts of many other lands.

In 1462 Ivan III, (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians.

The original [[Moscow Kremlin]] was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from [[Renaissance Italy]], such as [[Petrus Antonius Solarius]], who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and [[Marco Ruffo]] who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.

A trading settlement, or ''posad'', grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as ''Zaradye'' (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the [[Red Square]], originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.

In 1508–1516, the Italian architect [[Aloisio the New|Aleviz Fryazin (Novy)]] arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Neglinnaya River|Neglinnaya]] and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of {{convert|541|m|ft|abbr=off}}, width of {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and a depth of {{convert|9.5|to(-)|13|m|ft|abbr=off}} was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, {{convert|4|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-thick}} cogged-brick walls.{{anchor|Tsardom}}

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defences were built: [[Kitay-gorod]] (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the [[Crimean Tatars]] [[Russo-Crimean Wars|captured Moscow]], burning everything except the Kremlin.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&pg=PA260&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World]''".

The [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimean Tatars]] attacked again in 1591, but this time was held back by new defence walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named [[Fyodor Kon]]. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defence, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and [[Donskoy Monastery|Donskoy]], [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov]], [[Simonov Monastery|Simonov]], [[Novospassky Monastery|Novospasskiy]], and [[Andronikov Monastery|Andronikov]] monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as ''Bielokamennaya'', the "White-Walled". The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the [[Garden Ring]].

Three square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.

Orientation: north is at the right, west at the top]]

The [[Russian famine of 1601–03]] killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied Moscow, as its ruler [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and other Russian cities conducted by prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]] rose against the Polish occupants, [[Time of Troubles|besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them]]. In 1613, the [[Zemsky sobor]] elected [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] tsar, establishing the [[Romanov dynasty]]. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the [[Salt Riot]] (1648), the [[Copper Riot]] (1662), and the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]].

During the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. It is estimated, that in the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], practically all of them being driven from their homeland to Moscow by Muscovite invaders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Абецедарский|first=Л. С.|title=Белоруссия и Россия|publisher=|year=1978|isbn=|location=Москва|pages=213|language=Russian}}</ref> By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] abducted from their hometowns in the course of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the ''Meshchanskaya [[sloboda]]'', after Ruthenian ''meshchane'' "town people". The term ''meshchane'' (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means "petty bourgeois" or "narrow-minded philistine".<ref>П.В.Сытин, "Из истории московских улиц", М, 1948, p. 296.</ref>

The entire city of the late 17th century, including the [[sloboda]]s that grew up outside the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's [[Central Administrative Okrug]].

Numerous disasters befell the city. The [[Black Death|plague]] epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IcljzNyv4EgC&pg=PA17&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Bubonic Plague in Early Modern Russia: Public Health and Urban Disaster]''.

In 1712 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] moved his government to the newly built [[Saint Petersburg]] on the Baltic coast. Moscow ceased to be Russia's capital, except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the [[Supreme Privy Council]].

After losing the status as the capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.

[[File:Kniznije lavki.jpg|thumb|Bookshops at the [[Novospassky Bridge]] in the 17th century, by [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]]]

By 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=off}} long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called ''val'' (“ramparts”).
Between 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water-pipe (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813, following the destruction of much of the city during the French occupation, a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-centre. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time was the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] and the [[Kremlin Armoury]], the [[Moscow University]], the [[Moscow Manege]] (Riding School), and the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water-supply was completed.

In the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – "raskats". The [[Tsar Cannon]] was located on the platform of the [[Lobnoye mesto]].

The road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]], was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old [[Tver]] road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as ''[[Leningradsky Prospekt|Peterburskoye Schosse]]'' after it was paved in the 1780s. [[Petrovsky Palace]] was built in 1776–1780 by [[Matvey Kazakov]].

[[File:Fireofmoscow.jpg|thumb|Napoleon retreating from the city during the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of Moscow]], after the failed [[French Invasion of Russia]]]]
When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invaded]] Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected that the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Moscow fire]] was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's ''[[Grande Armée]]'' was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 of Napoleon's soldiers died during this time.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQqQz3VjlxcC&pg=PA29&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars]''".

[[Moscow State University]] was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by [[Domenico Giliardi]]. The ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti]]'' newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.

The [[Arbat Street]] had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.

In the 1830s, general [[Alexander Bashilov]] planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. [[Khodynka Field|Khodynka field]] south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]) was inaugurated in 1870. [[Sokolniki Park]], in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]] was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or [[Mayor]], was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.

When [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage was depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly life styles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.<ref>Alexander M.

Following the success of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd to Moscow on March 12, 1918.<ref name="prlib">{{cite web|url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/history/619089|title=Moscow becomes the capital of the Soviet State|accessdate=2019-03-12|date=2018|publisher=Presidential Library}}</ref> The Kremlin once again became the seat of power and the political centre of the new state.

[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to rename Moscow to "Stalindar" or "Stalinodar", one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to "live in Stalinodar" and had selected the name to represent the "gift" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.<ref>Sarah Davies, Popular Opinion in Stalin's Russia: Terror, Propaganda and Dissent, 1934–1941</ref> Stalin rejected this suggestion, and after it was suggested again to him by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], he was "outraged", saying "What do I need this for?". This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936.<ref>Simon Montefiore, The Court of the Red Tsar</ref>

During the [[World War II]], the [[USSR|Soviet]] State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people) and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German [[Army Group Centre]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defences, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal "For the defence of Moscow" and in 1947 another medal "In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow" was instituted.

Both [[German casualties in World War II|German]] and [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet casualties]] during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the [[Wehrmacht]] and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.<ref>''Moscow Encyclopedia'', ed. Great Russian Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1997, entry "Battle of Moscow"</ref><ref>Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1973–78, entry "Battle of Moscow 1941–42"</ref><ref>John Erickson, ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', table 12.4</ref>

During the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of [[Tower block|high-rise apartments]]. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.<ref name="hrranking">{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/statistics/skyline-ranking|title=Skyline Ranking|website=Emporis}}</ref> Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film ''[[Irony of Fate]]'' parodies this construction method.

The city of [[Zelenograd]] was built in 1958 at {{convert|37|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre to the north-west, along with the [[Leningradskoye Shosse]], and incorporated as one of Moscow's [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|administrative okrugs]]. [[Moscow State University]] moved to its campus on [[Sparrow Hills]] in 1953.

[[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign]]. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.

On May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th [[Victory Day (9 May)|anniversary of the victory]] in [[World War II]], Moscow was awarded a title of the [[Hero City]]. In 1980 it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]].

The MKAD (ring road) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running {{convert|109|km|abbr=off}} along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated. In 1980, it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], which were boycotted by the [[United States]] and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in [[Afghanistan]] in late 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup attempt]] by conservative communists opposed to the [[Perestroika|liberal reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

When the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the [[Russian Federation]]). Since then, a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.

The city has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.

In December 2002 [[Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo]] became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], intermediate between the early 19th-century [[Garden Ring]] and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.<ref>Robert J.

Typical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July and August are around a comfortable {{convert|20|to|26|C}}, but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed {{convert|30|C}}, sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately {{convert|−10|C}}, though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above {{convert|0|C}}, and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below {{convert|−30|C}}. These periods usually last about a week or two.

The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38.2|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=27612&month=7&year=2010 |title=Climate monitoring|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}</ref> at the [[VVC weather station]] and {{convert|39.0|C}} in the center of Moscow and [[Domodedovo airport]] on July 29, 2010 during the unusual [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. Record high temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, July, August, November, and December in 2007–2014.<ref name="pogoda (data)">{{cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/climate/27612.htm|title=Pogoda.ru.net|accessdate=December 15, 2012|language=Russian}}</ref> The average July temperature from 1981 to 2010 is {{convert|19.2|C}}. The lowest ever recorded temperature was {{convert|−42.1|C}} in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid October, while snow cover lies in November and melts at the beginning of April.

On average Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteoweb.ru/2014/pss2014.php|title=Sunshine hours in 2014 and averages |language=Russian|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref> This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as [[Edinburgh]]. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine. December 2017 was the darkest month in Moscow since records began, with only six minutes of sunlight.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/europe/moscow-darkness-sunlight.html|title=Moscow Got 6 Minutes of Sunlight in December|last=Luxmoore|first=Matthew|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 22, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-42722931|title=How to survive in Moscow without sunshine|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=February 22, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Temperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average February temperature in the north-east of Moscow is {{convert|−6.7|C}}, in the suburbs it is about {{convert|−9|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/27532.htm|title=Climate of Vladimir |language=Russian|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref> The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of [[Moscow Oblast]] can sometimes be more than {{convert|10|C-change}} on frosty winter nights.

Recent changes in Moscow's regional climate, since it is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, are often cited by climate scientists as evidence of [[global warming]]{{cn|date=April 2020}}, though by definition, climate change is global, not regional. During the summer, extreme heat is often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave|2010]], 2011).

The last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow. Temperature changes in the city are depicted in the table below:

The [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'|Patriarch of Moscow]] serves as the head of the church and resides in the [[Danilov Monastery]]. Moscow was called the "city of 40 times 40 churches"—''"город сорока сороков церквей"''—prior to 1917. In 1918 the Bolshevik government declared Russia a [[secular state]], which in practice meant that religion [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|was repressed]] and society was to become atheistic. During the period of 1920-1930s a [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921–28)|great number of churches in Moscow were demolished]], including historical [[Chudov Monastery]] in the Kremlin, dating from the 14th century, [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazansky Cathedral]] on the Red Square, the [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over Napoleon's army in 1812, and many more. This continued even after the Second World War, in 1940-1970s, when persecutions against religion in the Soviet Union became less severe. Most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs, offices, factories or even warehouses. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity. Among the churches reconstructed in the 1990s is an impressive new Cathedral of Christ the Savior that once more has become a landmark. It was built on the site of the old demolished cathedral, where there had been a huge open swimming-pool until 1994.

Moscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], with its elegant [[onion dome]]s, as well as the [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]] and the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]]. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.

Medieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.
[[File:Рабочий и колхозница 1937 год.jpg|thumb|The sculpture of [[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]], an example of [[Socialist realism]] in an [[Art Deco]] aesthetic]]
The Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.

The city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires but also the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.<ref>{{cite book|title=The architecture and planning of classical Moscow: a cultural history|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_STn96Qeg3D4C|last=Schmidt|first=Albert J|publisher=American Philosophical Society|date=April 1, 1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_STn96Qeg3D4C/page/n24 5]–25}}</ref>

For much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s large-scale effort to "modernize" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the [[Sukharev Tower]], a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply [[secular]] nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazan Cathedral]] and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.<ref>{{cite journal|title=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|journal=City & Society|volume=10|pages=269–314|publisher=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|date=June 28, 2008|doi=10.1525/city.1998.10.1.269|last1=Khazanov|first1=Anatoly M.|s2cid=145807994|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9b88d750ffa1f82dd10b89d5e49f9aabfbb7cba}}</ref>

While the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with [[VKHUTEMAS]], responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was [[Vladimir Shukhov]], famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid towers]] designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.<ref name="stako">{{cite web|url=http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&id=mem_shukhov&lang=eng&data=mem_shukhov |publisher=Melnikov Institute |title=Memorial |accessdate=July 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527154019/http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&id=mem_shukhov&lang=eng&data=mem_shukhov |archivedate=May 27, 2008 }}</ref> Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the [[GUM (department store)|GUM]] department store on [[Red Square]],<ref name="stako"/> bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.

[[File:Zhivopisny Bridge1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zhivopisny Bridge]], the highest cable-stayed bridge in Europe]]
Perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]], seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]] in [[New York City]], and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic architecture]]. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the [[Ostankino Tower]], which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, [[Taipei 101]] in Taiwan and the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto.<ref>[[List of tallest buildings in the world]]</ref>

The Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.

Although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have [[elevator]]s. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as [[Chicago]]. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/12/the-elevator-rescue-teams-of-moscow.html

[[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist-era buildings]], mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with [[Socialist realism]] motifs that imitate [[classical architecture|classical]] themes. However, small churches—almost always [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old [[Arbat Street]], a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist [[façade]]s of [[Tverskaya Street]], for example) are also examples of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture typical of Tsarist times. [[Ostankino Palace]], [[Kuskovo]], [[Uzkoye]] and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some [[:Template: Cloisters of Moscow|convents, and monasteries]], both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.

[[File:Москва, Россия (Unsplash -kgrPSetNW8).jpg|thumb|Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious [[Moscow International Business Center|MIBC]].]]
Attempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet [[avant-garde]] work too, such as the house of the architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. [[Facadism]] is also widely practiced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&data_id=92&do=view_single |title=Moscow Architecture Preservation Society |publisher=Maps-moscow.com |date=April 17, 2006 |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111182743/http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&data_id=92&do=view_single |archivedate=January 11, 2008 |df= }}</ref> Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-[[Modernist]] styles employed, such as with the [[Novy Arbat]] project, familiarly known as "false teeth of Moscow" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.

Plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many "museum houses" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.

Moscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.
In recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings.

===Moscow rings===
Moscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads ("rings").

The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso ([[Boulevard Ring]]), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called [[Bely Gorod]] (White Town).<ref name="golden-ring">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf |title=Along the Moscow Golden Ring |publisher=Moscow, Russia Tourist Information center |accessdate=July 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723084926/http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2006 }}</ref> The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a [[horseshoe]]-like arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the [[Yauza River]].
The second primary ring, located outside the bell end of the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso ([[Garden Ring]]). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.<ref name="golden-ring" />
[[File:ISS-38 Nighttime image of Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Moscow as viewed from the [[International Space Station]], January 29, 2014]]
The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], was completed in 2003 as a high-speed [[freeway]].

The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. It will be replaced by a system of chordal highways.

Aside from aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of [[Moscow Metro]] is a circle-shaped looped subway line (hence the name ''Koltsevaya Liniya'', "ring line"), which is located between the ''Sadovoye Koltso'' and Third Transport Ring.

September 10, 2016, ''[[Moscow Central Circle]]'' renovated railroad (former ''Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga'') was introduced as 14th line of [[Moscow Metro]]. The railroad itself was in use since 1907, but before the renovation, it was a non-electrified railroad for transit needs of fueled locomotives only.

Another circle metro line - ''Big Circle Line'' (''Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya'') is under construction and will be finished about 2023.

The outermost ring within Moscow is the [[Moscow Ring Road]] (often called ''MKAD'', acronym word for Russian ''Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога''), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).

Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.

Outside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable example of two ''Betonka'' road, originally made of concrete pads.

In order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called ''CKAD'' - ''Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga'', ''Central Ring Road'') is under construction now.

Waste management has been a sore point in the Russian capital for a long time, as well as in the country in general. The most advanced methods of separate collection and [[recycling]] of waste were mostly unknown to the citizens of Moscow, as the produced garbage was thrown into a single dumpster, the content later transported outside the capital and deposited in huge waste dumps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/327957-russians-ready-separate-waste|title=Are Russians ready to separate their garbage?}}</ref> Moscow couldn't handle its own garbage.

The entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor ([[Sergey Sobyanin]]). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.

The Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.

The following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of [[Zelenograd]]. A part of [[Moscow Oblast]]'s territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with [[Kaluga Oblast]].<ref name="Merger">Official website of the Government of Moscow. [http://www.mos.ru/about/borders/ Draft of adopted measures of the capital and oblast governments with regards to the expansion of the borders of Moscow] {{in lang|ru}}</ref> In all, Moscow gained about {{convert|1500|km2|sp=us}} and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a "mega-city" of twenty million people, to develop "harmonically".<ref name="Merger2"/>

All administrative okrugs and districts have their own [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] and flags as well as individual heads of the area.

In addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the [[Moscow Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences|Botanical Garden]], large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the [[Chinatown]]s that exist in some [[North America]]n and [[East Asia]]n cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:Цены на Квартиры в Москве по Административным Районам и Станциям Метро|url=http://www.metrinfo.ru/area/|work=Metrinfo.ru|accessdate=September 27, 2010|language=Russian}}</ref>

Moscow also hosts some of the government bodies of [[Moscow Oblast]], although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.<ref name="MoscowO">According to Article 24 of the [[Charter of Moscow Oblast]], the government bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially named the administrative centre of the oblast.</ref>

During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). [[Private ownership]] of apartments was limited until the 1990s, when people were permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.

===Public utilities===
====Heating====
Heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using [[District heating|central heating system]]. Before 2004, state [[unitary enterprise]]s were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the [[District heating substation|heating substations]] in the [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|north-eastern part]] of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) ({{lang-ru|Московская теплосетевая компания}}). In 2007 the [[Government of Moscow]] bought controlling stakes in the company.<ref>[Andrey Kovalev, Liliana Proskuryakova.

Although Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards [[engineering]] or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in [[Business school|business]] and [[management]]. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the [[Master of Business Administration]]. [[Student exchange program]]s with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.
[[File:Moscow 1152 (14384525084).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]]]
Moscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] are located in Moscow as well as research and applied science institutions. The [[Kurchatov Institute]], Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first [[nuclear reactor]] in Europe was built, the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]], [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]], [[Institute for Physical Problems|Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems]] and [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] are all situated in Moscow.

In regard to primary and secondary education, in 2011, [[Clifford J. Levy]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades."<ref name="Levy1">{{cite news|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy|authorlink=Clifford J.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Moscow}}

===Metro===
{{Main|Moscow Metro}}
[[File:Moscow metro ring railway map en sb future.svg|thumb|[[Moscow Metro]] route map with planned stations]]
[[File:Moscow MayakovskayaMetroStation 0943.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] station opened in 1938.]]
The [[Moscow Metro]] system is famous for its art, [[mural]]s, [[mosaic]]s, and ornate [[chandelier]]s. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new "Homo Sovieticus." (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel Wünsche, "Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station", ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp. 65–90</ref>

The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, "A Metro on the Mount", ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp. 697–723</ref> Soviet workers did the labour and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunnelling instead of the "cut-and-cover" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.<ref>Michael Robbins, "London Underground and Moscow Metro", ''Journal of Transport History'', (1997) 18#1 pp. 45–53.</ref> The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, "Redefining Intelligence and Intelligence-Gathering: The Industrial Intelligence Centre and the Metro-Vickers Affair, Moscow 1933", ''Intelligence and National Security'' (1994) 9#3 pp. 520–533.</ref>

Today, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance the [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] station, completed in 2003, at {{convert|84|m}} underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the world's busiest]] metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).<ref name="metro">{{cite web|url=http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99|language=ru|script-title=ru:Московский метрополитен|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714154607/http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99|archivedate=July 14, 2006|accessdate=July 4, 2006}}</ref> Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro. In 2016, the authorities launched a [[Moscow Central Circle|new circle metro railway]] that contributed to solving transportation issues, namely daily congestion at Koltsevaya Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rbth.com/politics_and_society/2016/09/09/how-moscows-new-light-rail-system-will-make-life-easier-for-passengers_628517|title=How Moscow's new light rail system will make life easier for passengers|last=RBTH|first=special to|date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

Due to treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by fact workers of Moscow would get to see every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different "custom" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, [[Elektrozavodskaya_(Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya_line)|Elektrozavodskaya]] station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/features/moscow-metro-stations/|title=The people's palace: exploring Moscow Metro's evolving designs|work=RailwayTechnology|date=December 10, 2018|access-date=September 30, 2020}}</ref> the tradition of "Grand Designs" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.

===Monorail===
[[File:Monorail Moskau - Einfahrt in Station Telezentrum.jpg|thumb|Two trains of the [[Moscow Monorail]] arriving at a monorail station]]
{{Main|Moscow Monorail}}

The Moscow Metro operates a short [[Moscow Monorail|monorail line]]. The line connects [[Timiryazevskaya (Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line)|Timiryazevskaya]] metro station and [[Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina]], passing close to [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|VVTs]]. The line opened in 2004. No additional fare is needed (first metro-monorail transfer in 90 minutes does not charge).

===Bus, trolleybus and electric bus===
{{main|Electric buses in Moscow}}
[[File:Выход 500-го электробуса на линию в Москве (09).jpg|thumb|left|Moscow has the [[Electric buses in Moscow|largest fleet of electric buses]] in Europe, with 500 operating {{as of|October 2020|lc=y}}.<ref name="Trolleybus"/>]]
As Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to {{convert|4|km}}, a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses ([[Moscow Central Bus Terminal|Central Bus Terminal]]) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.<ref>See also: {{in lang|ru}} [http://www.kvartirant.ru/news/?news_id=10891&date=12.05.2006&date2=2006-05-12] Realty news. Retrieved on July 22, 2006.</ref>

Every major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a [[trolleybus]] route and have trolley wires over them.

With the total line length of almost {{convert|600|km|abbr=off}} of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the [[Trolleybus usage by country|largest in the world]]. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy trolleybus system in Moscow at 2014 due to corruption and planned replacement of trolleybuses by electrobuses. At 2018 Moscow trolleybus system have only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) was cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets ("Moya Ulitsa"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.

In 2018 the vehicle companies [[Kamaz]] and [[GAZ]] have won the [[Mosgortrans]] tender for delivering 200 [[electric bus]]es and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019, according to expectations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rusautonews.com/2018/09/04/first-electric-buses-have-started-operating-in-moscow-in-regular-transport|title=First electric buses have started operating in Moscow in regular transport|date=September 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Moscow cable car===
[[File:Moscow Cable Car.jpg|thumb|Cable cars passing across the [[Moskva River]] and the [[Luzhniki Stadium]]]]
{{Main|Moskva River cable car}}
On November 26, 2018, the [[mayor of Moscow]] [[Sergey Sobyanin]] took part in the ceremony to open the [[Moskva River cable car|cable car]] above the [[Moskva River]]. The cable car will connect the [[Luzhniki Olympic Complex|Luzhniki sports complex]] with [[Sparrow Hills]] and Kosygin Street.

The journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to [[Luzhniki Stadium]] will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car. The cable car will work every day from 11 a.m. till 11 p.m.

The cable car is 720 meters long. It was built to transport 1,600 passengers per hour in all weathers. There 35 closed capsules designed by Porsche Design Studio to transport passengers. The booths are equipped with media screens, LED lights, hooks for bikes, skis and snowboards. Passengers will also be able to use audio guides in English, German, Chinese and Russian.

===Tram===
{{main|Trams in Moscow}}
[[File:Moscow TverZastava Vityaz asv2018-09.jpg|thumb|left|A Vityaz-M tram passing by the [[Tverskaya Zastava Square]]]]
[[File:Moscow tram map 2020-11-07.svg|thumb|Tram map of Moscow]]
Moscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://moscowseasons.com/en/news/the-long-trip-to-vityaz-or-the-story-of-the-moscow-tram-system/|title=The long trip to Vityaz or the story of the Moscow tram system
|website=MoscowSeasons|date=22 September 2018|accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross links between metro lines, for example between [[Universitet (Moscow Metro)|Universitet station]] of [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (#1 red line) and [[Profsoyuznaya (Moscow Metro)|Profsoyuznaya station]] of [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (#6 orange line) or between [[Voykovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Voykovskaya]] and [[Strogino (Moscow Metro)|Strogino]].

There are three tram networks in the city:

* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).
* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to fire at Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).
* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.

In addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.

===Taxi===
[[File:Taxi in Moscow (3040398341).jpg|thumb|Parked [[Porsche Cayenne]] taxis]]
Commercial taxi services and [[route taxi]]s are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as [[Yandex.Taxi]], [[Uber]] and [[Gett]] displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top.rbc.ru/money/20/07/2015/55ad01229a794778050020f6|title=Гонки на такси: на чем быстрее и дешевле ездить|author=|date=|work=rbc.ru|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134238/http://top.rbc.ru/money/20/07/2015/55ad01229a794778050020f6|archivedate=July 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://i.rbc.ru/publication/analytic/otsifrovannye_shashki_kak_tehnologii_perekroili Оцифрованные шашки: как технологии перекроили рынок такси / РБК Инновации<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805050244/http://i.rbc.ru/publication/analytic/otsifrovannye_shashki_kak_tehnologii_perekroili|date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

Moscow's nine rail terminals (or ''vokzals'') are:

*[[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kazansky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kiyevsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kursky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Leningradsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Paveletsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Rizhsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]]

[[File:Bullet-Train.jpg|thumb|The high-speed [[Sapsan]] train links Moscow with [[Saint Petersburg]].]]
The terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metroline to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.<ref name="mostimestrain">{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708154220/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html|archivedate=July 8, 2006|newspaper=The Moscow Times|title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Train|accessdate=July 3, 2006}}</ref> There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which traverses nearly {{convert|9300|km}} of Russian territory to [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.

Suburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter [[elektrichka]] (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to {{convert|140|km|mi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) large railway stations.

During the 2010s, the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. There is a connecting railway line on the North side of the town that connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.

==== Moscow Central Circle ====
[[File:81-765 Moskva on Shelepikha station.jpg|thumb|left|A 81-765 Moscow train on [[Shelepikha (Moscow Central Circle)|Shelepikha]]]]
The [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway|Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga]] formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's. 

The [[Moscow Central Circle]] is a {{convert|54|km|mi|adj = mid|-long}} [[Urban rail transit|urban-metro railway]] orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]], taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016. MOZD is integrated as "Line 14 of Moscow Metro", and, while using railway-sized trains, can be perceived as "S-train-design circle line".

The line is operated by the [[Moscow Government]] owned company MKZD through the [[Moscow Metro]], with the [[Government of Russia|Federal Government]] owned [[Russian Railways]] selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while most station buildings are owned by MKZD. However, in ''S-bahn'' way, Moscow unified tickets "Ediniiy" and "Troika" are accepted by MCC stations. There is one zero-fee interchange for any ticket used on Moscow Metro station less than 90 minutes before entering an MCC station (and vice versa: a passenger of MCC gets 1 free interchange to Moscow Metro within 90 minutes after entering MCC station)

==== Moscow Central Diameters ====
[[File:EG2Tv arrives to Belorussky rail terminal (platform 4).jpg|thumb|left|An [[Ivolga (train)|EG2Tv]] train arriving at the [[Moscow Belorussky railway station]]]]
[[File:Moscow Central Diameters - passenger scheme1.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Moscow Central Diameters]]]]
Another system, which forms "genuine ''S-Bahn''" as in "suburbia-city-suburbia"-designed railway, is the [[Moscow Central Diameters]], a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from "vokzals" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/news/moscow-central-diameters-opened-public/|title=Moscow Central Diameters, Russia, opens to the public|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> and forming a train line across Moscow's centre. 

Out of 5 projected lines, first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21 (e.g. November 21, 2019).

While using the same rails as "regular" suburban trains to vokzals, MCD trains ("''[[Ivolga_(train)|Ivolga]]''" model) got distinguishing features (shape; red cabin, different windows, lesser amount of seats; big red "MЦΔ" train logo (informally "ЯИЦА" train logo, due to overlap of letter M and a window: without upper left corner, M letter can be interpreted as ЯИ letters, and Δ letter can be both interpreted as stylized Д or as stylized А)).

===Roads===
[[File:Площадь Тверская Застава (вид сверху).jpg|thumb|Intersection at [[Tverskaya Zastava Square]]]]
There are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.

The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Transport Ring]] and the cancelled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. There are several other roadway systems that form [[concentric circles]] around the city.

===Air===
There are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo]] (SVO), [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]] (DME), [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo]] (VKO), [[Zhukovsky International Airport|Zhukovsky]] (ZIA), [[Ostafyevo International Airport|Ostafyevo]] (OSF).

Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput, and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. Most of [[Star Alliance]] members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Wizz Air]] and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.

Moscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}; Vnukovo is {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}}; Sheremetyevo is {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}; and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about {{convert|8|km|mi}} from MKAD.<ref name="4airports"/>

Moscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several [[car sharing]] companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor [[Sergey Sobyanin]] said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/03/09/moscows-car-sharing-market-becomes-biggest-in-europe-mayor-says-a60762|title=Moscow's Car Sharing Market Becomes Biggest in Europe, Mayor Says|date=9 March 2018|website=[[The Moscow Times]]|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref> Every day about 25,000 people use this service.

===Future development===
[[File:Перспективное новое строительство в Москва-Сити (2020).jpg|thumb|left|The 2020 development concept of MIBC and its adjacent territory implies the construction of even more skyscrapers during the period of 2020–2027.<ref>{{cite web|title=Собянин назвал сроки реализации проекта развития "Большого Сити"|url=https://rg.ru/2020/09/16/reg-cfo/sobianin-nazval-sroki-realizacii-proekta-razvitiia-bolshogo-siti.html|publisher=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]|author=Любовь Проценко, Сергей Михеев|date=September 16, 2020|access-date=December 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Собянин обещал достроить «Большой Сити» через семь лет|url=https://realty.rbc.ru/news/5f620ab99a794772c9fe4682|publisher=[[Rbc.ru]]|author=Вера Лунькова|date=September 16, 2020|access-date=December 4, 2020}}</ref>]]

In 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the [[Moscow International Business Center]], with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,<ref>{{cite news|date=December 23, 2005|script-title=ru:Москва-Сити начинается строительство Города столиц|language=Russian|work=|publisher=|agency=Lenta.ru|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/12/23/city/|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}</ref> that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in [[Presnensky District]] and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to {{convert|1|km2|acre|spell=in|abbr=off}}. The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.

The [[Federation Tower]], completed in 2016, is the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|second-tallest building in Europe]]. It is planned to include a [[water park]] and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment and residential buildings, a transport network and a [[City Hall and City Duma|new site for the Moscow government]]. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. A rail shuttle service, directly connecting [[Moscow International Business Center|MIBC]] with the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] is also planned. Major thoroughfares through MIBC are the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring]] and [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]]. Three metro stations were initially planned for the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed [[Vystavochnaya]] in 2009. The branch extended to the [[Mezhdunarodnaya (Moscow Metro)|Mezhdunarodnaya]] station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed. There are plans to extend the branch as far as the [[Savyolovskaya (Serpukhovsko–Timiryazevskaya line)|Savyolovskaya]] station, on the [[Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line]].
