The '''Apple iPod+HP''' is a line of [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]-branded [[iPod]]s, distributed through HP.

On January 8, 2004, [[Carly Fiorina]] announced the Apple iPod+HP deal at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]].<ref name="pcworld">[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,114205-page,1/article.html PC World: HP Will Resell Apple's iPod]</ref> The first device of the iPod+HP line was the [[IPod Classic|fourth-generation iPod]], available in 2 and 4&nbsp;GB of storage. The Apple iPod+HP was originally intended to be available in "HP Blue".<ref name="macrumors">[http://www.macrumors.com/2004/01/09/hps-blue-ipod-revealed/ Mac Rumors: HP's Blue iPod Revealed]</ref> 

HP later added the [[iPod mini]], the [[iPod photo]], and the [[iPod shuffle]] to the lineup.<ref name="hppress">[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2005/050701a.html HP Press Release: HP Adds iPod shuffle to Digital Music Player Lineup]</ref> As these were officially HP products rather than Apple products, [[Apple Store]] [[Genius Bar]]s were not authorized to repair Apple iPod+HP iPods, and they had to be sent to an HP Authorized Service Center for repair, despite identical designs.<ref name="ilounge">[http://forums.ilounge.com/showthread.php?t=82091 iLounge Forums: iPod from HP]</ref>

== Deal termination ==
On July 29, 2005, HP announced that it would terminate its deal with Apple. Even though the deal was terminated, part of the deal prevented HP from making a rival digital music player (MP3 player) until August 2006.<ref name="cnet">[http://www.news.com/2100-1047_3-5810643.html CNET News.com: HP to stop selling Apple's iPod]</ref> HP continued to pre-install iTunes on home computers until January 6, 2006, when HP announced a partnership with [[RealNetworks]] to install [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] on HP and Compaq-branded home players under the HP brand.<ref name="pcmag">[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1908810,00.asp PC Magazine: HP Drops iTunes for Rhapsody]</ref>
