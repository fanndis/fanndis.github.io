The Berlei brand originated in 1917.<ref name="Clune">{{cite book | last = Clune | first = Frank | title = Saga of Sydney | year = 1961 | location = Sydney, Australia | pages = 437–440 }}</ref><ref>Australian trademark #21931</ref> Berlei undergarments are now sold in Australia by [[Pacific Brands]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] by Courtaulds Textiles.

Berlei conducted a research project to quantify Australian 'figure types'.[[File:Berlei Figure Type Indicator 1950s a735001.jpg|thumb|250px]]

The name came from that of the firm's founder, Frederick Richard Burley, who felt that his name as normally spelt was not contextually appropriate to his products.

Berlei Limited was one of the first Australian companies to expand outside Australia.<ref name="Clune" /> Berlei ([[New Zealand]]) Limited was incorporated in 1923, and Berlei (U.K.) Limited was organised in 1930.

==Founder==
Frederick R. Burley (29 May 1885, [[Hamilton, Victoria]] – 26 May 1954, [[Wahroonga, New South Wales]]) was the founder of Berlei.

Burley was a pioneer in employee relations and an accomplished public citizen, holding office in the Rotary Club and contributing to other worthy organizations. In the custom of Rotary he would introduce himself to other clubs with his name, his club, and his occupation as a "maker of jewel caskets".<ref>{{cite book | last = Patterson | first = Hamilton Stuart | title = The Ordinary Doctor | publisher = Amphion Press | year = 1990 | location = Brisbane, Australia |page=55 | isbn = 0-86776-372-8 }}</ref>

In 1923, he founded the [[Australia Made Preference League]] and served as the first president of the League. The League created the [[Great White Train]] as a promotional tool for early Australian industries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/www/default.asp?guiValue=6B417187-FA44-4452-A139-4E34622E81B1 |title=The Great White Touring Train visit to Wagga |publisher=Wagga Wagga City Council |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WQSinVVT?url=http://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/www/html/626-the-great-white-touring-train-visit-to-wagga.asp |archivedate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

He travelled widely to learn business and trade information, to make business partnerships, and to get materials for his factories.<ref>{{cite news | title=Wants Girdles Stretched | date=1943-11-29 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OiAeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dY4EAAAAIBAJ&dq=fred%20burley&pg=2235%2C2661863 | work =The Pittsburgh Press |page=11 | accessdate = 2010-03-16 }}</ref>

==History of Berlei Limited and associated companies==
Berlei Limited was started in 1910, as a company called '''Unique Corsets''' in [[Sydney]], after Fred Burley discovered that the corset business was profitable and that the wholesale segment of the business could be prosecuted on an [[import replacement]] basis. Burley made his first overseas business trip to the US in 1913, to research methods and investigate the use of machinery of the time.  The 'frenchified' brand name of '''Berlei''' was conceptualized soon after and was registered in Australia in 1917.  (While this might reasonably be accordingly pronounced after the French style as 'bur-LAY', it is commonly still pronounced as if written 'burley'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://doylesconstructionlawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Berlei-Hestia-Industries-v-Bali-Co-Inc.pdf|title=BERLEI HESTIA INDUSTRIES LTD V BALI CO INC [1973] 129 CLR 353|date=17 October 1973|publisher=High Court of Australia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>) United Corsets became Berlei Limited in 1920.

Berlei's approach to marketing was professional.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maynard |first=Margaret |year=1999 |title=Living dolls: The fashion model in Australia |journal=Journal of Popular Culture |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=191–205 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1999.3301_191.x}}</ref>
