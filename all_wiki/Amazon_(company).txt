[[Jeff Bezos]] founded Amazon in July 1994. He chose [[Seattle]] because of technical talent as [[Microsoft]] is located there.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3NBQcAqyu4&t=223 The David Rubenstein Show: Jeff Bezos], Bloomberg Markets and Finance, September 19, 2018</ref> In May 1997, the organization went [[public company|public]].

The following year, the organization also sold video games, consumer electronics, home-improvement items, software, games, and toys in addition to other items.

In 2002, the corporation started [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), which provided data on Web site popularity, Internet traffic patterns and other statistics for marketers and developers. In 2006, the organization grew its AWS portfolio when [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Elastic Compute Cloud]] (EC2), which rents computer processing power as well as [[Simple Storage Service]] (S3), that rents data storage via the Internet, were made available. That same year, the company started'' Fulfillment by Amazon ''which managed the inventory of individuals and small companies selling their belongings through the company internet site. In 2012, Amazon bought [[Amazon Robotics|Kiva Systems]] to automate its inventory-management business, purchasing [[Whole Foods Market]] supermarket chain five years later in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amazoncom|title=Amazon.com - History & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=January 3, 2019}}</ref>

In 2000, U.S. toy retailer [[Toys "R" Us]] entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50&nbsp;million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys "R" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys "R" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys "R" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys "R" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys "R" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its own independent e-commerce website.

=== Reviews ===
{{See also|Criticism of Amazon#Amazon reviews}}
Amazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a [[rating scale]] from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicate the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicate that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. Customers may comment or vote on the reviews, indicating whether they found a review helpful to them. If a review is given enough "helpful" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100503005110/en/2010-Social-Shopping-Study-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Online |title=2010 Social Shopping Study Reveals Changes in Consumers' Online Shopping Habits and Usage of Customer Reviews |work=the e-tailing group, PowerReviews |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>

When publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was "taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose".<ref>{{cite book |title=Amazon.com |author=Spector, Robert |year=2002 |page=132}}</ref>

There have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by [[public relations]] companies on behalf of their clients<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?/contents/comments/amazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |title=BEACON SPOTLIGHT: Amazon.com rave book reviews – too good to be true? |work=The Cincinnati Beacon |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004404/http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?%2Fcontents%2Fcomments%2Famazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |archive-date=May 2, 2014 }}</ref> and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.

=== Content search ===
"Search Inside the Book" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=Amazon's online reader ''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828044958/http://www.amazon.com/ |archive-date=August 28, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33&nbsp;million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/102203.html |title=Amazon.com Launches "Search Inside the Book" Feature |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=October 23, 2003 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> There are about 300,000 books in the program. Amazon has cooperated with around 130 [[publisher]]s to allow users to perform these searches.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

To avoid copyright violations, Amazon does not return the computer-readable text of the book. Instead, it returns a picture of the matching page, instructs the web browser to disable printing and puts limits on the number of pages in a book a single user can access. Additionally, customers can purchase online access to some of the same books via the "Amazon Upgrade" program.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Third-party sellers ===
Amazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee204/Publications/Amazon-EE353-2008-1.pdf |title=AMAZON ENTERS THE CLOUD COMPUTING BUSINESS |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> Associates receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has "over 900,000 members" in its affiliate programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join |title=Amazon.co.uk Associates: The web's most popular and successful Affiliate Program |publisher=Affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk |date=July 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826210540/http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join |archive-date=August 26, 2008 }}</ref> In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/advertising/all |title=Usage of advertising networks for websites |publisher=W3Techs.com |date=July 22, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}</ref> It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.<ref>{{cite web |title=14 Easy Fundraising Ideas for Non-Profits |url=http://www.blisstree.com/2009/04/12/sex-relationships/14-easy-fundraising-ideas-for-non-profits/ |website=blisstree.com |accessdate=November 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120701/http://www.blisstree.com/2009/04/12/sex-relationships/14-easy-fundraising-ideas-for-non-profits/ |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Amazon reported over 1.3&nbsp;million sellers sold products through Amazon's websites in 2007. Unlike [[eBay.com|eBay]], Amazon sellers do not have to maintain separate payment accounts; all payments are handled by Amazon.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Associates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) [[XML]] service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched (rumored to be internally called "Project Genesis") to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonservices.com/content/product_alerts.htm?ld=AOguerillaPGJG |title=Amazon Seller Product Suggestions |publisher=Amazonservices.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205225641/http://www.amazonservices.com/content/product_alerts.htm?ld=AOguerillaPGJG |archive-date=December 5, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2019, Amazon launched a bigger local online store in [[Singapore]] to expand its product selection in the face of intensifying competition with competitors in the region.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-singapore-idUSKBN1WN05N|title=Amazon launches bigger local online store in Singapore|date=October 8, 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=October 8, 2019|language=en}}</ref>

In July 2019 the 3rd U.S. City Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that Amazon can be held accountable for faulty third-party sales.<ref>https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/181041p.pdf</ref> The decision ran counter to a past lower court ruling that had favored Amazon. Heather Oberdorf had sued the company in 2016 over a dog leash that snapped, causing permanent loss of vision in one eye. If upheld, the decision would expose Amazon and similar platform businesses to strict liability lawsuits for defective products, which represents a major change in the law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/supply-chain-decision-online-marketplaces-risk-due-to-federal-court-ruling-oberdorf|title=Supply Chain Decision: Online Marketplaces At Risk Due To Federal Court Ruling in Oberdorf v. Amazon.com Inc.|date=July 22, 2019|website=The National Law Review|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref> The panel sent the case back to the lower court, to decide whether the leash was actually defective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-liability/amazon-can-be-held-liable-for-third-party-seller-products-u-s-appeals-court-idUSKCN1TY2HM|title=Amazon can be held liable for third-party seller products: U.S. appeals court|date=July 3, 2019|website=Reuters|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref>

== Amazon sales rank ==
The Amazon sales rank (ASR) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a "best sellers list" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name="amazon">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name="amazon" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of "movers and shakers"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release [[point of sale]] data via the [[Nielsen BookScan]] service to verified authors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200580390 |title=Amazon.com Author Central |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,<ref>{{cite web |title=Amazon Sales Estimator |publisher=Jungle Scout |url=http://www.junglescout.com/estimator/ |date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> though Amazon states:

{{quote|text=Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources|sign=Amazon.com Help<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Amazon.com |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>}}

== Multi-level sales strategy ==
Amazon employs a multi-level e-commerce strategy. Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>

Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>

In November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in [[University Village, Seattle|University Village]] in Seattle.

== Finances ==
Amazon.com is primarily a retail site with a sales revenue model; Amazon takes a small percentage of the sale price of each item that is sold through its website while also allowing companies to advertise their products by paying to be listed as featured products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marketingteacher.com/swot/amazon-swot.html |title=SWOT Analysis Amazon |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203164606/http://www.marketingteacher.com/swot/amazon-swot.html |archive-date=December 3, 2011 }}</ref> {{as of|2018}}, Amazon.com is ranked 8th on the [[Fortune 500]] rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref>

Since its founding, the company has attracted criticism and controversy for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/22/amazon-is-selling-facial-recognition-to-law-enforcement-for-a-fistful-of-dollars/|title=Amazon is selling facial recognition to law enforcement — for a fistful of dollars|date=May 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> forming cloud computing partnerships with the [[CIA]];<ref name="vanity-fair">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/has-bezos-become-more-powerful-in-dc-than-trump|title="Everybody immediately knew that it was for Amazon": Has Bezos become more powerful in DC than Trump?|first=May|last=Jeong|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=August 13, 2018|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}</ref> leading customers away from bookshops;<ref>{{cite news |title=Amazon Lure's Shoppers Away from Stores |first=Nick |last=Leiber |url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/running_small_business/archives/2011/12/amazon_turns_shops_into_showrooms_with_new_app.html |newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> adversely impacting the environment;<ref name=Cavaillez /> placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers; actively opposing unionization efforts;<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise |title=Why Amazon Really Raised Its Minimum Wage to $15 |url=https://www.wired.com/story/why-amazon-really-raised-minimum-wage/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 2, 2018}}</ref> remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its [[1-Click]] technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and [[price discrimination]];<ref name=":6" /><ref name="baum">{{cite news |last1=Baum |first1=Andrew |title=Amazon Wins Ruling on Results for Searches on Brands It Doesn't Sell |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/amazon-wins-ruling-results-searches-brands-it-doesn-t-sell |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Foley & Lardner |date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> and reclassifying [[LGBT]] books as adult content.<ref>{{cite web |last=Slatterly |first=Brennon |title=Amazon 'Glitch' Yanks Sales Rank of Hundreds of LGBT Books |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/162996/amazon_glitch_yanks_sales_rank_of_hundreds_of_lgbt_books.html |work=PC World |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Paul |title=Amazon: 'Glitch' caused gay censorship error |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/14/amazon.gay.lesbian.ranking/ |publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 17, 2020 |date=April 14, 2009}}</ref> Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the [[WikiLeaks]] website, works containing [[Defamation|libel]] and material facilitating [[Dog fighting|dogfight]], [[cockfight]], or [[pedophilia|pedophile]] activities.

Amazon has introduced the Shipment Zero program, however Shipment Zero has only committed to reducing 50% of its shipments to net zero by 2030. Also, even that 50% does not necessarily mean a decrease in emissions compared to current levels given Amazon's rate of growth in orders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@amazonemployeesclimatejustice/amazon-employees-are-joining-the-global-climate-walkout-9-20-9bfa4cbb1ce3|title=Amazon employees are joining the Global Climate Walkout, 9/20|first=Amazon Employees for Climate|last=Justice|date=September 20, 2019|website=Medium}}</ref>

That said, Amazon's CEO has also signed the Climate Pledge, in which Amazon would meet the Paris climate agreement goals 10 years ahead of schedule, and would be carbon-neutral by 2040. Besides this pledge, it also ordered 100 000 electric delivery trucks from [[Rivian]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/technology/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund.html|title=Jeff Bezos Commits $10 Billion to Address Climate Change|first=Karen|last=Weise|date=February 17, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In November 2018, a community action group opposed the construction permit delivered to [[Goodman Group]] for the construction of a {{convert|160000|m2|sqft}} logisitics platform Amazon will operate at [[Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport]]. In February 2019, [[:fr:Étienne Tête|Étienne Tête]] filed a request on behalf of a second regional community action group asking the administrative court to decide whether the platform served a sufficiently important public interest to justify its environmental impact.

Amazon considered making an option for Prime customers to have packages delivered at the most efficient and environmentally-friendly time (allowing the company to combine shipments with the same destination) but decided against it out of fear customers might reduce purchases.<ref name="day">{{cite news |author=Matt Day |date=March 7, 2020 |title=Amazon nixed 'green' shipping proposal to avoid alienating shoppers |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon-nixed-green-shipping-proposal-to-avoid-alienating-shoppers/ |agency=Bloomberg}}</ref> Since 2019, the company has instead offered customer an "Amazon Day" option, where all orders are delivered on the same day, emphasizing customer convenience, and it occasionally offers Prime customers credits in return for selecting slower and less expensive shipping options.<ref name="day" />

=== Selling counterfeit, unsafe and discarded items ===
On October 16, 2016, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] provided evidence in a lawsuit against a third-party company that Amazon was selling counterfeit Apple products and advertising them as genuine. Through purchasing, Apple found that it was able to identify counterfeit products with a success rate of 90%. Amazon was sourcing and selling items without properly determining if they were genuine. The other company settled with Apple for an undisclosed amount on April 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2016/10/apple-sues-mobile-star-for-selling-counterfeit-power-adapters-and-charging-cables-through-amazon.html |title=Apple Sues Mobile Star for Selling Counterfeit Power Adapters and Charging Cables through Amazon |website=Patently Apple}}</ref>

The selling of counterfeit products by Amazon has attracted widespread notice, with both purchases marked as being fulfilled by third parties and those shipped directly from Amazon warehouses being found to be counterfeit. This has included some products sold directly by Amazon itself and marked as "ships from and sold by Amazon.com".<ref name="wapo">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/14/how-amazons-quest-more-cheaper-products-has-resulted-flea-market-fakes/ |title=How Amazon's quest for more, cheaper products has resulted in a flea market of fakes |first=Jay |last=Greene |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 14, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2020}}</ref><ref name=ForbesFuseChicken>{{cite web |last1=Shepard |first1=Wade |title=Fuse Chicken Vs.

One Amazon business practice that encourages counterfeiting is that, by default, seller accounts on Amazon are set to use "commingled inventory". With this practice, the goods that a seller sends to Amazon are mixed with those of the producer of the product and with those of all other sellers that supply what is supposed to be the same product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consumerist.com/2014/05/12/does-amazons-inventory-commingling-help-fake-products-fly-under-the-radar/ |work=[[Consumerist.com|Consumerist]] |first=Mary Beth |last=Quirk |title=Does Amazon's Inventory Commingling Help Fake Products Fly Under The Radar? |date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=ForbesProtect/> Then when a customer orders a product from a seller, Amazon ships out from its commingled pool of inventory according to its convenience for shipping rather than from what the seller sent to them for warehousing. According to a December 2017 article in [[Forbes.com|Forbes]], "This means that counterfeits can be commingled with authentic products, and not even Amazon (apparently) can easily determine where they came from. This gives an added level of protection to counterfeiters, as the smokescreen between them and the nefarious products they spike Amazon's supply chain with is often incredibly thick."<ref name=ForbesProtect>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/12/13/how-to-protect-your-family-from-dangerous-fakes-on-amazon-this-holiday-season/#30d23a3e7cf1 |first=Wade |last=Shepard |date=December 13, 2017 |access-date=August 29, 2020 |title=How To Avoid Dangerous Counterfeits On Amazon This Holiday Season |website=[[Forbes.com|Forbes]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.awesomedynamic.com/amazon-commingled-inventory/ |title=Amazon Commingled Inventory, Amazon Barcode {{!}} Which is Right for You? |work=Awesome Dynamic |access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref>

In August 2019, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that they had found more than 4,000 items for sale on Amazon's site that had been declared unsafe by federal agencies, had misleading labels, or had been banned by federal regulators.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-has-ceded-control-of-its-site-the-result-thousands-of-banned-unsafe-or-mislabeled-products-11566564990?shareToken=stf528a8da601e4017bdfc2faa508e09a2 |title=Amazon Has Ceded Control of Its Site.

In the wake of the ''WSJ'' investigation, three U.S. senators{{snd}} [[Richard Blumenthal]], [[Ed Markey]], and [[Bob Menendez]]{{snd}}sent an open letter to Jeff Bezos demanding him to take action about the selling of unsafe items on the site. The letter said that "Unquestionably, Amazon is falling short of its commitment to keeping safe those consumers who use its massive platform."<ref name=SenatorsAsk/> The letter included a number of questions about the company's practices and gave Bezos a deadline to respond by September 29, 2019, saying "We call on you to immediately remove from the platform all the problematic products examined in the recent ''WSJ'' report; explain how you are going about this process; conduct a sweeping internal investigation of your enforcement and consumer safety policies; and institute changes that will continue to keep unsafe products off your platform."<ref name=SenatorsAsk>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/senators-ask-jeff-bezos-to-crack-down-on-unsafe-products-on-amazon.html |website=[[CNBC]] |first=Annie |last=Palmer |title=Senators ask Jeff Bezos to crack down on thousands of unsafe products on Amazon |date=August 29, 2019 |access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref> Earlier in the same month, senators Blumenthal and Menendez had sent Bezos a letter about the ''Buzzfeed'' report.<ref name=SenatorsAsk/>

In December 2019, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that some people were literally retrieving trash out of dumpsters and selling it as new products on Amazon. The reporters ran an experiment and determined that it was easy for a seller to set up an account and sell cleaned up junk as new products. In addition to trash, sellers were obtaining inventory from clearance bins, thrift stores, and pawn shops.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-might-be-buying-trash-on-amazonliterally-11576599910?mod=e2twd |title=You Might Be Buying Trash on Amazon – Literally |date=December 18, 2019 |first1=Khadeeja |last1=Safdar |first2=Shane |last2=Shifflett |first3=Denise |last3=Blostein |access-date=August 29, 2020 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.komando.com/news/amazon-sells-literal-trash/697331/ |work=[[Komando.com]] |first=Mark |last=Jones |title=Shocking report finds dumpster divers selling trash on Amazon |date=December 19, 2019 |access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref>

=== Sales and use taxes ===
{{Main|Amazon tax}}
Amazon's state sales tax collection policy has changed over the years since it did not collect any sales taxes in its early years. In the U.S., [[Sales taxes in the United States|state and local sales taxes]] are levied by state and local governments, not at the federal level. In most countries where Amazon operates, a sales tax or [[value added tax]] is uniform throughout the country, and Amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers. Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anticompetitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.<ref name="Bloomberg/BusinessWeek">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2011/sb20110428_074924.htm |title=To Help Main Street, Close the Internet Sales Tax Loophole |last=Milchen |first=Jeff |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315102652/http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2011/sb20110428_074924.htm |archive-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref>

Many U.S. states in the 21st century have passed [[online shopping]] sales tax laws designed to compel Amazon.com and other [[e-commerce]] retailers to collect state and local sales taxes from its customers. Amazon.com originally collected sales tax only from five states {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, but {{as of|2017|April|lc=y}}, Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a state sales tax and in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15055662/amazon-us-sales-tax-collection-all-states |title=Amazon will start collecting sales tax nationwide starting April 1st |website=The Verge |accessdate=April 6, 2017}}</ref>

In early 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] repeatedly criticized Amazon's use of the [[United States Postal Service]] and its prices for the delivery of packages, stating, "I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy," Trump tweeted. "Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them {{Sic|bourne}} by the American Taxpayer."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/03/amazon-shares-turn-negative-after-trump-bashes-company-for-a-fourth-time-in-a-week.html |title=Amazon shares turn negative after Trump bashes company for a fourth time in a week |last=Franck |first=Thomas |date=April 3, 2018 |work=CNBC|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>  Amazon's shares fell by 6 percent as a result of Trump's comments.  [[Shepard Smith]] of [[Fox News]] disputed Trump's claims and pointed to evidence that the USPS was offering below-market prices to all customers with no advantage to Amazon.  However, analyst Tom Forte pointed to the fact that Amazon's payments to the USPS are not made public and that their contract has a reputation for being "a sweetheart deal".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-trump/amazon-shares-fall-6-percent-as-trump-renews-attack-idUSKCN1H9185 |title=Amazon shares fall 6 percent as Trump renews attack |last=Editorial |first=Reuters |work=U.S.|access-date=April 3, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/381542-foxs-shep-smith-fact-checks-trumps-amazon-claims-none-of-that-was-true |title=Fox's Shep Smith fact-checks Trump's Amazon claims: 'None of that was true' |last=Manchester |first=Julia |work=The Hill|access-date=April 3, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Opposition to trade unions ===
[[File:Anti-Amazon sticker.jpg|thumb|A sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.]]
Amazon has opposed efforts by [[trade union]]s to organize in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2001, 850 employees in Seattle were laid off by Amazon.com after a unionization drive. The Washington Alliance of Technological Workers (WashTech) accused the company of violating union laws, and claimed Amazon managers subjected them to intimidation and heavy propaganda. Amazon denied any link between the unionization effort and layoffs.<ref name="Independent">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010203/ai_n14364804|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410033727/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010203/ai_n14364804|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 10, 2008|title=Short shrift for unions in Amazon's silicon jungle – Independent, The (London) – Find Articles at BNET.com|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=September 23, 2017}}</ref> Also in 2001, Amazon.co.uk hired a US management consultancy organization, [[The Burke Group]], to assist in defeating a campaign by the [[Graphical, Paper and Media Union]] (GPMU, now part of [[Unite the Union]]) to achieve recognition in the [[Milton Keynes]] distribution depot.

Some workers, "pickers", who travel the building with a trolley and a handheld scanner "picking" customer orders can walk up to 15 miles during their workday and if they fall behind on their targets, they can be reprimanded.

In a German television report broadcast in February 2013, journalists Diana Löbl and Peter Onneken conducted a covert investigation at the distribution center of Amazon in the town of [[Bad Hersfeld]] in the German state of [[Hessen]].

In March 2015, it was reported in ''[[The Verge]]'' that Amazon would be removing [[non-compete clause]]s of 18 months in length from its US employment contracts for hourly-paid workers, after criticism that it was acting unreasonably in preventing such employees from finding other work.

=== Seattle head tax and houselessness services ===
In May 2018, Amazon threatened the [[Seattle City Council]] over an [[Seattle head tax|employee head tax proposal]] that would have funded houselessness services and low-income housing. The tax would have cost Amazon about $800 per employee, or 0.7% of their average salary.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-pauses-plans-for-seattle-office-towers-while-city-council-considers-business-tax/|title=Amazon puts high-profile Seattle plans on ice over proposal to tax large employers|date=May 2, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=May 3, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In retaliation, Amazon paused construction on a new building, threatened to limit further investment in the city, and funded a repeal campaign. Although originally passed, the measure was soon repealed after an expensive repeal campaign spearheaded by Amazon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/business-backed-opponents-of-seattle-head-tax-outspent-supporters-2-to-1/|title='Show of force': Business-backed opponents of Seattle head tax outspent supporters 2 to 1|date=July 13, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=July 17, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Nashville Operations Center of Excellence===
The incentives given by the [[Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County]] to Amazon for their new Operations Center of Excellence in [[Nashville Yards]], a site owned by developer [[Southwest Value Partners]], have been controversial, including the decision by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development to keep the full extent of the agreement secret.<ref name="tenneseanwantstokeepits">{{cite news |last1=Reicher |first1=Mike |title=Tennessee wants to keep its incentives offer for Amazon's HQ2 secret for 5 years |url=https://tennessean.com/story/news/2019/01/04/tennessee-amazon-incentives-kept-secret-five-years-public-records-original-pitch/2482548002/ |accessdate=January 6, 2019 |work=The Tennessean |date=January 4, 2019}}</ref> The incentives include "$102 million in combined grants and tax credits for a scaled-down Amazon office building" as well as "a $65 million cash grant for capital expenditures" in exchange for the creation of 5,000 jobs over seven years.<ref name="tenneseanwantstokeepits"/>

The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government called for more transparency.<ref name="tenneseanwantstokeepits"/> Another local organization known as the People's Alliance for Transit, Housing, and Employment (PATHE) suggested no public money should be given to Amazon; instead, it should be spent on building more public housing for the working poor and the homeless and investing in more public transportation for Nashvillians.<ref name="tntribunewillamazonbe">{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Peter |title=Will Amazon be Naughty or Nice? |url=https://tntribune.com/community/local/nashville/will-amazon-be-naughty-or-nice/ |accessdate=December 21, 2018 |work=Tennessee Tribune |date=December 13, 2018|quote=PATHE does not want Metro to give Amazon a dime.

=== Facial recognition technology and law enforcement ===
While Amazon has publicly opposed secret government surveillance, as revealed by Freedom of Information Act requests it has supplied [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] support to law enforcement in the form of the [[Amazon Rekognition|Rekognition]] technology and consulting services. Initial testing included the city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida, and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]], Oregon. Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition and a body camera manufacturer. These ventures are opposed by a coalition of civil rights groups with concern that they could lead to an expansion of surveillance and be prone to abuse. Specifically, it could automate the identification and tracking of anyone, particularly in the context of potential police body camera integration.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/yes-amazon-is-tracking-people-and-sending-their-data-to-police|title=Yes, Amazon is tracking people|website=Washingtonexaminer.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazon-teams-government-deploy-dangerous-new|title=Amazon Teams Up With Government to Deploy Dangerous New Facial Recognition Technology|website=Aclu.org}}</ref> Because of the backlash, the city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] publicly stated it will no longer use the technology, but may revisit this decision at a later date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/orlando-stops-using-amazons-facial-recognition-tech-996057|title=Orlando Stops Using Amazon's Face-Scanning Tech Amid Spying Concerns|website=Newsweek.com|date=June 26, 2018|language=en-USA}}</ref>

=== Access to NHS data ===
The UK government awarded Amazon a contract that gives the company free access to information about healthcare published by the UK's National Health Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3298/alexa-what-hidden-behind-your-contract-nhs|title=Alexa, what is hidden behind your contract with the NHS?|date=December 6, 2019|website=Privacy International|access-date=January 24, 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125112306/https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3298/alexa-what-hidden-behind-your-contract-nhs|archive-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>  This will, for example, be used by Amazon's Alexa to answer medical questions, although Alexa also uses many other sources of information.  The material, which excludes patient data, could also allow the company to make, advertise and sell its own products.  The contract allows Amazon access to information on symptoms, causes and definitions of conditions, and "all related copyrightable content and data and other materials".  Amazon can then create "new products, applications, cloud-based services and/or distributed software", which the NHS will not benefit from financially.  The company can also share the information with third parties.  The government said that allowing Alexa devices to offer expert health advice to users will reduce pressure on doctors and pharmacists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/08/nhs-gives-amazon-free-use-of-health-data-under-alexa-advice-deal|title=NHS gives Amazon free use of health data under Alexa advice deal|date=December 8, 2019|website=The Guardian|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>

===Collection of data and surveillance===
On February 17, 2020, a ''[[Panorama (British TV programme)|Panorama]]'' documentary highlighted the amount of data collected by the company and the move into surveillance causing concerns of politicians and regulators in the US and Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000fjdz/panorama-amazon-what-they-know-about-us|title=Panorama - Amazon: What They Know About Us|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbc.co.uk/news/extra/CLQYZENMBI/amazon-data|title=Amazon: How Bezos built his data machine|website=BBC News}}</ref>

=== EU antitrust charges ===

On June 11, 2020, the [[European Union]] announced that it will be pressing charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party e-commerce sellers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-face-antitrust-charges-from-eu-over-treatment-of-third-party-sellers-11591871818?mod=business_lead_pos1|title=Amazon to Face Antitrust Charges From EU Over Treatment of Third-Party Selles|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|last1=Pop|first1=Valentina|last2=Schechner|first2=Sam|date=June 11, 2020|accessdate=June 11, 2020}}</ref>

==== Quashing competitors ====
In July 2020, Amazon along with other tech giants [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] were accused of maintaining harmful power and anti-competitive strategies to quash potential competitors in the market.<ref>{{Cite news|date=July 30, 2020|title=Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' power|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53583941|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref> The CEOs of respective firms appeared in a teleconference on July 29, 2020 before the lawmakers of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law|U.S. House Antitrust Subcommittee]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Business|first=Brian Fung, CNN|title=Congress grilled the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.

=== Anti-vaccination and non-scientific cancer 'cures' ===
Anti-vaccination and non evidence-based cancer 'cures' have routinely appeared high in Amazon's books and videos. This may be due to positive reviews posted by supporters of untested methods, or gaming of the algorithms by [[Conspiracy theory|truther]] communities, rather than any intent on Amazon's part.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Naughton|first=John|date=August 8, 2020|title=How Amazon puts misinformation at the top of your reading list|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/08/amazon-algorithm-curated-misinformation-books-data|access-date=August 11, 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=May 3, 2019|title=How Amazon's Algorithms Curated a Dystopian Bookstore|url=https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-and-the-spread-of-health-misinformation/|access-date=May 11, 2020|website=Wired}}</ref>

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) expressed concern that Amazon was “surfacing and recommending products and content that discourage parents from vaccinating their children.” Amazon subsequently removed five anti-vaccination documentaries.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 1, 2019|title=House Rep.

This followed an NBC News report about parents who used it in a misguided attempt to reverse their children's autism.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 28, 2019|title=Amazon removes books promoting dangerous bleach 'cures' for autism and other conditions|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/amazon-removes-books-promoting-dangerous-bleach-cures-autism-other-illnesses-n1010861|access-date=August 11, 2020|website=NBC News}}</ref>

== Response to COVID-19 pandemic ==

=== Hazard pay and overtime ===
Amazon introduced new policies to reward frontline workers for continuing to come into work during the crisis. One of these policies, announced on March 16, 2020 was a temporary $2-per-hour rise in pay. This policy expired in June 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rey|first=Jason Del|date=May 13, 2020|title=Amazon extends bonus pay for front-line workers but says it ends in June|url=https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/13/21256756/amazon-pay-increases-frontline-warehouse-workers-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-may|access-date=June 3, 2020|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref> Amazon also announced a policy of unlimited, unpaid time off that lasted until April 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Davis|first=Charles|title=Amazon set to end 'unlimited unpaid time off' policy|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-set-to-end-unlimited-unpaid-time-off-policy-2020-4|access-date=June 3, 2020|website=Business Insider}}</ref>

=== Additional hiring as a result of pandemic ===
In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Amazon introduced temporary restrictions on the sale of non-essential goods. In March 2020, it hired some 100,000 more staff in the US to help deal with essential items such as food and medical equipment. It also reported that it was so busy that it was unable to bring on board new customers and therefore had to have a waiting list. In April, the firm announced that it was going to hire up to 75,000 workers to help deal with increased demand.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52276149|title=Amazon hiring spree as orders surge under lockdown|date=April 14, 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=April 14, 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Employee protests during COVID-19 ===

During the pandemic there have been protests by the Amazon workers at warehouses in the US, France, and Italy. The BBC reported that there were confirmed coronavirus cases in more than 50 locations.<ref name="auto"/> The reason for the protests is the company policy to "run normal shifts" despite many positive cases of the virus.<ref name=FTMarch19/> According to the [[UNI Global Union]], "Amazon cannot act like this is business as usual. We are facing a deadly virus that has already taken the lives of thousands of people and paralyzed the world's economy.

A group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos in March 2020, expressing concerns about worker safety.<ref name=TheVergeMarch31/>

An Amazon warehouse protest on March 30, 2020, in [[Staten Island]] led to its organizer, Christian Smalls, being fired. Amazon defended the decision by saying that Smalls was supposed to be in self-isolation at the time and leading the protest put its other workers at risk.<ref name=BBCMarch31/> Smalls has called this response "ridiculous".<ref name=CommonDreamsMarch31/> The New York state attorney general, [[Letitia James]], is considering legal retaliation to the firing which she called "immoral and inhumane."<ref name=BBCMarch31>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52096273|title=Amazon workers strike over virus protection|date=March 31, 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=March 31, 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref> She also asked the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to investigate Smalls' firing.

On May 4, Amazon vice president [[Tim Bray]] resigned "in dismay" over the firing of whistle-blower employees who spoke out about the lack of COVID-19 protections, including shortages of face masks and failure to implement widespread temperature checks which were promised by the company. He said that the firings were "chickenshit" and "designed to create a climate of fear" in Amazon warehouses.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paul |first=Kari |date=May 4, 2020 |title=Amazon executive resigns over company's 'chickenshit' firings of employee activists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref>

In a Q1 2020 financial report, Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon expects to spend $4&nbsp;billion or more (predicted operating profit for Q2) on COVID-19-related issues: personal protective equipment, higher wages for hourly teams, cleaning for facilities, and expanding Amazon's COVID-19 testing capabilities.

=== Closure in France ===

The [[Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques|SUD]] (trade unions) brought a court case against Amazon for unsafe working conditions. This resulted in a French district court ([[Nanterre]]) ruling on April 15, 2020, ordering the company to limit its deliveries to food and essential medical or hygienic products or pay a €1&nbsp;million  per day fine.  Amazon said it would appeal, and on the following day shut its six French warehouses until at least April 21, 2020, for evaluation of the situation.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Le Figaro|language=fr|date=April 16, 2020|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/amazon-menace-de-suspendre-l-activite-de-ses-centres-en-france-20200415|title=Amazon ferme ses entrepôts pour cinq jours en France|author=Olivia Détroyat}}</ref>

== Lobbying ==
Amazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and [[Information privacy|data protection]] and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the [[United States Congress]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5&nbsp;million, $5&nbsp;million and $9.5&nbsp;million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amazon's Lobbying Expenditures |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000023883|website=Opensecrets.org}}</ref>
