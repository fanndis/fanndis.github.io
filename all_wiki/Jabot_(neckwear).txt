A '''jabot''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Jabot.ogg|ʒ|æ|ˈ|b|oʊ}}; from [[French language|French]] ''jabot'': a [[Crop (anatomy)|bird's crop]]) is a decorative clothing accessory consisting of [[lace]] or other fabric falling from the throat, suspended from or attached to a neckband or collar; or simply pinned at the throat. It evolved from the [[frilling]] or ruffles decorating the front of a shirt in the 19th century.<ref>Caulfeild, S. F. A. ''Encyclopedia of Victorian Needlework, [Dictionary of Needlework]''. A. W. Cowan, London, 1882, (facsimile edition, Dover Publications, NY, 1972) v. I A–L, p. 274.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

==History==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, a jabot consisted of [[cambric]] or [[lace]] edging sewn to both sides of the front opening of a man's shirt, partially visible through a [[vest]]/[[waistcoat]] worn over it. This style arose around 1650. Jabots made of lace and hanging loose from the neck were an essential component of upper class, male fashion in the baroque period.  

In the late 19th century a jabot would be a cambric or lace bib, for decorating women's clothing. It would be held in place at the neck with a brooch or a sewn-on neckband.

Jabots survive in the present as components of various official costumes. The white bibs of judges of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are officially described as jabots, as are those worn by judges and [[counsel]] throughout Australian courts. Jabots are prescribed attire for [[barrister]]s appearing before the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]].

French magistrate court dress and French [[academic dress]] include a jabot, called ''rabat''. It is usually of plain cotton, except that of academic high officials, which is made of lace. Jabots are worn by the judges and Advocates General of the Court of Justice of the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7026/|title=CURIA – Presentation of the Members – Court of Justice of the European Union|website=curia.europa.eu}}</ref>

In the United States Supreme Court, jabots are worn by some female justices, but are not mandatory.  Both [[United States Supreme Court]] Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] often wear jabots with their judicial robes;<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=The Newest Justice Takes Her Seat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/us/politics/09scotus.html|accessdate=2018-04-06|work=The New York Times|date=8 September 2009}}</ref> Justice [[Elena Kagan]], in contrast, does not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joshblackman.com/blog/?p=5792|title=Kagan on not wearing a Neck Doily – "In my real life I’m not a frilly, lacy person"|publisher=Joshblackman.com|date=2010-12-27|accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref>

Her favorite jabot (woven with white beads) was from Cape Town, South Africa. <ref name="yahoo1"/><ref name="makers1"/> The [[Speaker of the  House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] traditionally wears a jabot along with a black silk and gold lace robe and lace cuffs when in ceremonial dress.

Jabots continue to be worn as part of the highest formal Scottish evening attire and a former part of [[Scottish highland dance]] costumes from the 1930s to the 1970s. They are usually worn with high-necked jackets or doublets (Sheriffmuir or Montrose), often with matching cuffs for both genders and a [[fly plaid]] of the same tartan as the kilt, draped over-the-shoulder for men. Since the 1970s, a white jabot has been part of the blue and white concert costume of South Africa's [[Drakensberg Boys' Choir]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The jabot is part of the vestment of a [[verger]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The jabot is also part of the ceremonial uniform of girl [[Queen's Scholars]] at [[Westminster School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westminster.org.uk/westminster-elects-the-first-female-queens-scholars/|title=WESTMINSTER ELECTS THE FIRST FEMALE QUEEN’S SCHOLARS|publisher=www.westminster.org.uk|date=2017-09-20|accessdate=2019-03-04}}</ref>
