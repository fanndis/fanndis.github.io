Komen's philosophy mixes education, action, research, and community involvement.

Many scientific reviews have criticized Komen for overpromoting mammography. They concluded that indiscriminate [[Breast cancer screening#Mammography|screening mammography]] for middle-aged and older women, regardless of each woman's risk of developing breast cancer, results in [[Unnecessary health care|overtreatment]] of some women whose cancer would never harm them. For every woman whose life is saved by screening mammography, 250 to 500 will be told that they might have breast cancer when they don't ([[False positives and false negatives|false positives]]), 125 to 250 will have biopsies performed, and between two and ten will receive unnecessary treatment.<ref>{{cite book|author=Welch, H.

Other organizations like the [[National Breast Cancer Coalition]] follow a "medical consumerism" model in which physicians educate women about their options and encourage them to make individualized, [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] decisions about their health care.<ref name="Suliksplit" /> Other organizations advocate more research into the environmental causes of breast cancer and [[cancer prevention]].<ref name="Suliksplit">Sulik, 2010. pages 52–53.</ref>

In addition to funding research, Komen and its affiliates fund non-duplicative, community-based breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment projects for the medically underserved.<ref name="Grants" />

Since 1992, Komen has also annually awarded work in the field of cancer research with the [[Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction]].

In recent years, Komen has cut by nearly half the proportion of fund-raising dollars it spends on research grants, according to a 2012 [[Reuters]] analysis. In 2011, the foundation spent $63 million (15%) of its donations on research grants and awards.<ref name="REUTERS"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdf.reuters.com/pdfnews/pdfnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=2012_02_06_06_47_88922e0de0044de08a8946f8442db305_PRIMARY.gif|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709175058/http://pdf.reuters.com/pdfnews/pdfnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=2012_02_06_06_47_88922e0de0044de08a8946f8442db305_PRIMARY.gif|url-status=dead|title=pdfnews.asp (550x442 pixels)|date=July 9, 2012|archive-date=July 9, 2012|website=Archive.is|access-date=May 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150318061214/http://ww5.komen.org/404.aspx] </ref>

==Fundraising==
===Cause marketing===
Komen raises over $36 million a year from over 60 [[cause marketing]] partnerships. These include prominent campaigns, such as those with [[Yoplait]], which runs the Save Lids to Save Lives program, and a partnership with [[Delta Air Lines]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130501091301/http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/about-delta/corporate-responsibility/force-for-global-good/breast-cancer-research-foundation.html] </ref>

Cause marketing allows Komen to associate the breast cancer [[brand]] with its organization. By promoting the "fear, hope and goodness" associated with the brand, Komen can promote itself, breast cancer awareness, its sponsoring corporations, and [[Ethical consumerism#Related concepts|conscientious consumption]].<ref>Sulik, 2010. pages 133-146.</ref>

The first race was run in [[Dallas, Texas]] in 1983, with 800 participants.<ref>[http://cms.komen.org/Komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm Susan G.

The race's primary source of revenue is donations collected by the participants. In 2011, Komen said that three-quarters of the event's proceeds were being used locally to pay for community outreach programs, breast health education, and [[breast cancer screening]] and treatment projects run by the Komen affiliate, with the remaining quarter sent to the central organization.<ref name=Iam>[http://www.iamthecure.org/about.aspx About Us], Komen's "I am the Cure" website, accessed June 10, 2011.</ref>

==Controversy and criticism==

===Pinkwashing===
{{Anchor|Pinkwashing in cause marketing}}
{{Main|Pinkwashing (breast cancer)}}
Komen is a key entity in the controversy over "pinkwashing". The term has been used to describe two different situations: (1) organizations getting disproportionate publicity for donating very little, and (2) organizations that use the [[pink ribbon]] to promote products that may be [[carcinogen]]ic.

Some campaigns require that consumers mail [[proof of purchase]] for a promoted item before the manufacturer donates a few cents per purchase to charity; some have a cap on the maximum amount donated, with all sales beyond this limit benefiting only the company, not the promoted cause.<ref name="boston1">{{cite news|first=Kris|last=Freiswick|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2009/10/04/sick_of_pink/ |title=Sick of pink |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=October 4, 2009 |accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>

Komen says that the organization protects its trademarks as a matter of financial stewardship to prevent confusion among donors; others suggest that the trademark issue is more about dominating the pink ribbon market.<ref>Sulik, 2010, pp. 146–150.</ref>

===Embryonic stem cell research===

In 2006, Komen wrote in its newsletter that embryonic stem cell research had promise for curing breast cancer.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://motherjones.com/files/cancer_stem_cell_research_shows_promise.pdf|title=Cancer Stem Cell Research Shows Promise (Komen's frontline newsletter, Fall 2006)|website=Motherjones.com|accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref> One such grant recipient was Robert A.

In 2012, Komen said that it did not fund stem cell research and never has. LifeNews.com then published an article saying that Komen had ''stopped'' funding stem cell research.
