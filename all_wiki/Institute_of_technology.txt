An '''institute of technology''' (also referred to as: '''technological university''', '''technical university''', '''university of technology''', '''technological educational institute''', '''technical college''', '''polytechnic university''' or just '''polytechnic''') is an institution of [[tertiary education]] (such as a [[university]] or [[college]]) that specializes in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[applied science]], and [[natural sciences]].

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after [[World War II]] with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by [[industrialization]]. The world's first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/uni/univ/booklet/MandU.html | title = Misckolc and the University | publisher = Miskolci Egyetem (University of Miskolci) | access-date = 29 October 2017}}{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}</ref>), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in [[Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Slovakia]]), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], founded in 1745 as "Collegium Carolinum". Another exception is the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', which has educated [[France|French]] ''élites'' since its foundation in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey, institutes of technology are institutions of [[higher education]] and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the [[Istanbul Technical University]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[İYTE]], [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[RWTH Aachen]], all considered universities.

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation).  Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in [[Science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[PhD]] that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. In 1992 UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term "institute of technology" is the more favored synonym of a "[[regional technical college]]" though the latter is the legally correct term; however, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | title = Report of the Delegated Authority Evaluation Group on the Cork Institute of Technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200434/http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | archive-date=September 12, 2008 | format = PDF | date = June 2005 | author = Evaluation Group for the Delegation of Authority to Make Awards | publisher = Higher Education and Training Awards Council}}</ref> and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level — Level 9 of the Republic of Ireland's National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) — for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history.  In many cases "polytechnic" were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an "institute of technology". A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like "institute of technology", "polytechnic university", "[[university of applied sciences]]" or "university of technology" for marketing purposes.<ref>{{Cite news

===Argentina===
{{See also|Education in Argentina|List of universities in Argentina}}

In the so-called ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the main higher institution advocates to the study of technology is the [[National Technological University]] which has brand ramifications through all the country geographic space in the way of ''Regional Faculties''. The [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]] (ITBA) is other important recognized institute of technology with renowned and prestige in the country.

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia|Technical and Further Education|College of Advanced Education|Category:Australian tertiary institutions}}

;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both [[vocational education|vocational]] and higher education. They were part of the [[College of advanced education|College of Advanced Education]] system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the [[Australian Technology Network]] a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the [[Melbourne Polytechnic]] rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE.<ref>Kylie Adoranti, Herald Sun, 3 October 2014 ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/northern-melbourne-institute-of-tafe-to-be-rebranded-as-melbourne-polytechnic/story-fnglekhp-1227078125350 Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to be rebranded as Melbourne Polytechnic]'', Retrieved 2 December 2014</ref> These primarily offer [[vocational education]], although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor's degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In 2009, the old college system in Tasmania and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated universities of technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase "university of technology", such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability – most important of all – to confer doctorates):
* [[Curtin University]], [[Western Australia]]
* [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Queensland]]
* [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[Swinburne University of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[University of Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[University of South Australia]], [[South Australia]]
* [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]

* [[University of Innsbruck]] (Faculty of Civil Engineering founded 1969)
* [[Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt]] (Faculty of Technical Sciences founded 2007)

;Fachhochschulen
'''[[Fachhochschule]]''' is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 Fachhochschulen in Austria<ref>{{cite web|author=Mokka Medienagentur GmbH |url=http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |title=Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung: Fachhochschulen |publisher=Bmwf.gv.at |access-date=2014-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119223842/http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |archive-date=January 19, 2014 }}</ref>

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there are four technical universities, jointly known as 4TU:

* [[Delft University of Technology]] (TU Delft)
* [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] (TU Eindhoven)
* [[Universiteit Twente]] (U Twente)
* [[Wageningen University]] (Wageningen U)

In [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]], ''Hogescholen'' or ''Hautes écoles'' (also translated into ''colleges'', ''university colleges'' or ''universities of applied science'') are applied institutes of higher education that do not award doctorates and do not focus on research but some research does happen. They are generally limited to Bachelor-level education, with degrees called professional bachelors, and only minor Master's programmes. The hogeschool thus has many similarities to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas and to the ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' in Finland. A list of all ''hogescholen'' in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found at the end of this [[List of universities in the Netherlands#Universities of applied sciences|list]].

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, institutes of technology / polytechnic institutes and universities that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to engineering and applied science degrees, apprenticeship and trade programs, certificates and diplomas. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions belonging to a national university and offer select technical and engineering programs. Colleges, institutes of technology / polytechnic institutes and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity or industry sources.

Some of Canada's most esteemed colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of [[Polytechnics Canada]], a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

;Affiliate schools

;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), [[Diplomi-insinööri]] M.Sc. (Tech.), Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*[[Aalto University]], formed from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and other universities
*[[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
*[[Tampere University of Technology]]

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. ''[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' is the common term in [[Finland]], as is the Swedish alternative "''yrkeshögskola''" – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance ''insinööri'', engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor's degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master's degrees (Master of Engineering).  After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term "polytechnic" to the term "university of applied sciences" in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the ''hogeschool'' in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*[[Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Tampere University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]]

A complete list may be found in [[List of polytechnics in Finland]].

==={{anchor|France}}France and Francophone regions===
;Instituts de technologie (grandes écoles)
[[Collegiate universities]] grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French [[grandes écoles]] provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]
* [[Centrale Graduate School]]
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]
* [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]
* [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]]
* [[Paris Institute of Technology]]
* ESTIA Institute of Technology
They provide science and technology master's degrees and doctoral degrees.

;''Universités technologiques / instituts universitaires de technologie'' / polytechs
The universities of technology (French: ''universités de technologie'') are public institutions awarding degrees and diplomas that are accredited by the [[French Ministry of Higher Education and Research]].  Although called "universities", the universities of technology are in fact non-university institutes (''écoles extérieures aux universités''), as defined by Chapter I, Section II (Articles 34 through 36) of French law 84-52 of 26 January 1984 regarding higher education (the ''loi Savary'').

They possess the advantage of combining all the assets of the engineering [[Grande école|Grandes Écoles]] and those of universities as they develop simultaneously and coherently three missions: [[Education]], [[Research]], [[Transfer of technology]].
They maintain close links with the industrial world both on national and international levels and they are reputed for their ability to innovate, adapt and provide an education that matches the ever-changing demands of industry{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

This network includes three institutions:
* [[Université de technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard|The University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard (''Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard'' or UTBM)]]
* [[University of Technology of Compiègne|The University of Technology of Compiègne (''Université de Technologie de Compiègne'' or UTC)]]
* [[University of Technology of Troyes|The University of Technology of Troyes (''Université de Technologie de Troyes'' or UTT)]]

In addition, France's education system includes many institutes of technology, embedded within most French universities. They are referred-to as ''[[institut universitaire de technologie]]'' (IUT). Instituts universitaires de technologie provide undergraduate technology curricula. 'Polytech institutes', embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term ''haute école specialisée'' for a type of institution called ''Fachhochschule'' in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French ''[[École polytechnique]]''. Such terms include ''Écoles Polytechniques'' (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In [[French language]], higher education refers to ''écoles polytechniques'', providing science and engineering curricula:
* [[École polytechnique]] or '''X''' (near [[Paris]])
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* [[École polytechnique de Montréal]]
* [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]]

;Fachhochschule
{{Main|Fachhochschule}}

''Fachhochschulen'' were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 ''Fachhochschulen'' in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/AktuellZusatz, templateId=renderPrint.psml#Fussnote1|title=Startseite&nbsp;-&nbsp;Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de}}</ref> See the [[:de:Liste der Fachhochschulen in Deutschland|German Wikipedia]] for a list.

;Technische Universität
{{main|Technische Universität}}
''Technische Universität'' (abbreviation: ''TU'') is the common term for universities of technology or technical university. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned ''Technische Universitäten'' in Germany have formed [[TU9|TU9 German Institutes of Technology]] as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] ([[Klinikum Aachen]], University Hospital Dresden, [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]]).

There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The four states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are not operating a ''Technische Universität''. [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Saxony]] have the highest counts of ''TUs'', while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Greece===
Greece has [[Polytechnic (Greece)|Technical Universities]] (also known as Polytechnic Universities) with 5 years of study legally equivalent to Bachelor's and master's degree 300 ECTS, ISCED 7 and has the full professional rights of the Engineer. and had [[List of universities in Greece#Technological educational institutes|Technological Educational Institutes]] (TEIs) (1982–2019) also known as Higher Educational Institute of Technology, Technological Institute, Institute of Technology (provides at least 4-year undergraduate degree qualification πτυχίο, Latinised version: Ptychion, in line with the [[Bologna Process]] legally equivalent to Bachelor's honours degree 240 ECTS, ISCED 6. Previoulsy it was three and a half years studies from 1983 to 1995, 210 ECTS). All the Technical Universities and Technological Educational Institutes are [[List of universities in Greece|Higher Education Institutions]] (HEIs) with university title (UT) and degree awarding powers (DAPs). TEIs existed from 1983 to 2019; they were reformed between 2013 and 2019 and their departments incorporated into existing higher education institutions (HEIs).

The two Polytechnic Universities (Technical Universities) in Greece (Greek: Πολυτεχνείο) are the  [[National Technical University of Athens]]  and the  [[Technical University of Crete]].<ref>https://www.anavasis.gr/blog/ta-polytexneia-kai-oi-polytexnikes-sxoles</ref> However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering that provides an equivalent diploma of engineerings with an integrated master and the full professional rights as well.

Many TEIs that got dismantled created engineering faculty with 5 years of study and 300 ECTS, ISCED 6. But those faculty are not under the general term of Polytechnics nor they have an integrated master's degree yet waiting evaluation<ref>https://www.foititikanea.gr/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%B1/%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%85%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82-%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%CF%82/20006-%CE%BE%CE%B5%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%B5%CE%B9-%CE%B7-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%BC%CE%B5-%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%82-%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AF%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B9%CF%87%CE%B5%CF%82-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82</ref> to be characterised as equivalent.

In Greece, all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are [[public university]] owned and government-funded, with [[free education]] undergraduate programmes that can be attended without any payment of tuition fee. About 1 out of 4 (one-fourth of) HEIs postgraduate programmes are offered free without any payment of tuition fee, especially about a 30% percentage of students can be entitled without tuition fee to attend all the HEIs statutory tuition fee postgraduate programmes after they be assessed on an individual basis of determined criteria as set out in the Ministry of Education.

===Hong Kong===

The first polytechnic in [[Hong Kong]] is The Hong Kong Polytechnic, established in 1972 through upgrading the Hong Kong Technical College (Government Trade School before 1947). The second polytechnic, the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, was founded in 1984. These polytechnics awards [[diploma]]s, [[higher diploma]]s, as well as academic degrees. Like the [[United Kingdom]], the two polytechnics were granted university status in 1994 and renamed [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University|The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] and the [[City University of Hong Kong]] respectively. [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], a university with a focus in applied science, engineering and business, was founded in 1991.

===Ireland===
{{see |Institutes of technology in Ireland}}

An "Institute of Technology" was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation '''IT''' is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and masters level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year [[Higher Certificate]] programme in various academic fields of study.  Some institutions have "delegated authority" that allows them to make doctoral awards in their own name, after authorisation by the [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]].

[[Dublin Institute of Technology]] developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the [[University of Dublin, Trinity College]] it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member of the T.U. Dublin.

The Technological Higher Education Association is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.<ref>http://www.thea.ie</ref>

In [[Italy]], the term "technical institute" generally refers to a [[secondary education in Italy|secondary school]] which offers a five-year course granting the access to the university system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandidizionari.it/Dizionario_Italiano/parola/t/tecnico.aspx?query=tecnico|title=TECNICO - Dizionario Italiano online Hoepli - Parola, significato e traduzione|work=dizionari.hoepli.it/}}</ref>

In [[higher education in Italy|higher education]], ''Politecnico'' refers to a technical university awarding bachelor, master and PhD degrees in engineering. Historically there were two ''Politecnici'', one in each of the two largest industrial cities of the north:
* [[Politecnico di Torino]], established 1859;
* [[Politecnico di Milano]], established 1863.
A third ''Politecnico'' was added in the south in 1990:
* [[Politecnico di Bari]], established 1990.
However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering.

In 2003, the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)]] and the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)]] jointly established the [[Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia]] (Italian Institute of Technology), headquartered in [[Genoa]] with 10 laboratories around Italy, which however focuses on research, not entirely in the fields of engineering and does not offer undergraduate degrees.

;Technical University
There are 4 technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to [[Malaysian Technical University Network]]: 
*[[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Perlis]]
*[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Pahang]]

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in [[Mauritius]] is the [[University of Technology, Mauritius]] with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country’s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===Mexico===
In Mexico there are different Institutes and Colleges of Technology. Most of them are public institutions.

The [[National Technological Institute of Mexico]] (in Spanish: Tecnológico Nacional de México, TecNM) is a Mexican public [[university system]] created on 23 July 2014 by presidential decree with the purpose to unify 263 public institutes of technology that had been created since 1948 and are found all around Mexico.

Another important institute of technology in Mexico is the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (''Instituto Politécnico Nacional''), which is located in the northern region of Mexico City.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Tertiary education in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with [[university|universities]], colleges of education and [[wananga|wānanga]]; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of [[Tertiary Education Institution]]s. Some have officially taken the title 'institute of technology' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term 'polytechnic'.  One has opted for the name '[[Universal College of Learning]]' (UCOL) and another '[[Unitec New Zealand]]'. These are legal names but not recognized terms like 'polytechnic' or 'institute of technology'.  Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand's state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with [[Massey University]]. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]], which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became [[Wellington Institute of Technology]]. Some smaller polytechnics in the [[North Island]], such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with [[Universal College of Learning|UCOL]]. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The [[Auckland University of Technology]] is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to [[university]] status; while [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

In mid-February 2019, the [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education Minister]] [[Chris Hipkins]] proposed merging the country's sixteen polytechnics into a "NZ Institute of Skills and Technology" in response to deficits and a decline in domestic enrollments. The proposed merger will be subject to a six-week consultation period until 27 March.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Collins |first1=Simon |title=Polytechnic mega-merger will take over apprentices and industry trainees |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12203337 |access-date=15 February 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=13 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Tom |last2=Richmond |first2=Adele |title=Government proposes merging 16 polytechnics and technology institutes into single entity |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/110554835/government-proposes-merging-16-polytechnics-in-major-overhaul-of-vocation-education |access-date=15 February 2019 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=14 February 2019}}</ref>

===Nigeria===
{{See also|List of polytechnics in Nigeria}}

Virtually, every state in [[Nigeria]] has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In [[Rivers State]] for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; [[Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic]], [[Bori City]] and the [[Rivers State College of Arts and Science]], [[Port Harcourt]]. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the [[National Board for Technical Education|NBTE]] in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the [[Eastern Polytechnic, Port Harcourt|Eastern Polytechnic]], established in 2008.

===Pakistan===
The polytechnic institutes in [[Pakistan]] offer [[Diploma in Engineering]] spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the [[10th grade]] standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and started in early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can either get employment or enroll in [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) and [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BE) degree programs.

Universities of Engineering & Technology in Pakistan offer [[undergraduate]] ([[B.E.|BE/BS/BSc Engineering]]) and [[postgraduate]] ([[Master of Engineering|ME/MS/MSc Engineering]] and [[PhD]]) degree programs in [[engineering]]. [[B.E.|BE/BS/BSc Engineering]] is a [[professional degree]] in Pakistan. It is a 4 years full-time program after [[HSSC]] (higher secondary school certificate).

===Portugal===
{{Main|Polytechnic (Portugal)}}

Till recently, there was a Technical University of Lisbon (UTL). It included several of the most prestigious schools, including, an engineering school (Instituto Superior Tecnico) and one of the most ancient business schools in the world (ISEG Lisbon). But UTL merged with the University of Lisbon.  In this field, here are also a number of non-university [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher educational institutions]] which are called [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic institutes]] since 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US [[community colleges]].

Since the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master's degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor ({{lang-pt|bacharelato}}) degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ''diploma de estudos superiores especializados''), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university's [[licentiate degree]]s (''licenciatura''). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

===Singapore===
{{See also|Education in Singapore}}

The Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelors, masters or PhD degrees. However, the Polytechnics in Singapore offers three-year diploma courses in fields such as information technology, engineering subjects and other vocational fields, like psychology and nursing. The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to a [[junior college]] in the UK or a [[community college]] in the United States. There are 5 polytechnics in Singapore. They are namely: [[Singapore Polytechnic]], [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], [[Temasek Polytechnic]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] and [[Republic Polytechnic]].

A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to local and overseas universities, depending on the university's policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term "institute of technology", most notably the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic Diploma graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor's degree. Other technological university in Singapore includes the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (1981) and the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] (2009).

===Slovakia===
*[[Slovak University of Technology]] in Bratislava
The world's first institution of technology or technical university with tertiary technical education is the '''Banská Akadémia''' in [[Banská Štiavnica]], Slovakia,<ref name="unesco1"/> founded in 1735, Academy since December 13, 1762 established by queen [[Maria Theresa]] in order to train specialists of silver and gold mining and metallurgy in neighbourhood. Teaching started in 1764. Later the department of Mathematics, Mechanics and Hydraulics and department of Forestry were settled. University buildings are still at their place today and are used for teaching. University has launched the first book of [[electrotechnics]] in the world.

[[South Africa]] has completed a process of transforming its "higher education landscape". Historically a division has existed in South Africa between Universities and Technikons (polytechnics) as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings. In 1993 Technikons were afforded the power to award [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|certain technology degrees]].
Beginning in 2004 former Technikons have either been merged with traditional Universities to form Comprehensive Universities or have become Universities of Technology, however the Universities of Technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a University (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).<ref>Mentz, J., Kotzé, P., Van der Merwe, A. (2008). [http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/comp/comp_v42_a10.html Searching for the Technology in University of Technology.] ''South African Computer Journal'', Vol 42, December 2008, pp. 29–37, looks at the role of Universities of Technologies after these mergers.</ref>

===Thailand===
{{See also|Education in Thailand}}

Most of Thailand's institutes of technology were developed from [[technical college]]s, in the past could not grant bachelor's degrees; today, however, they are [[university]] level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the [[doctorate|doctoral]] level. Examples are [[Pathumwan Institute of Technology]] (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to "University of Technology": [[Rajamangala University of Technology]] (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are [[Asian Institute of Technology]], which developed from [[SEATO]] Graduate School of Engineering and [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], an engineering school of [[Thammasat University]]. [[Suranaree University of Technology]] is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] is the most well known private technological institute.  Technology/Technical colleges in Thailand is associated with bitter rivalries which erupts into frequent off-campus brawls and assassinations of students in public locations that has been going on for nearly a decade, with innocent bystanders also commonly among the injured<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Schools-will-face-action-over-student-brawls-30163128.html|title=Schools will face action over student brawls|date=19 August 2011|work=The Nation|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104025/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Schools-will-face-action-over-student-brawls-30163128.html|archive-date=17 December 2014}}</ref> and the military under [[martial law]] still unable to stop them from occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/449944/tech-students-brawl-shuts-concert|title=Tech students' brawl shuts concert|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited}}</ref>

'''Polytechnics'''{{Main|Polytechnic (United Kingdom)}}

Polytechnics were [[tertiary education]] teaching institutions in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] of education along with universities.  Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD) validated at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA).  Initially they excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses and other [[science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects similar to technological universities in the US and continental Europe.  Polytechnics were associated with innovations including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s and the rise of management and [[business studies]].

Britain's first polytechnic, the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] later known as the [[Polytechnic of Central London]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain "at little expense."  The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century.  Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation "institute of technology" was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), [[Central Institution]]s (Dundee, Robert Gordon's) and postgraduate universities, (Cranfield and Wessex), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two "institutes of science and technology": [[UMIST]] and [[UWIST]] (part of the [[University of Wales]]). [[Loughborough University]] was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].  This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization.  These institutions are sometimes referred to as [[New universities (United Kingdom)#Post-1992 universities that trace their roots to former polytechnics|post-1992 universities]].

'''Technical colleges'''

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation [[college of advanced technology (United Kingdom)|college of advanced technology]]. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees.

Institutions called "technical institutes" or "technical schools" that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic.  Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

In 2016 the UK government announced plans to establish new "institutes of technology" in England as part of its reforms to post-16 skills provision "to provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels 3, 4 and 5. Each IoT is likely to build on infrastructure that already exists but will have its own independent identity, governance arrangements which directly involve employers and national branding".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536068/56259_Cm_9280_print.pdf |title=Data |website=www.gov.uk |format=PDF}}</ref>

Polytechnic institutes in the USA are elite technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century.  A handful of American universities include the phrases "Institute of Technology", "Polytechnic Institute", "Polytechnic University" or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally [[research]]-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. The earliest of these institutions include: [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI, 1824), [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT, 1829), [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute]] (1854), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT, 1861), [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (1865), [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1870), [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (VPI or VT, 1872), [[Case Institute of Technology]] (1881), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT, 1881), [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1885), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech, 1891), [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry]] (1891) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (1900). Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution.

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the ''polytechnic'' French concepts.  At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound [[middle class]] economy.

Nowadays, most of the ''Institutos de Tecnología'' are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ''Instituto universitario de tecnologia'' in Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French "Institut Universitaire de Technologie"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.
