'''''Protea''''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|oʊ|t|iː|ə}}<ref>{{OED|Protea}}<br>''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607</ref> is both the [[botanical name]] and the English common name of a [[genus]] of South African [[flowering plants]], sometimes also called '''sugarbushes''' ([[Afrikaans]]: ''suikerbos'').
==Etymology==

The genus ''Protea'' was named in 1735 by [[Carl Linnaeus]], possibly after the Greek god [[Proteus]], who could change his form at will, possibly because they have such a wide variety of forms. Linnaeus's genus was formed by merging a number of genera previously published by [[Herman Boerhaave]], although precisely which of Boerhaave's genera were included in Linnaeus's ''Protea'' varied with each of Linnaeus's publications.

==Taxonomy==

The family Proteaceae to which ''Protea'' species belong is an ancient one among [[angiosperms]]. Evidence from pollen fossils suggests Proteaceae ancestors grew in [[Gondwana]], in the [[Upper Cretaceous]], 75-80 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pollen evidence for Late Cretaceous differentiation of Proteaceae in southern polar forests|first1=Mary E.|last1=Dettmann|first2=David M.|last2=Jarzen|date=1 April 1991|journal=Can. J. Bot.|volume=69|issue=4|pages=901–906|doi=10.1139/b91-116}}</ref> The Proteaceae are divided into two subfamilies: the [[Proteoideae]], best represented in southern Africa, and the [[Grevillea|Grevilleoideae]], concentrated in Australia and South America and the other smaller segments of Gondwana that are now part of eastern Asia. Africa shares only one genus with [[Madagascar]], whereas South America and Australia share many common genera — this indicates they separated from Africa before they separated from each other.

==Distribution==

Most proteas occur south of the [[Limpopo River]]. However, ''[[P. kilimanjaro]] '' is found in the [[chaparral]] zone of [[Mount Kenya National Park]].  About 92% of the species occurs only in the [[Cape Floristic Region]], a narrow belt of mountainous coastal land from [[Clanwilliam, Western Cape|Clanwilliam]] to [[Grahamstown]], South Africa. The extraordinary richness and diversity of species characteristic of the Cape flora are thought to be caused in part by the diverse landscape, where populations can become isolated from each other and in time develop into separate species.

==Botanical history==

Proteas attracted the attention of botanists visiting the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the 17th century.  Many species were introduced to Europe in the 18th century, enjoying a unique popularity at the time amongst botanists.

==Cultivation==

Proteas are currently cultivated in over 20 countries. Cultivation is restricted to Mediterranean and subtropical climates.<ref>(Malan, G. 2012. Protea cultivation from concept to carton.  page=21)</ref> Three categories of traits have to be considered before developing a new cultivar. The yield or production capacity of the cultivar must be considered. The ease of handling and packaging of the cut stems and the last category is to consider the perceived market value of the cultivar <ref>(Littlejohn, G.M. (2002). Breeding Technology for Protea. Fynbos Research. Page 1).</ref> The cultivation of a ''Protea '' plant is time-consuming, so good planning when developing the cross combinations and goals are of great importance of the breeding programme.<ref>(Littlejohn, G.M. (2002). Breeding Technology for Protea. Fynbos Research. Page 1)</ref> Some protea flower species, like the [[king protea]] flower, are [[self-pollinating]] flowers. Other protea species, however, such as ''P. cordata'', ''P. decurrens'', and ''P. scabra'' are [[self-incompatible]], thus rely on cross-pollination for successive seed set. The main [[Pollinator|vectors]] responsible for the transfer of pollen in protea cultivation are birds, insects, and wind. Some ''Protea'' species exhibit both self-pollination and cross-pollination as a method of reproduction. Cross-pollination is preferred, though, as a method of reproduction because it provides genetic diversity in the population. When cultivating proteas, breeders use hand pollination as a controlled method to transfer pollen from one flower to another. <!-- not encyclopedic how-to  These steps are used by breeders to perform hand pollination:<ref name="auto">(Littlejohn, G.M. (2002). Breeding Technology for Protea. Fynbos Research. Page 2)</ref>

*Cover the inflorescence, which contain only closed flowers, with a plastic bag
*Once the first few flowers have opened, most have to be cut back to 10-20 flowers around the receptacle
*After 3 days, the pollen may be applied using a toothpick. The flower should then again be covered with a plastic bag and marked with a tag containing information regarding the seed, the parent, and the date of pollination. This step should be repeated until all the flowers are opened and pollinated.
*The seed head should be harvested at 9-12 months  and dried at temperatures more or less at 40°C to remove the seeds from the receptacle
*The seeds can  be germinated in autumn using hot water
*The seeds should then be placed in a sterilized potting medium for germination.

Proteas usually flower during spring. The general structure of their flower heads consists of a mass of flowers on a woody [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]. The ovary is protected by the receptacle, thus is not seen when looking at the flower, but the anthers are  present at the top of the flower, which can then easily transfer the pollen to the vectors. The common Proteaceae plants, e.g. ''Protea'', ''[[Leucospermum]]'', and ''[[Leucadendron]]'' are diploid organisms,  thus they can freely hybridise with closely related species to form new cultivars. Unusually, not all the genera within the family Proteaceae are able to hybridise freely; for example, ''Leucadendron'' species cannot be crossed with ''Leucospermum'' species because of the difference in their haploid chromosome number (13 and 12, respectively). This genetic incompatibility results in pollinated flowers that yield either no fruit, or seedless fruit, as the resulting plant embryos, from the incompatible pollen and ovum, fail to develop.

<!--how-to Proteas are used for ornamental practices as [[cut flowers]] and for decoration, so some of the desirable traits a breeder is looking for during cultivation are flower size and colour etc. traits considered by breeders in the selection process for cultivation are long lasting bloom, flowering time, plant architecture, general appearance and adaptability. There are four main methods of selecting Protea flowers for further cultivation: Mass selection, Single plant clonal selection, Chance interspecific hybrid selection, Controlled-pollination interspecific hybrid selection.<ref name="auto1">(Littlejohn, G.M. (2002). Breeding Technology for Protea. Fynbos Research. Page 4)</ref>

<!-- how-to The four main methods for cultivating Protea plants are sexual reproduction (cultivation with seed). When Proteas are cultivated using seeds, the first step in the cultivation process is to disinfect the seeds by soaking in water maintained at 50&nbsp;°C for 30 minutes. The germination of the seeds will occur over a period of 14 to 28 days. The germinating seeds should be planted in a medium in pots before the developing roots are 10mm long. Another method for cultivation is vegetative propagation (cultivation with cuttings), which is used to obtain a large protea population of the same genotype. This cultivation method allows for the cultivation of hybrid protea plants without the loss of their unique characteristics. The other two cultivation methods include [[grafting]] and budding and micropropagation, referring to cultivation with tissue culture.

<!-- off topic and how-to ==Hybrids==

A hybrid is defined as an offspring between two plants of different species or varieties. Inter- or intraspecific hybridization is used in the cultivation of flowers to improve the qualities including bract colour, flowering time and disease resistance. Intraspecific hybridization refers to a hybrid between different genotypes of the same species whereas interspecific hybridization refers to the progeny between two different species of the same genus. Hybrid flowers are more adaptable to different environments than the pure species, this is why the cultivation of hybrids are preferred. Hybridization of protea flowers is common amongst the genus ''[[Leucadendron]]'' to produce unique set of characteristics to meet the market requirements and thus increases market exports and changes the market trend.<ref name="auto1"/> It is often difficult to identify hybrids from a population based on morphological features, because of the resemblance the species show towards the parent plants. For this reason molecular markers such as [[RAPD]], [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLP]],  or microsatellite markers and PCR-RFLP are useful in identifying hybrid plants.<ref>(Blomerus, Joshua and Williams, 2010)</ref> Another common hybrid is the Protea emixia which is cultivated to flower during the spring and summer months and thus provides cut flowers for export to the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name="auto"/> The hybridization of proteas is usually started by covering the inflorescence of the female plant with a plastic bag to exclude external sources of pollination. After two days the unopened flowers are removed from the inflorescence leaving approximately 40 to 60 opened flowers. The pollen is then hand applied using a brush and the inflorescence is covered again.<ref>(Coetzee et al. (2007) “Proteaceous Ornamentals” ISHS: Scripta Horticulture (5): 89-90)</ref>
