'''PepsiCo, Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] food, snack and [[beverage corporation]] headquartered in [[Harrison, New York]], in the hamlet of [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]]. PepsiCo has interests in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the '''Pepsi-Cola Company'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> and [[Frito-Lay]], Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product [[Pepsi]] to a broader range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which included an acquisition of [[Tropicana Products]] in 1998 and the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 2001, which added the [[Gatorade]] brand to its portfolio.

As of January 26, 2012, 22 of PepsiCo's brands generated retail sales of more than $1&nbsp;billion,<ref name="billions">{{cite web|last=Bryson York |first=Emily |title=Pepsi says three drinks now billion-dollar brands |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-26/news/chi-pepsi-says-three-drinks-now-billiondollar-brands-20120126_1_starbucks-products-pepsi-max-diet-pepsi |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> and the company's products were distributed across more than 200 countries, resulting in annual [[net revenue]]s of $43.3&nbsp;billion.

==History==

===Origins===
The soft drink Pepsi was developed by [[Caleb Bradham]], a pharmacist and businessman from [[Duplin County, North Carolina]]. He coined the name "Pepsi-Cola" in 1898 while marketing the drink from his pharmacy in [[New Bern, North Carolina]]. As his drink gained popularity, Bradham founded the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 1903.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-pepsi-cola-1991656|title=Pepsi Cola's Long, Winding History|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|access-date=May 16, 2019|first5=Video Game Content|last6=inventors}}</ref> The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919. Bradham's company experienced years of success leading up to [[World War I]]. However, sugar rationing during the war and a volatile sugar market in the war's aftermath damaged the company's financial health to such a degree that in 1923, Bradham declared [[bankruptcy]] and returned to running pharmacies in North Carolina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nowweknowem.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/caleb-bradhams-soda-fountain-flavor-brads-drink-became-pepsi-cola-today-in-1898-now-we-know-em/|title=Caleb Bradham's soda fountain flavor "Brad's Drink" became Pepsi-Cola today in 1898. Now WE know em|last=Leonard|first=Carl|date=August 28, 2013|language=en|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

On June 8, 1923, the company trademark and secret recipe were purchased by Craven Holding Corporation. In 1931, Roy Megargel, a Wall Street broker, purchased the Pepsi trademark, business, and goodwill from Craven Holding in association with [[Charles Guth]]. Guth was also the president of [[Loft, Incorporated]], a leading candy manufacturer based in Long Island City, New York. Loft ran a network with 115 stores across the Mid Atlantic at the time of Guth's acquisition. Guth used Loft's labs and chemists to reformulate the Pepsi syrup recipe, and he used his position as president of the company to replace [[Coca-Cola]] with Pepsi Cola at Loft's shops and restaurants. Guth also used Loft resources to promote Pepsi, and moved the soda company to a location close by Loft's own facilities in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/42028#p21|title=Guth v. Loft (Del. 1939) [Pepsi]|website=h2o.law.harvard.edu|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

In 1935, the shareholders of Loft sued Guth for his 91% stake of Pepsi-Cola Company in the landmark case ''[[Guth v. Loft Inc.]]'' Loft won the suit and on May 29, 1941 formally absorbed Pepsi into Loft, which was then re-branded as Pepsi-Cola Company that same year. Loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In the early 1960s, Pepsi-Cola's product lines expanded with the creation of [[Diet Pepsi]] and purchase of [[Mountain Dew]].<ref name="fundhist">{{cite web|title=PepsiCo, Inc.

===Acquisitions and divestments===
Between the late-1970s and the mid-1990s, PepsiCo expanded via acquisition of businesses outside of its core focus of packaged food and beverage brands; however it exited these non-core business lines largely in 1997, selling some, and spinning off others into a new company named [[Tricon Global Restaurants]], which later became known as [[Yum! Brands|Yum! Brands, Inc.]]<ref name="yumhist">{{cite web|title=Yum! Brands, Inc.

The divestments concluding in 1997 were followed by multiple large-scale acquisitions, as PepsiCo began to extend its operations beyond soft drinks and snack foods into other lines of foods and beverages. PepsiCo purchased the [[orange juice]] company [[Tropicana Products]] in 1998,<ref name="tropicana">{{cite news|last=Hays|first=Constance L.|title=Pepsico Buys Tropicana|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/weekinreview/july-19-25-pepsico-buys-tropicana.html|access-date=December 12, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 26, 1998}}</ref> and merged with [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 2001,<ref name="quaker2">{{cite news|title=Pepsi Buys Quaker in $13.4B Stock Deal|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=88989&page=1|access-date=December 12, 2010|newspaper=ABC News|date=December 4, 2000}}</ref> adding with it the [[Gatorade]] sports drink line and other Quaker Oats brands such as [[Chewy Granola Bars]] and [[Aunt Jemima]], among others.<ref name="quakeroats">{{cite magazine|last=Herper|first=Matthew|author2=Schiffman, Betsy|title=Pepsi Bought Quaker.

In August 2009, PepsiCo made a $7&nbsp;billion offer to acquire the two largest bottlers of its products in North America: [[Pepsi Bottling Group]] and [[PepsiAmericas]].

[[The Coca-Cola Company]] has historically been considered PepsiCo's primary competitor in the beverage market,<ref name="pepsicococacola">{{cite web|last=Pyke|first=Jim|title=Cola Wars: Considering a Coke and Pepsi Pairs Trade|website=Seeking Alpha|date=October 31, 2010|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/233645-cola-wars-considering-a-coke-and-pepsi-pairs-trade|access-date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 12 years since both companies began to compete. In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company held a higher market share in carbonated [[soft drink]] sales within the U.S.<ref name=10k>{{cite magazine|title=2009 PepsiCo, Inc.

The majority of PepsiCo's revenues no longer come from the production and sale of carbonated soft drinks.<ref name=q32010earnings /> Beverages accounted for less than 50 percent of its total revenue in 2009. In the same year, slightly more than 60 percent of PepsiCo's beverage sales came from its primary non-carbonated brands, namely [[Gatorade]] and [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]].<ref name=10k />

PepsiCo's [[Frito-Lay]] and [[Quaker Oats]] brands hold a significant share of the U.S. snack food market, accounting for approximately 39 percent of U.S. snack food sales in 2009.<ref name=10k /> One of PepsiCo's primary competitors in the snack food market overall is [[Kraft Foods]], which in the same year held 11 percent of the U.S. snack market share.<ref name=10k />
Other competitors for soda are [[RC Cola]], [[Keurig Dr Pepper|Keurig Dr. Pepper]], and independent brands varying by region.

===Soviet Union===
In 1959, the [[USSR]] held an exhibition of Soviet technology and culture in New York. The United States reciprocated with an exhibition in [[Sokolniki Park]], [[Moscow]], which led to the famous [[kitchen debate]]. One of the American products exhibited was Pepsi Cola. After obtaining a photo of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] sipping Pepsi, Pepsico executive Donald Kendall was able to capture the attention of the Soviet people and, in 1972, negotiate a cola monopoly in the USSR. Due to Soviet restrictions on transporting rubles abroad, PepsiCo struck a [[Barter|barter deal]] whereby [[Stolichnaya]] vodka would be exchanged for Pepsi syrup. This deal lasted until 1990, when the USSR and PepsiCo re-negotiated a $3 billion deal to exchange syrup for vodka and a small fleet of Soviet warships including 17 submarines, a frigate, a cruiser and a destroyer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/soviet-union-pepsi-ships|title=When the Soviet Union Paid Pepsi in Warships|last1=Ewbank|first1=Anne|date=January 12, 2018|access-date=July 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/10/opinion/foreign-affairs-soviets-buy-american.html|title=FOREIGN AFFAIRS; Soviets Buy American|first=Flora|last=Lewis| date=May 10, 1989 |access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/04/10/pepsico-sets-3-billion-barter-deal-with-soviets/d5c3d727-2808-463a-b956-15245ae11bed/|title=PEPSICO SETS $3 BILLION BARTER DEAL WITH SOVIETS|date=April 10, 1990|access-date=October 23, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> This deal fell through before it could take place due to the fall of the Soviet Union and was renegotiated with the former nations of the USSR.

===Headquarters===
The PepsiCo headquarters are located in the hamlet of [[Purchase, New York]], in the town and village of [[Harrison, New York]]. It was one of the last architectural works by [[Edward Durell Stone]]. It consists of seven three-story buildings. Each building is connected to its neighbor through a corner. The property includes the [[Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens]] with 45 contemporary sculptures open to the public. Works include those of [[Alexander Calder]], [[Henry Moore]], and [[Auguste Rodin]]. ''[[Westchester Magazine]]'' stated "The buildings' square blocks rise from the ground into low, inverted ziggurats, with each of the three floors having strips of dark windows; patterned pre-cast concrete panels add texture to the exterior surfaces." In 2010 the magazine ranked the building as one of the ten most beautiful buildings in Westchester County.<ref>"[http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/December-2010/Our-10-Most-Beautiful-Buildings/ Our 10 Most Beautiful Buildings]."

===Water usage (India, U.S., U.K.)===
PepsiCo's usage of water was the subject of controversy in India in the early and mid-2000s, in part because of the company's alleged impact on water usage in a country where [[water shortage]]s are a perennial issue. In this setting, PepsiCo was perceived by India-based environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product, making it a target for critics at the time.<ref name="busweekasia">{{cite news|last=Brady |first=Diane |title=Pepsi: Repairing a Poisoned Reputation in India |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2007/gb20070531_868198_page_5.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602164227/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2007/gb20070531_868198_page_5.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |access-date=December 11, 2010 |newspaper=Businessweek Asia |date=May 31, 2007 }}</ref>

Water usage concerns have arisen at times in other countries where PepsiCo operates. In the U.S., [[water shortage]]s in certain regions resulted in increased scrutiny on the company's production facilities, which were cited in media reports as being among the largest water users in cities facing drought‚Äîsuch as [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name="glennon">{{cite book|last=Glennon|first=Robert Jerome|title=Unquenchable: America's Water Crisis and What To Do About It|year=2009|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-436-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781597264365/page/25 25]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781597264365|url-access=registration|quote=gatorade plant water use atlanta.}}</ref><ref name="wheatley">{{cite web|last=Wheatley|first=Thomas|title=Tap water wears a bow tie when it's put in a bottle and sold|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/tap-water-wears-a-bow-tie-when-its-put-in-a-bottle-and-sold/Content?oid=1271054|publisher=Creative Loafing Atlanta|access-date=December 7, 2010}}</ref> In response, the company formed partnerships with non-profit organizations such as the [[Earth Institute]] and [[Water.org]], and in 2009 began cleaning new Gatorade bottles with purified air instead of rinsing with water, among other [[water conservation]] practices.<ref name="gardner">{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Sarah|title=Pepsi conserves water with Gatorade|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/11/19/pepsi/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191458/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/11/19/pepsi/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 27, 2011|access-date=December 11, 2010|newspaper=Marketplace / Public Radio|date=November 19, 2008}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, also in response to regional [[drought]] conditions, PepsiCo snacks brand Walkers' reduced water usage at its largest [[potato chip]] facility by 45 percent between the years 2001 and 2008.

One strategy enacted to reach this goal has been the placement of interactive recycling kiosks called "Dream Machines" in supermarkets, [[convenience stores]], and [[gas stations]], with the intent of increasing access to recycling receptacles.<ref name="kiosk1">{{cite news | url=https://www.supermarketnews.com/latest-news/pepsico-roll-out-recycling-kiosks | title=PepsiCo to Roll Out Recycling Kiosks | work=[[Supermarket News]] | date=April 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name="kiosk2">{{cite web|title=PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Roll Out Recycling Initiatives|website=Environmental Leader|date=June 3, 2010|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/06/03/pepsico-coca-cola-roll-out-recycling-initiatives/|access-date=December 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605084816/http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/06/03/pepsico-coca-cola-roll-out-recycling-initiatives/|archive-date=June 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of [[resin]] to manufacture its [[plastic bottle]]s has resulted in reduced packaging weight, which in turn reduces the volume of [[fossil fuels]] required to transport certain PepsiCo products.

On March 15, 2011, PepsiCo unveiled the world's first plant-based [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottle. The bottle is made from plant-based materials, such as [[switch grass]], [[corn husks]], and pine bark, and is 100% recyclable. PepsiCo plans to reuse more by-products of its manufacturing processes such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles. PepsiCo has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleum-based PET‚Äîwhich will make the new bottle technology, dubbed "Green Bottle", feel the same as normal PET. PepsiCo will pilot production in 2012, and upon successful completion of the pilot, intends moving to full-scale commercialization.<ref>{{cite web |title=PepsiCo Develops World's First 100 Percent Plant-Based, Renewably Sourced PET Bottle |url=http://www.pepsico.com/PressRelease/PepsiCo-Develops-Worlds-First-100-Percent-Plant-Based-Renewably-Sourced-PET-Bott03152011.html |publisher=PepsiCo PRNewswire |date=March 15, 2011 |access-date=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

In a bid to reduce packaging consumption, in recent years the PepsiCoPartners launched as service offering carbonated drinks dispensers within the US.

===Energy usage and carbon footprint===
PepsiCo, along with other manufacturers in its industry, has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumed an additional {{convert|1.5|e9USgal|m3}} of [[petrochemicals]] in 2008. These critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging, which results in the [[Air pollution|emission]] of [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name="geller">{{cite news|last=Geller|first=Martinne|title=PepsiCo tests "green" vending machines|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE52T0QD20090330|access-date=December 12, 2010|work=Reuters |date=March 30, 2009}}</ref> Beginning largely in 2006, PepsiCo began development of more efficient means of producing and distributing its products using less energy,<ref name="bruce">{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Bill|title=Consumer goods industry initiatives on climate protection|website=FoodBev|date=November 29, 2010|url=http://www.foodbev.com/news/consumer-goods-industry-initiatives-on-climate-protection|access-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref> while also placing a focus on [[emissions reduction]].<ref name=geller /> In a comparison of 2009 [[energy usage]] with recorded usage in 2006, the company's per-unit use of energy was reduced by 16 percent in its beverage plants and 7 percent in snack plants.<ref name=susrept />

In 2009, Tropicana (owned by PepsiCo) was the first brand in the U.S. to determine the carbon footprint of its [[orange juice]] product, as certified by the [[Carbon Trust]], an outside auditor of carbon emissions.<ref name="martin">{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Andrew|title=How Green Is My Orange?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/business/22pepsi.html?_r=2|access-date=December 8, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> Also in 2009, PepsiCo began the test deployment of so-called "green [[vending machines]]", which reduce energy usage by 15 percent in comparison to average models in use.

==Product nutrition==
According to its 2009 annual report, PepsiCo states that it is "committed to delivering sustainable growth by investing in a healthier future for people and our planet,"<ref name=annualrpt09/><ref name="susrept">{{cite web|title=2009 Sustainability Report Overview|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Download/PepsiCo_2009_Sustainability_Report_Overview.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821142748/http://www.pepsico.com/Download/PepsiCo_2009_Sustainability_Report_Overview.pdf|archive-date=August 21, 2010|publisher=PepsiCo, Inc.|access-date=December 13, 2010|year=2009}}</ref> which it has defined in its mission statement since 2006 as "Performance with Purpose".<ref name="anreport06">{{cite report|title=2006 Annual Report|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Download/2006-Annual-English.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902080736/http://www.pepsico.com/Download/2006-Annual-English.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 2, 2009|publisher=PepsiCo, Inc.|access-date=December 9, 2010|pages=2‚Äì3|date=March 5, 2007}}</ref> According to news and magazine coverage on the subject in 2010, the objective of this initiative is to increase the number and variety of healthier food and beverage products made available to its customers,<ref name="econperf">{{cite magazine|title=Pepsi gets a makeover|magazine=The Economist|date=March 25, 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15772138|access-date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> employ a reduction in the company's [[environmental impact]],<ref name="clancy">{{cite web|last=Clancy |first=Heather |title=PepsiCo practices performance with purpose in sustainability push |website=Smart Planet |date=May 19, 2010 |url=http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/business-brains/pepsico-practices-performance-with-purpose-in-sustainability-push/7129/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523122801/http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/business-brains/pepsico-practices-performance-with-purpose-in-sustainability-push/7129/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 23, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2010 }}</ref> and to facilitate [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and healthy lifestyles within its employee base.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals‚Äînamely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products‚Äîhave been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations, and at times have raised concerns among its critics. As the result of a more recent focus on such efforts, "critics consider (PepsiCo) to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies", according to former ''[[New York Times]]'' food industry writer Melanie Warner in 2010.<ref name="warner">{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Melanie|title=Good News!

===Product diversity===
From its founding in 1965 until the early 1990s, the majority of PepsiCo's product line consisted of carbonated soft drinks and convenience [[snacks]]. PepsiCo broadened its product line substantially throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the [[takeover|acquisition]] and development of what its CEO deemed as "good-for-you" products, including [[Quaker Oats]], [[Naked Juice]], and Tropicana orange juice.<ref name="mangalindan">{{cite news|last=Mangalindan|first=JP|title=PepsiCo CEO: 'If all consumers exercised...obesity wouldn't exist'|url=https://money.cnn.com/2010/04/27/news/companies/indra_nooyi_pepsico.fortune/index.htm|access-date=December 12, 2010|newspaper=CNN Money / Fortune|date=April 27, 2010}}</ref> Sales of such healthier-oriented PepsiCo brands totaled $10&nbsp;billion in 2009, representing 18 percent of the company's total revenue in that year. This movement into a broader, healthier product range has been moderately well received by nutrition advocates; though commentators in this field have also suggested that PepsiCo market its healthier items as aggressively as less-healthy core products.<ref name="moore">{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Angela|title=Indra Nooyi's Pepsi challenge|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/indra-nooyi-puts-her-brand-on-pepsis-pressing-global-challenges?pagenumber=1|access-date=December 14, 2010|work=MarketWatch|date=December 6, 2007}}</ref>

In response to shifting consumer preferences and in part due to increasing governmental regulation, PepsiCo in 2010 indicated its intention to grow this segment of its business, forecasting that sales of fruit, vegetable, [[whole grain]], and [[fiber]]-based products will amount to $30&nbsp;billion by 2020.<ref name="confinogoals">{{cite news|last=Confino|first=Jo|title=PepsiCo's 'big hairy audacious goals'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/pepsico-background-sustainability-programme|access-date=December 14, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 26, 2010|location=London}}</ref> To meet this intended target, the company has said that it plans to acquire additional health-oriented brands while also making changes to the composition of existing products that it sells.<ref name=confinogoals />

===Ingredient changes in Pepsi===
Public health advocates have suggested that there may be a link between the [[ingredient]] makeup of PepsiCo's core snack and carbonated soft drink products and rising rates of health conditions such as [[obesity]] and [[diabetes]]. The company aligns with personal [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]] advocates, who assert that food and beverages with higher proportions of sugar or salt content are fit for consumption in moderation by individuals who also exercise on a regular basis.<ref name="byrnes">{{cite magazine|last=Byrnes |first=Nanette |title=Pepsi Brings In the Health Police |magazine=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=January 14, 2010 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_04/b4164050511214.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121152258/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_04/b4164050511214.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=December 13, 2010 }}</ref>

Changes to the composition of its products with nutrition in mind have involved reducing fat content, moving away from [[trans-fats]], and producing products in [[calorie]]-specific [[serving size]]s to discourage overconsumption, among other changes.<ref name="econperf"/> One of the earlier ingredient changes involved sugar and caloric reduction, with the introduction of [[Diet Pepsi]] in 1964 and [[Pepsi Max]] in 1993‚Äîboth of which are variants of their full-calorie counterpart, [[Pepsi]]. More recent changes have consisted of [[saturated fat]] reduction, which [[Frito-Lay]] reduced by 50% in [[Lay's]] and [[Ruffles]] potato chips in the U.S. between 2006 and 2009.<ref name=byrnes /> Also in 2009, PepsiCo's Tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice (Trop50) sweetened in part by the plant [[Stevia]], which reduced calories by half.<ref name=byrnes/> Since 2007, the company also made available lower-calorie variants of [[Gatorade]], which it calls "G2".<ref name="gatoradeg2">{{cite news|title=Pepsi unveils low-calorie Gatorade 'G2'|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/09/07/news/companies/pepsi_newproducts/index.htm|access-date=December 13, 2010|work=CNN Money|date=September 7, 2007}}</ref> On May 5, 2014, PepsiCo announced that the company would remove the flame retardant chemical known as "Brominated Vegetable Oil" from many of its products, but a time-frame was not discussed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kastrenakes|first1=Jacob|title=Coca-Cola and Pepsi removing controversial 'flame retardant' ingredient from all drinks|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/6/5686660/bvo-chemical-being-removed-from-all-coca-cola-and-pepsico-drinks|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|access-date=June 3, 2017}}</ref>

As public perception placed additional scrutiny on the marketing and distribution of carbonated soft drinks to children, PepsiCo announced in 2010 that by 2012, it will remove beverages with higher sugar content from primary and secondary schools worldwide.<ref name="kcity">{{cite news|last=Hack|first=Greg|title=Pepsi to pull sugar-sweetened drinks from schools|url=http://economy.kansascity.com/?q=node/6516|access-date=December 12, 2010|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=March 16, 2010}}</ref> It also, under voluntary guidelines adopted in 2006, replaced "full-calorie" beverages in U.S. schools with "lower-calorie" alternatives, leading to a 95 percent reduction in the 2009 sales of full-calorie variants in these schools in comparison to the sales recorded in 2004.<ref name="pepsugarschools">{{cite news|title=PepsiCo yanking sugar from schools worldwide|work=Crains New York |agency=Associated Press|date=March 16, 2010|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100316/FREE/100319922#|access-date=December 14, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, in accordance with guidelines adopted by the International Council of Beverages Associations, PepsiCo eliminated the advertising and marketing of products that do not meet its nutrition standards, to children under the age of 12.<ref name="fredrix">{{cite news|last=Fredrix |first=Emily |title=Pepsi Plans To Stop Selling Sugary Drinks In Schools Worldwide |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/pepsi-outdoes-cocacola-pl_n_501868.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326103918/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/pepsi-outdoes-cocacola-pl_n_501868.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 26, 2010 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=December 14, 2010 |date=March 16, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="gilbert2">{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Sarah|title=Is Pepsi's Removal of Sodas from Schools Just a Publicity Stunt?|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company-news/is-pepsis-removal-of-sodas-from-schools-really-just-a-publicity/19405032/|publisher=DailyFinance|access-date=December 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324190351/http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company-news/is-pepsis-removal-of-sodas-from-schools-really-just-a-publicity/19405032/|archive-date=March 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>
