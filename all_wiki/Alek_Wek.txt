When the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Wau in 1985, the Wek family had to flee from both rebel and government forces. Her father, Athian, once broke his hip in a bicycle accident, and his hip was repaired with metal pins. Long periods of walking caused Athian's hip to get infected, and upon the family's return to Wau, he became paralysed and endured a [[haemorrhage]]. He died at a relative's home in [[Khartoum]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

After arriving in London at age 14, Alek's psoriasis immediately cleared. She enrolled in the [[London College of Fashion]] and studied Fashion Business and Technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Dark-skinned models were rare, if not unheard of, in the high fashion industry. As a result, Alek's mainstream success was celebrated by black women all over the world. [[Oprah Winfrey]] commented that "if Alek had been on the cover of a magazine when I was growing up, I would have had a different concept of who I was."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/faraigundan/2013/12/31/supermodel-alek-wek-on-the-business-of-fashion-being-the-face-of-refugees-and-life-after-the-runway/|title=Supermodel Alek Wek on the Business of Fashion, Being The Face of Refugees And Life After The Runway|first=Farai|last=Gundan}}</ref> In a speech on beauty and self-perception,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPCkfARH2eE|title=Lupita Nyong'o Speech on Black Beauty Essence Black Women}}</ref> Kenyan actress [[Lupita Nyong'o]] stated that she had been a self-conscious, insecure teenager before seeing Alek in the spotlight: "When I saw Alek, I inadvertently saw a reflection of myself that I could not deny. Now, I had a spring in my step because I felt more seen, more appreciated by the far-away gatekeepers of beauty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/lupita-nyong-moving-speech-essence-event-article-1.1706333|title=Lupita Nyong'o: 'There is no shame in black beauty'}}</ref>
