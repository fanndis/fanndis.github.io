'''East Palo Alto''' (abbreviated E.P.A.) is a city in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], [[California]], United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of East Palo Alto was 28,155. It is situated on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], roughly halfway between the cities of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. To the north and east is the [[San Francisco Bay]], to the west is the city of [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], and to the south the city of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].

It is also in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]], while Palo Alto is in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]]. The two cities are separated only by [[San Francisquito Creek]] and, largely, the [[Bayshore Freeway]] (the vast majority of East Palo Alto is northeast of the freeway, while all of the residential part of Palo Alto is southwest of the freeway).

The prosperity that benefited the [[Silicon Valley]] during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] of the late 1990s largely bypassed East Palo Alto. The [[Ravenswood City School District]], which serves East Palo Alto and part of adjoining Menlo Park, has struggled with low academic performance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Eventually, however, the Peninsula's shortage of land and soaring property prices meant that even East Palo Alto became an option for urban regeneration. Until recently, [[gentrification]] has been rare in East Palo Alto.

East Palo Alto also includes a small piece of land across the [[Bayshore Freeway]] ([[US 101 (CA)|US 101]]) from the shopping center, a roughly triangular area between US 101 and San Francisquito Creek, formerly the site of a two-block-long retail business district known as Whiskey Gulch. The name dates back to the time when [[Stanford University]], on the other side of Palo Alto to the west, was [[Dry county|dry]] and prohibited alcohol sales within a radius of {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} from the campus. Whiskey Gulch, which was just outside these limits, became home to a number of liquor stores, bars, and music venues. Long after the university had relaxed its prohibition rules, the neighborhood still retained this character until 2000, when the city tore down Whiskey Gulch and replaced it with the University Circle office complex.<ref>''Environmental Impact Report for the University Circle Redevelopment Plan'', Report EMI7770, City of East Palo Alto</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Don |last=Kazak |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/2000_Apr_28.GULCH.html |title=Whiskey Gulch comes tumbling down |website=Palo Alto Online |date=April 28, 2000}}</ref> A 200-room [[Four Seasons Hotel|Four Seasons hotel]] opened in University Circle in 2006.

==History==
The [[Ohlone]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] inhabited this area at least by 1500 to 1000 BC. One [[tumulus]] was discovered in 1951 during development of the University Village subdivision near today's Costaño School. After a year-long excavation of 60 graves and 3,000 artifacts, researchers concluded Native Americans had utilized the area as a [[cemetery]] and camp, rather than as a permanent settlement. In later years another mound was found near Willow Road and the railroad [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]].<ref name=Romic>{{cite web |first=Rhonda |last=Rigenhagen |url=http://www.romic.com/epahistory/frame.htm |title=History of East Palo Alto |publisher=Romic Environmental Technologies Corp.|orig-year=1993 |date=1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630013952/http://www.romic.com/epahistory/frame.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}</ref>
[[File:Cooley_Landing_at_high_tide_-_Nov_2010_(5197304115).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Cooley Landing, the location of Isaiah Woods' failed city of Ravenswood]]
From the 1850s through the 1940s, the area which was to become East Palo Alto went through many changes. In 1849, Isaiah Woods attempted to make the area around what is now Cooley's Landing in the northeast of the current city a major shipping town and named the area Ravenswood. In 1868, after Woods' investments failed he sold the wharf to Lester Cooley, who built a brick factory. When the brick factory closed down, it reverted to a farming community.

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], the north side of East Palo Alto became a military training ground, of which only the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Menlo Park still exists. In the 1940s, East Palo Alto was a farming community with many Japanese residents. During the war, the Japanese were forced out, many to [[Internment of Japanese Americans|relocation centers]], and did not return after the war. In the 1950s the farms were built over with cheap housing and many African-American families moved in. 

The current demographics of East Palo Alto are largely a result of housing policies and events that occurred in the 1950’s. In particular, in 1954 the then-president of the California Real Estate Association, Floyd Lowe, implemented a strategy that turned a neighborhood on the East side of Palo Alto from predominantly white to predominantly black in a very short amount of time. He did this by “blockbusting” which is a strategy that was employed all over the country to similar results.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Russo |first1=Charles |title=Un-forgetting the segregationist history of Palo Alto (and Daly City, and San Francisco, and…) |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/06/28/un-forgetting-the-segregationist-history-of-palo-alto-and-daly-city-and-san-francisco-and |website=www.paloaltoonline.com |language=en}}</ref> Blockbusting involves instilling panic in white neighborhoods by warning of a “Negro invasion” when a black family considers purchasing a house in an area. In 1954, Lowe alerted the neighborhood that a “Negro invasion” was imminent, and sure enough, white flight ensued. Lowe profited due to the low prices at which the white families fleeing were willing to sell their homes, and within a few years, the demographics of the area had flipped. As white-owned businesses fled the area, it became poorer and overcrowded– a legacy that has persisted to this day. This segregationist act was never questioned by the government, and it led to many of the demographic and socioeconomic differences that exist between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto today.


During the civil rights movement of the 1960s there was a renewed interest in African history, one expression of which was a fad for [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. In 1968 the area was almost renamed [[Nairobi]], after the center of the [[Swahili language|Swahili]]-speaking area, to reflect the population's African roots.<ref name=Romic/><ref name=History/> Critics of the change pointed out that Nairobi was the capital of [[Kenya]], in East Africa, and had little to do with the cultural roots of most black Americans. In the end, the change was not made.

Historically East Palo Alto had relatively little shopping and business compared to surrounding areas, and most of it constituted an unincorporated "island" within San Mateo County, depending on county government for services and on the San Mateo County Sheriff for police protection and ineligible for many revenue benefits requiring city status. After several years of pro-incorporation campaigning by local community groups, a 1982 ballot measure that was stopped by a lawsuit, and a subsequent election the next year, East Palo Alto became a city on July 1, 1983,<ref name=anniversary/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Grieve|first1=Tim|title=Incorporation starts for East Palo Alto|url=https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford19830624-01.2.3&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=The Stanford Daily|date=24 June 1983}}</ref> with Barbara A. Mouton as its first Mayor. However, because of subsequent legal challenges to the last ballot measure, it was not until 1987 that the city was officially recognized as such. The legal challenges were led by former U.S. Congress member [[Pete McCloskey]], who represented one of the real-estate brokers whose original [[blockbusting]] campaign had turned EPA into a mostly black town.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The final tally was 1,777 for and 1,764 against, a margin of 13 votes and a majority of 50.2%.<ref name=History>{{cite web |author=Romic Environmental Technologies Corp. |url=http://www.epa.net/info/epa_history.html |title=The History of East Palo Alto |publisher=East Palo Alto.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206120354/http://www.epa.net/info/epa_history.html |archivedate=February 6, 2007 }}</ref>

Significant [[gentrification]] occurred in East Palo Alto from around 2000, with the construction of a large [[shopping center]] named Ravenswood 101—including a [[Home Depot]], a [[Best Buy]], and an [[IKEA]] store—and several upscale housing communities intended for high-earning Silicon Valley workers. This development faced opposition from some residents, who charged that it priced locals out of one of the region's only affordable communities while providing only low-paying retail jobs and consuming disproportionate land area (2.2 square miles). Supporters pointed to an increased tax base.

In 2008, after twenty years without a supermarket, East Palo Alto individuals and organizations established the East Palo Alto Community Farmers' Market.<ref>[https://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/story.php?story_id=8272 Palo Alto Online Palo Alto Weekly: An oasis in a food desert (April 16, 2008)].

==Geography==
[[File:East Palo Alto PA Airport Moffett Field P1190059.jpg|thumb|An aerial image of East Palo Alto, looking southeast towards [[Mountain View, California]]]]
East Palo Alto is located in [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]]. Despite its name, it lies almost entirely north, and not east, of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. (This may be explained by how directions on the Peninsula are traditionally defined by having Caltrain as north–south. Caltrain runs northwest–southeast in Palo Alto, so "east" would mean northeast. In addition, downtown Palo Alto is in the northwest corner of the city, so East Palo Alto is indeed northeast of downtown Palo Alto.){{Original research inline|date=May 2018}}

It is bordered on the west by [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], to the south by Palo Alto, and to the east by the [[San Francisco Bay]]. The San Francisquito Creek defines its southern edge. To the north are Ravenswood Point and the western end of the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]] in Menlo Park.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|2.5|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (4.11%) is water.
