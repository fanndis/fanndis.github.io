'''The Formation World Tour'''<ref name=Tour>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonce.com/tour/formation-world-tour/?tour_view=dates|title=The Formation World Tour|publisher=beyonce.com|date=February 7, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> was the seventh [[Concert#Concert tour|concert tour]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]] in support of her sixth studio album, ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''. The [[Stadium|all-stadium]] tour was announced following her guest appearance at the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]]. The tour started on April 27, 2016 at [[Marlins Park]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and concluded on October 7, 2016 at [[MetLife Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], comprising 49 dates. The tour's title is in reference to Beyoncé's 2016 song "[[Formation (song)|Formation]]".

The tour's production and staging consisted of a 60 foot tall rotating LED cuboid referred to as the 'Monolith', a treadmill runway and a secondary stage that stores and produces 2,000 gallons of water. The theme of the tour was described as following the same linear chapters to that of the tour's supporting album ''Lemonade'', with each rotation of the aforementioned 'Monolith' representing a new chapter of the show. Several music critics gave the show positive reviews, with a variety of publications praising both the tour's production and Beyoncé's performance and vocal abilities. The tour had a variety of notable opening acts, including a number of special guests joining prominent opener [[DJ Khaled]] on stage. Supporting acts also included artists signed to Beyoncé's own management company, [[Parkwood Entertainment]], such as the duo [[Chloe x Halle]], who were relatively unknown at the time.

The Formation World Tour ranked at #1 and #2 on ''[[Pollstar]]''<nowiki/>'s 2016 mid-year Top 100 Tours chart both in North America and worldwide respectively, with a total mid-year worldwide gross of $137.3&nbsp;million from the first 25 shows (including $126.3&nbsp;million from the first North American leg of the tour). In total, the tour grossed $256&nbsp;million from 49 sold-out shows according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore, and ranked at #2 on ''Pollstar''<nowiki/>'s 2016 Year End Tours chart.

Leading up to the tour announcement, Beyoncé was praised and criticized over her new song and [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]]-influenced costume for the Super Bowl halftime performance. As a result of this, the hashtags "#BoycottBeyonce" and "#IStandWithBeyonce" begun trending on social media platforms such as Twitter. A group of protesters also planned to stage an "anti-Beyoncé" rally outside of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s headquarters in New York City on the day general sale of tickets went for sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/09/beyonce-super-bowl-controversy/|title=Anger: Anti-Beyoncé Rally Planned For Next Week At NFL Headquarters|work=CBS New York|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}</ref> However, the planned rally was met with zero protesters and instead dozens of Beyoncé supporters who held a counter-protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/16/entertainment/beyonce-rally-feat/index.html|title=Only fans in 'Formation' at planned anti-Beyoncé rally|publisher=CNN|first=Lisa Respers|last=France|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> The tour's associated album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' was released four days prior to the start of the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-releases-new-album-lemonade-on-tidal-20160423|title= Beyoncé Releases New Album 'Lemonade' on Tidal|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|date=April 23, 2016|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> In a press release by [[Live Nation Entertainment]] following the tour's announcement, it was revealed that The Formation World Tour would be supporting local [[United Way of America]] programs, as well as the [[Flint water crisis]].

Rehearsals for the tour took place at [[Tampa]]'s [[Raymond James Stadium]], which was rented by Live Nation for $745,000. TSA board member Thomas Scott spoke on the large-scale production of the tour after seeing the stage during rehearsals, stating "that's one of the largest stages they ever put up, I don't think I've seen a stage that size". During the same rehearsal period, members of Beyoncé's team met with more than 20 Tampa leaders, including the Tampa Police Chief, for a private luncheon in [[Ybor City]], in which they discussed ways to make Tampa a better city, resulting in Beyoncé making multiple financial pledges to certain initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/music/beyonc233-preps-for-her-formation-tour-with-rehearsals-in-tampa/2274355|title=Beyoncé preps for her Formation Tour with rehearsals in Tampa|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|first=Jay|last=Cridlin|date=April 22, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>

The stage for the tour was described by Brian Levine, senior project manager from Tait Towers, as "a game-changer for what can be achieved in a stadium touring environment. The entire collaboration from scenic, to structure, to mechanics was custom-made to create an epic experience for both Beyoncé and her fans". Designed by [[Es Devlin]] and engineered and built collaboratively by [[Stageco]] and Tait Towers,<ref name="Stage 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mgmclaren.com/node/839 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918072448/http://www.mgmclaren.com/node/839 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 18, 2016 |title=Building Beyoncé's Formation Tour |work=[[Live Design]] |first=Marian |last=Sandberg |date=May 18, 2016 |accessdate=May 22, 2016 }}</ref> the tour's stage features a centrepiece of a revolving 60 foot tall box, made with video screen walls. Known as the 'Monolith', Devlin spoke on the box stating of "wanting this to be the tallest object in the stadium, a piece of kinetic stadium architecture the equivalent of a seven-story, revolving LED building". Devlin also commented the box was perceived as "a giant 3D billboard, a huge LED armor within which Beyoncé is revealed as an all-too-human-scale, real-life figure" and noted that Beyoncé was heavily involved in the creative process of every inch of stages design. The rotations of the box were said to represent a new chapter of the show, in a similar chapter line to that of ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''. The box takes approximately 4 minutes to achieve one rotation.<ref name="Stage 2">{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/beyonce-formation-world-tour/es-devlin-production-design-beyonc-s-formation-tour#slide-0-field_images-156831|title=Es Devlin On Production Design For Beyoncé's Formation Tour|work=Live Design|first=Marian|last=Sandberg|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=May 22, 2016}}</ref>

The stage also consists of a runway, which also acts as a treadmill leading onto a B-stage that fills with a pool of water. The treadmill on the catwalk was designed to be waterproof in order to withstand unpredictable weather found in outdoor stadiums. The B-stage stores 2,000 gallons of water inside of it and takes approximately 10 minutes to fill up, which occurs without the audience even realising.<ref name="Stage 1"/> The inspiration for the water within the B-stage was inspired by the tour's supporting album ''Lemonade'', in particularly the song "[[Forward (Beyoncé song)|Forward]]", as the songs message is described as a turning point from anger to forgiveness. "The pool of water is the antithesis to the fire-spitting monolith; the most joyful, redemptive sequence of the show takes place here, from "[[Freedom (Beyoncé song)|Freedom]]" through to "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]"", stated Devlin.<ref name="Stage 2"/> The tour's stage and production was said to be so large that the maximum capacity of some venues was reduced in order to make space for it. A writer for the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' stated that the maximum capacity for Beyoncé's concert in [[Dublin]] at [[Croke Park]] was reduced from 82,500 to 75,000 people to allow for the size of the stage, with event organiser Eamon Fox stating "It's a jaw-dropping production and stage show and one of the biggest that's ever been in Croke Park".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/apple-ipads-banned-at-beyonce-dublin-concert-in-croke-park-34858813.html|title=Apple iPads banned at Beyoncé Dublin concert in Croke Park|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|date=July 5, 2016|accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref>
