==History==
[[File:Transamerica building san francisco.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Transamerica Pyramid]] in [[San Francisco]]]]
In October 1904,  [[Amadeo Giannini|A.P. Giannini]] founded the Bank of Italy in [[San Francisco]] which later became known as [[Bank of America]].<ref>{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/giannini_hi.html| series=They Made America| title=Newcomers| air-date=June 9, 2004| network=[[PBS]]| station=[[WGBH-TV]]}}</ref><ref name="Transamerica about">{{cite web |url=https://www.transamerica.com/individual/why-transamerica/who-we-are/history/ |title=History |publisher=Transamerica |date=October 1, 2008 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> In 1928, Giannini put the bank into a [[holding company]] he named the Transamerica Corporation. In 1930, the company acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company, founded in 1906, and renamed it Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company.<ref>{{cite web| title=Company Profile: Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company| url=https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/companyprofile/companyprofile?event=companyProfile&doFunction=getCompanyProfile&eid=2710| publisher=California Department of Insurance| accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> Gradually, the company became a more diversified conglomerate which included the [[film distributor]] [[United Artists]],<ref>{{cite book| title=International Directory of Company Histories| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-zXAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=metro+goldwyn+mayer| volume=25| publisher=St. James Press| pages=326–330| date=January 1, 1999| accessdate=30 September 2017| isbn=978-1558623675|url-access=subscription }}</ref> [[Trans International Airlines|Transamerica Airlines]] and [[Budget Rent a Car]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Budget Car Rental Corporate History| url=https://www.budget.com/en/about-budget/company-information/milestone-events| publisher=Budget Rent A Car}}</ref>

In 1972, the company completed construction of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] skyscraper in [[San Francisco]] which served as its headquarters for many years. Although the company currently retains only a few offices in the building, the pyramid is still depicted in the company's logo and marketing materials.<ref name=facts>{{cite web| title=Pyramid Facts| url=https://www.pyramidcenter.com/tourism/pyramid-facts/| publisher=Transamerica| accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Transamerica began to divest and focused exclusively on financial services.<ref>{{cite news| title=Transamerica Plans to Divest Units: Will Sell Air Travel, Auto Rental, Manufacturing Firms| date=January 31, 1986| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-31-fi-2822-story.html| first=Victor F.| last=Zonana| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> It was eventually pared down to three main product divisions: insurance, investments and retirement. In July 1999, Transamerica CEO Frank C. Herringer announced that [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]], the [[Netherlands]]-based insurer, would acquire the company.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aegon buys Transamerica| date=February 18, 1999| url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/02/18/worldbiz/aegon/| work=[[CNNMoney]]| accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> Transamerica Occidental merged into Transamerica Life Insurance Company on October 1, 2008.

When the film ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' distributed by United Artists was released on November 19, 1980, it was a huge critical and box office failure, losing more than $44 million for UA and Transamerica. Because of this financial debacle, Transamerica sold United Artists to its current owner [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for $380 million on May 21, 1981.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
