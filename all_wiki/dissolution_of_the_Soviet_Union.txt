The '''dissolution of the Soviet Union''' (1988–1991){{Efn|{{lang-rus|Распа́д Сове́тского Сою́за|r=Raspád Sovétskovo Sojúza}}, also negatively connoted as {{lang-rus|Разва́л Сове́тского Сою́за|r=Razvál Sovétskovo Sojúza}}, ''Ruining of the Soviet Union''.}} was the process of internal [[balkanization|disintegration]] within the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], which began with growing [[Revolutions of 1989|unrest]] in its various [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics]] developing into an [[War of Laws|incessant political and legislative conflict]] between the republics and the central government, and ended when the leaders of three primal republics (the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]) [[Belovezha Accords|declared it no longer existed]], later [[Alma-Ata Protocol|accompanied by 11 more republics]], resulting in [[President of the Soviet Union|President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] having to resign and [[Soviet of Nationalities|what was left of the Soviet parliament]] formally acknowledging what had already taken place.

The failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 August Coup]], when Soviet government and military elites tried to overthrow Gorbachev and stop the "[[parade of sovereignties]]", led to the government in [[Moscow]] losing most of its influence, and many republics proclaiming independence in the following days and months. The secession of the [[Baltic states]], the first to declare their sovereignty and then their full independence, was recognized in September 1991. The Belovezha Accords were signed on December 8 by [[President of the Russian SFSR|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia, [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of Ukraine, and [[Supreme Council of Belarus|Chairman]] [[Stanislav Shushkevich]] of Belarus, recognising each other's independence and creating the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). The remaining republics, with the exception of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], joined the CIS on December 21, signing the Alma-Ata Declaration<ref name="gorbachev" /> 

On December 25, President Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, declared his office extinct, and handed over its powers—including control of the [[Cheget|nuclear launch codes]]—to Yeltsin. That evening at 7:32&nbsp;p.m., the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] was lowered from the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] for the last time and replaced with the [[Flag of Russia|Russian national flag]].<ref name = gorbachev>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/26/world/end-soviet-union-gorbachev-last-soviet-leader-resigns-us-recognizes-republics.html|title= Gorbachev, Last Soviet Leader, Resigns; U.S. Recognizes Republics' Independence|work= The New York Times|date=26 December 1991|access-date= June 7, 2020}}</ref> On the next day, the Declaration 142-Н of the Supreme Soviet's upper chamber, the Soviet of the Republics, recognised [[Self-governance|self-governing]] independence for the Soviet republics, [[Dissolution (law)|formally dissolving]] the Union.<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref>

</ref> Both the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of the [[Cold War]].

In the [[Post–Cold War era|aftermath of the Cold War]], several of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] have retained close links with Russia and formed [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] organizations such as the CIS, the [[Eurasian Economic Community]], the [[Union State]], the [[Eurasian Customs Union]], and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]], for economic and military cooperation. On the other hand, the Baltic states and the former Eastern Bloc countries joined [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], while Georgia and Ukraine have distanced themselves from Russia and express interest in following the same path.

{{see also|Glasnost|Perestroika}}
[[File:Mikhail Gorbachev 1987.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1987]]
[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] by the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] on March 11, 1985, just over four hours after predecessor [[Konstantin Chernenko]]'s death at age 73.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/12/world/chernenko-dead-moscow-73-gorbachev-succeeds-him-urges-arms-control-economic.html |title=Chernenko is Dead in Moscow at 73; Gorbachev Succeeds Him and Urges Arms Control and Economic Vigor  |work=The New York Times  |date=March 12, 1985 }}</ref> Gorbachev, aged 54, was the youngest member of the Politburo. His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the [[Soviet economy]], and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/ussr/ussr_state/gorbachev.php |title=Михаил Сергеевич Горбачёв (Mikhail Sergeyevičh Gorbačhëv)|access-date=April 3, 2009|date=March 27, 2009|publisher=Archontology }}</ref> The reforms began with personnel changes of senior [[Era of Stagnation|Brezhnev-era]] officials who would impede political and economic change.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carrere D'Encausse |first1=Helene|title=The End of the Soviet Empire: The Triumph of the Nations|url=https://archive.org/details/endofsovietemp00carr |url-access=registration |date=1993|publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09812-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/endofsovietemp00carr/page/16 16]|edition=English |translator-first= Franklin|translator-last= Philip}}</ref> On April 23, 1985, Gorbachev brought two protégés, [[Yegor Ligachev]] and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], into the Politburo as full members. He kept the "power" ministries happy by promoting KGB Head [[Viktor Chebrikov]] from candidate to full member and appointing Minister of Defence Marshal [[Sergei Sokolov (Marshal)|Sergei Sokolov]] as a Politburo candidate.

This [[liberalization]], however, fostered [[nationalist]] movements and ethnic disputes within the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R.

Under Gorbachev's leadership, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) in 1989 introduced limited competitive elections to a new central legislature, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/30/world/the-gorbachev-plan-restructuring-soviet-power.html |title=The Gorbachev Plan: Restructuring Soviet Power |work=The New York Times  |date=June 30, 1988 |access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref> (although the ban on other political parties was not lifted until 1990).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/08/opinion/the-third-russian-revolution-transforming-the-communist-party.html |title=The Third Russian Revolution; Transforming the Communist Party |work=The New York Times |date=February 8, 1990 |access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref>

On July 1, 1985, Gorbachev sidelined his main rival by removing [[Grigory Romanov]] from the Politburo and  brought [[Boris Yeltsin]] into the [[Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee Secretariat]]. On December 23, 1985, Gorbachev appointed Yeltsin [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]] replacing [[Viktor Grishin]].

=== 1986 ===
==== Sakharov ====
Gorbachev continued to press for greater [[Liberalization|liberalisation]]. On December 23, 1986, the most prominent [[Soviet dissidents|Soviet dissident]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], returned to Moscow shortly after receiving a personal telephone call from Gorbachev telling him that after almost seven years his internal [[exile]] for defying the authorities was over.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_2540000/2540121.stm |title=1986: Sakharov comes in from the cold |work=BBC News |date=December 23, 1972 |access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref>

=== 1987 ===
==== Moscow: one-party democracy ====
At the January 28–30, 1987, Central Committee [[Plenary session|plenum]], Gorbachev suggested a new policy of [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|''demokratizatsiya'']] throughout Soviet society. He proposed that future Communist Party elections should offer a choice between multiple candidates, elected by secret ballot. However, the CPSU delegates at the Plenum watered down Gorbachev's proposal, and democratic choice within the Communist Party was never significantly implemented.

Gorbachev also radically expanded the scope of ''[[Glasnost]]'', stating that no subject was off-limits for open discussion in the media.

On February 7, 1987, dozens of political prisoners were freed in the first group release since the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] in the mid-1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/world/soviet-releasing-some-prisoners-under-new-law.html |title=Soviet Releasing Some Prisoners Under New Law |work= The New York Times  |date=February 8, 1987 |access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref> 

On September 10, 1987, [[Boris Yeltsin]] wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev.<ref>O'Clery, Conor. ''Moscow December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. Transworld Ireland (2011). {{ISBN|978-1-84827-112-8}}, p. 71.</ref> At the October 27, 1987 plenary meeting of the Central Committee, Yeltsin, frustrated that Gorbachev had not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter, criticized the slow pace of reform and servility to the general secretary.<ref name="O'Clery, Conor 2011">Conor O'Clery, ''Moscow December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. Transworld Ireland (2011). {{ISBN|978-1-84827-112-8}}, p. 74</ref> In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of "political immaturity" and "absolute irresponsibility." Nevertheless, news of Yeltsin's insubordination and "secret speech" spread, and soon ''[[samizdat]]'' versions began to circulate. This marked the beginning of Yeltsin's rebranding as a rebel and rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure. The following four years of political struggle between Yeltsin and Gorbachev played a large role in the dissolution of the USSR.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/critic-of-gorbachev-offers-to-resign-his-moscow-party-post.html  | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=Critic of Gorbachev Offers to Resign His Moscow Party Post  | date=November 1, 1987}}</ref> On November 11, 1987, Yeltsin was fired from the post of [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]].

In the years leading up to the dissolution, various protests and resistance movements occurred or took hold throughout the USSR which variously were put down or tolerated. 

The CTAG ({{lang-lv|Cilvēktiesību aizstāvības grupa|lit=Human Rights Defense Group|label=}}) [[Helsinki-86]] was founded in July 1986 in the [[Latvia]]n port town of [[Liepāja]]. Helsinki-86 was the first openly [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] organization in the U.S.S.R., and the first openly organized opposition to the Soviet regime, setting an example for other ethnic minorities' pro-independence movements.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Road to Freedom|url=http://www.lvarhivs.gov.lv/Praga68/index.php?id=1050|website=The Virtual Exhibition|publisher=Latvia National Archives}}</ref>

On December 26, 1986, 300 Latvian youths gathered in Riga's Cathedral Square and marched down Lenin Avenue toward the [[Freedom Monument]], shouting, "Soviet Russia out! Free Latvia!" Security forces confronted the marchers, and several police vehicles were overturned.<ref name="ethnopolitics1" />

The ''[[Jeltoqsan]]'' ('December') of 1986 were riots in [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], sparked by Gorbachev's dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Kunaev]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and an [[Kazakhs|ethnic Kazakh]], who was replaced with [[Gennady Kolbin]], an outsider from the [[Russian SFSR]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nationalist riots in Kazakhstan: "Violent nationalist riots erupted in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, on 17 & 18 December 1986"}}</ref> Demonstrations started in the morning of December 17, 1986, with 200 to 300 students in front of the Central Committee building on [[Brezhnev Square]]. On the next day, December 18, protests turned into civil unrest as clashes between troops, volunteers, militia units, and Kazakh students turned into a wide-scale confrontation. The clashes could only be controlled on the third day. 

On May 6, 1987, [[Pamyat]], a Russian nationalist group, held an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow. The authorities did not break up the demonstration and even kept traffic out of the demonstrators' way while they marched to an impromptu meeting with Boris Yeltsin.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=May 24, 1987|title=Russian Nationalists Test Gorbachev|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/world/russian-nationalists-test-gorbachev.html|access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref> 

On July 25, 1987, 300 [[Crimean Tatars]] staged a noisy demonstration near the [[Moscow Kremlin Wall|Kremlin Wall]] for several hours, calling for the right to return to their homeland, from which they were [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deported]] in 1944; police and soldiers merely looked on.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=July 26, 1987|title=Tartars Stage Noisy Protest in Moscow|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/world/tartars-stage-noisy-protest-in-moscow.html|access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>

On August 23, 1987, the 48th anniversary of the secret protocols of the 1939 [[Molotov Pact]], thousands of demonstrators marked the occasion in the three Baltic capitals to sing independence songs and attend speeches commemorating Stalin's victims. The gatherings were sharply denounced in the official press and closely watched by the police but were not interrupted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Bill|date=August 24, 1987|title=Lithuanians Rally For Stalin Victims|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/24/world/lithuanians-rally-for-stalin-victims.html|access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>

On June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered again at Freedom Monument in [[Riga]], and laid flowers to commemorate the anniversary of [[Stalin]]'s [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|mass deportation]] of Latvians in 1941. The authorities did not crack down on demonstrators, which encouraged more and larger demonstrations throughout the Baltic States. On November 18, 1987, hundreds of police and civilian militiamen cordoned off the central square to prevent any demonstration at Freedom Monument, but thousands lined the streets of Riga in silent protest regardless.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 19, 1987|title=Latvian Protest Reported Curbed|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/world/latvian-protest-reported-curbed.html|access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref>

On October 17, 1987, about 3,000 Armenians demonstrated in [[Yerevan]] complaining about the condition of [[Lake Sevan]], the Nairit chemicals plant, and the [[Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant]], and air pollution in Yerevan. Police tried to prevent the protest but took no action to stop it once the march was underway.<ref name="afm1987">{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/49.html |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Republic of Armenia Official Site |publisher=Armeniaforeignministry.com |date=October 18, 1987 |access-date=June 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914104126/http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/49.html |archive-date=September 14, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> The following day 1,000 Armenians participated in another demonstration calling for Armenian national rights in [[Karabagh]] and the annexation of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] to Armenia.

== Timeline ==
=== 1988 ===
==== Moscow loses control ====
{{main|Parade of sovereignties}}
In 1988, Gorbachev started to lose control of two regions of the Soviet Union, as the Baltic republics were now leaning towards independence, and the Caucasus descended into violence and civil war.

On July 1, 1988, the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th Party Conference, Gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. Frustrated by the old guard's resistance, Gorbachev embarked on a set of constitutional changes to attempt separation of party and state, thereby isolating his conservative Party opponents. Detailed proposals for the new Congress of People's Deputies were published on October 2, 1988,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/world/government-in-the-soviet-union-gorbachev-s-proposal-for-change.html  | work=The New York Times | title=Government in the Soviet Union: Gorbachev's Proposal for Change | date=October 2, 1988}}</ref> and to enable the creation of the new legislature. The Supreme Soviet, during its November 29 – December 1, 1988, session, implemented amendments to the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]], enacted a law on electoral reform, and set the date of the election for March 26, 1989.<ref name="ipu.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/english/parline/reports/arc/2263%5F89.htm |title=Union of Soviet SOSocialist Republics: Parliamentary elections Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR, 1989 |publisher=Ipu.org |access-date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>

On November 29, 1988, the Soviet Union ceased to [[Radio jamming#Cold War era|jam]] all foreign radio stations, allowing Soviet citizens for the first time since a brief period in the 1960s to have unrestricted access to news sources beyond Communist Party control.<ref>[http://www.radiojamming.puslapiai.it/article_en.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== Baltic Republics ====
In 1986 and 1987, Latvia had been in the vanguard of the Baltic states in pressing for reform. In 1988 Estonia took over the lead role with the foundation of the Soviet Union's first popular front and starting to influence state policy.

The [[Estonian Popular Front]] was founded in April 1988. On June 16, 1988, Gorbachev replaced [[Karl Vaino]], the "old guard" leader of the [[Communist Party of Estonia]], with the comparatively liberal [[Vaino Väljas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3060,6601998&dq=vaino+v%C3%A4ljas&hl=en|title=Estonia Gets Hope|date=October 23, 1989|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]|page=9|access-date=March 18, 2010|location=Helsinki, Finland}}</ref> In late June 1988, Väljas bowed to pressure from the Estonian Popular Front and legalized the flying of the old blue-black-white flag of Estonia, and agreed to a new state language law that made Estonian the official language of the Republic.<ref name="ethnopolitics1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnopolitics.org/ethnopolitics/archive/volume_III/issue_3-4/ulfelder.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920084102/http://www.ethnopolitics.org/ethnopolitics/archive/volume_III/issue_3-4/ulfelder.pdf |archive-date=September 20, 2011 }}</ref>

On October 2, the Popular Front formally launched its political platform at a two-day congress. Väljas attended, gambling that the front could help Estonia become a model of economic and political revival, while moderating separatist and other radical tendencies.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/04/world/estonia-ferment-soviet-role-model-or-exception.html  | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller|author-link1=Bill Keller | title=Estonia Ferment: Soviet Role Model or Exception? | date=October 4, 1988}}</ref> On November 16, 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR adopted a declaration of national sovereignty under which Estonian laws would take precedence over those of the Soviet Union.<ref>Website of Estonian Embassy in London (National Holidays)</ref> Estonia's parliament also laid claim to the republic's natural resources including land, inland waters, forests, mineral deposits, and to the means of industrial production, agriculture, construction, state banks, transportation, and municipal services within the territory of Estonia's borders.<ref>Walker, Edward (2003).

The [[Latvian Popular Front]] was founded in June 1988. On October 4, Gorbachev replaced [[Boris Pugo]], the "old guard" leader of the [[Communist Party of Latvia]], with the more liberal Jānis Vagris. In October 1988 Vagris bowed to pressure from the Latvian Popular Front and legalized flying the former carmine red-and-white flag of independent Latvia, and on October 6 he passed a law making [[Latvian language|Latvian]] the country's official language.<ref name="ethnopolitics1"/>

The Popular Front of Lithuania, called [[Sąjūdis]] ("Movement"), was founded in May 1988. On October 19, 1988, Gorbachev replaced [[Ringaudas Songaila]], the "old guard" leader of the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]], with the relatively liberal [[Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas]]. In October 1988 Brazauskas bowed to pressure from Sąjūdis and legalized the flying of the historic yellow-green-red flag of independent Lithuania, and in November 1988 passed a law making [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] the country's official language and the former national anthem [[Tautiška giesmė]] was later reinstated.<ref name="ethnopolitics1" />

==== Rebellion in the Caucasus ====
On February 20, 1988, after a week of growing demonstrations in [[Stepanakert]], capital of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (the Armenian majority area within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]), the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia]].<ref>Pages 10–12 ''Black Garden'' de Waal, Thomas. 2003. [[NYU]]. {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}</ref> This local vote in a small, remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world; it was an unprecedented defiance of republican and national authorities. On February 22, 1988, in what became known as the "[[Askeran clash]]", thousands of Azerbaijanis marched towards Nagorno-Karabakh, demanding information about rumors of an Azerbaijani having been killed in Stepanakert. They were informed that no such incident had occurred, but refused to believe it. Dissatisfied with what they were told, thousands began marching toward Nagorno-Karabakh, massacring 50.<ref>Elizabeth Fuller, "Nagorno-Karabakh: The Death and Casualty Toll to Date," RL 531/88, Dec. 14, 1988, pp. 1–2.</ref><ref>Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War – Page 63 by Stuart J.

Gorbachev refused to make any changes to the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which remained part of Azerbaijan. He instead sacked the Communist Party Leaders in both Republics – on May 21, 1988, [[Kamran Baghirov]] was replaced by [[Abdulrahman Vezirov]] as First Secretary of the [[Azerbaijan Communist Party]]. From July 23 to September 1988, a group of Azerbaijani intellectuals began working for a new organization called the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front of Azerbaijan]], loosely based on the [[Estonian Popular Front]].<ref>Page 82 ''Black Garden'' de Waal, Thomas. 2003.

The rebellion of fellow Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh had an immediate effect in Armenia itself. Daily demonstrations, which began in the Armenian capital [[Yerevan]] on February 18, initially attracted few people, but each day the Nagorno-Karabakh issue became increasingly prominent and numbers swelled. On February 20, a 30,000-strong crowd demonstrated in the [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Theater Square]], by February 22, there were 100,000, the next day 300,000, and a transport strike was declared, by February 25, there were close to 1&nbsp;million demonstrators—more than a quarter of Armenia's population.<ref>''Black Garden'' de Waal, Thomas. 2003. NYU. {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}, p. 23</ref> This was the first of the large, peaceful public demonstrations that would become a feature of communism's overthrow in Prague, Berlin, and, ultimately, Moscow. Leading Armenian intellectuals and nationalists, including future first president of independent Armenia [[Levon Ter-Petrossian]], formed the eleven-member [[Karabakh Committee]] to lead and organize the new movement.

Gorbachev again refused to make any changes to the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, which remained part of Azerbaijan. Instead he sacked both Republics' Communist Party Leaders: On May 21, 1988, [[Karen Demirchian]] was replaced by Suren Harutyunyan as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]]. However, Harutyunyan quickly decided to run before the nationalist wind and on May 28, allowed Armenians to unfurl the red-blue-orange [[Flag of Armenia|First Armenian Republic flag]] for the first time in almost 70 years.<ref>Pages 60–61 ''Black Garden'' de Waal, Thomas. 2003.

On December 7, 1988, the [[Spitak earthquake]] struck, killing an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 people.

Beginning in February 1988, the Democratic Movement of [[Moldova]] (formerly Moldavia) organized public meetings, demonstrations, and song festivals, which gradually grew in size and intensity. In the streets, the center of public manifestations was the [[Stephen the Great Monument in Chişinău]], and the adjacent park harboring ''Aleea Clasicilor'' (The "[[Alley of Classics, Chișinău|Alley of Classics]] [of Literature]"). On January 15, 1988, in a tribute to [[Mihai Eminescu]] at his bust on the Aleea Clasicilor, [[Anatol Şalaru]] submitted a proposal to continue the meetings. In the public discourse, the movement called for national awakening, freedom of speech, revival of Moldovan traditions, and for attainment of official status for the [[Romanian language]] and return to the Latin alphabet. The transition from "movement" (an informal association) to "front" (a formal association) was seen as a natural "upgrade" once a movement gained momentum with the public, and the Soviet authorities no longer dared to crack down on it.

On April 26, 1988, about 500 people participated in a march organized by the Ukrainian Cultural Club on Kyiv's [[Khreschatyk]] Street to mark the second anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, carrying placards with slogans like "Openness and Democracy to the End." Between May and June 1988, [[Catholic Church in Ukraine|Ukrainian Catholics]] in western Ukraine celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in [[Kyivan Rus]] in secret by holding services in the forests of Buniv, [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], Hoshiv, and Zarvanytsia. On June 5, 1988, as the official celebrations of the Millennium were held in Moscow, the Ukrainian Cultural Club hosted its own observances in Kyiv at the monument to [[St. Volodymyr the Great]], the grand prince of [[Kyivan Rus]].

On June 16, 1988, 6,000 to 8,000 people gathered in Lviv to hear speakers declare no confidence in the local list of delegates to the 19th Communist Party conference, to begin on June 29. On June 21, a rally in Lviv attracted 50,000 people who had heard about a revised delegate list. Authorities attempted to disperse the rally in front of Druzhba Stadium. On July 7, 10,000 to 20,000 people witnessed the launch of the Democratic Front to Promote Perestroika. On July 17, a group of 10,000 gathered in the village [[Zarvanytsia, Terebovlia Raion|Zarvanytsia]] for Millennium services celebrated by Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Bishop Pavlo Vasylyk. The militia tried to disperse attendees, but it turned out to be the largest gathering of Ukrainian Catholics since Stalin outlawed the Church in 1946. On August 4, which came to be known as "Bloody Thursday", local authorities violently suppressed a demonstration organized by the Democratic Front to Promote Perestroika. Forty-one people were detained, fined, or sentenced to 15 days of administrative arrest. On September 1, local authorities violently displaced 5,000 students at a public meeting lacking official permission at [[Lviv University|Ivan Franko State University]].

On November 13, 1988, approximately 10,000 people attended an officially sanctioned meeting organized by the cultural heritage organization ''Spadschyna'', the [[Kyiv University]] student club ''[[Hromada]]'', and the environmental groups ''Zelenyi Svit'' ("Green World") and ''Noosfera'', to focus on ecological issues. From November 14–18, 15 Ukrainian activists were among the 100 human-, national- and religious-rights advocates invited to discuss human rights with Soviet officials and a visiting delegation of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as the Helsinki Commission). On December 10, hundreds gathered in Kyiv to observe [[International Human Rights Day]] at a rally organized by the Democratic Union. The unauthorized gathering resulted in the detention of local activists.<ref name="ukrweekly.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/330121.shtml |title=Independence: a timeline (PART I) (08/19/01) |publisher=Ukrweekly.com |access-date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>

The [[Belarusian Popular Front]] was established in 1988 as a political party and cultural movement for democracy and independence, similar to the Baltic republics’ popular fronts. The discovery of mass graves in [[Kurapaty]] outside [[Minsk]] by historian [[Zianon Pazniak]], the Belarusian Popular Front's first leader, gave additional momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/18/world/graves-of-500-stalin-victims-are-reported-outside-minsk.html | work= The New York Times | title=Graves of 500 Stalin Victims Are Reported Outside Minsk | date=August 18, 1988}}</ref> It claimed that the [[NKVD]] performed secret killings in Kurapaty.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/world/stalin-s-victims-an-uneasy-enshrinement.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=Stalin's Victims: An Uneasy Enshrinement | date=December 28, 1988}}</ref> Initially the Front had significant visibility because its numerous public actions almost always ended in clashes with the police and the [[KGB]].

=== 1989 ===
==== Moscow: limited democratization ====
Spring 1989 saw the people of the Soviet Union exercising a democratic choice, albeit limited, for the first time since 1917, when they elected the new Congress of People's Deputies. Just as important was the uncensored live TV coverage of the legislature's deliberations, where people witnessed the previously feared Communist leadership being questioned and held accountable. This example fueled a limited experiment with democracy in [[Poland]], which quickly led to the toppling of the Communist government in Warsaw that summer – which in turn sparked uprisings that overthrew communism in the other five Warsaw Pact countries before the end of 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell.

This was also the year that [[CNN]] became the first non-Soviet broadcaster allowed to beam its TV news programs to Moscow. Officially, CNN was available only to foreign guests in the [[Savoy Hotel (Moscow)|Savoy Hotel]], but Muscovites quickly learned how to pick up signals on their home televisions. That had a major impact on how Soviets saw events in their country, and made censorship almost impossible.<ref>Pages 188–189. Conor O'Clery.

[[File:RIAN archive 25981 Academician Sakharov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrei Sakharov]], formerly exiled to [[Gorky (city)|Gorky]], was elected to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] in March 1989.]]
The month-long nomination period for candidates for the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] of the USSR lasted until January 24, 1989. For the next month, selection among the 7,531 district nominees took place at meetings organized by constituency-level electoral commissions. On March 7, a final list of 5,074 candidates was published; about 85% were Party members.

In the two weeks prior to the 1,500 district polls, elections to fill 750 reserved seats of public organizations, contested by 880 candidates, were held. Of these seats, 100 were allocated to the CPSU, 100 to the [[All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]], 75 to the Communist Youth Union ([[Komsomol]]), 75 to the Committee of Soviet Women, 75 to the War and Labour Veterans' Organization, and 325 to other organizations such as the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]. The selection process was done in April.

In the March 26 general elections, voter participation was an impressive 89.8%, and 1,958 (including 1,225 district seats) of the 2,250 CPD seats were filled. In district races, run-off elections were held in 76 constituencies on April 2 and 9 and fresh elections were organized on April 20 and 14 to May 23,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/this-time-many-candidates-for-soviet-voters.html  | work=The New York Times | first=Francis X. | last=Clines | title=This Time, Many Candidates for Soviet Voters | date=May 15, 1989}}</ref> in the 199 remaining constituencies where the required absolute majority was not attained.<ref name="ipu.org" /> While most CPSU-endorsed candidates were elected, more than 300 lost to independent candidates such as Yeltsin, physicist [[Andrei Sakharov]] and lawyer [[Anatoly Sobchak]].

In the first session of the new Congress of People's Deputies, from May 25 to June 9, hardliners retained control but reformers used the legislature as a platform for debate and criticism – which was broadcast live and uncensored. This transfixed the population; nothing like this freewheeling debate had ever been witnessed in the U.S.S.R. On May 29, Yeltsin managed to secure a seat on the Supreme Soviet,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/30/world/moscow-maverick-in-shift-is-seated-in-supreme-soviet.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller|author-link1=Bill Keller | title=Moscow Maverick, in Shift, Is Seated in Supreme Soviet | date=May 30, 1989}}</ref> and in the summer he formed the first opposition, the [[Inter-Regional Deputies Group]], composed of [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] and [[Liberalism in Russia|liberals]]. Composing the final legislative group in the Soviet Union, those elected in 1989 played a vital part in reforms and the eventual breakup of the Soviet Union during the next two years.

On May 30, 1989, Gorbachev proposed that nationwide local elections, scheduled for November 1989,  be postponed until early 1990 because there were still no laws governing the conduct of such elections. This was seen by some as a concession to local Party officials, who feared they would be swept from power in a wave of anti-establishment sentiment.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/31/world/gorbachev-urges-a-postponement-of-local-voting.html | work= The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller|author-link1=Bill Keller | title=Gorbachev Urges a Postponement of Local Voting  | date=May 31, 1989}}</ref>

On October 25, 1989, the Supreme Soviet voted to eliminate special seats for the Communist Party and other official organizations in national and local elections, responding to sharp popular criticism that such reserved slots were undemocratic. After vigorous debate, the 542-member Supreme Soviet passed the measure 254-85 (with 36 abstentions). The decision required a constitutional amendment, ratified by the full congress, which met December 12–25. It also passed measures that would allow direct elections for presidents of each of the 15 constituent republics. Gorbachev strongly opposed such a move during debate but was defeated.

The vote expanded the power of republics in local elections, enabling them to decide for themselves how to organize voting. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia had already proposed laws for direct presidential elections. Local elections in all the republics had already been scheduled to take place between December and March 1990.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/25/world/soviet-legislature-votes-to-abolish-official-seats.html | work=The New York Times | first=Esther B. | last=Fein | title=Soviet Legislature Votes to Abolish Official Seats | date=October 25, 1989}}</ref>

{{main|Revolutions of 1989}}
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|thumb|The [[Eastern Bloc]]]]
The six [[Warsaw Pact]] countries of Eastern Europe, while nominally independent, were widely recognized as the [[Soviet satellite states]]. All had been occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945, had Soviet-style socialist states imposed upon them, and had very restricted freedom of action in either domestic or international affairs. Any moves towards real independence were suppressed by military force – in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968. Gorbachev abandoned the oppressive and expensive [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], which mandated intervention in the Warsaw Pact states, in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of allies – jokingly termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in a reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] was the first republic to democratize following the enactment of the [[April Novelization]], as agreed upon following the [[Polish Round Table Agreement]] talks from February to April between the government and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union, and soon the Pact began to dissolve itself. The last of the countries to end communism, [[Romanian Socialist Republic|Romania]], only did so following the violent [[Romanian Revolution]].

The [[Baltic Way]] or Baltic Chain (also Chain of Freedom {{lang-et|Balti kett}}, {{lang-lv|Baltijas ceļš}}, {{lang-lt|Baltijos kelias}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Балтийский путь}}) was a peaceful political demonstration on August 23, 1989.<ref>{{cite book| title=Central and East European Politics: From Communism to Democracy |first=Sharon L. |last=Wolchik |author2=Jane Leftwich Curry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ciKIBazTof8C&pg=PA238 |page=238 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7425-4068-2}}</ref> An estimated 2&nbsp;million people joined hands to form a [[Human chain (politics)|human chain]] extending {{convert|600|km}} across [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], which had been forcibly reincorporated into the Soviet Union in 1944.

Just months after the Baltic Way protests, in December 1989, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union |Congress of People's Deputies]] accepted—and Gorbachev signed—the report by the [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev |Yakovlev]] Commission condemning the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact which led to the annexations of the three Baltic republics.<ref>{{cite book| first=Alfred Erich |last=Senn | author-link=Alfred Erich Senn | title=Gorbachev's Failure in Lithuania | year=1995 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=0-312-12457-0|page = 78}}</ref>

In the March 1989 elections to the Congress of Peoples Deputies, 36 of the 42 deputies from Lithuania were candidates from the independent national movement [[Sąjūdis]]. This was the greatest victory for any national organization within the USSR and was a devastating revelation to the Lithuanian Communist Party of its growing unpopularity.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/02/world/communists-in-baltics-shying-from-kremlin.html  | work=The New York Times | first=Anne | last=Cooper | title=Communists in Baltics Shying From Kremlin | date=September 2, 1989}}</ref>

On December 7, 1989, the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] under the leadership of [[Algirdas Brazauskas]], split from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and abandoned its claim to have a constitutional "leading role" in politics. A smaller loyalist faction of the Communist Party, headed by hardliner [[Mykolas Burokevičius]], was established and remained affiliated with the CPSU. However, Lithuania's governing Communist Party was formally independent from Moscow's control – a first for Soviet Republics and a political earthquake that prompted Gorbachev to arrange a visit to Lithuania the following month in a futile attempt to bring the local party back under control.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/world/upheaval-east-lithuania-legalizes-rival-parties-removing-communists-monopoly.html | work=The New York Times | first=Esther B. | last=Fein | title=Upheaval in the East; Lithuania Legalizes Rival Parties, Removing Communists' Monopoly | date=December 8, 1989}}</ref> The following year, the Communist Party lost power altogether in multiparty parliamentary elections which had caused [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] to become the first non-Communist leader (Chairman of the Supreme Council of Lithuania) of Lithuania since its forced incorporation into the USSR.

On April 7, 1989, Soviet troops and armored personnel carriers were sent to [[Tbilisi]] after more than 100,000 people protested in front of Communist Party headquarters with banners calling for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to secede from the Soviet Union and for [[Abkhazia]] to be fully integrated into Georgia.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/08/world/soldiers-patrolling-soviet-georgia-amid-wave-of-nationalist-protests.html | work=The New York Times | title=Soldiers Patrolling Soviet Georgia Amid Wave of Nationalist Protests | date=April 8, 1989}}</ref> On [[April 9 tragedy|April 9, 1989]], troops attacked the demonstrators; some 20 people were killed and more than 200 wounded.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/world/at-least-16-killed-as-protesters-battle-the-police-in-soviet-georgia.html | work=The New York Times | first=Esther B. | last=Fein | title=At Least 16 Killed as Protesters Battle the Police in Soviet Georgia | date=April 10, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/26/world/kremlin-calls-georgia-violence-a-local-operation.html  |title=Kremlin Calls Georgia Violence a Local Operation |date=April 25, 1989 | access-date=June 24, 2014 | first=Esther | last=Fein }}</ref> This event radicalized Georgian politics, prompting many to conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule.

On July 16, 1989, in [[Abkhazia]]'s capital [[1989 Sukhumi riots|Sukhumi]], a protest against the opening of a Georgian university branch in the town led to violence that quickly degenerated into a large-scale inter-ethnic confrontation in which 18 died and hundreds were injured before Soviet troops restored order.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/18/world/soviet-troops-struggle-to-curb-georgia-strife.html | work= The New York Times | title=Soviet Troops Struggle To Curb Georgia Strife | date=July 18, 1989}}</ref> This riot marked the start of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.

During its second congress (June 30 – July 1, 1989), [[Ion Hadârcă]] was elected its president.

A series of demonstrations that became known as the [[Grand National Assembly, Chişinău 1989|Grand National Assembly]] ({{lang-ro|Marea Adunare Naţională}}) was the Front's first major achievement. Such mass demonstrations, including one attended by 300,000 people on August 27,<ref>Esther B.

In Ukraine, [[Lviv]] and [[Kyiv]] celebrated Ukrainian Independence Day on January 22, 1989. Thousands gathered in Lviv for an unauthorized ''[[moleben]]'' (religious service) in front of [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]]. In Kyiv, 60 activists met in a Kyiv apartment to commemorate the proclamation of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in 1918. On February 11–12, 1989, the Ukrainian Language Society held its founding congress. On February 15, 1989, the formation of the Initiative Committee for the Renewal of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] was announced. The program and statutes of the movement were proposed by the [[National Writers' Union of Ukraine|Writers Union of Ukraine]] and were published in the journal ''Literaturna Ukraina'' on February 16, 1989. The organization heralded Ukrainian dissidents such as [[Vyacheslav Chornovil]].

In late February, large public rallies took place in Kyiv to protest the election laws, on the eve of the March 26 elections to the USSR Congress of People's Deputies, and to call for the resignation of the first secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], lampooned as "the mastodon of stagnation". The demonstrations coincided with a visit to Ukraine by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. On February 26, 1989, between 20,000 and 30,000 people participated in an unsanctioned ecumenical memorial service in Lviv, marking the anniversary of the death of 19th-century Ukrainian artist and nationalist [[Taras Shevchenko]].

On March 4, 1989, the Memorial Society, committed to honoring the victims of Stalinism and cleansing society of Soviet practices, was founded in Kyiv. A public rally was held the next day. On March 12, A pre-election meeting organized in Lviv by the Ukrainian Helsinki Union and the [[Roman Catholic Marian movements and societies|Marian Society]] ''Myloserdia'' (Compassion) was violently dispersed, and nearly 300 people were detained. On March 26, elections were held to the union Congress of People's Deputies; [[by-elections]] were held on April 9, May 14, and May 21. Among the 225 Ukrainian representatives to the Congress, most were conservatives, though a handful of progressives were also elected.

From April 20–23, 1989, pre-election meetings were held in Lviv for four consecutive days, drawing crowds of up to 25,000. The action included a one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions. It was the first labor strike in Lviv since 1944. On May 3, a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in Lviv. On May 7, The Memorial Society organized a mass meeting at [[Bykivnia]], site of a mass grave of Ukrainian and Polish victims of Stalinist terror. After a march from Kyiv to the site, a memorial service was staged.

From mid-May to September 1989, Ukrainian Greek-Catholic hunger strikers staged protests on Moscow's [[Arbat]] to call attention to the plight of their Church. They were especially active during the July session of the World Council of Churches held in Moscow. The protest ended with the arrests of the group on September 18. On May 27, 1989, the founding conference of the Lviv regional Memorial Society was held. On June 18, 1989, an estimated 100,000 faithful participated in public religious services in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] in western Ukraine, responding to Cardinal [[Myroslav Lubachivsky]]'s call for an international day of prayer.

On August 19, 1989, the Russian Orthodox Parish of Saints Peter and Paul announced it would be switching to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. On September 2, 1989, tens of thousands across Ukraine protested a draft election law that reserved special seats for the Communist Party and for other official organizations: 50,000 in Lviv, 40,000 in Kyiv, 10,000 in [[Zhytomyr]], 5,000 each in [[Dniprodzerzhynsk]] and [[Chervonohrad]], and 2,000 in [[Kharkiv]]. From September 8–10, 1989, writer [[Ivan Drach]] was elected to head Rukh, the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], at its founding congress in Kyiv. On September 17, between 150,000 and 200,000 people marched in Lviv, demanding the legalization of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. On September 21, 1989, exhumation of a mass grave began in Demianiv Laz, a nature preserve south of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. On September 28, First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Ukraine]] [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], a holdover from the Brezhnev era, was replaced in this office by [[Vladimir Ivashko]].

On October 1, 1989, a peaceful demonstration of 10,000 to 15,000 people was violently dispersed by the militia in front of Lviv's Druzhba Stadium, where a concert celebrating the Soviet "reunification" of Ukrainian lands was being held. On October 10, Ivano-Frankivsk was the site of a pre-election protest attended by 30,000 people. On October 15, several thousand people gathered in [[Chervonohrad]], [[Chernivtsi]], [[Rivne]], and [[Zhytomyr]]; 500 in [[Dnipropetrovsk]]; and 30,000 in Lviv to protest the election law. On October 20, faithful and clergy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church participated in a synod in Lviv, the first since its forced liquidation in the 1930s.

On October 24, the union Supreme Soviet passed a law eliminating special seats for Communist Party and other official organizations' representatives. On October 26, twenty factories in Lviv held strikes and meetings to protest the police brutality of October 1 and the authorities' unwillingness to prosecute those responsible. From October 26–28, the ''Zelenyi Svit'' (Friends of the Earth – Ukraine) environmental association held its founding congress, and on October 27 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a law eliminating the special status of party and other official organizations as deputies of parliament.

On October 28, 1989, the Ukrainian Parliament decreed that effective January 1, 1990, Ukrainian would be the official language of Ukraine, while Russian would be used for communication between ethnic groups. On the same day The Congregation of the Church of the Transfiguration in Lviv left the Russian Orthodox Church and proclaimed itself the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. The following day, thousands attended a memorial service at Demianiv Laz, and a temporary marker was placed to indicate that a monument to the "victims of the repressions of 1939–1941" soon would be erected.

In mid-November The Shevchenko Ukrainian Language Society was officially registered. On November 19, 1989, a public gathering in Kyiv attracted thousands of mourners, friends and family to the reburial in Ukraine of three inmates of the infamous [[Gulag]] Camp No.&nbsp;36 in Perm in the [[Ural Mountains]]: human-rights activists [[Vasyl Stus]], [[Oleksiy Tykhy]], and [[Yuri Lytvyn]]. Their remains were reinterred in [[Baikove Cemetery]]. On November 26, 1989, a day of prayer and fasting was proclaimed by Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, thousands of faithful in western Ukraine participated in religious services on the eve of a meeting between Pope [[John Paul&nbsp;II]] and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev. On November 28, 1989, the Ukrainian SSR's Council for Religious Affairs issued a decree allowing Ukrainian Catholic congregations to register as legal organizations. The decree was proclaimed on December&nbsp;1, coinciding with a meeting at the Vatican between the pope and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]].

On December 10, 1989, the first officially sanctioned observance of International Human Rights Day was held in Lviv. On December 17, an estimated 30,000 attended a public meeting organized in Kyiv by Rukh in memory of Nobel laureate [[Andrei Sakharov]], who died on December 14. On December 26, the Supreme Soviet of Ukrainian SSR adopted a law designating [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], and the [[Trinity Sunday|Feast of the Holy Trinity]] official holidays.<ref name="ukrweekly.com" />

In May 1989, a Soviet dissident, [[Mustafa Dzhemilev]], was elected to lead the newly founded [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] National Movement. He also led the campaign for return of Crimean Tatars to their homeland in Crimea after 45 years of exile.
[[File:Kurapaty 1989 meeting.jpg|thumb|Meeting in [[Kurapaty]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarus]], 1989]]
On January 24, 1989, the Soviet authorities in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]] agreed to the demand of the democratic opposition (the [[Belarusian Popular Front]]) to build a monument to thousands of people shot by Stalin-era police in the Kuropaty Forest near [[Minsk]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/world/byelorussia-plans-to-build-memorial-to-stalin-s-victims.html | work= The New York Times | title=Belarus Plans to Build Memorial to Stalin's Victims | date=January 25, 1989}}</ref>

On September 30, 1989, thousands of Belarusians, denouncing local leaders, marched through Minsk to demand additional cleanup of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] site in Ukraine. Up to 15,000 protesters wearing armbands bearing radioactivity symbols and carrying the [[Flag of Belarus#White-red-white flag|banned red-and-white national flag]] used by the [[Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic|government-in-exile]] filed through torrential rain in defiance of a ban by local authorities. Later, they gathered in the city center near the government's headquarters, where speakers demanded resignation of Yefrem Sokolov, the republic's Communist Party leader, and called for the evacuation of half a million people from the contaminated zones.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/world/marchers-in-minsk-demand-further-chernobyl-cleanup.html  | work=The New York Times | title =Marchers in Minsk Demand Further Chernobyl Cleanup | date=October 1, 1989}}</ref>

==== Central Asian republics ====
Thousands of Soviet troops were sent to the [[Fergana Valley]], southeast of the Uzbek capital [[Tashkent]], to re-establish order after clashes in which local Uzbeks hunted down members of the [[Meskhetians|Meskhetian]] minority in several days of rioting between June 4–11, 1989; about 100 people were killed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/12/world/uzbekistan-riots-reported-quelled.html | work=The New York Times | title=Uzbekistan Riots Reported Quelled | date=June 12, 1989}}</ref> On June 23, 1989, Gorbachev removed [[Rafiq Nishonov]] as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Uzbek SSR]] and replaced him with Karimov, who went on to lead Uzbekistan as a Soviet Republic and subsequently as an independent state.
[[File:Nursultan Nazarbayev 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] became leader of the Kazakh SSR in 1989 and later led Kazakhstan to independence.]]
In [[Kazakhstan]] on June 19, 1989, young men carrying guns, [[Incendiary device|firebombs]], iron bars and stones rioted in [[Zhanaozen]], causing a number of deaths. The youths tried to seize a police station and a water-supply station. They brought public transportation to a halt and shut down various shops and industries.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/20/world/soviets-report-an-armed-rampage-in-kazakhstan.html | work= The New York Times | first=Esther B. | last=Fein | title=Soviets Report an Armed Rampage in Kazakhstan | date=June 20, 1989}}</ref> By June 25, the rioting had spread to five other towns near the [[Caspian Sea]]. A mob of about 150 people armed with sticks, stones and metal rods attacked the police station in Mangishlak, about 90 miles from Zhanaozen, before they were dispersed by government troops flown in by helicopters. Mobs of young people also rampaged through Yeraliev, Shepke, [[Fort-Shevchenko]] and [[Kulsary]], where they poured flammable liquid on trains housing temporary workers and set them on fire.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/26/world/rioting-youths-reportedly-attack-the-police-in-soviet-kazakhstan.html | work=The New York Times | first=Esther B. | last=Fein | title=Rioting Youths Reportedly Attack The Police in Soviet Kazakhstan | date=June 26, 1989}}</ref>

With the government and CPSU shocked by the riots, on June 22, 1989, as a result of the riots Gorbachev removed [[Gennady Kolbin]] (the ethnic Russian whose appointment caused riots in December 1986) as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] for his poor handling of the June events, and replaced him with [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], an ethnic Kazakh who went on to lead Kazakhstan as a Soviet Republic and subsequently to independence. Nazarbayev would lead Kazakhstan for 27 years until he stepped down as president on March 19, 2019.

=== 1990 ===
==== Moscow loses six republics ====
On February 7, 1990, the Central Committee of the CPSU accepted Gorbachev's recommendation that the party give up its [[One-party state|monopoly]] on political power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviet-communist-party-gives-up-monopoly-on-political-power |title=Soviet Communist Party gives up monopoly on political power: This Day in History – 2/7/1990 |publisher=History.com |access-date=June 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122002621/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviet-communist-party-gives-up-monopoly-on-political-power |archive-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1990, all fifteen constituent republics of the USSR held their first competitive elections, with reformers and [[ethnic nationalist]]s winning many seats. The CPSU lost the elections in six republics:
* In [[1990 Lithuanian parliamentary election|Lithuania]], to [[Sąjūdis]], on February 24 (run-off elections on March 4, 7, 8, and 10)
* In [[1990 Moldovan parliamentary election|Moldova]], to the [[Popular Front of Moldova]], on February 25
* In [[1990 Estonian Supreme Soviet election|Estonia]], to the [[Estonian Popular Front]], on March 18
* In [[1990 Latvian Supreme Soviet election|Latvia]], to the [[Latvian Popular Front]], on March 18 (run-off elections on March 25, April 1, and April 29)
* In [[1990 Armenian parliamentary election|Armenia]], to the [[Pan-Armenian National Movement]], on May 20 (run-off elections on June 3 and July 15)
* In [[1990 Georgian Supreme Soviet election|Georgia]], to [[Round Table-Free Georgia]], on October 28 (run-off election on November 11)

The constituent republics began to declare their national sovereignty and began a "war of laws" with the Moscow central government; they rejected union-wide legislation that conflicted with local laws, asserted control over their local economy, and refused to pay taxes. Landsbergis, Chairman of the Supreme Council of Lithuania, also exempted Lithuanian men from [[conscription|mandatory service]] in the Soviet Armed Forces. This conflict caused economic dislocation as supply lines were disrupted, and caused the [[Soviet economy]] to decline further.<ref name="Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy">Acton, Edward, (1995) ''Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy'', Longmann Group Ltd (1995) {{ISBN|0-582-08922-0}}</ref>

==== Rivalry between USSR and RSFSR ====
On March 4, 1990, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] held relatively free elections for the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia]]. [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected, representing [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], garnering 72 percent of the vote.<ref>Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page&nbsp;739–740.</ref> On May 29, 1990, Yeltsin was elected chair of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the RSFSR, despite the fact that Gorbachev asked Russian deputies not to vote for him.

Yeltsin was supported by democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet, who sought power in the developing political situation. A new power struggle emerged between the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. On June 12, 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR adopted a declaration of sovereignty. On July 12, 1990, Yeltsin resigned from the Communist Party in a dramatic speech at the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|28th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_4493000/4493177.stm |work=BBC News | title=1990: Yeltsin Resignation Splits Soviet Communists | date=July 12, 1990}}</ref>

==== Baltic republics ====
Gorbachev's visit to the Lithuanian capital [[Vilnius]] on January 11–13, 1990, provoked a pro-independence rally attended by an estimated 250,000 people.

On March 11, the newly elected parliament of the Lithuanian SSR elected [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], the leader of [[Sąjūdis]], as its chairman and proclaimed the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]], making Lithuania the first Soviet Republic to break away from the USSR. Moscow reacted with an economic blockade keeping the troops in Lithuania ostensibly "to secure the rights of [[ethnic Russian]]s".<ref>Nina Bandelj, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlhoP8snGTgC&pg=PA41 ''From Communists to Foreign Capitalists: The Social Foundations of Foreign Direct Investment in Postsocialist Europe''], [[Princeton University Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-12912-9}}, p. 41</ref>
[[File:Edgar Savisaar 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Estonia's [[Edgar Savisaar]]]]
On March 25, 1990, the [[Estonian Communist Party]] voted to split from the CPSU after a six-month transition.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/26/world/upheaval-in-the-east-party-in-estonia-votes-split-and-also-a-delay.html | work=The New York Times | title=Upheaval in the East; Party in Estonia Votes Split and Also a Delay | date=March 26, 1990}}</ref>

On March 30, 1990, the Estonian Supreme Council declared the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia]] since the Second World War to be illegal and began a period of national transition towards the formal reestablishment of national independence within the republic.

On April 3, 1990, [[Edgar Savisaar]] of the [[Popular Front of Estonia]] was elected chairman of the Council of Ministers (the equivalent of being Prime Minister), and soon a majority-pro independence cabinet was formed.
[[File:Ivars Godmanis saeima.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Latvia's [[Ivars Godmanis]]]]
Latvia [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|declared the restoration of independence]] on May 4, 1990, with the declaration stipulating a transitional period to complete independence. The Declaration stated that although Latvia had de facto lost its independence in World War II, the country had ''de jure'' remained a sovereign country because the annexation had been unconstitutional and against the will of the Latvian people. The declaration also stated that Latvia would base its relationship with the Soviet Union on the basis of the [[Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty|Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 1920]], in which the Soviet Union recognized Latvia's independence as inviolable "for all future time". May 4 is now a national holiday in Latvia.

On May 7, 1990, [[Ivars Godmanis]] of the [[Latvian Popular Front]] was elected chairman of the Council of Ministers (the equivalent of being Latvia's Prime Minister).

Оn May 8, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR adopted a law restoring the operation of the 1938 Constitution of the independent Republic of Estonia.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190906230101/http://estonia.news-city.info/docs/sistemsf/dok_ierskz.htm Закон ЭССР от 08.05.1990 "О СИМВОЛИКЕ ЭСТОНИИ"]</ref>

During the first week of January 1990, in the Azerbaijani [[exclave]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], the Popular Front led crowds in the storming and destruction of the frontier fences and watchtowers along the border with [[Iran]], and thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis crossed the border to meet their ethnic cousins in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/world/upheaval-east-azerbaijan-angry-soviet-crowd-attacks-what-left-iran-border-posts.html | work=The New York Times | title=Upheaval in the East: Azerbaijan; Angry Soviet Crowd Attacks What Is Left Of Iran Border Posts | date=January 7, 1990}}</ref> It was the first time the Soviet Union had lost control of an external border.

Late on January 19, 1990, after blowing up the central television station and cutting the phone and radio lines, 26,000 Soviet troops entered the Azerbaijani capital [[Baku]], smashing barricades, attacking protesters, and firing into crowds. On that night and during subsequent confrontations (which lasted until February), more than 130 people died. Most of these were civilians. More than 700 civilians were wounded, hundreds were detained, but only a few were actually tried for alleged criminal offenses.

Civil liberties suffered. Soviet Defence Minister [[Dmitry Yazov]] stated that the use of force in Baku was intended to prevent the ''de facto'' takeover of the Azerbaijani government by the non-communist opposition, to prevent their victory in upcoming free elections (scheduled for March 1990), to destroy them as a political force, and to ensure that the Communist government remained in power.

The army had gained control of Baku, but by January 20 it had essentially lost Azerbaijan. Nearly the entire population of Baku turned out for the mass funerals of "martyrs" buried in the Alley of Martyrs.<ref name="ReferenceB">Page 93 ''Black Garden'' de Waal, Thomas. 2003.

Deciding that it was legal, deputies prepared a declaration of independence, which Aliyeva signed and presented on January 20 on national television.

[[File:Chornovil Vyacheslav.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Viacheslav Chornovil]], a prominent Ukrainian dissident and a lead figure of [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]]]]
On January 21, 1990, [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] organized a {{convert|300|mi|km|adj=on}} human chain between Kyiv, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk. Hundreds of thousands joined hands to commemorate the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in 1918 and the reunification of Ukrainian lands one year later ([[Act Zluky|1919 Unification Act]]). On January 23, 1990, the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church]] held its first [[synod]] since its liquidation by the Soviets in 1946 (an act which the gathering declared invalid). On February 9, 1990, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice officially registered Rukh. However, the registration came too late for Rukh to stand its own candidates for the parliamentary and local elections on March 4. At the [[1990 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1990 elections]] of [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|people's deputies]] to the [[Supreme Council of Ukraine|Supreme Council]] (''Verkhovna Rada''), candidates from the [[Democratic Bloc (Ukraine)|Democratic Bloc]] won landslide victories in [[Western Ukraine|western Ukrainian oblasts]]. A majority of the seats had to hold run-off elections. On March 18, Democratic candidates scored further victories in the run-offs. The Democratic Bloc gained about 90 out of 450 seats in the new parliament.

On April 6, 1990, the Lviv City Council voted to return [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George Cathedral]] to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] refused to yield. On April 29–30, 1990, the [[Ukrainian Helsinki Group|Ukrainian Helsinki Union]] disbanded to form the [[Ukrainian Republican Party]]. On May 15 the new parliament convened. The bloc of conservative communists held 239 seats; the Democratic Bloc, which had evolved into the National Council, had 125 deputies. On June 4, 1990, two candidates remained in the protracted race for parliament chair. The leader of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU), [[Vladimir Ivashko|Volodymyr Ivashko]], was elected with 60 percent of the vote as more than 100 opposition deputies boycotted the election. On June 5–6, 1990, Metropolitan [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)|Mstyslav]] of the U.S.-based [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] was elected patriarch of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) during that Church's first synod. The UAOC declared its full independence from the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, which in March had granted autonomy to the Ukrainian Orthodox church headed by the Metropolitan [[Filaret (Denysenko)|Filaret]].

[[File:Leonid Kravchuk.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leonid Kravchuk]] became Ukraine's leader in 1990.]]
On June 22, 1990, [[Vladimir Ivashko|Volodymyr Ivashko]] withdrew his candidacy for leader of the Communist Party of Ukraine in view of his new position in parliament. [[Stanislav Hurenko]] was elected first secretary of the CPU. On July 11, Ivashko resigned from his post as chairman of the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] after he was elected deputy general secretary of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The Parliament accepted the resignation a week later, on July 18. On July 16 Parliament overwhelmingly approved the Declaration on State Sovereignty of Ukraine – with a vote of 355 in favour and four against. The people's deputies voted 339 to 5 to proclaim July 16 a Ukrainian national holiday.

On July 23, 1990, [[Leonid Kravchuk]] was elected to replace Ivashko as parliament chairman. On July 30, Parliament adopted a resolution on military service ordering Ukrainian soldiers "in regions of national conflict such as Armenia and Azerbaijan" to return to Ukrainian territory. On August&nbsp;1, Parliament voted overwhelmingly to shut down the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. On August 3, it adopted a law on the economic sovereignty of the Ukrainian republic. On August 19, the first Ukrainian Catholic liturgy in 44 years was celebrated at St. George Cathedral. On September 5–7, the International Symposium on the [[Holodomor|Great Famine of 1932–1933]] was held in Kyiv. On September 8, The first "Youth for Christ" rally since 1933 took place held in Lviv, with 40,000 participants. In September 28–30, the [[Party of Greens of Ukraine|Green Party of Ukraine]] held its founding congress. On September 30, nearly 100,000 people marched in Kyiv to protest against the new union treaty proposed by Gorbachev.

On October 1, 1990, parliament reconvened amid mass protests calling for the resignations of Kravchuk and of Prime Minister [[Vitaliy Masol]], a leftover from the previous régime. Students erected a tent city on [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|October Revolution Square]], where they continued the protest.

On October 17 Masol resigned, and on October 20, [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)|Patriarch Mstyslav&nbsp;I]] of Kyiv and all Ukraine arrived at [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kyiv|Saint Sophia's Cathedral]], ending a 46-year banishment from his homeland. On October 23, 1990, Parliament voted to delete Article&nbsp;6 of the Ukrainian Constitution, which referred to the "leading role" of the Communist Party.

On October 25–28, 1990, Rukh held its second congress and declared that its principal goal was the "renewal of independent statehood for Ukraine". On October 28 UAOC faithful, supported by Ukrainian Catholics, demonstrated near St. Sophia's Cathedral as newly elected Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Aleksei and Metropolitan Filaret celebrated liturgy at the shrine. On November 1, the leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, respectively, Metropolitan Volodymyr Sterniuk and Patriarch Mstyslav, met in Lviv during anniversary commemorations of the 1918 proclamation of the [[Western Ukrainian National Republic]].

On November 18, 1990, the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] enthroned Mstyslav as Patriarch of Kyiv and all Ukraine during ceremonies at Saint Sophia's Cathedral. Also on November 18, [[Canada]] announced that its consul-general to Kyiv would be Ukrainian-Canadian Nestor Gayowsky. On November 19, the United States announced that its consul to Kyiv would be Ukrainian-American John Stepanchuk. On November 19, the chairmen of the Ukrainian and Russian parliaments, respectively, Kravchuk and Yeltsin, signed a 10-year bilateral pact. In early December 1990 the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine was founded; on December 15, the [[Democratic Party of Ukraine]] was founded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2001/340119.shtml|title=Independence: a timeline (CONCLUSION) (08/26/01)|publisher=Ukrweekly.com|access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref>

On January 13, 1991, Soviet troops, along with the [[KGB]] [[Spetsnaz]] [[Alpha Group]], [[Vilnius massacre|stormed the Vilnius TV Tower]] in Lithuania to suppress the independence movement. Fourteen unarmed civilians were killed and hundreds more injured. On the night of July 31, 1991, Russian [[OMON]] from [[Riga]], the Soviet military headquarters in the Baltics, [[Soviet OMON assaults on Lithuanian border posts|assaulted the Lithuanian border post]] in Medininkai and killed seven Lithuanian servicemen.

The bloody attacks in Lithuania prompted Latvians to organize defensive barricades (the events are still today known as "[[The Barricades]]") blocking access to strategically important buildings and bridges in Riga. Soviet attacks in the ensuing days resulted in six deaths and several injuries; one person died later of their wounds.

Оn February 9, Lithuania held an independence [[1991 Lithuanian independence referendum|referendum]] with 93.2% votes. 

On March 3, 1991, a [[1991 Estonian independence referendum|referendum]] was held on the independence of the Republic of Estonia, which was attended by those who lived in Estonia before the Soviet annexation and their descendants, as well as persons who have received the so-called "green cards" of the Congress of Estonia.<ref>''Маркедонов Сергей'' [https://polit.ru/article/2011/04/01/ussr/ Референдум распада]</ref> 77.8% of those who voted supported the idea of restoring independence.<ref>[http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1985-1991_Restoration_of_independence/The_road_to_independence/ The road to independence]</ref>

When Estonia reaffirmed its independence during the coup (see below) in the dark hours of August 20, 1991, at 11:03 pm Tallinn time, many Estonian volunteers surrounded the [[Tallinn TV Tower]] in an attempt to prepare to cut off the communication channels after the Soviet troops seized it and refused to be intimidated by the Soviet troops. When [[Edgar Savisaar]] confronted the Soviet troops for ten minutes, they finally retreated from the TV tower after a failed resistance against the Estonians.

==== August Coup ====
{{main|1991 August Coup}}
[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|Tanks in [[Red Square]] during the 1991 August coup attempt]]
Faced with growing [[separatism]], Gorbachev sought to restructure the Soviet Union into a less centralized state. On August 20, 1991, the Russian SFSR was scheduled to sign a [[Union of Sovereign States|New Union Treaty]] that would have converted the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|federation of independent republics]] with a common president, foreign policy and military. It was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, which needed the economic advantages of a common market to prosper. However, it would have meant some degree of continued Communist Party control over economic and social life.

More radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required, even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the Soviet Union into several independent states. Independence also accorded with Yeltsin's desires as president of the Russian Federation, as well as those of regional and local authorities to get rid of Moscow's pervasive control. In contrast to the reformers' lukewarm response to the treaty, the conservatives, "patriots", and Russian nationalists of the USSR – still strong within the CPSU and the military – were opposed to weakening the Soviet state and its centralized power structure.

On August 19, 1991, Gorbachev's vice president, [[Gennady Yanayev]], Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]], Defense Minister [[Dmitry Yazov]], KGB chief [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] and other senior officials acted to prevent the union treaty from being signed by forming the "General Committee on the State Emergency", which put Gorbachev – on holiday in [[Foros, Ukraine|Foros]], [[Crimea]] – under house arrest and cut off his communications. The coup leaders issued an emergency decree suspending political activity and banning most newspapers.

Thousands of Muscovites came out to defend the [[White House, Moscow|White House]] (the Russian Federation's parliament and Yeltsin's office), the symbolic seat of Russian sovereignty at the time. The organizers tried but ultimately failed to arrest Yeltsin, who rallied opposition to the coup by making speeches from atop a tank. The special forces dispatched by the coup leaders took up positions near the White House, but members refused to storm the barricaded building. The coup leaders also neglected to jam foreign news broadcasts, so many Muscovites watched it unfold live on [[CNN]]. Even the isolated Gorbachev was able to stay abreast of developments by tuning into the BBC World Service on a small transistor radio.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gerbner |first=George |author-link=George Gerbner |title=Instant History: The Case of the Moscow Coup |url=http://www.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=883 |date=1993 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116221008/http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID%3D883 |archive-date=January 16, 2015 |journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=193–203 |issn=1058-4609 |access-date=24 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all |doi=10.1080/10584609.1993.9962975 }}</ref>

After three days, on August 21, 1991, the coup collapsed. The organizers were detained and Gorbachev was reinstated as president, albeit with his power much depleted.

On August 24, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the general secretary the Central Committee of the CPSU<ref>[http://www.illuminats.ru/component/content/article/29-new/1198-statement-by-mikhail-gorbachev-on-the-addition-of-duties-the-secretary-general-of-the-cpsu-24-august-1991?directory=29 Заявление М. С. Горбачева о сложение обязанностей генерального секретаря ЦК КПСС (24 августа 1991)]</ref> and dissolved all party units in the government. On the same day, the [[Verkhovna Rada|Supreme Council of Ukraine]] passed a [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]. Five days later, the Supreme Soviet indefinitely suspended all CPSU activity on Soviet territory, effectively ending Communist rule in the Soviet Union and dissolving the only remaining unifying force in the country (On 6 November, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all Communist Party activities on Russian<ref>[http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/385 Указ Президента РСФСР от 6 ноября 1991 г. № 169 «О деятельности КПСС и КП РСФСР»]</ref>). Gorbachev established a [[State Council of the Soviet Union]] on 5 September, designed to bring him and the highest officials of the remaining republics into a collective leadership, able to appoint a [[premier of the Soviet Union]]; it never functioned properly, though [[Ivan Silayev]] ''de facto'' took the post through the [[Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy]] and the [[Inter-Republican economic committee of the USSR|Inter-Republican Economic Committee]] and tried to form [[Silayev's Government|a government]], though with rapidly shrinking powers.

The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed in the last quarter of 1991. Ukraine was the first of 10 republics to secede from the Union between August and December, largely out of fear of another coup. By the end of September, Gorbachev no longer had the ability to influence events outside of Moscow.  He was challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had begun taking over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Kremlin.

On September 17, 1991, [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|General Assembly resolution]] numbers 46/4, 46/5, and 46/6 admitted Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the [[United Nations]], conforming to [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]] numbers [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 709|709]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 710|710]], and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 711|711]] passed on September 12 without a vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/1991.shtml|title=Resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council in 1991|work=[[United Nations]]|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.un.org/en/docs/ga/quick/regular/46|title=46th Session (1991–1992) – General Assembly – Quick Links – Research Guides at United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld Library|work=[[United Nations]]|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref>

The final round of the Soviet Union's collapse began on December 1, 1991. That day, a [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|Ukrainian popular referendum]] resulted in 91 percent of Ukraine's voters voting to affirm the independence declaration passed in August and formally secede from the Union. The secession of Ukraine, long second only to Russia in economic and political power, ended any realistic chance of Gorbachev keeping the Soviet Union together even on a limited scale. The leaders of the three Slavic republics, Russia, Ukraine, and [[Belarus]] (formerly Byelorussia), agreed to discuss possible alternatives to the union.

On December 8, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus secretly met in [[Belavezhskaya Pushcha]], in western Belarus, and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which proclaimed the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and announced formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) as a looser association to take its place.  They also invited other republics to join the CIS. Gorbachev called it an unconstitutional coup.  However, by this time there was no longer any reasonable doubt that, as the preamble of the Accords put it, "the USSR, as a subject of [[international law]] and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence."

On December 12, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] formally ratified the Belavezha Accords,<ref>[http://base.garant.ru/10164306/ Постановление Верховного Совета РСФСР от 12 декабря 1991 года № 2014-I «О ратификации Соглашения о создании Содружества Независимых Государств»]</ref> denounced the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|1922 Union Treaty]],<ref>[https://www.lawmix.ru/abrolaw/13907 Постановление Верховного Совета РСФСР от 12 декабря 1991 года № 2015-I «О денонсации Договора об образовании СССР»]</ref> and recalled the Russian deputies from the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]]. The legality of this ratification raised doubts among some members of the Russian parliament, since according to the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978 consideration of this document was in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR.<ref>''V.Pribylovsky, Gr.Tochkin'' [http://sssr.net.ru/denons.html .

Any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect, since the Soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before December.

On December 17, 1991, along with 28 European countries, the [[European Economic Community]], and four non-European countries, the three Baltic Republics and nine of the twelve remaining Soviet republics signed the [[European Energy Charter]] in [[the Hague]] as sovereign states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf#page=211|title=Concluding document of The Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter|access-date=December 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073327/http://www.encharter.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/EN.pdf#page=211|archive-date=October 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Doubts remained over whether the Belavezha Accords had legally dissolved the Soviet Union, since they were signed by only three republics. However, on December 21, 1991, representatives of 11 of the 12 remaining republics – all except [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] – signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the dissolution of the Union and formally established the CIS. They also "accepted" Gorbachev's resignation. Even at this moment, Gorbachev hadn't made any formal plans to leave the scene yet. However, with a majority of republics now agreeing that the Soviet Union no longer existed, Gorbachev bowed to the inevitable, telling CBS News that he would resign as soon as he saw that the CIS was indeed a reality.<ref>Francis X. Clines, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/world/end-soviet-union-11-soviet-states-form-commonwealth-without-clearly-defining-its.html "11 Soviet States Form Commonwealth Without Clearly Defining Its Powers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 22, 1991.</ref> 

In a nationally televised speech in the evening of December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR – or, as he put it, "I hereby discontinue my activities at the post of President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." He declared the office extinct, and all of its powers (such as control of the nuclear arsenal) were ceded to Yeltsin. A week earlier, Gorbachev had met with Yeltsin and accepted the ''[[Point of no return|fait accompli]]'' of the Soviet Union's dissolution. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR adopted a statute to change Russia's legal name from "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic" to "Russian Federation", showing that it was now a fully sovereign state.

On the night of December 25, at 7:32&nbsp;p.m. Moscow time, after Gorbachev left the Kremlin, the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] was lowered  and the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] was played for the last time, and the [[Flag of Russia|Russian tricolor]] was raised in its place at 11:40&nbsp;pm, symbolically marking the end of the Soviet Union. In his parting words, Gorbachev defended his record on domestic reform and [[détente]], but conceded, "The old system collapsed before a new one had time to start working."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|isbn=9780199371020|pages=323–324|oclc=907585907|date = 2015-06-26}}</ref> On that same day, the [[President of the United States]] [[George H.W. Bush]] held a brief televised speech officially recognizing the independence of the 11 remaining republics.

On December 26, the {{ill|Soviet of Republics|ru|Совет Республик Верховного Совета СССР|lt=Soviet of Republics}}, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, voted the Soviet Union out of existence<ref>[http://vedomosti.sssr.su/1991/52/#1561 Декларация Совета Республик Верховного Совета СССР в связи с созданием Содружества Независимых Государств от 26 декабря 1991 года № 142-Н]</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&q=26+december+1991+ussr&pg=PR5 | title=Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States: Documents, Data, and Analysis| isbn=9781563246371| last1=Brzezinski| first1=Zbigniew| last2=Brzezinski| first2=Zbigniew K.| last3=Sullivan| first3=Paige| year=1997}}</ref> (the lower chamber, the [[Council of the Union]], had been unable to work since December 12, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a [[quorum]]).  The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier. By the end of 1991, the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation, and individual republics assumed the central government's role.

The Alma-Ata Protocol also addressed other issues, including UN membership. Notably, Russia was authorized to assume the Soviet Union's UN membership, including its permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Ambassador to the UN delivered a letter signed by Russian President Yeltsin to the [[UN Secretary-General]] dated December 24, 1991, informing him that by virtue of the Alma-Ata Protocol, Russia was the successor state to the USSR. After being circulated among the other UN member states, with no objection raised, the statement was declared accepted on the last day of the year, December 31, 1991.

=== Sports ===
The breakup of the Soviet Union saw a massive impact in the sporting world. Before its dissolution, the [[Soviet Union national football team|football team]] had just qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], but their place was instead taken by the [[CIS national football team]]. After the tournament, the former Soviet Republics competed as separate independent nations, with FIFA allocating the Soviet team's record to [[Russia national football team|Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.rfs.ru/rfs/information/general/history/ |title=History of the Football Union of Russia |access-date=2016-06-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909203359/http://en.rfs.ru/rfs/information/general/history/ |archive-date=September 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all |website=Russian Football Union }}</ref>

Before the start of the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville]] and the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Barcelona]], ''The Olympic Committee of the USSR'' formally existed until March 12, 1992, when it disbanded but it was succeeded by the [[Russian Olympic Committee]]. However, 12 of the 15 former Soviet Republics competed together as the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] and marched under the [[Olympic Flag]] in Barcelona, where they finished first in the medal rankings. Separately, [[Lithuania at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Lithuania]], [[Latvia at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Latvia]], and [[Estonia at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Estonia]] also competed as independent nations in the 1992 Games. The Unified Team also competed in Albertville earlier in the year (represented by six of the twelve ex-Republics), and finished second in the medal ranking at those Games. Afterwards, the individual IOCs of the non-Baltic former republics were established. Some NOCs made their debuts at the [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer]], while others made it at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta]].

Members of the Unified Team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona consisted of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], Russia, [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. In these Summer Games, the Unified Team secured 45 gold medals, 38 silver medals, and 29 bronze medals to beat second place United States by four medals, and third place Germany by 30 medals. In addition to great team success, the Unified Team also saw great personal success. [[Vitaly Scherbo]] of Belarus was able to secure six gold medals for the team in gymnastics, while also becoming the most decorated athlete of the Summer Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/barcelona-1992|title=Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics - results & video highlights|date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Gymnastics, athletics, wrestling, and swimming were the strongest sports for the team, as the four combined earned 28 gold medals and 64 medals in total.

Only six teams competed earlier in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. These countries were Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The Unified team placed second, losing to Germany by three medals. However, much like the summer games, the Unified team had the most decorated medalist in the Winter Games as well with [[Lyubov Yegorova (cross-country skier)|Lyubov Yegorova]] of Russia, a figure skater with five total medals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/albertville-1992|title=Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics - results & video highlights|date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

=== Telecommunications ===
The Soviet Union's [[List of country calling codes|calling code]] of [[Telephone numbers in the Soviet Union|+7]] continues to be used by [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. Between 1993 and 1997, many newly independent republics implemented their own [[Telephone numbering plan|numbering plans]] such as [[Belarus]] ([[Telephone numbers in Belarus|+375]]) and [[Ukraine]] ([[Telephone numbers in Ukraine|+380]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The [[Domain name|Internet domain]] ''[[.su]]'' remains in use alongside the internet domains of the newly created countries.

=== United Nations membership ===
In a letter dated December 24, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the [[President of Russia|President of the Russian Federation]], informed the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] that the membership of the Soviet Union in the Security Council and all other UN organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

However, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] had already joined the UN as original members on October 24, 1945, together with the Soviet Union. After declaring independence, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic changed its name to [[Ukraine]] on August 24, 1991 and on September 19, 1991, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic informed the UN that it had changed its name to the [[Belarus|Republic of Belarus]].

The other twelve independent states established from the former Soviet Republics were all admitted to the UN:
* 17 September 1991: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
* 2 March 1992: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan
* 31 July 1992: Georgia

== Explanations in historiography ==
Historiography on Soviet dissolution can be roughly classified in two groups, namely [[Intentionalist historian|intentionalist]] accounts and [[Structuralism|structuralist]] accounts.

Intentionalist accounts contend that Soviet collapse was not inevitable and resulted from the policies and decisions of specific individuals (usually Gorbachev and Yeltsin). One characteristic example of intentionalist writing is historian [[Archie Brown]]'s ''The Gorbachev Factor'', which argues Gorbachev was the main force in Soviet politics at least in the period 1985–1988 and even later largely spearheaded the political reforms and developments as opposed to being led by events.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gorbachev Factor|last=Brown|first=Archie|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19288-052-9|location=Oxford|url=https://archive.org/details/gorbachevfactor00brow_0}}</ref> This was especially true of the policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'', market initiatives and [[foreign policy]] stance as political scientist [[George W. Breslauer|George Breslauer]] has seconded, labelling Gorbachev a "man of the events."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gorbachev and Yeltsin as Leaders|last=Breslauer|first=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0521892445|location=Cambridge|pages=274–275}}</ref> In a slightly different vein, David Kotz and Fred Weir have contended that Soviet elites were responsible for spurring on both nationalism and capitalism from which they could personally benefit (this is also demonstrated by their continued presence in the higher economic and political echelons of post-Soviet republics).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kotz, David and Fred Weir|title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union was a Revolution from Above|journal=The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union|pages=155–164}}</ref>

By contrast, structuralist accounts take a more deterministic view in which Soviet dissolution was an outcome of deeply-rooted structural issues, which planted a "time-bomb." For example, Edward Walker has argued that while minority nationalities were denied power at the Union level, confronted by a culturally-destabilizing form of economic [[Modernization theory|modernization]] and subjected to a certain amount of [[Russification]], they were at the same time strengthened by several policies pursued by the Soviet government (e.g. [[indigenization]] of leadership, support for local languages, etc.) which over time created conscious nations. Furthermore, the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet Union's federative system—that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples – eased the task of secession and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dissolution: Sovereignty and the Breakup of the Soviet Union|last=Edward|first=Walker|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2003 |isbn= 978-0-74252-453-8|location=Oxford|page=185|url=https://archive.org/details/dissolutionsover00walk}}</ref> On 25 January 2016, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the [[right of secession]] for the Soviet Republics a "delay-action bomb".{{cn|date=December 2020}}

An opinion piece by Gorbachev written in April 2006 stated: "[[Chernobyl disaster|The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl]] 20 years ago this month, even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/chernobyl-disaster-timeline|title=Chernobyl Disaster: The Meltdown by the Minute|first=Jesse|last=Greenspan|website=HISTORY}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Japan Times|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2006/04/21/commentary/world-commentary/turning-point-at-chernobyl/|title=Turning point at Chernobyl|first=Mikhail|last=Gorbachev|date=21 April 2006}}</ref>
