'''''BRW''''' (formerly '''''Business Review Weekly''''') was an [[Australia]]n business magazine published by the [[Fairfax Media]] group. The magazine was headquartered in Melbourne.<ref>{{cite book|title=Business review weekly: BRW|work=WorldCat|oclc=10249354}}</ref> It regularly compiled lists which rank corporations and individuals according to various criteria, similar to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in the [[United States]]. ''BRW'' provided news and commentary on the economy, business and investment in Australia. The magazine reported on successful business strategies, investments and entrepreneurialism. Cover stories and features concentrated on ways to make money and improve businesses. Each week ''BRW'' focused on a sector or topic relevant to business people or investors.
