</ref> {{lang-rm|{{Audio|Roh-Tavau.ogg|Tavau|help=no}}}}; archaic {{lang-it|Tavate}}) is an [[List of towns in Switzerland|Alpine town]], and a [[Municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] in the [[Prättigau/Davos Region]] in the [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]]. It has a permanent population of {{Swiss populations |CH-GR|3851}} ({{Swiss populations Y|CH-GR}}).{{Swiss populations ref|CH-GR}} Davos is located on the river [[Landwasser]], in the [[Rhaetian Alps]], between the [[Plessur Range|Plessur]] and [[Albula Range]] at {{convert|1560|m|abbr= on}} above sea level.

The former [[Alps|Alpine]] resort village consists of two parts: Davos Dorf (literally: "Davos village") to the northeast towards [[Klosters]] and further down through the [[Prättigau]] to [[Landquart, Graubünden|Landquart]], and Davos Platz (literally: "place") to the southwest, which opens into the valley of the river [[Landwasser]] and eventually leads to [[Filisur]].

During summer season the [[Flüela Pass]] leads south-east into the [[Lower Engadine]].

Davos plays host to the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), an annual meeting of global political and business elites (often referred to simply as "Davos"), and has one of Switzerland's biggest [[ski resort]]s. At the end of every year it serves as the site of the annual [[Spengler Cup]] [[ice-hockey]] tournament, hosted by the [[HC Davos]] local hockey team.

==History==
[[File:ETH-BIB-Davos-Dorf, Davos-Platz, Tinzenhorn v. N. O. aus 300 m-Inlandflüge-LBS MH01-003844.tif|thumb|left|Aerial view from 300&nbsp;m by [[Walter Mittelholzer]] (1923)]]
The current settlement of the Davos area began in the [[High Middle Ages]] with the immigration of [[Romansh language|Rhaeto-Romans]]. The village of Davos is first mentioned in 1213 as ''Tavaus''.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|1571|Davos}}</ref> From about 1280 the barons of [[Vaz/Obervaz|Vaz]] allowed German-speaking [[Walser]] colonists to settle, and conceded them extensive self-administration rights, causing Davos to become the largest Walser settlement area in eastern Switzerland. Natives still speak a [[dialect]] that is atypical for Graubünden, showing similarities with German idioms of western parts of Switzerland, especially the Upper [[Valais#Demographics|Valais]].

In 1436, the [[League of the Ten Jurisdictions]] was founded in Davos.

[[File:Bobfahrer Davos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bobsled]] team in Davos, 1910]]

From the middle of the 19th century, Davos modeled on [[Sokołowsko]] became a popular destination for the sick and ailing because the [[microclimate]] in the high valley was deemed excellent by doctors (initiated by [[Alexander Spengler]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davos.ch/en/stay/davos-klosters/history/alexander-spengler.html|title=Alexander Spengler Davos Klosters|access-date=1 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410060952/http://www.davos.ch/en/stay/davos-klosters/history/alexander-spengler.html|archive-date=10 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>) and recommended for [[lung disease]] patients. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], who suffered from [[tuberculosis]], wintered in Davos in 1880 upon the recommendation of his Edinburgh physician Dr. George Balfour. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote an article about skiing in Davos in 1899. A sanatorium in Davos is also the inspiration for the Berghof Sanitorium in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''Der Zauberberg'' (''[[The Magic Mountain]]''). Between 1936 and 1938, [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], then at the end of his life and living in Davos since 1917, depicted Davos and the Junkerboden. His painting has a both [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[pantheistic]] atmosphere and simplified formal structure.

During the ''natural ice'' era of [[winter sport]]s, Davos and the ''[[Davos Eisstadion]]'' were a mecca for [[speed skating]]. Many international championships were held here, and many world records were set, beginning with [[Peder Østlund]] who set four records in 1898. The only European [[Bandy]] Championship was held in the town in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/2049/English/Switzerland.html|title=Switzerland|date=28 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028160240/http://geocities.com/Colosseum/Track/2049/English/Switzerland.html|archive-date=28 October 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, Davos became a ski resort, especially frequented by tourists from the United Kingdom and the [[Netherlands]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} After peaking in the 1970s and 1980s, the city settled down as a leading but less high-profile tourist attraction.

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[File:Luftbild Davos2.jpg|thumb|left|View of Davos from [[paraglider]] looking southwest]]
[[File:Luftbild Davos.jpg|thumb|left|Davos from the air looking north with Schatzalp and Parsenn ski areas]]
Davos has an area (as of the 2004/09 survey) of {{Swiss area|3851|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|3851|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 35.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.2% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 2.3% is settled (buildings or roads) and 40.5% is unproductive land.  In the 2004/09 survey a total of {{convert|337|ha|acre|abbr=on}} or about 1.2% of the total area was covered with buildings, an increase of {{convert|61|ha|acre|abbr=on}} over the 1985 amount.  Over the same time period, the amount of recreational space in the municipality increased by {{convert|10|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and is now about 0.22% of the total area.  Of the agricultural land, {{convert|1296|ha|acre|abbr=on}} is fields and grasslands and {{convert|9056|ha|acre|abbr=on}} consists of alpine grazing areas. Since 1985 the amount of agricultural land has decreased by {{convert|736|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.  Over the same time period the amount of forested land has increased by {{convert|481|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.  Rivers and lakes cover {{convert|285|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in the municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/raum-umwelt/bodennutzung-bedeckung.gnpdetail.2016-0436.html |title=Arealstatistik Land Use - Gemeinden nach 10 Klassen |date=24 November 2016 |website=www.landuse-stat.admin.ch |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |access-date=27 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=SFSO2016>[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/regionalstatistik/regionale-portraets-kennzahlen/gemeinden/daten-erlaeuterungen.assetdetail.328115.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office - Regional portraits] accessed 27 October 2016</ref>

Until 2017 the municipality was located in the Davos subdistrict of the Prättigau/Davos district, after 2017 it was part of the Prättigau/Davos Region.<ref>[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/grundlagen/agvch.assetdetail.1666963.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office - Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz - Mutationsmeldungen 2016] accessed 16 February 2017.</ref> It is in the [[Landwasser (river)|Landwasser Valley]]. In terms of area, it was the largest municipality in Switzerland until the formation of the municipality of [[Glarus Süd]] in 2010, and is the largest in the canton of Graubünden.

It consists of the village of Davos, with its two parts Davos Dorf (Davos-Village, northeast) and Davos Platz (Davos-Place, southwest), and the villages Frauenkirch, Davos Glaris, [[Davos Wiesen]], Davos Monstein, and Davos Clavadel, and the [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of Laret, Wolfgang, Obem See, Meierhof, Stilli, Bünda, and Spina in the main valley. In the side valleys there are additional hamlets including Tschuggen, Dörfji, In den Büelen, Hof, Teufi, Gadmen, Am Rin, Dürrboden, Sertig Dörfli, Oberalp, Inneralp.

Davos lies in a high valley, the connection to Klosters needing the [[Wolfgang Pass]] of only some 70 metres ascent from Davos Dorf. This tiny pass results in a flow direction of the river not corresponding to the main traffic routes of road and [[Rhätische Bahn]] to the northeast but flowing in a southwesterly direction. Three long side valleys reach out to the south from the main valley.

===Climate===
Davos has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfc'') with an average of 124.7 days of precipitation per year and on average receives {{convert|1022|mm|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

The wettest month is August during which time Davos receives an average of {{convert|148|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 13.5 days. The month with the most days of precipitation is June, with an average of 13.6, but with only {{convert|126|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation. The driest month of the year is April with an average of {{convert|56|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation over 9.6 days, of which {{convert|50.9|cm|abbr=on}} in 8.5 days are snowfall.<ref name=MeteoSwiss/>

==Politics==

===Subdivisions===
The municipality of Davos is divided into five ''Fraktionsgemeinden'' (which are also former municipalities): Davos Dorf, Davos Platz, Davos Frauenkirch, Davos Glaris, Davos Monstein, and [[Davos Wiesen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gemeindedavos.ch/de/politikverwaltung/politik/fraktionen/ |title=Fraktionsgemeinden |publisher=Gemeinde Davos |language=German |location=Davos, Switzerland |type=official website |access-date=2015-12-30}}</ref>

===Government===
The Small Country Council (''Kleiner Landrat'') constitutes the [[Executive (government)|executive government]] of the municipality of Davos and operates as a [[collegiate authority]]. It is composed of five councilors ({{lang-de|Landrat/-rätin}}), each presiding over a department (''Departement'') comprising several bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as president of the municipality (''Landammann'' or ''Gemeindepräsident''). In the mandate period 2017–2020 (''Legislatur'') the Small Country Council is presided by ''Landammann'' Tarzisius Caviezel. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand Country Council are carried by the Small Country Council. The regular election of the municipal councils by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of the municipality of Davos allowed to vote and being registered can be elected as a member of the Small Country Council for a maximal period of twelve years. The delegates are selected by means of a system of [[First-past-the-post voting|''Majorz'']]. The President is elected as such as well by a public election while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. They usually meet once a week.<ref name=KLR>{{cite web |url=http://www.gemeindedavos.ch/de/politikverwaltung/politik/exekutive/ |title=Kleiner Landrat |publisher=Gemeinde Davos |language=German |location=Davos, Switzerland |type=official website |access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>

{{As of|2017}}, Davos's Small Country Council is made up of two members of FDP ([[FDP.The Liberals]], of whom one is the president), one BDP ([[Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland|Conservative Democratic Party]]), one SP ([[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]]), and one SVP ([[Swiss People's Party]]). The last regular elections (''Landschaftswahlen'') were held on 5 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gemeindedavos.ch/de/politikverwaltung/politik/infos/vorlagen/?action=showobject&object_id=820 |title=Wahl Kleiner Landrat |publisher=Gemeinde Davos |date=6 June 2016|language=German |location=Davos, Switzerland |type=official website |access-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>

[[Bandy]] is occasionally played there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/pix/14099.jpeg|title=Bandy field at the ice stadium}}</ref> [[Four nation bandy tournament in 2014|An international tournament, starting in 2014]], has been organised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQTgqD8EzCk|title=Bandy Davos 2014 (Czech republic vs. Netherlands)|last=Česká Asociace Bandy|date=24 February 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luxos.com/images/DESTINATIONS/Davos/About/6606/Bandy-Spiele_100-Jahr-Jubilaum-der-ersten-Bandy-Europameisterschaft_04.jpg|title=Czech Republic and Germany playing in the international bandy tournament 2014}}</ref> The [[1913 European Bandy Championships]] in Davos is so far the only one of its kind.

There are six main ski areas in winter, with a total of {{convert|320|km}} of slopes:
* [[Parsenn|Parsenn / Gotschna]] which connects to the partner town of Klosters from Davos Dorf
* [[Jakobshorn]] which can be reached from Davos Platz directly

* Schatzalp is privately owned by the Schatzalp Hotel and a specialty as a "decelerated" skiing area

To the north there are no valleys but rather a direct one-day ascent to continue across a pass into the "Schanfigg" valley towards the rival resort of [[Arosa]] or even to continue to [[Lenzerheide]] in a two-day hike.<ref>{{in lang|en}} [http://en.graubuenden.ch/hiking-switzerland/trekking/54-mittelbuenden-panoramaweg-lenzerheide-davos.html Hiking Alps in Switzerland, Davos, Graubünden] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514091942/http://en.graubuenden.ch/hiking-switzerland/trekking/54-mittelbuenden-panoramaweg-lenzerheide-davos.html |date=14 May 2015 }}</ref>
