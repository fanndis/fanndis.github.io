[[File:JD-S-propaganda-Kannada-Bangalore.jpg|thumb|JD(S) promotion art-work in [[Bangalore]].]]
The Janata Dal(Secular),formed in 1999, had its origins in the [[Janata Party]],founded in 1977 as a coalition of several smaller parties that combined forces to oppose the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Janata-Dal-Secular|title=britannica.com : Janata Dal (Secular)}}</ref> In 1988 the Janata Party and other smaller parties merged to form the [[Janata Dal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lokpriya.com/personalities/political/present/chandrashekhar.html|title=article on Chandrashekar|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindujobs.com/thehindu/mp/2006/01/17/stories/2006011700490300.html|title=Bouquet of ideologies - article in the Hindu|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029548.html|title=Janata Dal|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> In 1996, Janata Dal reached its pinnacle when [[H.

The [[Janata Dal]] split in 1999, when a faction led by Chief Minister [[J. H. Patel]] lent support to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] leading to the formation of Janata Dal(Secular) under [[H. D. Deve Gowda]] and [[Siddaramaiah]]. The [[Sharad Yadav]] faction of the Janata Dal, the Lok Shakti and the Samata Party merged as the [[Janata Dal (United)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janata.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=60|title=Janata.in|website=www.janata.in}}</ref><ref>[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2108/stories/20040423006701900.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103051657/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2108/stories/20040423006701900.htm |date=3 January 2008 }}</ref> Even though the premise for the split was its opposition to allying with the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]], [[H. D. Deve Gowda]] stayed equally away from the [[Indian National Congress]] from the outset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99aug26/head2.htm|title="Gowda rules out tieup with Congress " - Tribune India article|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>

JD(S) in Karnataka state for a time governed in a coalition with the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) party, the first coalition government in Karnataka. There was much controversy over the JD(S) allying with the INC in [[Bangalore]] as the INC formerly had an outright majority and was diminished to second place with the BJP having a plurality. However, the JD(S) considered INC to be the lesser of the two evils on account of its erstwhile secular and center-left credentials.

The [[2004 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election|2004 Karnataka Assembly election]] witnessed the revival of the party's fortunes with JD(S) becoming part of the ruling coalition in the state.

On 14 April 2015, the JD(S), [[Janata Dal (United)]], [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]], the [[Indian National Lok Dal]], [[Samajwadi Party]], and [[Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya)]] announced that they would merge into a new national [[Janata Parivar]] alliance in order to oppose the BJP, thus leaving the UPA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/janata-parivar-formalised-mulayam-singh-named-chief-of-new-party_1578871.html |title='Janata Parivar' formalised, Mulayam Singh named chief of new party &#124; Zee News |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2017-03-12}}</ref>
