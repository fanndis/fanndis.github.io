'''''The Sunday Times''''' is a British newspaper whose circulation makes it the largest in the [[quality press]] market category. It is published by Times Newspapers Ltd, a subsidiary of [[News UK]], which is in turn owned by [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]. Times Newspapers also publishes ''[[The Times]]''. The two papers were founded independently and have been under [[common ownership]] only since 1966. They were bought by News International in 1981.

''The Sunday Times'' has a circulation of just over 650,000 which exceeds that of its main rivals, including [[The Sunday Telegraph|''The'' ''Sunday Telegraph'']] and [[The Observer|''The'' ''Observer'']], combined.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Observer - Data - ABC {{!}} Audit Bureau of Circulations |url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/2895 |website=www.abc.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Sunday Telegraph - Data - ABC {{!}} Audit Bureau of Circulations |url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/2324 |website=www.abc.org.uk}}</ref> While some other national newspapers moved to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] in the early 2000s, ''The Sunday Times'' has retained the larger [[broadsheet]] format and has said that it will continue to do so. As of December 2019, it sells 75% more copies than its sister paper, ''[[The Times]]'', which is published Monday to Saturday.<ref>[http://www.abc.org.uk/product/2896 website=www.abc.org.uk]</ref>

''The Sunday Times'' has acquired a reputation for the strength of its investigative reporting – much of it by its [[Insight (Sunday Times)|Insight]] team – and also for its wide-ranging foreign coverage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} It has a number of popular writers, columnists and commentators including [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[Bryan Appleyard]]. [[A. A. Gill]] was a prominent columnist for many years. It was Britain's first multi-section newspaper and remains substantially larger than its rivals. A typical edition contains the equivalent of 450 to 500 tabloid pages. Besides the main news section, it has standalone News Review, Business, Sport, Money and Appointments sections – all broadsheet. There are three magazines (''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'', ''Culture'', and ''Style'') and two tabloid supplements (Travel and Home). It has a website and separate digital editions configured for both the [[iOS]] operating system for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system for such devices as the [[Google Nexus]], all of which offer video clips, extra features and multimedia and other material not found in the printed version of the newspaper. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The paper publishes [[Sunday Times Rich List|''The Sunday Times'' Rich List]], an annual survey of the wealthiest people in Britain and Ireland, equivalent to the [[Forbes 400]] list in the United States, and a series of league tables with reviews of private British companies, in particular [[Sunday Times Fast Track 100|''The Sunday Times'' Fast Track 100]]. The paper also produces an annual league table of the best-performing state and independent schools at both junior and senior level across the United Kingdom, entitled ''Parent Power'' (with additional information available online), and an annual league table of [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]] and a similar one for [[List of higher education institutions in the Republic of Ireland|Irish universities]]. It publishes ''The Sunday Times'' Bestseller List of books in Britain, and a list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For", focusing on UK companies. It also organises ''The Sunday Times'' Oxford Literary Festival, held annually, and ''The Sunday Times'' Festival of Education, which takes place every year at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Sunday Times plaque London 1822.jpg|thumb|Plaque to the first edition of ''The Sunday Times'' at No. 4 Salisbury Court, [[London]]]]

===Founding and early history (1821–1915)===
The paper began publication on 18 February 1821 as ''The New Observer'', but from 21 April its title was changed to the ''Independent Observer''. Its founder, Henry White, chose the name in an apparent attempt to take advantage of the success of [[The Observer|the ''Observer'']], which had been founded in 1791, although there was no connection between the two papers. On 20 October 1822 it was reborn as ''The Sunday Times'', although it had no relationship with ''[[The Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/story/0,,1674998,00.html|title=Unravelling the DNA inside Britain's oldest Sunday paper|author=Pritchard, Stephen|work=The Observer|location=UK|date=1 January 2006|access-date=17 August 2009}}</ref> In January 1823, White sold the paper to [[Daniel Whittle Harvey]], a radical politician.

Under its new owner, ''The Sunday Times'' notched up several firsts: a wood engraving it published of the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838 was the largest illustration to have appeared in a British newspaper;<ref>{{cite book|title= The Pearl of Days|author=Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard|year=1972|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=22}}</ref> in 1841, it became one of the first papers to serialise a novel: [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s ''Old St Paul's''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard|title= The Pearl of Days|year=1972 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=0 241 02266 5|page=39}}</ref>

The paper was bought in 1887 by [[Alice Anne Cornwell]] who had made a fortune in mining in Australia and floating the Midas Mine Company of the London Stock Exchange. She bought the paper to promote her new company, The British and Australasian Mining Investment Company, and as a gift to her lover Frederick Stannard (‘Phil’) Robinson. Robinson was installed as editor and she married him in 1894.<ref>Griffiths, D. (2004-09-23). Cornwell [other married names Whiteman, Robinson], Alice Ann (1852–1932), [[gold mining]] industrialist and newspaper proprietor. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 10 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-56583 link]</ref>

She then sold it in 1893 to Frederick Beer, who already owned ''[[The Observer|Observer]]''. Beer appointed his wife, [[Rachel Beer|Rachel Sassoon Beer]], as editor. She was already editor of ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' – the first woman to run a national newspaper – and continued to edit both titles until 1901.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Pearl of Days|author=Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard|year=1972|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=52}}</ref>

===The Kemsley years (1915–59)===
There was a further change of ownership in 1903, and then in 1915 the paper was bought by [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|William Berry]] and his brother, Gomer Berry, later ennobled as Lord Camrose and [[Viscount Kemsley]] respectively. Under their ownership, ''The Sunday Times'' continued its reputation for innovation: on 23 November 1930, it became the first Sunday newspaper to publish a 40-page issue and on 21 January 1940, news replaced advertising on the front page.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Pearl of Days |author= Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard |year=1972 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=226}}</ref>

In 1943, the Kemsley Newspapers Group was established, with ''The Sunday Times'' becoming its flagship paper. At this time, Kemsley was the largest newspaper group in Britain.

On 12 November 1945, [[Ian Fleming]], who later created [[James Bond]], joined the paper as foreign manager (foreign editor) and special writer. The following month, circulation reached 500,000.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Pearl of Days |author= Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard |year=1972 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=227}}</ref> On 28 September 1958 the paper launched a separate Review section, becoming the first newspaper to publish two sections regularly.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Pearl of Days |author= Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard |year=1972 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=298}}</ref>

===The Thomson years (1959–81)===
In 1959 the Kemsley group was bought by [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Lord Thomson]], and in October 1960 circulation reached one million for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Pearl of Days |author= Hobson, Harold, Knightley, Phillip and Russell, Leonard |year=1972 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0 241 02266 5 |page=339}}</ref> In another first, on 4 February 1962 the editor, Denis Hamilton, launched ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]''. (At the insistence of newsagents, worried at the impact on sales of standalone magazines, it was initially called the "colour section" and did not take the name ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' until 9 August 1964.) The cover picture of the first issue was of [[Jean Shrimpton]] wearing a [[Mary Quant]] outfit and was taken by [[David Bailey]]. The magazine got off to a slow start, but the advertising soon began to pick up, and, over time, other newspapers launched magazines of their own.

In 1963, the [[Insight (Sunday Times)|Insight]] investigative team was established under Clive Irving. On 27 September 1964, the ''Business'' section was launched, making ''The Sunday Times'' Britain's first regular three-section newspaper. In September 1966, Thomson bought ''[[The Times]]'', to form [[News UK|Times Newspapers Ltd]] (TNL). It was the first time both ''The Sunday Times'' and ''[[The Times]]'' had been brought under the same ownership.

[[Harold Evans]], editor from 1967 until 1981, established ''The Sunday Times'' as a leading campaigning and investigative newspaper. On 19 May 1968, the paper published its first major campaigning report on the drug [[Thalidomide]], which had been reported by the Australian doctor [[William McBride (doctor)|William McBride]] in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1961 as associated with birth defects, and quickly withdrawn. The newspaper published a four-page [[Insight]] investigation, entitled ''The Thalidomide File'', in the ''Weekly Review'' section. A compensation settlement for the UK victims was eventually reached with [[Distillers Company]] (now part of [[Diageo]]), which had distributed the drug in the UK.

TNL was plagued by a series of industrial disputes at its plant at Gray's Inn Road in London, with the print unions resisting attempts to replace the old-fashioned hot-metal and labour-intensive [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] method with technology that would allow the papers to be composed [[electronically]]. Thomson offered to invest millions of pounds to buy out obstructive practices and overmanning, but the unions rejected every proposal. As a result, publication of ''The Sunday Times'' and other titles in the group was suspended in November 1978. It did not resume until November 1979.

Although journalists at ''[[The Times]]'' had been on full pay during the suspension, they went on strike demanding more money after production was resumed. [[Kenneth Thomson]], the head of the company, felt betrayed and decided to sell. Evans tried to organise a management buyout of ''The Sunday Times'', but Thomson decided instead to sell to [[Rupert Murdoch]], who he thought had a better chance of dealing with the trade unions.

===The Murdoch years (1981–present)===
[[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]]'s [[News UK|News International]] acquired the group in February 1981. Murdoch, an Australian who in 1985 became a [[naturalised]] American citizen, already owned ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[News of the World]]'', but the Conservative government decided not to refer the deal to the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]], citing a clause in the [[Fair Trading Act 1973|Fair Trading Act]] that exempted uneconomic businesses from referral. [[The Thomson Corporation]] had threatened to close the papers down if they were not taken over by someone else within an allotted time, and it was feared that any legal delay to Murdoch's takeover might lead to the two titles' demise. In return, Murdoch provided legally binding guarantees to preserve the titles' editorial independence.

Evans was appointed editor of ''[[The Times]]'' in February 1981 and was replaced at ''The Sunday Times'' by [[Frank Giles]]. In 1983, the newspaper bought the serialisation rights to publish the faked ''[[Hitler Diaries]]'', thinking them to be genuine after they were authenticated by the own newspaper's own independent director, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], the historian and author of ''The Last Days of Hitler''.<ref name="Harris 1986">{{cite book |title= Selling Hitler: The Extraordinary Story of the Con Job of the Century – The Faking of the Hitler "Diaries" |last= Harris |first= Robert |publisher= New York: Pantheon |date= 1986 |isbn= 9780394553368 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/sellinghitler00harr }}</ref>
 
Under [[Andrew Neil]], editor from 1983 until 1994, ''The Sunday Times'' took a strongly [[Thatcherite]] slant that contrasted with the [[traditional]] paternalistic conservatism expounded by [[Peregrine Worsthorne]] at the rival ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]''. It also built on its reputation for investigations. Its scoops included the revelation in 1986 that [[Israel]] had manufactured more than 100 [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] warheads<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640613.stm |title=Middle East &#124; Vanunu: Israel's nuclear telltale |work=BBC News |date=20 April 2004 |access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> and the publication in 1992 of extracts from [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]]'s book, ''Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words''. In the early 1990s, the paper courted controversy with a series of articles in which it rejected the role of HIV in causing AIDS.

In January 1986, after the announcement of a [[Labor strike|strike]] by print workers, production of ''The Sunday Times'', along with other newspapers in the group, was shifted to a new plant in Wapping, and the strikers were dismissed.  The plant, which allowed journalists to input copy directly, was activated with the help of the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]] (EETPU). The print unions posted pickets and organised demonstrations outside the new plant to try to dissuade journalists and others from working there, in what became known as the [[Wapping dispute|Wapping Dispute]]. The demonstrations sometimes turned violent. The protest ended in failure in February 1987.

During Neil's editorship, a number of new sections were added: the annual [[Sunday Times Rich List|''The Sunday Times'' Rich List]] and the [[Funday Times]], in 1989, (the latter stopped appearing in print and was relaunched as a standalone website in March 2006 but was later closed); Style & Travel, News Review and Arts in 1990, and Culture in 1992. In September 1994, Style and Travel became two separate sections.

During Neil's time as editor, ''The Sunday Times'' backed a campaign to prove that [[HIV]] was not a cause of [[AIDS]].<ref name="Summerskill">Ben Summerskill [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jul/28/sundaytimes.comment "Paper tiger"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221085721/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jul/28/sundaytimes.comment|date=21 December 2016}} ''The Observer'', 28 July 2002</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2006-10-02|title=When it's time to speak out|journal=News@nature|doi=10.1038/news061002-12|issn=1744-7933}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=McKnight|first1=David|date=2009|title=THE SUNDAY TIMES AND ANDREW NEIL|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=10|issue=6|pages=754–768|doi=10.1080/14616700903119891}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Policy, the Media and Misrepresentation|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Franklin|editor-first=Bob|pages=72}}</ref> In 1990, ''The Sunday Times'' serialized a book by an American conservative who rejected the scientific consensus on the causes of AIDS and argued that AIDS could not spread to heterosexuals.<ref name=":2" /> Articles and editorials in ''The Sunday Times'' cast doubt on the scientific consensus, described HIV as a "politically correct virus" about which there was a "conspiracy of silence," disputed that AIDS was spreading in Africa, claimed that tests for HIV were invalid, described the HIV/AIDS treatment drug AZT as harmful, and characterized the WHO as an "Empire-building AIDS [organisation]."<ref name=":2" /> The [[pseudoscientific]] coverage of HIV/AIDS in ''the Sunday Times'' led the scientific journal ''Nature'' to monitor the newspaper's coverage and to publish letters rebutting ''Sunday Times'' articles which ''the Sunday Times'' refused to publish.<ref name=":2" /> In response to this, ''the Sunday Times'' published an article headlined "AIDS - why we won’t be silenced", which claimed that ''Nature'' engaged in censorship and "sinister intent".<ref name=":2" /> In his 1996 book, ''Full Disclosure'', Neil wrote that the HIV/AIDS denialism "deserved publication to encourage debate."<ref name=":2" /> That same year, he wrote that ''the Sunday Times'' had been vindicated in its coverage, "The Sunday Times was one of a handful of newspapers, perhaps the most prominent, which argued that heterosexual Aids was a myth. The figures are now in and this newspaper stands totally vindicated... The history of Aids is one of the great scandals of our time. I do not blame doctors and the Aids lobby for warning that everybody might be at risk in the early days, when ignorance was rife and reliable evidence scant." He criticized the "AIDS establishment" and said "Aids had become an industry, a job-creation scheme for the caring classes."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The great Aids myth is finally laid to rest|last=Neil|first=Andrew|author-link=Andrew Neil|date=1996|work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>

[[John Witherow]], who became editor at the end of 1994 (after several months as acting editor), continued the newspaper's expansion. A website was launched in 1996 and new print sections added: Home in 2001, and Driving in 2002, which in 2006 was renamed InGear. (It reverted to the name Driving from 7 October 2012, to coincide with the launch of a new standalone website, Sunday Times Driving.) Technology coverage was expanded in 2000 with the weekly colour magazine Doors, and in 2003 The Month, an editorial section presented as an interactive CD-Rom. Magazine partworks were regular additions, among them 1000 Makers of Music, published over six weeks in 1997.

John Witherow oversaw a rise in circulation to 1.3 million<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection39 |title=42.

In common with other newspapers, ''The Sunday Times'' has been hit by a fall in circulation, which has declined from a peak of 1.3 million to just over 710,000. It has a number of digital-only subscribers, which numbered 99,017 by January 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Sunday Times tablet edition - Data - ABC {{!}} Audit Bureau of Circulations |url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/16961-the-sunday-times-tablet-edition |website=www.abc.org.uk}}</ref>

During January 2013, [[Martin Ivens]] became acting editor of ''The Sunday Times'' in succession to John Witherow, who became the 'acting' editor of ''The Times'' at the same time. The independent directors rejected a permanent position for Ivens as editors to avoid any possible merger of ''The Sunday Times'' and daily ''Times'' titles.<ref name="Rushton">Katherine Rushton [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9812458/John-Witherow-named-acting-editor-of-The-Times-as-News-International-eyes-merger.html "John Witherow named acting editor of The Times as News International eyes merger"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 January 2013</ref>

==Online presence==
''The Sunday Times'' has its own website. It previously shared an online presence with ''[[The Times]]'', but in May 2010 they both launched their own sites to reflect their distinct brand identities. Since July 2010, the sites have charged for access.

An iPad edition was launched in December 2010, and an Android version in August 2011. Since July 2012, the digital version of the paper has been available on Apple's Newsstand platform, allowing automated downloading of the news section. With over 500MB of content every week, it is the biggest newspaper app in the world. {{Citation needed|reason=Is there evidence to support this claim?|date=March 2017}}

''The Sunday Times'' iPad app was named newspaper app of the year at the 2011 Newspaper Awards and has twice been ranked best newspaper or magazine app in the world by iMonitor. Various subscription packages exist, giving access to both the print and digital versions of the paper.

On 2 October 2012, ''The Sunday Times'' launched Sunday Times Driving, a separate classified advertising site for premium vehicles that also includes editorial content from the newspaper as well as specially commissioned articles. It can be accessed without cost.

In response, the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' described the paper's coverage of HIV/AIDS as "seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/03/aids-hiv-deniers-christine-maggiore/print Will stupid people and their pseudoscience cost more lives this year?] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 2009/jan/03</ref> ''Nature'' argued that the newspaper had "so consistently misrepresented the role of HIV in the causation of AIDS that ''Nature'' plans to monitor its future treatment of the issue."<ref>{{cite journal|title=New-style abuse of press freedom|journal=Nature|volume=366 |issue=6455|pages=493–494|date=December 1993|pmid=8255275|doi=10.1038/366493a0 }}</ref>
* In 1992, the paper published extracts from [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]]'s book, ''Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words'', which revealed for the first time the disastrous state of her marriage to [[Prince Charles]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* Also in 1992, the paper agreed to pay [[David Irving]], an author widely criticised for [[Holocaust denial]], the sum of £75,000 to authenticate the Goebbels diaries and edit them for serialisation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hitler-apologist-does-deal-for-goebbels-war-diaries-sunday-times-contract-with-david-irving-over-1530789.html|title=Hitler apologist does deal for Goebbels war diaries: 'Sunday Times'|date=3 July 1992|work=The Independent}}</ref>  The deal was quickly cancelled after drawing strong international criticism.

* Under the headline, "KGB: [[Michael Foot]] was our agent", ''The Sunday Times'' ran an article on 19 February 1995 that claimed the Soviet intelligence services regarded Foot, a former leader of the Labour Party, as an "agent of influence", codenamed "Agent Boot"", and that he had been in the pay of the KGB for many years. The article was based on the serialisation of the memoirs of [[Oleg Gordievsky]], a former high-ranking KGB officer who defected from the Soviet Union to Britain in 1985. Crucially, the newspaper used material from the original manuscript of the book which had not been included in the published version. Foot successfully sued, winning "substantial" damages.<ref>{{cite news|author=Rhys Williams Media Correspondent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sunday-times-pays-foot-damages-over-kgb-claim-1590325.html|title='Sunday Times' pays Foot damages over KGB claim|work=The Independent|date=8 July 1995|access-date=16 October 2012|location=London, UK}}</ref>

* In mid-2009, the newspaper ran a series of articles revealing how politicians were abusing the expenses system.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Sunday Times Insight Team|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Test/politics/article166500.ece |title=Labour peer Baroness Uddin claims £100,000 expenses on empty flat|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref>
* Between 2004 and 2010, the newspaper ran an award-winning investigation by [[Brian Deer]] which revealed that research by [[Andrew Wakefield]] into the [[MMR vaccine]] was fraudulent. The investigation led to Wakefield being banned from medicine, and the retraction of his research from ''[[The Lancet]]''.
* In January 2010, ''The Sunday Times'' published an article by [[Jonathan Leake]], alleging that a figure in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] was based on an "unsubstantiated claim".

* In March 2010, undercover reporters from ''The Sunday Times'' Insight team filmed [[2010 cash for influence scandal|members of parliament agreeing to work for a fictitious lobbying firm]] for fees of £3,000-£5,000 a day. One of those implicated, [[Stephen Byers]], described himself as "sort of like a cab for hire".<ref>{{cite web|author=Times Insight|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Test/politics/article249556.ece|title=Stephen Byers: ‘I'm like a cab for hire – at up to £5,000 a day’|work=The Sunday Times|date=21 March 2010|access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref>

* In 2011, the paper broke what became known as the [[2011 cash for influence scandal|Cash for Influence scandal]]; it revealed that [[Adrian Severin]], [[Ernst Strasser]], Pablo Zalba Bidegain and [[Zoran Thaler]] tried to influence EU legislation in exchange for promised money. Both Strasser and Thaler resigned in March 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12806955|title=Two Euro MPs quit amid lobbying allegations|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2011|access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref>
* In March 2012, the paper filmed [[Peter Cruddas]], the co-treasurer of the Conservative Party, offering access to David Cameron, the prime minister, in return for donations of £250,000 ($400,000). Cruddas resigned several hours later. Cameron said: "What happened was completely unacceptable.

In fact, as the newspaper subsequently pointed out, cod can start breeding between the ages of four and six, in which case there are many more mature cod in the North Sea.
* In January 2013, the seven-times [[Tour de France]] winner [[Lance Armstrong]] confessed to having used performance-enhancing drugs during each of his Tour victories. The confession ended years of denials about allegations of cheating during most of the cyclist's professional career. ''The Sunday Times'' chief sports writer [[David Walsh (journalist)|David Walsh]] had spent over a decade investigating Armstrong, his team, and the systematic [[Doping in sport|doping]] rife in the sport. The newspaper was forced to pay Armstrong £300,000 in damages in 2006 after he sued it for libel. Following Armstrong's lifelong ban (and subsequent televised confession) ''The Sunday Times'' said it would sue him to recover the damages, plus interest and costs, for the original proceedings which it called "baseless and fraudulent".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/20833119|title=Lance Armstrong: Sunday Times sues cyclist for up to £1m|work=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2012|access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref>
* In January 2013, ''The Sunday Times'' published a [[Gerald Scarfe]] caricature depicting Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] cementing a wall with blood and Palestinians trapped between the bricks.

*In June 2014, the Insight team at ''The Sunday Times'' published a front-page story "Plot to buy the World Cup" that detailed how [[Qatar]] used secret slush funds to make dozens of payments totalling more than $5m to senior officials at [[FIFA]] to ensure the country won enough votes to secure hosting rights to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/plot-to-buy-the-world-cup-lvxdg2v7l7w|title=Plot to buy the World Cup|last=Blake|first=Jonathan Calvert and Heidi|date=2014-06-01|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2019-02-07|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}</ref> The revelation prompted calls for Qatar to be stripped of the World Cup.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/plot-to-buy-the-world-cup-reaction-from-around-the-world-to-the-fifa-files-tqkqnfp7kn5|title=Plot to buy the World Cup: reaction from around the world to the Fifa files|last=Times|first=The Sunday|date=2014-06-01|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2019-02-07|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}</ref> The reporting by Jonathan Calvert and Heidi Blake won numerous awards, including the [[Paul Foot Award]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/26/fifa-files-expose-by-sunday-times-joint-winner-of-paul-foot-award-2014|title=Fifa Files exposé by Sunday Times joint winner of Paul Foot Award 2014|last=Jackson|first=Jasper|date=2015-02-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> It also formed the basis for the book by Calvert and Blake, published by [[Simon & Schuster|Simon and Schuster]], ''The Ugly Game''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Ugly-Game/Heidi-Blake/9781501132964|title=The Ugly Game|date=2017-06-27|isbn=9781501132964|language=en}}</ref>
* In June 2015, ''The Sunday Times'' ran a lead front article titled "British spies betrayed to Russians and Chinese". The article was controversial because it contained numerous unlikely and unsubstantiated claims. Shortly after publication parts of the online version of the article were changed quietly by the newspaper. The article appeared to be an attempt to smear the American Whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]], thus fuelling further doubt as to its independent editorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/06/14/sunday-times-report-snowden-files-journalism-worst-also-filled-falsehoods/|title=The Sunday Times’ Snowden Story is Journalism at its Worst — and Filled with Falsehoods|work=The Intercept}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/15/sunday-times-drops-claim-david-miranda-edward-snowden|title=Sunday Times drops claim that Miranda met Snowden before UK detention|first=Jane|last=Martinson|date=15 June 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/15/sunday-times-cnn-interview_n_7588000.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Sunday Times Reporter Tries To Defend Snowden Story | date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

==Phone hacking scandal==
In July 2011, ''The Sunday Times'' was implicated in the wider [[News International phone hacking scandal]] which primarily involved the ''[[News of the World]]'', a Murdoch tabloid newspaper published in the UK from 1843 to 2011. Former British prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] accused ''The Sunday Times'' of employing "known criminals" to impersonate him and obtain his private financial records.<ref name="nyt-brown">{{cite news |work=The New York Times | title = Gordon Brown Says Newspaper Hired 'Known Criminals' | date = 12 July 2011 | access-date =12 July 2011 | first = John | last = Burns |author2=Jo Becker |author3=Alan Cowell  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/world/europe/13hacking.html}}</ref><ref name="bbc-brown">{{cite news |publisher=BBC   | title = Gordon Brown allegations: What is blagging? | first = Gerry | last = Holt | date = 12 July 2011 | access-date =12 July 2011 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14120244}}</ref> Brown's bank reported that an investigator employed by ''The Sunday Times'' repeatedly impersonated Brown to gain access to his bank account records.<ref name="guardian-brown">{{cite news |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 11 July 2011 | access-date =12 July 2011 | title = News International papers targeted Gordon Brown | first = Nick | last = Davies |author2=David Leigh  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/11/phone-hacking-news-international-gordon-brown}}</ref> ''The Sunday Times'' vigorously denied these accusations and said that the story was in the public interest and that it had followed the [[Press Complaints Commission]] code on using subterfuge.

==Other editions==
===Irish edition===
The Irish edition of ''The Sunday Times'' was launched on a small scale on 1993 with just two staff, Alan Ruddock and John Burns (who is at present associate editor). It used the slogan "The English just don't get it".<ref>{{cite news|author=John Waters|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/jesuit-s-press-edict-continued-a-grain-of-truth-1.91316|title=Jesuit's press edict continued a grain of truth|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=1 October 1996|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> It is now the third biggest-selling newspaper in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] measured in terms of full-price cover sales (Source: ABC Jan–June 2012). Circulation had grown steadily to over 127,000 in the two decades before 2012 but has declined since and currently stands at 60,352 (Jan to Jun 2018).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Irish Times - Data - ABC {{!}} Audit Bureau of Circulations |url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/2683 |website=www.abc.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Slattery |first1=Laura |title=‘The Irish Times’ had combined daily circulation of 77,988 in second half of 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/the-irish-times-had-combined-daily-circulation-of-77-988-in-second-half-of-2017-1.3402249 |website=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref>

The paper is heavily editionalised, with extensive Irish coverage of politics, general news, business, personal finance, sport, culture and lifestyle. The office employs 25 people. The paper also has a number of well-known freelance columnists including [[Brenda Power]], Liam Fay, [[Matt Cooper (Irish journalist)|Matt Cooper]], [[Damien Kiberd]], Jill Kerby and Stephen Price. The paper ended collaboration with [[Kevin Myers]] after it published a controversial column.  The Irish edition has had four editors since it was set up: Alan Ruddock, Rory Godson,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/196005/profile-rory-godson-powerscourt---pr-novice-international-outlook|title=PROFILE: Rory Godson, Powerscourt - A PR 'novice' with an international outlook|publisher=[[PR Week]]|date=21 November 2003}}</ref> Fiona McHugh<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/irish-daily-to-use-ios-team/|title=Irish daily to use IoS team|magazine=[[Press Gazette]]|date=26 June 2013}}</ref> and, since 2005, Frank Fitzgibbon.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Scottish edition===
For more than 20 years the paper has published a separate Scottish edition, which has been edited since January 2012 by Jason Allardyce. While most of the articles that run in the English edition appear in the Scottish edition, its staff also produces about a dozen Scottish news stories, including a front-page article, most weeks. The edition also contains a weekly "Scottish Focus" feature and Scottish commentary, and covers Scottish sport in addition to providing Scottish television schedules. The Scottish issue is the biggest-selling quality newspaper in the market, outselling both ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Herald]]''. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
