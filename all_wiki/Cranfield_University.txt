'''Cranfield University''' is a British [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] and research-based [[public university]] specialising in science, engineering, technology and management. Cranfield was founded as the '''College of Aeronautics''' in 1946. Through the 1950s and 1960s, the development of aircraft research led to growth and diversification into other areas such as manufacturing and management, and in 1967, to the founding of the Cranfield School of Management. In 1969, the College of Aeronautics was renamed the '''Cranfield Institute of Technology''', was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]], gained degree awarding powers, and became a [[university]].  In 1993, it adopted its current name.<ref name="Cranfield2006">{{cite web|url=https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/~/media/files/corporate_documents/college-of-aeronautics-historyv2.ashx|title=Cranfield College of Aeronautics history|publisher=Cranfield University|date=n.d.|accessdate=28 December 2017|quote=The institution ... was granted university status in 1969 becoming the Cranfield Institute of Technology and it changed its name to Cranfield University in 1993|page=1}}</ref>

Cranfield University has two [[campus]]es: the main campus is at [[Cranfield]], [[Bedfordshire]], and the second is at the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]] at [[Shrivenham]], southwest [[Oxfordshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/about/how-to-find-cranfield/how-to-find-shrivenham|title=How to find us - Cranfield University at Shrivenham|accessdate=1 July 2017|publisher=Cranfield University}}</ref> The main campus is unique{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} in the United Kingdom (and Europe) for having its own semi-operational airport{{snd}} [[Cranfield Airport]]{{snd}} and its own aircraft, used for teaching and research.

[[File:Cranfield University AIRC.jpg|thumb|Cranfield University AIRC]]

===College of Aeronautics (1946–1969)===
Cranfield University was formed in 1946 as the College of Aeronautics, on the then [[Royal Air Force]] base of [[RAF Cranfield]]. A major role was played in the development of the college by [[Roxbee Cox, Baron Kings Norton|Roxbee Cox]], later Lord Kings Norton, who was appointed to be the first governor of the college in 1945 and then served as vice-chair and (from 1962) chair of the board. He led the drive for the college to diversify, with the [[Cranfield University School of Management]] being established in 1967, and petitioned successfully for a royal charter and degree awarding powers. When these were granted in 1969, he became the first chancellor of the Cranfield Institute of Technology, serving until 1997.<ref>{{cite web | title = History and heritage| publisher = Cranfield University | url = https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/about/history-and-heritage| accessdate = 1 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cranfield University|work=Lord Kings Norton|publisher=Cranfield University|url=http://lordkingsnorton.cranfield.ac.uk/cranfield/index.html|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>

===Cranfield Institute of Technology (1969–1993)===
The Cranfield Institute of Technology was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1969, giving the institution its own degree-awarding powers and making it a full university in its own right.<ref name="Guardian12Jan2012">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jan/23/postgraduate-only-universities|title=Is Cranfield's postgraduate-only university a model for the future?|last=Swain|first=Harriet|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Independent23July2014">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/cranfield-university-458905.html|title=Cranfield University|work=The Independent|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Cranfield2006"/>

In 1975 the [[National College of Agricultural Engineering]], founded in 1963 at [[Silsoe]], [[Bedfordshire]], was merged with Cranfield and run as Silsoe College.<ref name=Silsoe>{{cite news|url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/news/education/silsoe-college-remembered-on-new-homes-estate-1-5748954|title=Silsoe college remembered on new homes estate|work=Bedford Today|date=15 December 2013|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>

An academic partnership with the [[Royal Military College of Science]] (RMCS) at [[Shrivenham]] was formed in 1984. RMCS, whose roots can be traced back to 1772, is now a part of the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]] and from 2009 has been known as "Cranfield Defence and Security". RMCS became wholly postgraduate in c.2007 with undergraduate courses moved elsewhere.

=== Cranfield University (1993–present) ===
In 1993 the institution's Royal Charter was amended changing its name to Cranfield University.<ref name="Guardian12Jan2012"/><ref name="Independent23July2014"/><ref name="Cranfield2006"/> A decade later in 2003, Cranfield became wholly postgraduate and the Shrivenham site admitted its last undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web | title = Analysis: Military redeploys intellectual might| publisher = Times Higher Education | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=173295&sectioncode=26 | accessdate = 26 December 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, the University's first international campus was opened by the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], located in the [[Torrens Building]] in [[Adelaide]], alongside the [[Carnegie Mellon University, Australia|Carnegie Mellon University]]. It offered short-term postgraduate degrees in defence management and technology, in partnership with local institutions and using some distance learning courses. However [[South Australia]]'s "defence boom" did not materialise and its failure to attract enough students caused the closure of the campus in 2010.<ref name=Adelaidia>{{cite web|website=Adelaidia|url=http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/places/torrens-building-0|title=Torrens Building|first=Alexander|last=Parsons|date=7 July 2017|access-date=15 November 2019|quote=This entry was first published in S.A.'s Greats: The men and women of the North Terrace plaques, edited by John Healey (Historical Society of South Australia Inc., 2001).}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/aug/07/highereducation.internationaleducationnews|title=Coalition courses|first=David|last=Cohen|date=8 August 2007|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=In Daily|url=https://indaily.com.au/opinion/2015/02/04/adelaides-uni-city-dream/|title=Adelaide's "uni city" dream is over|first=Malcolm|last=King|date=4 February 2015|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref>

In 2009 Silsoe College was closed and its activities were relocated to the main campus at Cranfield.<ref name=Silsoe/>
