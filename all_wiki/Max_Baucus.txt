Baucus was one of the Senate's largest career recipients of [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israel]] [[Political action committee|Political Action Committee]] (PAC) contributions, receiving $550,589 since 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00004643 |title=Max Baucus: Campaign Finance/Money ‚Äì Industries ‚Äì Career |publisher=OpenSecrets |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

====Vietnam====

On July 14, 2009, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an editorial on Baucus's attitude over Vietnam's "[[tra fish|tra]]" and "[[Basa fish|basa]]" [[pangasius]], saying there was no reason for America to launch a [[trade war]] with [[Vietnam]] over [[fish]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124753151017535963 |title=Max Baucus's Fish Sense |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Khong-co-ly-do-gi-ve-ca-tra-basa-Viet-Nam/20097/10881.vnplus Kh√¥ng c√≥ l√Ω do g√¨ v·ªÅ c√° tra, basa Vi·ªát Nam] {{in lang|vi}}</ref> "He's dead right about a trade issue now percolating in Washington," said the newspaper. The article, entitled "Max Baucus's Fish Sense{{snd}}Protectionism often hurts the protectionist", outlined this controversial topic in Washington and underlined the possibility that the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] could effectively ban imports from Vietnam of pangasius fish, which are similar to U.S.-produced [[catfish]].<ref>[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2009/07/858241/ US Senator warns against trade barriers to Vietnam's fish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718040424/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2009/07/858241/ |date=July 18, 2009 }}</ref>

The ostensible reason for the move would be food safety and the USDA is considering whether Vietnamese fish should be subject to a stricter safety inspection regime. But the article noted that there have been no reported cases of Vietnamese fish making American consumers sick and the proposed inspections would be onerous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/US-senator-protests-over-ban-on-Vietnams-fish/20097/105923.vov|title=US senator protests over ban on Vietnam's fish|publisher=English.vovnews.vn|accessdate=2012-10-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727023724/http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/US-senator-protests-over-ban-on-Vietnams-fish/20097/105923.vov|archive-date=2011-07-27}}</ref> It quoted Baucus as telling ''Congress Daily'', "If we expect other countries to follow the rules and drop these restrictions, it is critical that we play by the rules and do not block imports for arbitrary or unscientific reasons."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_fcbfd3ec-f7a8-5dd1-851f-889361d3c2a7.html|title=Catfish fight could hurt beef producers|publisher=Billingsgazette.com|date=2009-06-27|accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref>

====Japan====

Baucus went on a trade mission in Japan, inspecting the [[Tesla Motors]] facility in Tokyo, saying "Tesla is a great example of how exports and trade help the U.S. economy and create good-paying jobs at home in America. Our trade ties overseas help Tesla sell a world-class product that's manufactured in the U.S. by top-notch American workers," Baucus said. "There are millions of consumers in Japan and across the Pacific ready to buy more American-made goods, and we can continue to open those markets and boost U.S. exports with an aggressive trade agenda."<ref name=Equities.com>{{cite web|title=Equities.com ‚Äì Baucus Sees U.S. Export Success Story at Tesla Motors in Tokyo|url=http://www.equities.com/news/headline-story?dt=2012-08-25&val=415136&cat=energy|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122050932/http://www.equities.com/news/headline-story?dt=2012-08-25&val=415136&cat=energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 22, 2013|work=Equities.com|publisher=Equities.com|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Health care reform===

{{See also|America's Healthy Future Act}}

In 2013, Baucus was criticized for his comments concerning the implementation of Obamacare provisions specifically stating it could turn into a "train-wreck". He feared that the changes and their specific implementations would have a negative impact on small business owners stating "When I am home, small businesses have no idea what to do, what to expect. They don't know what affordability rules are; they don't know when penalties may apply. They just don't know.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/aug/06/context-obamacare-train-wreck/|title=In Context: Obamacare|work=PolitiFact Wisconsin|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/294501-baucus-warns-of-huge-train-wreck-in-obamacare-implementation|title=Baucus warns of 'huge train wreck' enacting ObamaCare provisions|last=Baker|first=Sam|date=2013-04-17|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}</ref> While Baucus was very supportive of the intent of the new legislation saying "I spent two years of my life working on the Affordable Care Act.

====Senate finance committee====

As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]], Baucus called the first Senate meeting of interested parties before the committee to discuss [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]], including representatives from pharmaceutical groups, insurance companies, and HMOs and hospital management companies. Some viewed the meeting as controversial because it did not include representatives from groups calling for [[single-payer health care]].

====Opposition to single payer health care====

Advocate groups attended a Senate Finance Committee meeting in May 2009 to protest their exclusion as well as statements by Baucus that "single payer was not an option on the table." Baucus later had eight protesters removed by police who arrested them for disrupting the hearing. Many of the single-payer advocates said it was a "[[pay to play]]" event.<ref name=schultz>http://www.edschultzshow.com/videoblog/details.asp?BID=111{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} MSNBC The Ed Show: Is Single payer on or off the table?</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=3665Single-payer|title=Doctors Protest Exclusion of Single-Payer at Senate Finance Committee|date=2009-05-05|publisher=The Real News Network|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.sustainablemiddleclass.com/?p=1105 "Polls Show Strong Support for Single-Payer Health Program"].

Baucus has used the term "uniquely American solution" to describe the end point of current health reform and has said he believes America is not ready yet for any form of single payer health care. This is the same term the insurance trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), is using. AHIP has launched the Campaign for an American Solution, which argues for the use of private health insurance instead of a government backed program.<ref name="cjr.org"/> Critics have said [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is already effectively a single-payer system.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/13/baucus_raucus_caucus_doctors_nurses_and Baucus's Raucous Caucus: Doctors, Nurses and Activists Arrested Again for Protesting Exclusion of Single-Payer Advocates at Senate Hearing on Health Care], Democracy Now</ref>

====Conflict of interest====

Baucus has been criticized for his ties to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and was one of the largest beneficiaries in the Senate of campaign contributions from these industries.<ref name=schultz/> From 2003-08, Baucus received $3,973,485 from the health sector, including $852,813 from pharmaceutical companies, $851,141 from health professionals, $784,185 from the insurance industry and $465,750 from HMOs/health services, according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?type=C&cid=N00004643&newMem=N&recs=20&cycle=2008 |title=Top Industries: Senator Max Baucus 2003-2008|publisher=Opensecrets.org |date=2012-10-01|accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref><ref>Jack Cafferty, [http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/03/six-lobbyists-per-lawmaker-enough-on-health-care "Six lobbyists per lawmaker enough on health care?"] [[CNN]], September 3, 2009.</ref> A 2006 study by [[Public Citizen]] found that between 1999 and 2005 Baucus, along with former Senate majority leader [[Bill Frist]], took in the most special-interest money of any senator.<ref name="Ari Berman">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070319/berman|title=K Street's Favorite Democrat|work=The Nation|author=Ari Berman|date=March 6, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref>

A statistical analysis of the impact of political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by [[Nate Silver]] has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the [[public option]] in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/06/special-interest-money-means-longer.html|title=Special Interest Money Means Longer Odds for Public Option|work=FiveThirtyEight|author=Nate Silver|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref>

In response to the questions raised by the large amount of funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">Eggen, Dan (July 21, 2009).

===Tax policy===

Baucus voted for the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|Bush tax cuts]] in 2001. He has usually voted against repealing portions of that bill and against repealing more recent tax cut bills that benefit upper income taxpayers. In 2008, he voted in favor of permanently repealing the [[estate tax]].<ref name="Max Baucus on the issues"/>

==Political campaigns==
===2002===

{{Main|2002 United States Senate election in Montana}}

The 2002 Montana elections got national attention when Baucus's opponent, [[Montana State Senate|state senator]] Mike Taylor, accused Baucus of having implied in a campaign ad that Taylor was [[homosexuality|gay]]. The ad was paid for by the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], not by the Baucus campaign. The ad, which alleged that Taylor had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds from the [[cosmetology school]] he once owned, showed footage from the early 1980s of Taylor massaging another man's face while wearing a tight suit with an open shirt. Taylor dropped out of the race and Baucus won with 63 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gransbery |first=Jim |url=http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2002/10/10/build/local/50-taylor-bails.inc |title=Taylor quits Senate race in Montana |newspaper=Billings Gazette |date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2007-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205015139/http://billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews%2F2002%2F10%2F10%2Fbuild%2Flocal%2F50-taylor-bails.inc |archive-date=2006-12-05 }}</ref>

===2008===

{{Main|2008 United States Senate election in Montana}}

Baucus sought re-election in 2008 in Montana, a state that has seen political change starting in 2004 when it elected Democratic Governor [[Brian Schweitzer]] and then in 2006 Democratic Senator [[Jon Tester]] by a slim margin. Montana was the only state in the U.S. to turn over a chamber of its legislature to [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] control in 2006. The legislative chamber had a one-seat Democratic majority that then became a one-seat Republican majority.

Baucus raised a record amount of money for his 2008 re-election bid, 91 percent of which came from individuals living outside of Montana.<ref>[http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2007/12/03/news/local/news03.txt Missoulian: Baucus's campaign fills coffers with out-of-state funds<!--bot generated title-->]</ref> Similarly, according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], Baucus's 2008 campaign raised $11.6{{nbs}}million, only 13 percent of which came from Montana donors; the rest included millions from [[Health care industry|health care]] and other industries overseen by Finance and Baucus's other committees.<ref name="npr.org">Seabrook, Andrea & Overby, Peter (July 22, 2009).

<blockquote>So as Baucus and other lawmakers attempt to craft a bill that can smash through a virtual gridlock of interests, the awkward question lingers: to whom are they more attentive, their voting constituencies back home or the dollar constituencies who are at the Capitol every day?<ref name="npr.org"/></blockquote>

As a result of Baucus's significant fund-raising advantage, in the week he announced his intention to run for re-election he opened eight state offices{{snd}}one more than he had official offices in the state. Baucus also announced that he had hired 35 full-time campaign staff members. Baucus won re-election in a [[landslide victory]], with 73% of the vote, carrying every county in the state.

In April 2009, The Associated Press reported that Baucus and his second wife, the former Wanda Minge, were divorcing after 25 years of marriage and had "parted ways amicably and with mutual respect".<ref name="news.yahoo.com">{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_baucus_girlfriend_nominated|title=Baucus: Girlfriend merited US attorney nomination |date=2009-12-06 | work=Associated Press |author1=Daly, Matthew |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207055755/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_baucus_girlfriend_nominated |archive-date=December 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2008, Baucus had been romantically linked with his state office director, Melodee Hanes, whom he later nominated to the vacant position of [[United States District Court for the District of Montana|U.S. Attorney in Montana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/41188-1.html?ET=rollcall:e6074:80067576a:&st=email |title=Baucus Nominated Girlfriend for U.S. Attorney |publisher=Roll Call |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208012733/http://www.rollcall.com/news/41188-1.html?ET=rollcall:e6074:80067576a:&st=email |archive-date=2009-12-08 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hanes then withdrew her nomination before the conflict of interest was discovered, because (according to Baucus) they wanted to be together in Washington, D.C. Both the Senator and Hanes had ended their marriages within the previous year. Baucus said he was separated from his wife before he began seeing Hanes.<ref name="google.com">Daly, Matthew (December 5, 2009).
