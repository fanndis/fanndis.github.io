'''''U.S. News & World Report''''' is an American [[media company]] that publishes news, opinion, consumer advice, rankings, and analysis. Founded as a [[news magazine]] in 1933, ''U.S. News'' transitioned to primarily web-based publishing in 2010, although it still publishes its rankings. ''U.S. News'' covers politics, education, health, money, careers, travel, technology, and cars.

==History==
'''''United States News''''' was founded in 1933 by [[David Lawrence (publisher)|David Lawrence]] (1888–1973), who also started '''''World Report''''' in 1946. The two magazines covered national and international news separately, but Lawrence merged them into ''U.S. News & World Report'' in 1948.<ref>{{cite journal | author=David E. Sumner | title=American winners and losers:2001 to 2010 | journal=International Conference on Communication, Media, Technology and Design | date=May 2012 | url=http://www.cmdconf.net/2012/makale/6.pdf | accessdate=June 25, 2016 | location=Istanbul}}</ref> He subsequently sold the magazine to his employees. Historically, the magazine tended to be slightly more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than its two primary competitors, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', and focused more on economic, health, and education stories. It also eschewed sports, entertainment, and celebrity news.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620229/US-News-World-Report | title=U.S. News & World Report | accessdate=June 24, 2008 | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | year=2008}}</ref> Important milestones in the early history of the magazine include the introduction of the "Washington Whispers" column in 1934 and the "News You Can Use" column in 1952.<ref name="about-usnews">{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/info/features/about-usnews|title=About U.S. News & World Report|publisher=|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name="usnews-timeline">{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/info/articles/2013/05/17/celebrating-80-years |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016005625/http://www.usnews.com/info/articles/2013/05/17/celebrating-80-years |archivedate=2014-10-16 }}</ref> In 1958, the weekly magazine's circulation passed one million and reached two million by 1973.<ref name="about-usnews" />

Since 1983, it has been known primarily for its influential ranking and annual reports of colleges and graduate schools, spanning across most fields and subjects. ''U.S. News & World Report'' is America's oldest and best-known ranker of academic institutions,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/us-news-college-rankings-are-denounced-but-not-ignored/2011/09/02/gIQAn6BzzJ_story.html | title=U.S. News college rankings are denounced but not ignored | accessdate=September 4, 2011 | work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]] | year= 2011}}</ref> and covers the fields of business, law, medicine, engineering, education, social sciences and public affairs, in addition to many other areas.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/rankings | title=U.S. News & World Report: Comprehensive Categories of Academic Institutions | accessdate=June 18, 2012 | work=U.S. News & World Report|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.| year=2012}}</ref> Its print edition was consistently included in national [[bestseller]] lists, augmented by online subscriptions. Additional rankings published by ''U.S. News & World Report'' include hospitals, medical specialties and automobiles.

In October 1984, [[publisher]] and [[real estate]] developer [[Mortimer Zuckerman]] purchased ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref name="usnews-timeline" /> Zuckerman had owned the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. In 1993, ''U.S. News & World Report'' entered the digital world by providing content to [[CompuServe]] and in 1995, the website usnews.com was launched. In 2001, the website won the [[National Magazine Award]] for General Excellence Online.<ref name="infoplease">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0881066.html|title=2001 National Magazine Awards|publisher=Infoplease}}</ref> In 2007, ''U.S. News & World Report'' published its first list of the nation's best high schools. Its ranking methodology included state test scores and the success of poor and minority students on these exams, and schools' performance in [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement exams]].

Starting in June 2008, the magazine reduced its publication frequency in three steps. In June 2008, citing a decline overall in magazine circulation and advertising, ''U.S. News & World Report'' announced that it would become a [[biweekly]] publication, starting January 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/media/11mag.html | title=U.S. News Plans to Publish Biweekly and Expand Consumer Focus | accessdate=June 24, 2008 | work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=June 11, 2008 | first=Richard | last=Pérez-Peña}}</ref> It hoped advertisers would be attracted to the schedule, which allowed ads to stay on newsstands a week longer.

==Rankings==
===Who Runs America?===
The first of the U.S. News & World Report's famous rankings was its "Who Runs [[America]]?" surveys.  These ran in the spring of each year from 1974 to 1986.  The magazine would have a cover typically featuring persons selected by the USN & WR as being the ten most powerful persons in the United States.  Every single edition of the series listed the [[President of the United States]] as the most powerful person, but the #2 position included such persons as [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (1974),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-22-1974|title=backissues.com - U.S. News & World Report April 22, 1974 - Product Details|publisher=}}</ref> [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairmen]] [[Paul Volcker]] and [[Arthur Burns]] (each listed multiple years) and US Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] (1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-16-1979|title=backissues.com - U.S. News & World Report April 16, 1979 - Product Details|publisher=}}</ref> While most of the top ten each year were officials in government, occasionally others were included, including TV anchormen [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Dan Rather]], [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] Chairman [[David Rockefeller]], [[AFL-CIO]] leader [[George Meany]], and consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]]. The only woman to make the top ten list was First Lady [[Rosalynn Carter]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backissues.com/issue/US-News-and-World-Report-April-14-1980|title=backissues.com - U.S. News & World Report April 14, 1980 - Product Details|publisher=}}</ref>

In addition to these overall top ten persons, the publication also included top persons in each of several fields, including Education, Business, Finance, Journalism, and many other areas.  The survey was discontinued after 1986.

====Criticism====
{{main | Criticism of college and university rankings (North America) | Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}
During the 1990s, several educational institutions in the [[United States]] were involved in a movement to boycott the ''U.S. News & World Report'' college rankings survey. The first was [[Reed College]], which stopped submitting the survey in 1995. The survey was also criticized by [[Alma College]], [[Stanford University]], and [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] during the late 1990s.<ref>Christopher B. Nelson, "[http://www.universitybusiness.com/page.cfm?p=64 Why you won't find St. John's College ranked in U.S.News & World Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040044/http://www.universitybusiness.com/page.cfm?p=64 |date=2007-09-27 }}", ''University Business: The Magazine for College and University Administrators''.</ref> [[SAT scores]] play a role in The ''U.S. News & World Report'' college rankings even though ''U.S. News'' is not empowered with the ability to formally verify or recalculate the scores that are represented to them by schools.

As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the ''U.S. News'' reputational rankings in the future."<ref>{{cite web | first =Scott | last =Jaschik | title =More Momentum Against 'U.S.News' | publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = 20 June 2007 | url= http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/20/usnews}}</ref> The statement also said that its members "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process".<ref>{{cite web | first = | last = | title = Annapolis Group Statement on Rankings and Ratings | publisher = [[Annapolis Group]] | date = 19 June 2007 | url= http://www.collegenews.org/x7131.xml}}</ref> This database will be web-based and developed in conjunction with higher-education organizations including the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]] (NAICU) and the [[Council of Independent Colleges]].

On June 22, 2007, ''U.S. News & World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response in which he argued, "in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the 'intangibles' of a college that we can't measure through statistical data. Plus, the reputation of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature subjective, but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between private and public colleges."<ref name="aboutanna">{{cite web | first = Robert | last = Morse | title = About the Annapolis Group's Statement | publisher = U.S. News & World Report | date = 22 June 2007 | url = https://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702061309/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more | archivedate = 2 July 2007 }}</ref> In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse also argued, "It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that [[NAICU]] will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality. ''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''."<ref name="aboutanna"/>

Some higher education experts, such as Kevin Carey of Education Sector, have asserted that ''U.S. News & World Report'''s college rankings system is merely a list of criteria that mirrors the superficial characteristics of elite colleges and universities. According to Carey, the ''U.S. News'' ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity. He suggests that there are more important characteristics parents and students should research to select colleges, such as how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.<ref>{{cite web | last=Carey | first=Kevin | title=College Rankings Reformed | url=http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf | publisher=educationsector.org | accessdate=July 28, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823184901/http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf | archivedate=August 23, 2009 }}</ref>

The question of college rankings and their impact on admissions gained greater attention in March 2007, when [[Sarah Lawrence College#Outgoing president|Dr. Michele Tolela Myers]] (the former President of [[Sarah Lawrence College]]) [[Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)#Sarah Lawrence College|shared in an op-ed]]<ref name="Tolela Myers">{{cite news | first = Michele | last = Tolela Myers | title = The Cost of Bucking College Rankings | work = The Washington Post | date = 11 March 2007 | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030901836.html }}</ref> that the ''U.S. News & World Report'', when not given SAT scores for a university, chooses to simply rank the college with an invented SAT score of approximately one standard deviation (roughly 200 SAT points) behind those of peer colleges, with the reasoning being that [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT-optional]] universities will, because of their test-optional nature, accept higher numbers of less academically capable students.

In a 2011 article regarding the Sarah Lawrence controversy, [[Peter Sacks]] of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' criticized the ''U.S. News'' rankings' centering on test scores and denounced the magazine's "best colleges" list as a scam:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-sacks/americas-best-college-sca_b_45064.html | title=America's Best College Scam | last=Sacks | first=Peter | website=The Huffington Post | date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>

<blockquote>In the ''U.S. News'' worldview of college quality, it matters not a bit what students actually learn on campus, or how a college actually contributes to the intellectual, ethical and personal growth of students while on campus, or how that institution contributes to the public good [...] and then, when you consider that student SAT scores are profoundly correlated [to] parental income and education levels – the social class that a child is born into and grows up with – you begin to understand what a corrupt emperor 'America's Best Colleges' really is. The ranking amounts to little more than a pseudo-scientific and yet popularly legitimate tool for perpetuating inequality between educational haves and have nots – the rich families from the poor ones, and the well-endowed schools from the poorly endowed ones.</blockquote>
