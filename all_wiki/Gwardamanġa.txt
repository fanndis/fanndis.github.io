It is also the location where the [[Rediffusion House]] is found.

==Overview== 
[[File:Villa Messina Guardamangia Pieta Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Villa Messina near [[St. Luke's Hospital, Malta]]]]
At Gwardamanġa one may find the [[Villa Guardamangia]], a large two-storey building, best known for its elaborate porch which is reached by a flight of steps from each side. The first has a convex configuration over which is a wide elliptical arch. Scroll [[corbel]]s support the lintels of the sides, while a square-headed doorway is set in an elliptical arched recess. On top of the porch are a series of segmentally arched, [[louvred windows]]. Other features include semi-circular [[wrought iron]] balconies on each side of the porch, louvred windows and a 'remissa' doorway. The façade lacks decoration apart from a [[balustrade]]d [[parapet wall]].

The Villa was leased by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] in about 1929.  At various times between 1946 and 1953, the then Princess Elizabeth, now [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], stayed at the villa while her fiancé, and later husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] was stationed in Malta as a serving [[Royal Navy]] officer.  Philip and Elizabeth lived in Malta for a period between 1949 and 1951. (Malta is the only foreign country in which the Queen has ever lived.)  It has been suggested that it is here that her son [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] was conceived.  The Queen re-visited the villa during her state visit to Malta in 1992.
