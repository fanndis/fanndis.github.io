'''First Secretary of State''' is a title sometimes given to a [[cabinet minister]] in the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]. The title implies seniority over all other [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretaries of State]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/george-osborne-made-first-secretary-of-state-in-cabinet-reshuffle |title=George Osborne made first secretary of state in cabinet reshuffle|date=8 May 2015 |author=Nicholas Watt|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=8 May 2015 }}</ref> but has no specific powers or authority attached to it, including no automatic sucession to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. The title is not always in use, so there have sometimes been extended gaps between successive holders of the title. 

The title temporarily enjoyed some greater constitutional footing between when it was incorporated as a corporate sole in 2002<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2626/article/3/made The Transfer of Functions (Transport, Local Government and the Regions) Order 2002 Article 3(1).]</ref> and having all of its remaining functions transferred in 2008.<ref>The Transfer of Functions (Miscellaneous) Order 2008 Article 7.</ref> During most of this time, the title was held by [[John Prescott]]. 

[[Boris Johnson]] appointed the incumbent [[Dominic Raab]] to the title on 24 July 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dominic Raab appointed UK foreign secretary, first secretary of state: statement |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-leader-raab/dominic-raab-appointed-uk-foreign-secretary-first-secretary-of-state-statement-idUSKCN1UJ2JF |work=Reuters |location=London |date=25 July 2019 |access-date=26 July 2019 }}</ref> When Johnson was moved to the Intensive Care Unit on the 6 April 2020 after contracting [[COVID-19]], Raab was asked "...to deputise for him where necessary."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Statement from Downing Street: 6 April 2020|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-downing-street-6-april-2020|access-date=2020-08-12|website=GOV.UK|language=en}}</ref>

== Responsibilities ==
The role has had varying responsibilities over time. The most recent responsibilities are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/first-secretary-of-state--2|title=First Secretary of State - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=The information listed below is not currently included in the citation.|date=August 2020}}
* Supporting the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the running of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]].
* Deputising for the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].
* Advising the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] on developing and implementing government policy.
* Answering the questions at [[Prime Minister's Questions|PMQs]] in absence of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].
==Relationship with the title of Deputy Prime Minister==
The title of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] indicates that the holder ranks ''de facto'' second in government, after the Prime Minister, but does not confer cabinet rank.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} As it is not mentioned in the UK's [[uncodified constitution]], it also does not come with any executive powers or automatically pay a salary, while the title of Secretary of State does pay a salary.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/27 Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975] Sch 1.</ref>

The title of First Secretary of State was created in 1962 for Deputy Prime Minister [[Rab Butler|R. A. Butler]], granting him a place in cabinet despite not holding a specific cabinet portfolio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=It is not clear that this is why Butler was appointed the title of First Secretary of State.}} [[Michael Heseltine]] and [[John Prescott]] were also relieved of their cabinet portfolios when serving as Deputy Prime Minister and were therefore additionally appointed First Secretary of State.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=It is not clear that this is why Heseltine and Prescott were appointed to the title of First Secretary of State.}}  

In 1964, Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] established the alternative usage, appointing a First Secretary of State among the cabinet without appointing a Deputy Prime Minister.

The two titles have only existed concurrently with different holders in [[David Cameron]]'s [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]], wherein [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]] was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, while [[William Hague]] was appointed First Secretary of State.
