The '''English people''' are an [[ethnic group]] and a [[nation]] native to [[England]], who speak the [[English language in England|English language]] of the [[Indo-European language family]] and share a common history and culture. The English identity is of [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] origin, when they were known in [[Old English]] as the ''Angelcynn'' ('family of the [[Angles]]'). Their [[ethnonym]] is derived from the Angles, one of the [[Germanic peoples]] who migrated to [[Great Britain]] around the 5th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=English |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=8 July 2011}}</ref> England is the largest and most populous [[countries of the United Kingdom|country of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

In their 2004 Annual Population Survey, the [[Office for National Statistics]] compared the ''ethnic'' identities of British people with their perceived [[national identity]]. They found that while 58% of [[white people]] in England described their nationality as "English", the vast majority of non-white people called themselves "British".<ref>"78 per cent of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] said they were British, while only 5 per cent said they were English, Scottish or Welsh", and the largest percentage of non-whites to identify as English were the people who described their ethnicity as "[[Mixed race|Mixed]]" (37%).[https://web.archive.org/web/20110824122026/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=459 'Identity', ''National Statistics'', 21 February 2006]</ref>

===Relationship to Britishness===
It is unclear how many British people consider themselves English. The words "English" and "British" may be used interchangeably, especially outside the UK. In his study of English identity, [[Krishan Kumar (sociologist)|Krishan Kumar]] describes a common slip of the tongue in which people say "English, I mean British". He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: "Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also "problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity. It tells of the difficulty that most English people have of distinguishing themselves, in a collective way, from the other inhabitants of the British Isles".{{sfn|Kumar|2003|pp=1–2}}

In 1965, the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote,

<blockquote>When the ''[[Oxford History of England]]'' was launched a generation ago, "England" was still an all-embracing word. It meant indiscriminately England and Wales; Great Britain; the United Kingdom; and even the British Empire. Foreigners used it as the name of a [[Great Power]] and indeed continue to do so. [[Bonar Law]], by origin a [[Scottish Canadian|Scotch Canadian]],<!-- This is a verbatim quote, PLEASE DO NOT ALTER IT, even if you have are unfamiliar with or dislike this usage of the term "Scotch" --> was not ashamed to describe himself as "Prime Minister of England" [...] Now terms have become more rigorous. The use of "England" except for a geographic area brings protests, especially from the [[Scottish people|Scotch]].<ref>[[A. J. P. Taylor|Taylor, A. J. P.]] (1965, ''English History, 1914–1945'' Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. v</ref></blockquote>

However, although Taylor believed this blurring effect was dying out, in his book ''The Isles'' (1999), [[Norman Davies]] lists numerous examples in history books of "British" still being used to mean "English" and vice versa.<ref>Norman Davies, ''The Isles'' (1999){{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref>

In December 2010, [[Matthew Parris]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'', analysing the use of "English" over "British", argued that English identity, rather than growing, had existed all along but has recently been unmasked from behind a veneer of Britishness.<ref>Matthew Parris, in ''The Spectator'' dated 18 December 2010: "With a shrug of the shoulders, England is becoming a nation once again".</ref>

==Historical and genetic origins==

===Replacement of Neolithic farmers by Bell Beaker populations===

Recent genetic studies have suggested that Britain's Neolithic population was largely replaced by a population from North Continental Europe characterised by the [[Bell Beaker culture]] around 1200 BC, associated with the [[Yamnaya]] people from the [[Pontic-Caspian Steppe]]. This population lacked genetic affinity to other Bell Beaker populations, such as the Iberian Bell Beakers, but appeared to be an offshoot of the [[Corded Ware]] single grave people.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature07331|pmid = 18758442| pmc=2735096| title=Genes mirror geography within Europe| journal=Nature| volume=456| issue=7218| pages=98–101| year=2008| last1=Novembre| first1=John| last2=Johnson| first2=Toby| last3=Bryc| first3=Katarzyna| last4=Kutalik| first4=Zoltán| last5=Boyko| first5=Adam R.| last6=Auton| first6=Adam| last7=Indap| first7=Amit| last8=King| first8=Karen S.| last9=Bergmann| first9=Sven| last10=Nelson| first10=Matthew R.| last11=Stephens| first11=Matthew| last12=Bustamante| first12=Carlos D.|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/01/dutch-beakers-like-no-other-beakers.html | title=Dutch Beakers: Like no other Beakers| date=19 January 2019}}</ref> It is currently unknown whether these Beaker peoples went on to develop Celtic languages in the [[British Isles]], or whether later Celtic migrations introduced Celtic languages to Britain.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43115485 | title=Ancient Britons 'replaced' by newcomers| work=BBC News| date=21 February 2018| last1=Rincon| first1=Paul}}</ref>

The close genetic affinity of these Beaker people to Continental North Europeans means that British and Irish populations cluster genetically very closely with other Northwest European populations, regardless of how much Anglo-Saxon and Viking ancestry was introduced during the 1st millennium.{{Fix|BC or AD, or presumably later?}}<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1534/genetics.116.189241| pmid=27535931| pmc=5068857| title=Nationwide Genomic Study in Denmark Reveals Remarkable Population Homogeneity| journal=Genetics| volume=204| issue=2| pages=711–722| year=2016| last1=Athanasiadis| first1=G.| last2=Cheng| first2=J.

The influence of later invasions and migrations on the English population has been debated, as studies that sampled only modern DNA have produced uncertain results and have thus been subject to a large variety of interpretations.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/19/7/1008/1068561|title=Y Chromosome Evidence for Anglo-Saxon Mass Migration|first1=Michael E.|last1=Weale|first2=Deborah A.|last2=Weiss|first3=Rolf F.|last3=Jager|first4=Neil|last4=Bradman|first5=Mark G.|last5=Thomas|date=1 July 2002|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=19|issue=7|pages=1008–1021|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004160|pmid=12082121|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csueastbay.edu/museum/files/docs/exhibit/dna/dna-chrom-isles.pdf|title=A Y Chromosome Census of the British Isles}}</ref><ref name="oppenheimer">Oppenheimer, Stephen (2006). The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story: Constable and Robinson, London. {{ISBN|978-1-84529-158-7}}.</ref> More recently, however, ancient DNA has been used to provide a clearer picture of the genetic effects of these movements of people.

One 2016 study, using Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon era DNA found at grave sites in Cambridgeshire, calculated that ten modern day eastern English samples had 38% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, while ten Welsh and Scottish samples each had 30% Anglo-Saxon ancestry, with a large statistical spread in all cases. However, the authors noted that the similarity observed between the various sample groups was likely to be due to more recent internal migration.<ref>Schiffels, S. ''et al.'' (2016) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26783965 ''Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history''], Nature Communications 7, Article number:10408 doi:10.1038/ncomms10408</ref>

Another 2016 study conducted using evidence from burials found in northern England, found that a significant genetic difference was present in bodies from the Iron Age and the Roman period on the one hand, and the Anglo-Saxon period on the other. Samples from modern-day Wales were found to be similar to those from the Iron Age and Roman burials, while samples from much of modern England, East Anglia in particular, were closer to the Anglo-Saxon-era burial. This was found to demonstrate a "profound impact" from the Anglo-Saxon migrations on the modern English gene pool, though no specific percentages were given in the study.<ref name="auto5"/>

A third study combined the ancient data from both of the preceding studies and compared it to a large number of modern samples from across Britain and Ireland. This study found that modern southern, central and eastern English populations were of "a predominantly Anglo-Saxon-like ancestry" while those from northern and southwestern England had a greater degree of indigenous origin.<ref>Ross P. Byrne, Rui Martiniano, Lara M. Cassidy, Matthew Carrigan, Garrett Hellenthal, Orla Hardiman, Daniel G. Bradley, Russell McLaughlin: "Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration" (2018)</ref>

A major 2020 study, which used DNA from Viking-era burials in various regions across Europe, found that modern English samples showed nearly equal contributions from a native British "North Atlantic" population and a Danish-like population. While much of the latter signature was attributed to the earlier settlement of the Anglo-Saxons, it was calculated that up to 6% of it could have come from Danish Vikings, with a further 4% contribution from a Norwegian-like source representing the Norwegian Vikings. The study also found an average 18% admixture from a source further south in Europe, which was interpreted as reflecting the legacy of French migration under the Normans.<ref>Margaryan, A., Lawson, D.J., Sikora, M. et al.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{further|Anglo-Saxons|Roman Britain|Sub-Roman Britain|Brython|l4=Ancient Britons|Romano-British culture|l5=Romano-Britons}}

The first people to be called 'English' were the [[Anglo-Saxons]], a group of closely related [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes that began migrating to eastern and southern Great Britain, from southern [[Denmark]] and northern [[Germany]], in the 5th century AD, after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Romans had withdrawn from Britain]]. The Anglo-Saxons gave their name to England (''Engla land'', meaning "Land of the Angles") and to the English.

The Anglo-Saxons arrived in a land that was already populated by people commonly referred to as the '[[Romano-British]]'—the descendants of the native Brittonic-speaking population that lived in the area of Britain under Roman rule during the 1st–5th centuries AD. The multi-ethnic nature of the [[Roman Empire]] meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at [[Aballava]], now [[Burgh-by-Sands]], in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit ''Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum'' ("unit of Aurelian Moors") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/blackhistorymap/arch.html The archaeology of black Britain], Channel 4.

The exact nature of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons]] and their relationship with the Romano-British is a matter of debate. The traditional view is that a mass invasion by various Anglo-Saxon tribes largely displaced the indigenous British population in southern and eastern Great Britain (modern-day England with the exception of [[Cornwall]]). This is supported by the writings of [[Gildas]], who gives the only contemporary historical account of the period, and describes the slaughter and starvation of native Britons by invading tribes (''[[Anglo-Saxon invasion|aduentus Saxonum]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/gildas_02_ruin_of_britain.htm|title=Gildas, The Ruin of Britain &c.|date=1899|pages=4–252|first=Gildas the|last=Wise|website=Tertullian.org|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, the English language contains no more than a handful of words borrowed from [[Brythonic languages|Brittonic]] sources.<ref>[http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/celtpn.htm celtpn<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206051120/http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/dialect/celtpn.htm|date=6 December 2007}} However the names of some towns, cities, rivers etc. do have Brittonic or pre-Brittonic origins, becoming more frequent towards the west of Britain.</ref>

This view was later re-evaluated by some archaeologists and historians, with a more small-scale migration being posited, possibly based around an elite of male warriors that took over the rule of the country and gradually acculturated the people living there.<ref>''Britain BC: Life in Britain and Ireland before the Romans'' by [[Francis Pryor]], p. 122.

An emerging view is that the degree of population replacement by the Anglo-Saxons, and thus the degree of survival of the Romano-Britons, varied across England, and that as such the overall settlement of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons cannot be described by any one process in particular. Large-scale migration and population shift seems to be most applicable in the cases of eastern regions such as East Anglia and Lincolnshire,<ref>Stefan Burmeister, ''Archaeology and Migration'' (2000): " ... immigration in the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon settlement does not seem aptly described in terms of the “elite-dominance model.To all appearances, the settlement was carried out by small, agriculture-oriented kinship groups. This process corresponds more closely to a classic settler model. The absence of early evidence of a socially demarcated elite underscores the supposition that such an elite did not play a substantial role. Rich burials such as are well known from Denmark have no counterparts in England until the 6th century. At best, the elite-dominance model might apply in the peripheral areas of the settlement territory, where an immigration predominantly {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} men and the existence of hybrid cultural forms might support it."</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dark|first=Ken R.|title=Large-scale population movements into and from Britain south of Hadrian's Wall in the fourth to sixth centuries AD|year=2003|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2003-03_K._R._Dark,_Large-scale_population_movements_into_and_from_Britan_south_of_Hadrian's_Wall_in_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries_AD.pdf}}</ref><ref>Toby F.

===Vikings and the Danelaw===

{{Further|Vikings|Danelaw}}
From about 800 AD waves of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] Viking assaults on the coastlines of the [[British Isles]] were gradually followed by a succession of Danish settlers in England. At first, the Vikings were very much considered a separate people from the English. This separation was enshrined when [[Alfred the Great]] signed the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] to establish the Danelaw, a division of England between English and Danish rule, with the Danes occupying northern and eastern England.<ref>''The Age of Athelstan'' by Paul Hill (2004), Tempus Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7524-2566-8}}</ref>

However, Alfred's successors subsequently won military victories against the Danes, incorporating much of the Danelaw into the nascent kingdom of England. Danish invasions continued into the 11th century, and there were both English and Danish kings in the period following the unification of England (for example, [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (978–1013 and 1014–1016) was English but [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (1016–1035) was Danish).

Gradually, the Danes in England came to be seen as 'English'. They had a noticeable impact on the English language: many English words, such as ''anger'', ''ball'', ''egg'', ''got'', ''knife'', ''take'', and ''they'', are [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|of Old Norse origin]],<ref>''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=d&p=18 Online Etymology Dictionary]'' by Douglas Harper (2001), [http://www.etymonline.com/sources.php List of sources used].

===English unification===
{{further|Treaty of Wedmore|Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum}}

The English population was not politically unified until the 10th century. Before then, there were a number of [[petty kingdom]]s which gradually coalesced into a [[heptarchy]] of seven states, the most powerful of which were [[Mercia]] and [[Wessex]]. The English [[nation state]] began to form when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms united against Danish Viking invasions, which began around 800 AD. Over the following century and a half England was for the most part a politically unified entity, and remained permanently so after 959.

The nation of England was formed in 937 by [[Æthelstan]] of Wessex after the [[Battle of Brunanburh]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/athelstan.shtml|title= Athelstan (c.895–939) : Historic Figures|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=30 October 2006}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3483029 The Battle of Brunanburh, 937AD]'' by [[h2g2]], [[BBC]] website.

===Norman and Angevin rule===
{{further|Normans}}
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hastings]], 1066 (from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]])]]

The [[Norman conquest of England]] during 1066 brought Anglo-Saxon and Danish rule of England to an end, as the new [[French language|French speaking]] [[Normans|Norman]] elite almost universally replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and church leaders. After the conquest, "English" normally included all natives of England, whether they were of Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian or Celtic ancestry, to distinguish them from the Norman invaders, who were regarded as "Norman" even if born in England, for a generation or two after the Conquest.<ref>''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, s.v. 'English'.</ref> The Norman dynasty ruled England for 87 years until the death of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] in 1154, when the succession passed to [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[House of Plantagenet]] (based in France), and England became part of the [[Angevin Empire]] until 1399.

Various contemporary sources suggest that within 50 years of the invasion most of the Normans outside the royal court had switched to English, with [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] remaining the prestige language of government and law largely out of social inertia. For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language. Anglo-Norman continued to be used by the Plantagenet kings until [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] came to the throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&FileName=britain_3.php|website=Heritage History<!-- — Putting the "Story" back into History--> |title =England—Plantagenet Kings|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216064812/http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&FileName=britain_3.php |archive-date=16 December 2010}}</ref> Over time the English language became more important even in the court, and the Normans were gradually assimilated, until, by the 14th century, both rulers and subjects regarded themselves as English and spoke the English language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/lang_gallery_04.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: The Ages of English|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>

Despite the assimilation of the Normans, the distinction between 'English' and 'French' survived in official documents long after it had fallen out of common use, in particular in the legal phrase ''[[Presentment of Englishry]]'' (a rule by which a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] had to prove an unidentified murdered body found on their soil to be that of an Englishman, rather than a Norman, if they wanted to avoid a fine). This law was abolished in 1340.<ref>[[OED]], s.v. 'Englishry'.</ref>

Since the 18th century, England has been one part of a wider political entity covering all or part of the British Isles, which today is called the United Kingdom. [[Wales]] was [[Annexation|annexed]] by England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], which incorporated Wales into the English state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~dluby/history.htm|title=Liberation of Ireland|website=Iol.ie|access-date=23 June 2006}}</ref> A new British identity was subsequently developed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became [[James I of England]] as well, and expressed the desire to be known as the monarch of Britain.<ref>''A History of Britain: The British Wars 1603–1776'' by [[Simon Schama]], BBC Worldwide. {{ISBN|0-563-53747-7}}.</ref>

In 1707, England formed a union with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in March 1707 that ratified the [[Treaty of Union]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the [[Irish Free State]]. The remainder became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although this name was not introduced until 1927, after some years in which the term "United Kingdom" had been little used.

Throughout the history of the UK, the English have been dominant in population and in political weight. As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar. At the same time, after the Union of 1707, the English, along with the other peoples of the British Isles, have been encouraged to think of themselves as British rather than to identify themselves with the constituent nations.<ref>''The English'', [[Jeremy Paxman]] 1998{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref>

===Immigration and assimilation===
{{See also|Historical immigration to Great Britain|Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)}}

England has been the destination of varied numbers of migrants at different periods from the 17th century onwards. While some members of these groups seek to practise a form of pluralism, attempting to maintain a separate ethnic identity, others have [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] and [[Interracial marriage|intermarried]] with the English. Since [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|resettlement of the Jews]] in 1656, there have been waves of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigration from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 19th century and from Germany in the 20th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/digest/in_depth/on_anglo_jewry/|title=EJP - In Depth - On Anglo Jewry|date=14 July 2006|access-date=21 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714100957/http://www.ejpress.org/digest/in_depth/on_anglo_jewry/|archive-date=14 July 2006}}</ref>

This perceived rise in English self-consciousness has generally been attributed to the [[devolution]] in the late 1990s of some powers to the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]].<ref name=Economist/> In policy areas for which the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]] have responsibility, the UK Parliament votes on laws that consequently only apply to England. Because the Westminster Parliament is composed of MPs from throughout the United Kingdom, this has given rise to the "[[West Lothian question]]", a reference to the situation in which MPs representing constituencies outside England can vote on matters affecting only England, but MPs cannot vote on the same matters in relation to the other parts of the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82358.stm|title=The West Lothian Question|publisher=BBC News |date=1 June 1998|access-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> Consequently, groups such as the CEP have called for the creation of a [[Devolved English parliament|devolved English Parliament]], claiming that there is now a discriminatory democratic deficit against the English.

Recent surveys of public opinion on the establishment of an English parliament have given widely varying conclusions.

Prior to this, in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], 24,509,692 Americans described their [[ancestry]] as wholly or partly English. In addition, 1,035,133 recorded British ancestry.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/tablist.html US Census 2000 data], table PHC-T-43.</ref> This was a numerical decrease from the census in [[1990 United States Census|1990]] where 32,651,788 people or 13.1% of the population self-identified with English ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|title=1990 Census of Population Detailed Ancestry Groups for States|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cp-s/cp-s-1-2.pdf|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=30 November 2012|date=18 September 1992}}</ref>

In [[1980 United States Census|1980]] over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.34% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf|work=1980 United States Census|title = Table 2: Persons Who Reported at Least One Specific Ancestry Group for the United States: 1980}}</ref> [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish Americans]] are descendants of [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]] (specifically: [[County Durham]], [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Westmorland]]) settlers who colonised Ireland during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in the 17th century.

[[Americans]] of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply "American" due to the many historic cultural ties between England and the U.S. and their influence on the country's population. Relative to ethnic groups of other European origins, this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SoOXrMVp5BsC&pg=PA37&dq=english+ancestry+united+states&cd=2#v=onepage&q=english%20ancestry%20united%20states&f=false From many strands: ethnic and racial groups in contemporary América] by Stanley Lieberson</ref>

===Australia===

{{main|English Australians}}
From the beginning of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|colonial era]] until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from the [[British Isles]], with the English being the dominant group. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.<ref name="abs.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument|title=Chapter - Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=Abs.gov.au|access-date=21 August 2017|date=3 June 2003}}</ref>

[[Australians]] of English descent, are both the single largest ethnic group in [[Australia]] and the largest 'ancestry' identity in the Australian census.<ref name="Census2016-036">{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/036 |title=Census 2016: Summary of result – Population by states and territories, 2011 and 2016 Census |work=Australian Bureau of Statistics |publisher=Australian Government }}</ref>
In the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], 7.8 million or 36.1% of the population identified as "English" or a combination including English, a numerical increase from 7.2 million over the 2011 census figure. The census also documented 907,572 residents or 3.9% of Australia as being born in [[England]], and are the largest overseas-born population.<ref name="auto2"/>

===New Zealand===
From 1840, the English comprised the largest single group among New Zealand's overseas-born, consistently being over 50 percent of the total population.<ref name="auto4">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFF8ynVL4wIC&q=new+zealand+foundational+culture+was+english&pg=PA151|title=Locating the English Diaspora 1500-2010|first1=Tanja|last1=Bueltmann|first2=David T.|last2=Gleeson|first3=Donald M.|last3=MacRaild|date=2010|isbn=9781846318191|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>
Despite this, after the early 1850s the English-born slowly fell from being a majority of the colonial population. In the [[1851 New Zealand census|1851 census]] 50.5% of the total population were born in England, this proportion fell to 36.5% (1861) and 24.3% by 1881.<ref name="auto4"/>

In the most recent Census in [[2013 New Zealand census|2013]], there were 215,589 English-born representing 21.5% of all overseas-born residents or 5 percent of the total population and is still the most-common birthplace outside New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/sites/default/files/2013%20Census%20QuickStats%20about%20culture%20and%20identity.pdf|title=Birthplace (detailed) For the census usually resident population count 2001, 2006, and 2013 Censuses Table 11|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>

English settlers arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1806 (then a Spanish colony) in small numbers, mostly as businessmen, when [[Argentina]] was an emerging nation and the settlers were welcomed for the stability they brought to commercial life. As the 19th century progressed more English families arrived, and many bought land to develop the potential of the Argentine pampas for the large-scale growing of crops. The English founded banks, developed the export trade in crops and animal products and imported the luxuries that the growing Argentine middle classes sought.<ref name="BSIA001">{{cite news | title =Emigration of Scots, English and Welsh-speaking people to Argentina in the nineteenth century | publisher =British Settlers in Argentina—studies in 19th and 20th century emigration | url =http://www.argbrit.org/ | access-date =8 January 2008}}</ref>

As well as those who went to [[Argentina]] as industrialists and major landowners, others went as [[Railroad engineer|railway engineers]], [[civil engineer]]s and to work in [[bank]]ing and [[commerce]]. Others went to become [[whaler]]s, [[missionaries]] and simply to seek out a future. English families sent second and younger sons, or what were described as the [[black sheep]] of the family, to Argentina to make their fortunes in [[cattle]] and [[wheat]]. English settlers introduced [[Association football|football]] to Argentina. Some English families owned [[Plantation|sugar plantations]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}

English people traditionally speak the [[English language]], a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[language family]]. The modern English language evolved from [[Middle English language|Middle English]] (the form of language in use by the English people from the 12th to the 15th century); Middle English was influenced lexically by Norman-French, Old French and Latin. In the Middle English period Latin was the language of administration and the nobility spoke Norman French. Middle English was itself derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] of the Anglo-Saxon period; in the Northern and Eastern parts of England the language of Danish settlers had influenced the language, a fact still evident in Northern English dialects.

There were once many different dialects of modern English in England, which were recorded in projects such as the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' (late 19th century) and the [[Survey of English Dialects]] (mid 20th century), but many of these have passed out of common usage as [[Standard English]] has become more widespread through education, the media and socio-economic pressures.<ref>Wolfgang Vierick (1964), ''Der English Dialect Survey und der Linguistic Survey of Scotland - Arbeitsmethoden und bisherige Ergebnisse'', Zeitschrift für Mundartforschung 31, 333-335 in {{cite book |last=Shorrocks |first=Graham |year=1999 |title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area, Part 1 |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=3-631-33066-9 |page=58}}</ref>

[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is one of three existing Brittonic languages; its usage has been revived in [[Cornwall]]. Historically, another Brittonic Celtic language, [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], was spoken in [[Cumbria]] in [[North West England]], but it died out in the 11th century although traces of it can still be found in the Cumbrian dialect. [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London and the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the [[BBC]]) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] of [[business]], [[science]], [[communication]], [[sports]], [[aviation]], and [[diplomacy]].

[[File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped) 02.jpg|thumb|''Geoffrey Chaucer'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɔː|s|ər}}; {{circa|1340s}} – 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.]]

English literature begins with [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], which was written in [[Old English]] and produced epic works such as [[Beowulf]] and the fragmentary [[The Battle of Maldon]], [[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]] and [[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]. For many years, [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the [[medieval period]] there was a flourishing of literature in [[Middle English]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is the most famous writer of this period. 

The [[Elizabethan era]] is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].

Other famous English writers include [[Jane Austen]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[A. E. Housman]], [[George Orwell]] and the [[Lake Poets]].

Due to the expansion of English into a [[world language]] during the British Empire, literature is now written in English across the world.

In 2003 the [[BBC]] carried out a UK survey entitled ''[[The Big Read]]'' in order to find the "nation's best-loved novel" of all time, with works by English novelists [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Douglas Adams]] and [[J. K. Rowling]] making up the top five on the list.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml BBC – The Big Read – Top 100 Books]. Retrieved 2010-27-11.</ref>
