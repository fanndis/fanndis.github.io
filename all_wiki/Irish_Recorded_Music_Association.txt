The '''Irish Recorded Music Association''' ('''IRMA''') is a non-profit association set up in 1999 to promote certain interests of the [[music industry in the Republic of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irma.ie/index2.htm|title=IRMA - About Us|work=irma.ie}}</ref>  It is particularly active in addressing copyright issues, and it compiles the official music charts for Ireland.

==Membership==
Only Irish companies can become members of the IRMA. All members pay a yearly fee based on company size. Currently, the IRMA has 51 member companies.

=== Board member companies===

*IML Irish Music Licensing Ltd

==Goals and activities==
IRMA  operates to promote and protect the welfare and interests of the Irish record industry. Specifically, IRMA is involved in lobbying to protect and enhance the interest of member companies and lobby to prevent illegal downloading of music content from local and international artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/is-censorship-the-order-of-the-day-in-protecting-the-music-industry-1653919.html|title=Is censorship the order of the day in protecting the music industry?|work=[[Independent.ie]]}}</ref>

IRMA also compiles and manages the official music charts for the Republic of Ireland. These include: [[Irish Albums Chart|Top 100 Albums]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Top 100 Singles]], Top 10 Classical Albums, Top 10 Dance Singles, Top 20 Multi-Artist Compilation Albums, Top 30 Videos, Top 20 DVDs and Top 10 Music DVDS.

In the mid-1990s IRMA presented the IRMA Music Awards. These have been replaced by the annual music awards show [[Meteor Ireland Music Awards]].

In the past IRMA has organised "The IRMA Honours," an awards ceremony which honours the life work of Ireland's leading musicians and people who have influenced the Irish music industry. Past recipients include [[Bob Geldof]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irma.ie/irma_honours.htm|title=>> IRMA << Welcome to our site >>|work=irma.ie|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109130613/http://www.irma.ie/irma_honours.htm|archivedate=9 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Larry Gogan]] and [[Christy Moore]].

===Copyright issues===
On 12 April 2005, the association began to take legal action against "serial filesharers" in the Republic of Ireland who illegally distribute music on the Internet. On 15 November 2005, the IRMA began "Phase II" of its plan to battle filesharing.

On 12 June 2013, IRMA secured an Order of the High Court to block access to [[The Pirate Bay]] to all Irish internet users in the Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/high-court-gives-irish-isps-30-days-to-block-the-pirate-bay-130612/|title=High Court Gives Irish ISPs 30 Days To Block The Pirate Bay|work=[[TorrentFreak]]}}</ref>

=== Filesharing controversy ===
{{see also|Internet censorship in the Republic of Ireland}}
IRMA and [[Eircom]] reached an agreement over file sharing which uses a third-party organisation to monitor Eircom users for downloading of infringing music.<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0206/1233796244239.html Specialists to police music downloads], John Collins, [[The Irish Times]], 6 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref> The agreed system was reported to use a "three-strikes-and-you're-out" system.<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009"/> The agreement was criticised by [[Digital Rights Ireland]] and [[IrelandOffline]].<ref name="irish-times-feb-6-2009"/><ref name="silicon-republic-ireland-offline">[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12374/digital-life/lobby-group-calls-for-stop-to-censorship-plans Lobby group calls for stop to censorship plans], Marie Boran, Silicon Republic, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref>

The association sent solicitors' letters to several organisations, including [[Internet hosting service|hosting service]] [[Blacknight Solutions]], whose MD, Michele Neylon, made the copy sent to his company publicly available on the company site.<ref name="blacknight-letter">[http://www.enn.ie/story/show/10125049 "IRMA warning letter goes public"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228060007/http://www.enn.ie/story/show/10125049 |date=28 February 2009 }}, Ralph Averbuch, ENN.ie, 26 February 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2009.</ref> Although Blacknight Solutions isn't an ISP they still received the letter, which stated ''in the event of a positive response to this letter it is proposed to make practical arrangements with Blacknight of a like nature to those made with eircom''.<ref name="blacknight-letter"/><ref name="dri-filtering-and-strikes">[http://www.digitalrights.ie/2009/02/26/music-industry-pushing-for-internet-filtering-as-well-as-three-strikes-what-can-you-do-about-it/ "Music industry pushing for internet filtering as well as 'three strikes' â€“ what can you do about it?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228154539/http://www.digitalrights.ie/2009/02/26/music-industry-pushing-for-internet-filtering-as-well-as-three-strikes-what-can-you-do-about-it/ |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>

Protests against some actions of IRMA are being organised by Digital Rights Ireland, as well as Blackout Ireland.<ref name="dri-filtering-and-strikes"/>

== The IRMA trust ==
In 1997 the IRMA set up a trust with [[Phonographic Performance Ireland]], with the aim to enhance the opportunities for young people who want to pursue a career in music. The trust's main initiative is the Instrument Bank, which provides music instruments to young people, particularly to young people who live in disadvantaged communities throughout Ireland.
