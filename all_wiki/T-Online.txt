==History==
[[File:t-online.de.svg|frameless|right|Historical T-Online logo 1995 to 25&nbsp;March 2019]]
In 1995 [[Deutsche Telekom]] renamed the ''[[Bildschirmtext]]'' (BTX) service as "T-Online". In Spring 2000, T-Online became the first major ISP in Germany to offer a flat-rate dialup plan for consumers.  This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including dialup access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis.  The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with [[ISDN]] connections at the same price as for analog service. In Spring 2001, T-Online announced the demise of the flat-rate dialup plan but offered a flat-rate [[DSL]] plan in its place.

Deutsche Telekom (T-Online) was the monopoly [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) for the [[Internet in Germany|German Internet]] until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter.<ref name="dtag-interneten">{{cite book | title= Internet Entrepreneurship in Europe: Venture Failure and the Timing of Telecommunications Reform | first= Niko Marcel | last= Waesche | pages= [https://archive.org/details/internetentrepre0000waes/page/162 162]–164 | year= 2003 | publisher= Edward Elgar Publishing | isbn= 978-1-84376-135-8 | url= https://archive.org/details/internetentrepre0000waes| url-access= registration }}</ref> Until the 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany.<ref name="dtag-interneten"/>
