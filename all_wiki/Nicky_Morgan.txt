'''Nicola Ann Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Cotes''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (''n√©e'' '''Griffith'''; born 10 October 1972) is a British politician who served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] from 2014 to 2016 and [[Culture Secretary]] from 2019 to 2020. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], she was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]] from [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] to [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]]. 

Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]], Morgan was raised in [[Surbiton]]. After graduating from [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], she worked as a solicitor and corporate lawyer. She was elected to the [[marginal seat]] of [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]] at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. She served as [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] from October 2013 to April 2014 and as [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] from April to July 2014.  

Morgan first served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Education]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]] from 2014 until new Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] removed her from these positions in 2016. In July 2017, she was elected chair of the [[Treasury Select Committee]] following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. 

Morgan accepted the appointment by [[Boris Johnson]] of [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] in July 2019, even though she had stated in 2018 she would not serve in a Johnson government. In October 2019, Morgan announced she would stand down as an MP at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] but retained her cabinet post as part of the [[second Johnson ministry]] after being elevated to the [[House of Lords]] as a [[life peer]]. She stood down from her ministerial position in Johnson's [[2020 British cabinet reshuffle|2020 cabinet reshuffle]].

== Early life and career ==
Morgan was born in [[Kingston upon Thames]], south-west [[London]] on 10 October 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Morgan, Rt Hon. Nicola (Ann), (Rt Hon.

Morgan joined the Conservative Party as a teenager in 1989.<ref name=":0" /> She read [[jurisprudence]] at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]].<ref name="loughboroughnicky" /> She twice stood unsuccessfully for president of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]], on the second occasion being defeated by [[Daniel Hannan]], later a prominent Conservative Member of the European Parliament. She was also involved in the [[Oxford Union]] society. She was elected treasurer, but failed in her bid for its presidency.  

Morgan qualified as a solicitor in 1994 and worked as a [[corporate lawyer]] at [[Travers Smith]] specialising in [[mergers and acquisitions]] before taking on an [[in-house counsel]] role advising on corporate law matters.<ref name="Conservative Party profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Morgan_Nicky.aspx|title=Nicky Morgan|publisher=Conservative Party|accessdate=7 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322121713/http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Morgan_Nicky.aspx|archive-date=22 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She was the chair of [[Wessex]] [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] from 1995 to 1997 and vice-chair of [[Battersea]] Conservatives from 1997 to 1999.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/representatives/profiles/31696.stm|title=Nicky Morgan MP Loughborough, Conservative|work=[[BBC Democracy Live]]|accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Morgan unsuccessfully contested the [[Islington South and Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington South and Finsbury]] constituency in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. She was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Loughborough parliamentary seat in 2004 but was defeated by the Labour incumbent in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], although she achieved a 5% Labour to Conservative swing compared to a national average of 3.1%. This made Loughborough the most [[marginal seat]] in the [[East Midlands]]. Morgan was reselected for the Loughborough seat in 2006.

== Parliamentary career ==
In the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Morgan was elected as the MP for Loughborough on a swing of 5.5% with a majority of 3,744 votes.<ref name=LEcho>{{cite news | last = Ashe | first = Isaac |title= Loughborough seat won by Conservative Nicky Morgan |url=http://www.loughboroughecho.net/news/loughborough-news/2010/05/07/loughborough-seat-won-by-conservative-nicky-morgan-73871-26394388 |date=7 May 2010|work=Loughborough Echo|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> She made her [[maiden speech]] in a debate on Economic Affairs and Work and Pensions on 8 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2010-06-08a.219.0|title=House of Commons debates:Speaker Nicky Morgan|publisher=TheyWorkForYou.com|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> In June 2010, she was selected as a Conservative member of the [[Business, Innovation and Skills Committee]] but was replaced following promotion in September to [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Universities and Science Minister, [[David Willetts]].<ref>{{cite news| last = Hess | first = John|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/johnhess/2010/09/new_mps_tipped_for_the_top.html|work=BBC News|title=New MPs tipped for the top?|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> She was appointed as an [[Chief Whip#The Whips Office|assistant whip]] in September 2012 and as [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] on 7 October 2013.<ref name="juli&john">{{cite news | last1 = Jowit | first1 = Juliette | last2 = Burn-Murdoch | first2 = John |title= The new cabinet: no women in Treasury but Boris Johnson's brother on the up |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/05/new-cabinet-treasury-lady-warsi|work=The Guardian|date=5 September 2012|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="tw4y">{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/24732/nicky_morgan/loughborough|title=Nicky Morgan Conservative MP for Loughborough|publisher=TheyWorkForYou.com|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

In July 2010, Morgan asked the Prime Minister to join her in congratulating [[Loughborough Students' Union#Loughborough Students' Rag|Loughborough University Student Union Rag Committee]] on raising more money on behalf of the [[Royal British Legion]] than any other rag in the country.<ref name=rag>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] | title = Prime Minister's Questions | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100714/debtext/100714-0001.htm#10071434000010 |date= 14 July 2010 | access-date = 19 February 2011 |column_start= 941 |column_end= 942|speaker=Nicky Morgan |position=[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]]}}</ref> Both agreed it was an example of the [[Big Society]] in action.<ref name=rag/>

On 7 November 2010, Morgan appeared on the ''[[Daily Politics#Sunday Politics (English regions)|Politics Show]]'' with Lucy Hopkins, [[Loughborough Students' Union]] President, to continue an earlier on-campus debate on the tripling of [[Tuition fees|student tuition fees]]. Morgan agreed costs could be daunting but said student numbers were unsustainable, it was fair to ask people to invest in their own education and people should ask more questions about how courses would improve prospects. Hopkins accepted that the Government had tried to find fair options but said students were taking on "excessive debts" which they would still be paying off when their own children went to university, they had no guarantee of a better job and those from poor homes would either have to choose an affordable university or not attend. In response, Morgan said that university was not a rite of passage, and that there were other ways of continuing education and she herself had taken eight years to pay off her debts.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Nicky Morgan (guest), Lucy Hopkins (guest) | date = 7 November 2010 | title= Interview | medium= Television | series = [[Daily Politics#Sunday Politics (English regions)|Sunday Politics, East Midlands]] | url =  | publisher= [[BBC One]]}}</ref>

=== Minister for Women and Equalities ===
In 2013, Morgan voted against the introduction of [[same-sex marriage in England and Wales]], arguing that marriage could only be between a man and a woman.<ref name="merc-val">{{Cite news | last = Leicester Mercury |title= Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan explains why she voted against allowing gay marriage |url= http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Loughborough-MP-Nicky-Morgan-explains-voted/story-18148357-detail/story.html  |date=14 February 2013 |work=Leicester Mercury |access-date=8 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321085634/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Loughborough-MP-Nicky-Morgan-explains-voted/story-18148357-detail/story.html |archive-date=21 March 2015}}</ref>

Following the resignation of [[Maria Miller]] from the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], she became [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Minister for Women]] (attending Cabinet) on 9 April 2014 and was appointed a [[Privy Councillor]].<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Clare | first1 = Sean | last2 = Browning | first2 = Anna | last3 = Parkinson | first3 = Justin |title=As it happened: Miller resignation |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26951726 | work = BBC News|date=9 April 2014|accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> However, the equalities brief went to [[Sajid Javid]], the culture secretary.<ref name="Appointments">{{cite press release|title=Ministerial appointments: April 2014|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ministerial-appointments-april-2014|date=9 April 2014|location=London|publisher=Prime Minister's Office|access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref>

The separation of the equalities portfolio was seen by some as a response to Morgan's vote against the government's proposal to introduce legislation allowing same-sex marriages. This led to accusations that Morgan was merely "minister for straight women".<ref name="merc-val" /><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news | last = Mason | first = Rowena | title = Nicky Morgan's gay-marriage stance causes equalities role confusion ‚Ä¶ again | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/15/equalities-minister-voted-against-gay-marriage-nicky-morgan | work = The Guardian | date = 15 July 2014 | access-date = 19 July 2014 }}</ref> On her promotion, she retained her post as Minister for Women and also added the equalities brief to it, thus also becoming [[Minister for Women and Equalities]].<ref>{{cite press release | title = Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities: The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan MP |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/nicky-morgan | date = 15 July 2014 |location=London |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref> However, Downing Street announced that responsibility for implementing the rest of the changes to same-sex marriage would be driven by [[Nick Boles]], a new education minister who is himself gay and is in a civil partnership.<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

In October 2014, she clarified her views saying she had previously voted against gay marriage as she believed her constituents were opposed to it. However she would now support it and she wished "supporters of same-sex marriage had been more vocal about their position before the vote in July last year."<ref name=georgygirl>{{cite news| last = Graham | first = Georgia |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11194679/I-have-changed-my-mind-on-gay-marriage-Nicky-Morgan-says.html|title=I have changed my mind on gay marriage, Nicky Morgan says|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> She expressed support for [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|Ireland's "yes" vote on same-sex marriage]] in May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Politicians welcome victory for same-sex marriage in Ireland|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/23/uk-politicians-welcome-victory-for-same-sex-marriage-in-ireland/|publisher=Pink News|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=23 May 2015}}</ref>

=== Secretary of State for Education ===
Morgan was appointed [[Secretary of State for Education]] in Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]'s reshuffle in July 2014, replacing [[Michael Gove]].<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Alex  |display-authors=etal| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28303750 | title = As it happened: PM reshuffles cabinet | work = BBC News | date = 14 July 2014 | access-date = 14 July 2014 }}</ref>

In September 2014, Morgan was questioned by Parliament's [[Education Select Committee]] following a report by London University's [[Institute of Education]] on conflicts of interest between academies and their financial backers. The report failed to find evidence that academies were undertaking competitive tendering or that they were being properly monitored by the [[Education Funding Agency|Education Funding Agency (EFA)]]. It also said that previous reports had also questioned the capability of the EFA to fund and finance academies. [[Graham Stuart (politician)|Graham Stuart]], chairman of the committee, acknowledged that there were loopholes but said the public needed to be sure that sponsors acted exclusively in the interests of their school.<ref>{{cite news| last = Woolcock | first = Nicola |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4208640.ece|title=Academy sponsors 'cashing in'|work=Sunday Times|url-access=subscription |date=17 September 2014|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>

Following concerns from business leaders that children were leaving school without good teamwork skills, Morgan stated that character development is as important as academic achievement. In December 2014, she announced ¬£3.5&nbsp;million of funding to promote the building of "grit" and "resilience". Some schemes were likely to involve ex-servicemen teaching pupils ‚Äì particularly those with behaviour problems ‚Äì the importance of discipline. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported potential concerns about maths, English and science being effectively downgraded.<ref name=graeme>{{cite news | last = Paton | first = Graeme |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11296280/Nicky-Morgan-lessons-in-character-just-as-important-as-academic-grades.html|title=Nicky Morgan: lessons in character 'just as important' as academic grades|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>

Morgan was removed from her position of Education Secretary on 14 July 2016 under the new Prime Minister Theresa May.<ref name="sacking">{{cite news|last=Staff writer|date=14 July 2016|title=Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36785814|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>

=== Criticism by the UK Statistics Authority ===
In December 2014, Morgan was advised by [[Andrew Dilnot|Sir Andrew Dilnot]], chair of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], that she should "reconsider her comments" and possibly "take advice" about misleading information given to parliament. Morgan had claimed that one third of children under the previous Labour government had left primary school unable to read or write. In fact 91% of 11-year-old pupils tested in May 2010 had reached at least level 3 of [[Key Stage 2]] ‚Äì defined as being able to "read a range of texts fluently and accurately" ‚Äì whereas 83% achieved level 4, the expected level. The BBC noting that 64% achieved expected results in all subjects tested suggests Morgan had both misunderstood official literacy level definitions and confused literacy results with expected overall attainment levels.<ref name=beebstats>{{cite news|last = Staff writer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30533044|title=Morgan criticised over use of statistics|work=BBC News|date=19 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Relationship with Michael Gove ===
In an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' in December 2014, Morgan ‚Äì who has been engaged in a long running "battle with Michael Gove" over policy ‚Äì expounded her views on her relationship with her predecessor.<ref name=toby>{{cite news | last1 = Helm | first1 = Toby | last2 = Cowburn | first2 = Ashley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/06/nicky-morgan-battle-michael-gove-schools|title=Education chief fights back in battle with Michael Gove over schools|work=The Observer|date=6 December 2014|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> Her friends have denied that she is subservient to Gove,<ref name=toby/> whereas Morgan herself has rejected Gove's attitude to the educational establishment, which he had described as "a left wing blob".<ref name=nick>{{cite news| last = Watt | first = Nicholas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/nicky-morgan-counter-michael-gove-toxic-legacy|title=Nicky Morgan moves to counter Michael Gove's 'toxic' legacy|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2014 |accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> Morgan told ''The Observer'' that although Gove's combative style alienated teachers, she fully supports his key policies: the introduction of [[Free school (England)|free schools]] and the expansion of [[Academy (English school)|academies]].<ref name=toby/>

Writing in ''The Times'' the following day, Sir [[Anthony Seldon]], headmaster of [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] and a key Gove ally, claimed that Morgan knew little about schools and had accepted the education portfolio despite an initial lack of interest. She needed more radical policies to get schools to develop pupils who were "rounded, resilient citizens" but her "probable departure at the election" meant she was unlikely to make any sort of mark.<ref name=greg>{{cite news| last = Hurst | first = Greg|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4291633.ece|title=Gove's replacement Nicky Morgan needs to be 'more radical', says Sir Anthony Seldon|work=The Times|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

In [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2016]] and [[2019 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2019]], Morgan supported Gove for leadership of the Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Payne |first1=Sebastian |title=Tory leadership contenders garner endorsements |url=https://www.ft.com/content/74661a18-8537-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2 |accessdate=14 September 2019 |work=Financial Times |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>

=== Row over 2014 school league tables ===
The 2014 school league tables published in January 2015 excluded some results from fee-paying schools using [[International GCSE]]s (IGCSEs) which Morgan regards as not rigorous or challenging enough, a move which placed many of them, including [[Eton College|Eton]], near the bottom of the tables. Writing to ''The Daily Telegraph'', Simon Lebus, the chief executive of [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate|Cambridge assessment]], said Morgan had been poorly advised and that admission tutors agreed that the exams were the best preparation for university. He said the Department of Education should encourage competition ‚Äì a race to the top between the two exam types ‚Äì rather than "trying to rig the race". Morgan appealed to the fee-paying schools to return to conventional GCSEs.<ref name=ed>{{cite news| last = Malnick | first = Edward|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11380532/Exam-board-chief-Private-schools-are-being-punished-in-league-tables.html|title=Exam board chief: Private schools are being 'punished' in league tables|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref>

=== 2015 general election ===
In January 2014, speaking at a meeting of the [[Bright Blue (organization)|Bright Blue]] Conservative think tank, Morgan said Conservatives would have to send out an optimistic message and not just "the language of hate" if they were to win the next general election. Her comments were thought to show concern at right-wing backbenchers' criticisms of Cameron on immigration, welfare, and the EU, although a party source insisted that she was talking about very few people.<ref name="georgigirl">{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|date=21 January 2014|title=Tories need less 'hate' to win election, says minister|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10586568/Tories-need-less-hate-to-win-election-says-minister.html|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>

Professor Stephen Fisher of Oxford University, writing for the Higher Education Policy Institute think tank, observed in December 2014 that Loughborough was one of 10 or 11 constituencies where the student vote could affect the outcome. Loughborough was one of several Conservative marginals with a student population of more than 13% and he noted Morgan as being at risk of losing her seat in 2015.<ref name="anon">{{cite news|last=Staff writer|date=1 December 2014|title=Anger of students may oust top Lib Dems at ballot box|work=The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4283332.ece|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>

In May 2015, ''The Guardian'' highlighted a donation of ¬£3,220 from Paul Mercer, a Conservative activist, former councillor and constituent who runs a local radio campaign on Morgan's behalf. According to ''The Guardian,'' Mercer is known to have worked for a "secretive corporate security firm" with a history of infiltrating and spying on political campaigners and had passed confidential legal advice to their opponents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDevitt|first1=Johnny|last2=Evans|first2=Rob|last3=Jones|first3=Meirion|date=1 May 2015|title=Cabinet minister accepted donation from corporate spy|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/01/nicky-morgan-accepts-donation-from-corporate-spy-paul-mercer|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>

In the event, Morgan increased her majority achieving a 5.25% swing compared to a ‚àí0.3% swing nationally.

=== Religious education in schools ===
In December 2015, Morgan declared that a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruling that religious teaching should be pluralistic, and that therefore it was unlawful to exclude teaching about [[atheism]] and [[secular humanism|humanism]], should be ignored as UK religious traditions are mainly Christian. ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper noted that both she and her department had also ignored the [[Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life]] report that Britain is "no longer predominantly Christian."<ref>{{cite news | last = Staufenberg | first = Jess |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools-must-teach-that-britain-is-mainly-christian-and-need-not-cover-atheism-says-nicky-morgan-a6787951.html|title=Schools must teach that Britain is 'mainly Christian' and need not cover atheism, says Nicky Morgan|work=The Independent |date=28 December 2015|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> The [[British Humanist Association]], which supported the legal battle against Morgan, called Morgan's decision to simply ignore the judgment against her "an affront to democracy".<ref>{{cite news | last = Green | first = Chris |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/faith-school-complaints-ban-is-affront-to-democracy-campaigners-say-a6833531.html|title=Faith school complaints ban is 'affront to democracy', campaigners say|work=The Independent|date=25 January 2016|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref>

In December 2015, [[British Deaf Association]] chairman Terry Riley expressed regret at the closing of the [[History of Margate#Royal School for Deaf Children|Royal School for Deaf Children]] in Margate which closed despite an appeal to Morgan.<ref>{{cite news| last = Burns | first = Judith|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35101604|title=Fight to save Royal School for Deaf Children|work=BBC News|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Riley | first = Terry |url=https://www.bda.org.uk/news/save-britains-oldest-deaf-school-and-safeguard-the-future-of-our-deaf-children-and-young-people|title=Save Britain's oldest Deaf school & safeguard the future of our deaf children & young people | publisher = [[British Deaf Association]] |date=10 December 2015|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> However, an inspection the previous month by the [[Care Quality Commission]] had uncovered what the inspectors called "shocking examples of institutionalised failings and abuse" at the nearby Westgate College for Deaf People for students aged 16 and over, which was run by the same educational trust. The trust running the schools subsequently went into administration.<ref name="BBC News 5 April 2016">{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title= Margate deaf students 'abused and harmed'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-35966220|date= 5 April 2016| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 13 October 2016 }}</ref>

===Conversion of all schools to academies===
In March 2016, Morgan told a [[NASUWT]] conference that the government had made significant improvements to the education system and would not back down. Every school would become an academy by 2022 and she invited the unions to help shape the reforms. NASUWT General secretary, [[Chris Keates]] asked her to listen to the concerns raised.<ref>{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Richard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/26/nicky-morgan-academies-teachers-what-works-in-classrooms-nasuwt|title=Nicky Morgan warns teachers: no 'reverse gear' for academies plan |work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2016|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> Her proposal was also criticised by her own backbenchers as likely to remove parental and local authority involvement, force small rural schools to close, reduce accountability and cost more than the ¬£1.6 billion estimated in the [[2016 United Kingdom budget|budget]]. Chair of the [[1922 Committee]] [[Graham Brady]] said he would write to Morgan.<ref>{{cite news | last = Helm | first = Toby |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/02/backbench-pressure-on-osborne-academy-scheme|title=Tory backbench rebellion threat over George Osborne's academies plan |work=The Guardian|date= 2 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> The plan was dropped days later, except for schools in "underperforming" local authorities.<ref name=guardian-20160506>{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Richard |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies |title=Government drops plan to make all schools in England academies |work=The Guardian |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016}}</ref>

===2016 EU referendum and May government===
Morgan supported the [[Britain Stronger in Europe|'Remain']] campaign in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. Following the decision to leave and Cameron's resignation she announced she was considering running for the Conservative party leadership. She said the vote had split the country and parliament could not spend the next few years on the single issue of Europe. She wanted a grown up debate on immigration, which included the positive case and not simply problems relating to jobs and housing<ref>{{cite news| last = Staff writer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36656752|title=Conservative leadership: More contenders to launch leadership bids|work=BBC News|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> and criticised [[Nigel Farage]]'s campaign for "emboldening" racists and bigots.<ref>{{cite news| last = Kirkup | first = James |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/28/nicky-morgan-conservatives-must-make-the-positive-case-for-immig/|title=Nicky Morgan: Conservatives must make the 'positive case' for immigration |work=Daily Telegraph|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> In spite of her stance for Remain in the referendum, Morgan endorsed Leave campaigner [[Michael Gove]] as the party leadership candidate on 30 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickymorgan.org/news/statement-conservative-party-leadership|title=Statement on Conservative Party Leadership|publisher=Nicky Morgan MP|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref>

Following Theresa May's policy statement advocating new grammar schools, Morgan joined [[Michael Wilshaw]] in saying the changes were a retrograde step and a distraction from six years of effort under David Cameron to improve the existing state system via academies and free school reforms.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hope|first1=Christopher|last2=Hughes|first2=Laura|date=9 September 2016|title=Theresa May's new wave of grammar schools under threat as Nicky Morgan and Ofsted chief lead revolt|work=Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/09/theresa-may-every-school-in-england-will-be-given-opportunity-to/|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>

In early December 2016, Theresa May was interviewed and photographed by the ''[[Sunday Times]]''. Among the photos, May posed in a pair of brown leather trousers which cost ¬£995. The photos and May's fashion choices were discussed widely in Conservative circles, with the cost of the trousers deemed excessive and giving May an air of being out of touch with the electorate. Morgan was among May's critics who expressed concerns about the leather trousers. Morgan said that she would feel concerned about how she would justify such expense to constituents in Loughborough Market. Morgan was disinvited from a meeting about Brexit at Number 10.<ref name="eveningstandardtoxicrowoverleather">{{cite news|last1=De Peyer|first1=Robin|date=11 December 2016|title=Toxic row over Theresa May's trousers revealed in leaked text messages|work=London Evening Standard|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/toxic-row-over-theresa-mays-trousers-revealed-in-leaked-text-messages-a3417386.html|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>  The falling-out became known on social media as #Trousergate. Following the falling-out, Morgan withdrew from a scheduled appearance on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', explaining that she wished to "keep a low profile". She was replaced by a handbag, referring to an equally expensive handbag she allegedly owned.<ref name="guardiannickymorganreplacedbyhandbag">{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Heather|date=16 December 2016|title=Nicky Morgan replaced by designer handbag on Have I Got News For You|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/16/nicky-morgan-replaced-designer-handbag-have-i-got-news-for-you|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>

Following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Morgan defeated pro-Brexit MP [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]], her nearest rival, to be elected chair of the [[Treasury Select Committee]].<ref>{{cite news| last = Mason | first = Rowena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/12/nicky-morgan-beats-jacob-rees-mogg-in-vote-to-chair-treasury-committee|title=Nicky Morgan beats pro-Brexit MP to chair of Treasury committee|work=The Guardian|date=12 July 2017|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>

In December 2017, Morgan voted along with fellow Conservative [[Dominic Grieve]] and nine other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a "[[Meaningful vote#Alteration of Clause 9|meaningful vote]]" on any deal Theresa May agrees with Brussels over [[Brexit]].<ref name="Independent_Austin">{{cite news | last = Austin | first = Henry | title = Brexit vote: The 11 Tory rebel MPs who defeated the Government | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-tory-mps-rebel-theresa-may-government-defeat-who-were-they-list-a8108776.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 13 December 2017 | access-date = 19 June 2018}}</ref> In May 2018, Morgan joined [[Nick Clegg]] and [[David Miliband]] calling for a [[soft Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Culbertson | first = Alix |title=David Miliband joins Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan in call for soft Brexit |url=https://news.sky.com/story/david-miliband-joins-nick-clegg-and-nicky-morgan-in-call-for-soft-brexit-11370115|work=Sky News|date=14 May 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>

Morgan opposed delays until October 2019 in stake reduction for [[fixed odds betting terminal]]s; she cited [[Tracey Crouch]] that two people commit [[suicide]] daily through gambling addiction. Morgan said, "It is the case that the government has prioritised the preservation of jobs in the gambling industry over the addiction of those who suffer from these machines."  Morgan also said, "The trouble with that very rational analysis [‚Ä¶] is that it doesn‚Äôt really help the expected 300 people who may end up taking their lives, suffering mental health problems from gambling addiction."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/05/fobts-hammond-bookmakers-jobs-over-gamblers-lives FOBTs: Hammond is 'placing bookmakers' jobs over gamblers' lives'] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

In the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election]], she supported Michael Gove.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/74661a18-8537-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2|work=Financial Times|date=3 June 2019|title=Tory leadership contenders garner endorsements|accessdate=29 August 2019|last=Payne|first=Sebastian}}</ref> Morgan during the campaign supported former Conservative Prime Minister John Major's plan for legal action if [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom#August 2019|parliament were suspended]] to deliver [[No-deal Brexit]]. She commented that such a suspension 'would lead to a constitutional crisis' and that it was 'clearly a mad suggestion'.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/mad-suggestion-how-tory-ministers-once-viewed-call-to-prorogue-parliament|work=The Guardian|last=Rourke|first=Alison|date=29 August 2019|title='Mad suggestion': how Tory ministers once viewed call to prorogue parliament}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-10/nicky-morgan-acting-prime-minister-itv-news/|title='Boris Johnson should have backed up UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch' says Nicky Morgan as Acting Prime Minister|publisher=ITV News|date=10 July 2019|accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>

===Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport===
Morgan joined [[Boris Johnson]]'s government as [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] in July 2019. She stood down from the House of Commons at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December general election]] but remained in cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|date=30 October 2019|title=Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan announces she won't stand for re-election|work=Sky News|url=https://news.sky.com/story/culture-secretary-nicky-morgan-announces-she-wont-stand-for-re-election-11849488|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref> On 6 January 2020, she was created '''Baroness Morgan of Cotes''', ''of [[Cotes, Leicestershire|Cotes]] in the County of [[Leicestershire]]'', allowing her to represent the government from the [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3466303 |publisher=The London Gazette |title=Crown Office |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref> 
==Post-Government==
In January 2020, she announced her intention to "step back from ministerial life" and did so when Boris Johnson [[2020 British cabinet reshuffle|reshuffled]] his cabinet in February.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Association|first=Press|date=2020-01-23|title=Nicky Morgan confirms she will stand down from Cabinet in reshuffle|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/nicky-morgan-confirms-she-will-stand-down-from-cabinet-in-reshuffle/|access-date=2020-02-05|website=Evening Express|language=en-US}}</ref>

Morgan was understood to be under Boris Johnson's considerations for the position of [[Chairman of the BBC]] in August 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/andrew-neil-and-nicky-morgan-in-frame-for-bbc-chairman-6gtttw89b|title=Andrew Neil and Nicky Morgan in frame for BBC chairman|work=The Times|last1=Shipman|first1=Tim|last2=Urwin|first2=Rosamund|date=9 August 2020|access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref>
