The '''2018 European drought and heat wave''' was  a period of unusually hot weather that led to record-breaking temperatures and [[wildfires]] in many parts of [[Europe]] during the spring and summer of 2018. It is part of a larger heat wave affecting the [[northern hemisphere]], caused in part by the [[jet stream]] being weaker than usual, allowing hot [[high-pressure]] air to linger in the same place.<ref name=TG>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/22/heatwave-northen-hemisphere-uk-algeria-canada-sweden-whats-the-cause|date=22 July 2018|title=The big heatwave: from Algeria to the Arctic.

==General==
Researchers at the [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] and [[World Weather Attribution]] estimated that [[global warming]] more than doubled the overall likelihood of the heat wave, and in some places like Denmark made it up to five times as likely.<ref>{{cite web |title=Attribution of the 2018 heat in northern Europe |url=https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/analyses/attribution-of-the-2018-heat-in-northern-europe/ |publisher=World Weather Attribution |accessdate=3 August 2018}}"We estimate that the probability to have such a heat or higher is generally more than two times higher today than if human activities had not altered climate."</ref><ref name="PrelimUpTo2x">{{cite news |last1=Carrington |first1=Damian |title=Heatwave made more than twice as likely by climate change, scientists find |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/heatwave-made-more-than-twice-as-likely-by-climate-change-scientists-find |accessdate=3 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=560|issue=7716|pages=20–22|year=2018|title=Droughts, heatwaves and floods: How to tell when climate change is to blame|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05849-9|pmid=30061648|last1=Schiermeier|first1=Quirin|bibcode=2018Natur.560...20S|doi-access=free}}</ref> The heat has built up for two months due to slow and weakened [[jet stream]].  One possible cause for the jet stream to be slow and weak relates to [[global warming]].  In the polar regions, the average surface temperature is rising more quickly than at mid latitudes in a phenomenon called [[polar amplification]].  Many researchers believe a strong polar amplification reduces the strength and changes the pattern of the [[jet stream]], producing patterns like those occurring during the [[2018 heat wave]].<ref name="PrelimUpTo2x" /> [[Michael E. Mann|Dr. Michael Mann]] opined that global warming may be making such heat waves even more likely than the researchers estimated, because at the time of the study the climate models could not fully account for how the jet stream is affected by global warming.<ref name="PrelimUpTo2x" />

The extreme heat was blamed for forest fires and crop failures.<ref name="AP1">{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/9db0ece961604537a4334480052f45ce|work=AP|year=2018|title=Animals, crops suffering as Europe's heatwave hits new highs}}</ref>

According to the World Meteorological Organization, the severe heat waves across the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018, are linked to climate change, as well as events of extreme precipitation. Results were increase in elderly mortality; severe decline in yields; the biggest algae bloom in the Baltic sea for decades, that has poisoned water both for human and animals use; shutdowns of nuclear power plants in Europe, because the water in the rivers, that is used for cooling the reactors, was too warm; and electricity grids crashing across four continents. The impacts were severe, even in the countries considered rich and well prepared to deal with the impacts of climate change.<ref name="July sees extreme weather with high impacts">{{cite web |title=July sees extreme weather with high impacts |url=https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/july-sees-extreme-weather-high-impacts |website=World Meteorological Organization (WMO) |accessdate=14 August 2018|date=2018-07-10 }}</ref><ref name="2018 will be fourth-hottest year on record, climate scientists predict">{{cite news |last1=Somini Sengupta |first1=Somini |title=2018 will be fourth-hottest year on record, climate scientists predict |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/climate-change-global-warming-records-2018-heatwave-a8489151.html |accessdate=14 August 2018 |agency=The Independent |date=14 August 2018}}</ref>

===Austria===
The west and the north of Austria were worst affected by drought; certain areas in these regions experienced up to 85% less rainfall than the 10 year average. Insurance companies estimate the damage as high as 210 million euro.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/5476590/Solche-Duerreschaeden-gab-es-noch-nie-in-Oesterreich|title=Solche Dürreschäden gab es noch nie in Österreich }} Note: As of 7 August 2018.</ref>

===Belgium===
Belgium experienced the second hottest July since regular measurements started in 1833, with an average of 22&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/nl/39624016-Juli+2018.html | title=Klimaat Juli 2018 (KMI) | publisher=KMI | language=Dutch | accessdate=25 September 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925065413/http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/nl/39624016-Juli+2018.html | archive-date=25 September 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Precipitation during July was close to normal at the official weather station in Uccle; most regions however received less than 20% of the normal amount of rain for the month, which was especially true for the western part of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.be/resources/climateReportWeb/klimatologisch_maandoverzicht_201807.pdf |title= Klimatologisch Maandoverzicht juli 2018 (PDF) | publisher=KMI | language=Dutch | accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>

As a whole, 2 heat waves occurred: the first one between 13 and 27 July (making this the fifth longest heat wave in history) and the second one from 29 July until 7 August. Belgium's official weather service, the [[Royal Meteorological Institute|KMI]], defines a heat wave as a period of at least 5 days with maximum temperatures of 25&nbsp;°C or higher, of which 3 days require a maximum of 30&nbsp;°C or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankdeboosere.be/vragen/vraag227.php |title= Wat is een hittegolf | publisher=Frank Deboosere | language=Dutch | accessdate=25 September 2018 }}</ref>

Heat increases the risk of cardiac arrest and other serious conditions in people with poor health. On 8 August, [[Statens Serum Institut]] released a report that showed an increase of about 250 deaths, primarily among elderly, in the summer of 2018 (peak in late July) compared to the norm. A similar increase was seen in neighbouring countries affected by the heat wave, including other [[Scandinavia]]n countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssi.dk/Aktuelt/Nyheder/2018/2018_8_overdodelighed.aspx | title=Flere ældre dør i varmen | date=8 August 2018 | publisher=[[Statens Serum Institut]] | language=Danish | accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2018-08-08-dansk-hedebolge-er-skyld-i-250-flere-dodsfald-end-normalt | title=Dansk hedebølge er skyld i 250 flere dødsfald end normalt | date=8 August 2018 | publisher=TV2 News | language=Danish | accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>

===France===
The French utility company EDF made known that on the morning of 4 August 2018 it had to shut down reactor number one of the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]]. This was necessary because the nearby river which is used for cooling water had reached a critical temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dna.fr/environnement/2018/08/04/la-centrale-de-fessenheim-arrete-un-reacteur|title=La centrale de Fessenheim arrête un réacteur }} Note: As of 4 August 2018.</ref>
The [[white stork]]s in the [[Alsace]] region have also been suffering under the drought and heat waves. The 2018 stork generation is generally malnourished. Many are too weak to fly and crash-land when they leave the nest, resulting in fatal injuries like broken legs or wings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dna.fr/environnement/2018/08/04/le-spectre-d-une-hecatombe-de-cigogneaux|title=Par manque de nourriture, les cigogneaux en danger }} Note: As of 4 August 2018.</ref>
