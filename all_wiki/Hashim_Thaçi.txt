Thaçi is from the region of Drenica in Kosovo, which is where the KLA originated. He studied philosophy in Prishtina before moving to Switzerland, where he joined the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] in 1993. He rose through the ranks of the KLA to become leader of the most powerful faction by 1999, during the Rambouillet negotiations. He then joined the interim Kosovo administration after the war.

Thaçi became leader of the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]] (PDK), which won the largest share of the vote in the [[2007 Kosovan parliamentary election|2007 Kosovo elections]]. In 2008, Thaçi declared the independence of Kosovo and became its first prime minister. In 2016 he was elected President of Kosovo. Thaçi has pursued a pro-American policy while in office. There have been controversies regarding Thaçi's role in the KLA and allegations about him being involved in organized crime. In 2020, the [[Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office]] filed a ten-count Indictment, charging Hashim Thaçi and others for [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime|war crimes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53169808|title=Kosovo President Thaci faces war crimes indictment|website=BBC|date=24 June 2020}}</ref> Thaçi subsequently resigned from his position as president, in his words, in order to "protect the integrity of the presidency of Kosovo".<ref>[https://apnews.com/article/hashim-thaci-kosovo-face-war-crimes-3cbaf9f0f41a2bc491a832e5df3813cb Kosovo's president resigns to face war crimes charges], Associated Press</ref>

==Early life and education==
Hashim Thaçi was born in the village of Broćna, [[Srbica]] (Albanian [[Skenderaj]]), [[SR Serbia]] (now Buroja, Skenderaj, [[Kosovo]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED AGAINST TACI {sic}, SEJDIU, KRASNICI|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Bilteni/Engleski/b180208_e.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dosije Hašima Tačija|date=23 December 2010|publisher=Pecat|url=http://www.pecat.co.rs/2010/12/dosije-hasima-tacija/}}</ref> Srbica is located in the [[Drenica]] valley, a historical region resistant of Serbian rule.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009|p=107}} Drenica would become the birthplace of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009|p=107}}

Thaçi studied [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]].{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009|p=107}} By 1993, he was living in [[Switzerland]], where he joined the Albanian political émigré group.

==Role in KLA==
In 1993, Thaçi became a member of the inner circle of the KLA. The charisma of leaders such as Thaçi helped the KLA gain support from Kosovo Albanians.<ref name="Perritt2010"/> Thaçi (''[[Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]]'' "Gjarpëri" - ''The Snake'') was responsible for securing financial means and armaments, and training recruits in [[Albania]] to be dispatched to Kosovo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} On 11 July 1997, Thaçi was tried in absentia and convicted by the District Court in Pristina for terrorism associated with his activities in the KLA, sentenced to 10 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&mm=04&dd=20&nav_category=640&nav_id=982736|title=BG odgovorio Tačiju: Bićeš uhapšen|date=20 April 2015|publisher=B92|language=sr}}</ref>

In March 1999, Thaçi participated in the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet]] negotiations as the leader of the Kosovar Albanian team.<ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EFD81338F930A35751C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=Ethnic Albanian Guerrillas Will Attend Talks on Kosovo|first=Carlotta|last=Gall|date=3 February 1999|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Thaçi was perceived by western diplomats during the negotiations as the "voice of reason" within the KLA: his attendance at the negotiations demonstrated a willingness to accept autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia at a time when other rebel leaders rejected any solution short of full national independence.<ref name="query.nytimes.com"/>

Thaçi emerged from the final diplomatic settlement as the leader of the strongest faction within a KLA rife with factionalism. He moved quickly to consolidate power, unilaterally naming himself prime minister within a provisional government and allegedly ordering the assassination of the leaders of rival armed factions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DD1539F935A35755C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=Crisis in the Balkans: The Guerrillas; Kosovo Rebel Force Will Be Serbian Province's New Power Broker|first=Chris|last=Hedges|date=6 June 1999|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E2DF153AF936A15755C0A96F958260|work=The New York Times|title=Crisis in the Balkans: The Separatists; Leaders of Kosovo Rebels Tied to Deadly Power Play|first=Chris|last=Hedges|date=25 June 1999|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

Thaçi is alleged to have extensive criminal links.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Dipak Basu|author2=Victoria Miroshnik|title=Structural Revolution in International Business Architecture: Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHD-CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA109|date=2 December 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-53578-8|pages=109–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=David L.

The [[BBC]] reported in 2000 that Thaçi is allegedly central to the criminal activities of the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]] (KPC), who reportedly extorted money from businessmen under the guise of "taxes" for his self-appointed government.<ref name="Kosovo-gripped-by-racketeers">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/699175.stm|work=BBC News|title=Kosovo gripped by racketeers|date=5 April 2000|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> While the KLA was officially disbanded at the end of armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999, the new Kosovo Protection Corps was composed primarily of former KLA fighters and the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]] (PDK). The party was formed largely from the political leadership of the KLA. A near monopoly on the means of force, based on the absorption of the KLA into the KPC, allowed the Democratic Party of Kosovo to seize control of the machinery of government at the municipal level.<ref name="Kosovo-gripped-by-racketeers"/> The PDK has regularly used violence and intimidation of political rivals to maintain local political control and protect criminal enterprises that depend upon cooperation from friendly local authorities.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0815/p9s1.html "Political violence in run-up to Kosovo vote"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 15 August 2000.</ref>

In 2001, the Democratic Party of Kosovo suffered electoral defeat in the first free elections in the province in 2001. The BBC said at the time, "The tumbling reputation of the former KLA was to have a disastrous effect on the PDK because of the perceived overlap between its political leadership and post-KLA organised crime."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/999166.stm|work=BBC News|title=Analysis: Kosovo chooses normality|date=30 October 2000|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

A 2008 analysis of organised crime in Kosovo prepared by the German intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] and a confidential report contracted by the German military, the [[Bundeswehr]], accuse Thaçi, [[Ramush Haradinaj]], and [[Xhavit Haliti]], the majority leader of the Kosovo parliament, of far-reaching involvement in organised crime. The BND writes: "The key players (including Haliti, Haradinaj, and Thaçi) are intimately involved in inter-linkages between politics, business, and organised crime structures in Kosovo."<ref name="Welt"/> The report accuses Thaçi of leading a "criminal network operating throughout Kosovo" by the end of the 1990s.<ref name="Welt"/> The BND report accuses Thaçi of contacts with the Czech and Albanian mafias. It says that he, together with Haliti, ordered  killings by a professional hit man, 'Afrimi', who is responsible for at least 11 contract murders.<ref name="Welt">[https://www.welt.de/english-news/article2806537/German-spy-affair-might-have-been-revenge.html "German spy affair might have been revenge"], ''Die Welt'' Online, 30 November 2008.</ref>

According to the 8 March 2016 issue of the French newspaper "Le Figaro", Thaçi is likely to be charged by the [[ICTY]] for a wide range of atrocities, including organs trafficking.<ref name="gazetaexpress.com">{{cite web|title=Le Figaro: Kouchner might testify against Thaci|url=http://www.gazetaexpress.com/en/news/le-figaro-kouchner-might-testify-against-thaci-170815/|website=Gazetaexpress.|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A peine élu, le président du Kosovo risque d'être inculpé|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2016/03/08/01003-20160308ARTFIG00153--peine-elu-le-president-du-kosovo-risque-d-etre-inculpe.php|website=Le Figaro|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> The paper also claims that former [[UNMIK]] administrator for Kosovo, [[Bernard Kouchner]], might be summoned to testify.

[[2007 Kosovan parliamentary election|Kosovo elections]] were held on 17 November 2007. After early results based on 90 percent of the votes, Hashim Thaçi, who was on course to gain 34 percent, claimed victory for the PDK. He stated his intention to declare independence without delay on 10 December, the date set by the [[United Nations]] for the end of negotiations with [[Serbia]]. At 45 percent, the turnout at the election was particularly low, as most Serbs refused to vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2007/11/18/low-turnout-hits-kosovo-election|title=Low turnout hits Kosovo election|date=18 November 2007|publisher=euronews|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref>

On 19 November 2007, several [[European Union|EU]] foreign ministers warned Thaçi and his allies against proceeding with their [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] without consultations. [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Jean Asselborn]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Carl Bildt]] urged the PDK not to make any hasty moves, while the EU foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]] stressed the importance of proper preparations prior to formal independence. After EU talks on Kosovo in [[London]] on 19 November 2007, the UK's Europe minister, [[Jim Murphy]], said independence without foreign support could isolate the breakaway province.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7101366.stm|title=EU warns Kosovo on independence|date=19 November 2007|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref>

Hashim Thaçi was designated as the next leader of Kosovo's government on 11 December 2007 by the Kosovar President Fatmir Sejdiu and told to form a government "as soon as possible".

==President of Kosovo==
===2016 presidential election===
Thaçi was elected the [[President of Kosovo]] in February 2016, and took office on 7 April 2016.<ref name="bbc_08-04-2016">{{Cite web |title=Kosovo's Hashim Thaci: From guerrilla leader to president |last=Delauney |first=Guy |work=[[BBC News]] |date=8 April 2016 |access-date=25 June 2020 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35984823 }}</ref> In August 2019, Thaçi asserted that his nation would hold parliamentary elections on 6 October. The President cited that the nation is in need of a "functional and accountable government," which is capable enough to face challenges of the state and society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/kosovo-set-for-october-election/|title=Kosovo set for October election|accessdate=27 August 2019|publisher=Emerging Europe}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Hashim Thaçi MSC 2018 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Thaçi during the [[Munich Security Conference|MSC]] 2018]]
In January 2018, Thaçi said that Kosovo would have supported U.S. President Trump's decision to relocate the U.S. embassy from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]], which would have made it the only Muslim-majority nation to do so. But Thaçi told the Albanian newspaper ''[[Gazeta Express|Express]]'' that if his country was handed full membership of the global body, it would vote "all the time" with the U.S., even on the resolution motioned last month to protest Trump's decision. Thaçi met with [[Donald Trump]] on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017 in New York, and invited Trump to visit Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. According to local media, he said their meeting was "exceptionally friendly, warm."<ref>[https://www.timesofisrael.com/kosovo-says-it-wouldve-voted-with-us-at-un-on-jerusalem-recognition/ Kosovo says it would’ve voted with US at UN on Jerusalem recognition]. ''The Time of Israel''. Retrieved 7 April 2018.</ref>

“The Head of State thanked President Trump for his personal support for Kosovo,” his office said in a statement, calling the U.S. a "strategic partner" and saying the support of Washington was "crucial to the peace, stability and overall development of Kosovo and the region." Thaçi told Pristina-based broadcaster ''[[RTV21]]'', "President Trump, like all other U.S. presidents, has a clear vision for Kosovo. It is unique support to our country. He said that Kosovo is a wonderful country and that we are a wonderful people."<ref>[https://www.jta.org/2018/01/05/news-opinion/united-states/kosovo-president-wed-have-voted-with-us-on-jerusalem-at-united-nations Kosovo president: We’d have voted with US on Jerusalem at United Nations]. ''JTA''. Retrieved 7 April 2018.</ref>

On 26 November 2019, [[2019 Albania earthquake|an earthquake struck Albania]]. President Thaçi was part of a presidential delegation that visited the earthquake epicentre and expressed his condolences on behalf of Kosovo.<ref name="Mortimer">{{cite news|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|title=Kosovan president caught up in aftershock when visiting Albanian earthquake victims|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/11/28/kosovan-president-caught-up-in-aftershock-when-visiting-albanian-earthquake-victims|agency=Euronews|date=28 November 2019|accessdate=29 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
