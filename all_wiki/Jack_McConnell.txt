'''Jack Wilson McConnell, Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|PC}} (born 30 June 1960) is a Scottish politician and a [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] [[life peer]] in the [[House of Lords]]. He was the [[First Minister of Scotland]] from 2001 to [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]]. He was the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[Motherwell and Wishaw (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] from [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] to 2011.

McConnell became an MSP in the inaugural elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]], later holding the positions of Finance Minister, and Education Minister. He was elected First Minister following the resignation of his predecessor [[Henry McLeish]], and led the [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Labour Party]] to its second election victory in the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003 Election]].

After losing office as First Minister of Scotland, McConnell became a member of the [[House of Lords]] of the United Kingdom. He made a commitment to continuing his work to tackle poverty in Africa and to develop the relationship between Scotland and [[Malawi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11098203|title=Jack McConnell to quit as an MSP|work=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828172834/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11098203|archivedate=28 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Education and early career==
McConnell was born in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], [[Ayrshire]] brought up on a [[domestic sheep|sheep]] farm near [[Lamlash]] on the [[Isle of Arran]], and educated at Arran High School.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12132824.Jack_the_family_man__Jack_the_fixer__Jack_the_lad__Which_is_the_real_face_of_the_new_first_minister_/ |title=Jack the family man, Jack the fixer, Jack the lad.

He was also President of the [[Students' union|Students' Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Ministers/First-Minister|title=Scotland.gov.uk- Jack McConnell MSP|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003025355/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Ministers/First-Minister|archivedate=3 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After graduating in 1983 he began work as a [[mathematics]] teacher at [[Lornshill Academy]] in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]] (a position he retained throughout his subsequent council service).

McConnell's political career began with his election to [[Stirling Council|Stirling District Council]].  McConnell served on the council for eight years, while retaining his job at Lornshill. He served as Treasurer from 1988 until 1992, and was the Leader of the council from 1990 to 1992. McConnell became the [[General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party]] in 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

His major breakthrough was in his handling of the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 General Election]] success, where Labour attained a large overall majority victory over the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. Together the Scottish Labour Party, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and the [[Scottish National Party]] eliminated every seat the Conservatives held in Scotland. In 1998, he served as a member of the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] where he pioneered the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish devolution referendum]] success, establishing the [[Scottish Parliament]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Political career==

===Early political career===
As a strong proponent of [[Scottish devolution]], McConnell helped push for reform. Between 1989 and 1998 he was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, where he was playing an important role in the creation of the Scotland Act, which created a Scottish Parliament for the first time.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

As General Secretary, he managed the Labour Party's successful YES YES devolution referendum campaign in 1997. Following the successful devolution campaign and the creation of a [[Scottish Parliament]], McConnell was elected as an MSP, for Motherwell and Wishaw, in the first Scottish Parliament in May 1999.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He was appointed immediately by [[Donald Dewar]], the then First Minister, to the post of Minister of Finance. As Finance Minister one of his primary jobs was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new [[Scottish government]], which included consulting the public on budget priorities. As Minister responsible for External Relations he established Concordats with the UK Government and opened Scotland House in [[Brussels]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Finance Minister===
McConnell was elected an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] in the first [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament elections]] in 1999. He was appointed [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth|Minister for Finance]] in the new [[Scottish Executive]] by then First Minister [[Donald Dewar]]. One of his first moves as Finance Minister was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new Scottish Executive, including publishing a consultation document asking the public and MSPs how the budget should be spent. His department also passed the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 through Parliament, which set out the finance and auditing procedures of the Executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cipfa.org.uk/publicfinance/search_details.cfm?News_id=3675&keysearch=McConnell|title=Public Finance- "Edinburgh gives public say in £16.2bn budget"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212152610/http://www.cipfa.org.uk/publicfinance/search_details.cfm?News_id=3675&keysearch=McConnell|archivedate=12 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Education, Europe and External Affairs===
On 11 October 2000, [[Donald Dewar]] died of a [[brain haemorrhage]]. After the Labour leadership intervened to stop the Enterprise Minister Henry McLeish being appointed Dewar's successor without a vote, McConnell stood in the leadership contest. The election was held on Saturday 21 October, only 72 hours after Dewar's funeral, and the surprise result saw McConnell defeated with 36 votes to Henry McLeish's 44 votes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

McLeish appointed him [[Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2000/10/d45ebfe7-d474-4aca-9719-a3d9694c68a4|title=First Minister Announces New Ministerial Team|publisher=Scottish Executive |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref> Some analysts considered this post to be a "poisoned chalice", as he would be required to resolve both [[SQA examinations controversy (2000)|a crisis]] in the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] over exam marking, and pay disputes with the teaching unions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/scotland/2001/mcleish_resignation/969756.stm|title=In Depth - McLeish resignation - Profile: Jack McConnell|work=BBC News|date=22 November 2001|accessdate=19 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819152407/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/scotland/2001/mcleish_resignation/969756.stm|archivedate=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In August 2000, prior to Jack McConnell's appointment as Education Minister, Scotland's national exams system was plunged into chaos when 5,000 students got the wrong exam results. Immediately following his appointment as Education Minister Jack McConnell appointed a new board for the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and introduced significant changes to the way the agency worked. The marking of the 2001 exams was a success. He introduced a new pay and conditions package for Scottish teachers and the largest ever investment in schools buildings.  He also established the Scottish government's first external relations and European strategy.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===First attempt to become First Minister===
[[File:Vladmir Putin, President of Russia with First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell.jpg|thumb|right|First Minister McConnell with President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
After the death of [[Donald Dewar]] whilst he was [[First Minister of Scotland]] in October 2000, McConnell ran for First Minister, but was narrowly defeated by [[Henry McLeish]] who became the second First Minister of Scotland. In the office of First Minister, McLeish then appointed McConnell to the post of Minister of Education, Europe and External Affairs.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

This was viewed as a particularly tricky post due to thousands of students getting the wrong exam results and pay disputes with teachers' trade unions in the preceding year. He negotiated a new pay and conditions package for Scottish teachers and invested heavily in improving school infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He reformed the Scottish Qualifications Authority and appointed a new board, and the following year there was no problem with exam results. In terms of European and External Affairs, he created the first External Relations and European Affairs strategy on how to influence and implement EU policies and promote Scotland abroad.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Election for First Minister===
Henry McLeish resigned as First Minister on 8 November 2001 over the [[Officegate|Officegate Scandal]], regarding the sub let of his [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituency]] office. In the resulting search for a leader, McConnell was seen by many political analysts as the likely successor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1646339.stm|title=BBC News - SCOTLAND - Search begins for new first minister|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040316232121/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1646339.stm|archivedate=16 March 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

McConnell quickly emerged as the only candidate, and was elected First Minister by the Parliament on 22 November 2001 and formally appointed into office by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 26 November 2001. As a result of his becoming First Minister, he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Privy Council Office |title=Privy Counsellors |url=https://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/privy-counsellors/ |accessdate=8 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913232018/https://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/privy-counsellors/ |archivedate=13 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Privy Council Office Secretariat |title=Privy Council Held On 14th March 2001 |url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/pdf/011211_orders_in_council.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103140224/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/pdf/011211_orders_in_council.pdf |archivedate= 3 November 2010 }}</ref>

A few days after his appointment, on 27 November 2001, McConnell carried out a reshuffle of the Cabinet, axing four Ministers: [[Angus MacKay (Scottish politician)|Angus MacKay]], [[Sarah Boyack]], [[Tom McCabe]] and [[Jackie Baillie]], and demoting [[Susan Deacon]] (she later resigned rather than accept the new post offered to her).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1577402001|title=New look at the top as Jack swings axe|publisher=}}</ref>

In February 2002, Scotland joined forces with the Republic of Ireland in a bid to host the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Football Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2002/02/1179|title=Joint Euro 2008 bid goes ahead|publisher=}}</ref> McConnell was initially unconvinced that it was worth spending around £100 million on the tournament, but he later put his support behind the joint bid with the Irish. Although the bid lost out to Austria/Switzerland, McConnell later supported other attempts to land major supporting events including London's successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/en/news/archive/2004/august/2004-08-25-11-05.htm|title=London 2012 News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509063517/http://www.london2012.com/en/news/archive/2004/august/2004-08-25-11-05.htm|archivedate=9 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Glasgow]]'s bid for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/Commonwealth+Games+Bid+Glasgow+2014.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520013448/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/Commonwealth+Games+Bid+Glasgow+2014.htm|archivedate=20 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In December 2002, McConnell launched his government's campaign against sectarianism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/04/2193449/34509|title=A Nation of Opportunity, Not a State of Fear|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607201739/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/04/2193449/34509|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Labour Party won 50 seats, the largest number, and formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrat Party which won 17 seats.
