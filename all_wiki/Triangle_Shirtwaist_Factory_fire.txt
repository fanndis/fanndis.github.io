The '''Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire''' in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], on March 25, 1911, was the deadliest [[List of industrial disasters|industrial disaster]] in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history.<ref name="osha">{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/oas/trianglefactoryfire.html|title=The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire|website=OSHA|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The fire caused the deaths of 146 [[garment worker]]s – 123 women and girls and 23 men<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apwu.org/labor-history-articles/sweatshop-tragedy-ignites-fight-workplace-safety|title=Sweatshop Tragedy Ignites Fight for Workplace Safety|website=APWU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208140549/http://www.apwu.org/labor-history-articles/sweatshop-tragedy-ignites-fight-workplace-safety|archive-date=2014-12-08|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> – who died from the fire, [[smoke inhalation]], or falling/jumping to their deaths.

The factory was located on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the [[Asch Building]], at 23–29 Washington Place, near [[Washington Square Park]]. The 1901 building still stands today and is now known as the [[Brown Building (Manhattan)|Brown Building]]. It is part of and owned by [[New York University]].<ref>[http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/?z=8&p=985536,205260&c=GISBasic&s=a:23,WASHINGTON+PLACE,MANHATTAN "23 Washington Place, Manhattan"] New York City Geographic Information System map</ref>

Because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked<ref name="osha" /><ref>Lange 2008, p. 58</ref> (a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft),<ref name="Liff" /> many of the workers who could not escape from the burning building jumped from the high windows. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory [[Occupational safety and health|safety standards]] and helped spur the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for [[sweatshop]] workers.

The building has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]].<ref name="Harris">{{Cite web|author=Gale Harris|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/brown.pdf|title=Brown Building (formerly Asch Building) Designation Report|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|date=March 25, 2003|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807052010/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/brown.pdf|archive-date=August 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Under the ownership of Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women's blouses, known as "[[shirtwaist]]s". The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young [[immigrant]] women and girls, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays,<ref name="Drehle 105">von Drehle, p. 105</ref> earning for their 52 hours of work between $7 and $12 a week,<ref name="Liff" /> the equivalent of $191 to $327 a week in 2018 currency, or $3.67 to $6.29 per hour.<ref>[http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=12.00&year1=1913&year2=2016 CPI Inflation Calculator] [[United States Bureau of Labor Statistics]]</ref>

At approximately 4:40&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday, March 25, 1911, as the workday was ending, a fire flared up in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the 8th floor.<ref name="Drehle 118"/> The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45&nbsp;p.m. by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the 8th floor.<ref>Stein, p. 224</ref> Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon.<ref name="von Drehle, p. 163" /> The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings by the time of the fire.<ref>Stein p. 33</ref> Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. The scraps piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable.<ref name="Drehle 118">von Drehle, p. 118</ref> Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection.<ref>von Drehle, p. 119</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the [[sewing machine]]s. A series of articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory [[insurance fraud|in order to collect insurance]]. ''[[The Insurance Monitor]]'', a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was "fairly saturated with [[moral hazard]]." Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.<ref name="von Drehle, p. 163">von Drehle, pp. 162–63</ref>

A bookkeeper on the 8th floor was able to warn employees on the 10th floor via telephone, but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the 9th floor.<ref>von Drehle, p. 131</ref> According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the 9th floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself.<ref>von Drehle, pp. 141–42</ref> Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a [[fire escape]], and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses.<ref>Lange, Brenda.

Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.<ref>Hall, Angus (ed.) (1987) ''Crimes of Horror'' Reed Editions. p. 23 {{ISBN|1-85051-170-5}}</ref>

Within three minutes, the Greene Street stairway became unusable in both directions.<ref>von Drehle, pp. 143–44</ref> Terrified employees crowded onto the single exterior fire escape – which city officials had allowed Asch to erect instead of the required third staircase<ref name="Drehle 118"/> – a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure that may have been broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. The remainder waited until smoke and fire overcame them.

The fire department arrived quickly but was unable to stop the flames, as their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the 7th floor.<ref name="osha" /> The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.

Elevator operators Joseph Zito<ref>von Drehle, p. 157</ref> and Gaspar Mortillaro saved many lives by traveling three times up to the 9th floor for passengers, but Mortillaro was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture – the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk".<ref>von Drehle, p. 126</ref>

A large crowd of bystanders gathered on the street, witnessing 62 people jumping or falling to their deaths from the burning building.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shepherd|first=William G. |date=March 27, 1911 |title=Eyewitness at the Triangle|accessdate=September 2, 2007|url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/texts/stein_ootss/ootss_wgs.html?location=Fire!}}</ref> [[Louis Waldman]], later a New York Socialist state assemblyman, described the scene years later:<ref>{{cite book |title= Labor Lawyer |url= https://archive.org/details/laborlawyer00wald |url-access= registration |first= Louis |last= Waldman |location= New York |publisher= E.P.

{{quote|One Saturday afternoon in March of that year—March 25, to be precise—I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library. … It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire.

A few blocks away, the Asch Building at the corner of Washington Place and Greene Street was ablaze. When we arrived at the scene, the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze. The eighth, ninth, and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames.

Word had spread through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds—I among them—looked up at the burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the pavement below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.

The emotions of the crowd were indescribable. Women were hysterical, scores fainted; men wept as, in paroxysms of frenzy, they hurled themselves against the police lines.}}

==Consequences and legacy==
The company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree [[manslaughter]] in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911.<ref>Stein p. 158</ref> [[Max Steuer]], counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire,<ref>von Drehle, p. 220</ref> but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.

In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20 which was the minimum amount the fine could be.<ref name="Hoenig">Hoenig, John M.

Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York state, and gave them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class.

The Coalition grew out of a [[public art]] project called "Chalk" created by New York City filmmaker [[Ruth Sergel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://streetpictures.org/chalk/ |title=Chalk website |publisher=Streetpictures.org |date=March 25, 1911 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> Every year beginning in 2004, Sergel and volunteer artists went across New York City on the anniversary of the fire to inscribe in chalk the names, ages, and causes of death of the victims in front of their former homes, often including drawings of flowers, tombstones or a triangle.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>Molyneux, Michael (April 3, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/nyregion/thecity/03tria.html?_r=2 "City Lore: Memorials in Chalk"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

===Centennial===
[[File:Triangle Shirtwaist Fire Centennial Memorial crop.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Hilda Solis]], the American [[Secretary of Labor]], seen on the overhead screen, speaking at the Centennial Memorial; the Brown (Asch) Building is on the far right.]]
[[Image:Triangle33.JPG|thumb|350px|The commemoration drew thousands of people, many holding aloft "146 Shirtwaist-Kites" conceived by artist [[Annie Lanzillotto]] and designed and fabricated by members of The '''Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition''', with the names of the victims on sashes, as they listened to speakers.]]

From July 2009 through the weeks leading up to the 100th anniversary, the Coalition served as a clearinghouse to organize some 200 activities as varied as [[academic conferences]], films, theater performances, art shows, concerts, readings, awareness campaigns, [[walking tours]], and parades that were held in and around New York City, and in cities across the nation, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston and Washington, D.C.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The ceremony, which was held in front of the [[Asch Building|building where the fire took place]], was preceded by a march through [[Greenwich Village]] by thousands of people, some carrying shirtwaists – women's blouses – on poles, with sashes commemorating the names of those who died in the fire. Speakers included the [[United States Secretary of Labor]], [[Hilda L. Solis]], U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]], New York City Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]], the actor [[Danny Glover]], and Suzanne Pred Bass, the grandniece of Rosie Weiner, a young woman killed in the blaze. Most of the speakers that day called for the strengthening of workers’ rights and organized labor.<ref name=autogenerated3>Fouhy, Beth.

At 4:45&nbsp;pm EST, the moment the first fire alarm was sounded in 1911, hundreds of bells rang out in cities and towns across the nation. For this commemorative act, the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organized hundreds of churches, schools, fire houses, and private individuals in the New York City region and across the nation. The Coalition maintains on its website a national map denoting each of the bells that rang that afternoon.<ref>[http://rememberthetrianglefire.org/bells/ "Bells"] on the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition website</ref>

===Permanent memorial===
The Coalition has launched an effort to create a permanent [[public art]] [[memorial]] for the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire at the site of the 1911 fire in lower Manhattan. In 2012, the Coalition announced a national design competition for the memorial, and formed a design search committee, with representatives from [[Workers United]], [[New York University]], the [[New York City Fire Department]], the [[Martin P. Catherwood Library#Kheel Center|Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation & Archives]], [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]], [[Manhattan Community Board 2]], family members of the victims, historians, and community members.<ref>Swanson, Lillian.

Plans for the memorial include steel panels that wrap around the building, as well as upper and lower panels that will list the names of the victims and tell the story of the fire. A reflective steel beam will extend from the corner of the building to the eighth floor, the place of origin for the fire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/13522-memorial-to-honor-triangle-shirtwaist-fire-victims|title=Memorial to honor Triangle Shirtwaist fire victims|access-date=September 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In 2011, the Coalition established that the goal of the permanent memorial would be:
* To honor the memory of those who died from the fire;
* To affirm the dignity of all workers;
* To value women’s work;
* To remember the movement for worker safety and social justice stirred by this tragedy;
* To inspire future generations of activists
