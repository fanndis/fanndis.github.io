==Charges of discrimination==
In early June 2020, top editor and co-founder Christene Barberich stepped down after women of color{{huh|date=October 2020}} and black employees and [[freelancers]] took to social media to tell stories of discrimination while working for Refinery29.<ref name = vulture>{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/refinery-29-editor-resigns-racism.html | publisher = Vulture | title = Refinery29 Editor Resigns After Former Employees Speak Out on Racism| accessdate = 20 June 2020}}</ref> A writer for the company wrote on Twitter, “I worked at Refinery29 for less than nine months due to a toxic company culture where white women’s egos ruled the near nonexistent editorial processes. One of the founders consistently confused myself and one of our full-time front desk associates & pay disparity was atrocious.”<ref name="Katie">{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Katie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/business/media/refinery-29-christene-barberich.html |title=Refinery29 Editor Resigns After Former Employees Describe ‘Toxic Culture’ |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2020-06-08 |accessdate=2020-06-10 }}</ref> 

Barberich also faced criticism after a former employee recalled that Barberich once cried in a team meeting after being told she seemed "squeamish" when discussing race.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jennings|first=Rebecca|date=2020-06-11|title=Women’s media seemed progressive in the 2010s.

We have to do better, and that starts with making room. And, so I will be stepping aside in my role at R29 to help diversify our leadership in editorial and ensure this brand and the people it touches can spark a new defining chapter.”<ref name="Katie" /> Refinery29 parent, Vice Media, launched an investigation into Refinery29's [[Toxic workplace | toxic work environment]].<ref name = cnn2>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/media/vice-investigating-refinery29/index.html | publisher = CNN | title =Vice Media launches probe into Refinery29's toxic work environment |accessdate = 20 June 2020}}</ref>
