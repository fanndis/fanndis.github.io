The '''Library of Congress''' ('''LC''') is the research [[library]] that officially serves the [[United States Congress]] and is the ''[[de facto]]'' national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The library is housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; it also maintains the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].<ref name="Fascinating Facts" /> The library's functions are overseen by the [[librarian of Congress]], and its buildings are maintained by the [[architect of the Capitol]]. The Library of Congress is one of the [[List of largest libraries|largest libraries in the world]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica: Library of Congress">{{cite web|title=Library of Congress|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Library-of-Congress|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=FFStats>{{cite web|title=Fascinating Facts – Statistics|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/fascinating-facts/|website=The Library of Congress|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref> Its "collections are universal, not limited by subject, format, or national boundary, and include research materials from all parts of the world and in more than 450 languages."<ref name="Fascinating Facts" />

Congress moved to Washington, D.C., in 1800 after sitting for 11 years in the temporary national capitals in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. In both cities, members of the U.S. Congress had access to the sizable collections of the [[New York Society Library]] and the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/about/history-of-the-library/# |website=Library of Congress |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref> The small Congressional Library was housed in the [[United States Capitol]] for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the [[War of 1812]], and the library sought to restore its collection in 1815. They bought [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s entire personal collection of 6,487 books. After a period of slow growth, another fire struck the library in its Capitol chambers in 1851, again destroying a large amount of the collection, including many of Jefferson's books. After the [[American Civil War]], the Library of Congress grew rapidly in both size and importance, which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned. The library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to deposit two copies of books, maps, illustrations, and diagrams printed in the United States. It also began to build its collections, and its development culminated between 1888 and 1894 with the construction of a separate, extensive library building across the street from the Capitol.

The library's primary mission is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, carried out through the [[Congressional Research Service]]. The library is open to the public, although only high-ranking government officials and library employees may check out books and materials.<ref>{{cite web |title=FY 2019-2023 Strategic Plan of the Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/strategic-plan/ |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

===1800–1851: Origin and Jefferson's contribution===

[[James Madison]] is credited with the idea of creating a congressional library, first making such a proposition in 1783.<ref name=":4">Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History (New York, Skyhouse Publishing, 2012): 155.</ref> The Library of Congress was subsequently established on April 24, 1800, when President [[John Adams]] signed an act of Congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from [[Philadelphia]] to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 "for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ... and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them."<ref>{{USStat|2|55}}</ref> Books were ordered from London, and the collection consisted of 740 books and three maps which were housed in the new [[United States Capitol]].<ref name="loc history">{{cite web| title=Jefferson's Legacy: A Brief History of the Library of Congress| publisher=Library of Congress| url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html| date=March 6, 2006| access-date=January 14, 2008}}</ref>

President [[Thomas Jefferson]] played an important role in establishing the structure of the Library of Congress. On January 26, 1802, he signed a bill that allowed the president to appoint the [[librarian of Congress]] and establishing a [[Joint Committee on the Library]] to regulate and oversee it. The new law also extended borrowing privileges to the president and vice president.<ref>{{USStat|2|128}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The library: an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart P.|publisher=Skyhorse Pub|year=2009|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/158 158]|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/158}}</ref>

The invading British army [[Burning of Washington|burned Washington]] in August 1814 during the [[War of 1812]] and destroyed the Library of Congress and its collection of 3,000 volumes.<ref name="loc history"/> These volumes had been left in the Senate wing of the Capitol.<ref name=":2" /> One of the few congressional volumes to survive was a government account book of receipts and expenditures for 1810.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Library An Illustrated History

Within a month, Thomas Jefferson offered to sell his personal library<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?view=ThomasJefferson |title=Thomas Jefferson's personal library, at LibraryThing, based on scholarship |publisher=LibraryThing |access-date=2012-11-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.librarything.com/profile/ThomasJefferson LibraryThing profile page for Thomas Jefferson's library], summarizing contents and indicating sources</ref> as a replacement. Congress accepted his offer in January 1815, appropriating $23,950 to purchase his 6,487 books.<ref name="loc history"/> Some members of the House of Representatives opposed the outright purchase, including New Hampshire representative [[Daniel Webster]] who wanted to return "all books of an atheistical, irreligious, and immoral tendency."<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart P.|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub]]|year=2009|isbn=9781602397064|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr/page/162}}</ref> Jefferson had spent 50 years accumulating a wide variety of books in several languages and on subjects such as philosophy, history, law, religion, architecture, travel, natural sciences, mathematics, studies of classical Greece and Rome, modern inventions, hot air balloons, music, submarines, fossils, agriculture, and meteorology.<ref name=":4" /> He had also collected books on topics not normally viewed as part of a legislative library, such as cookbooks. However, he believed that all subjects had a place in the Library of Congress. He remarked:

<blockquote>I do not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection; there is, in fact, no subject to which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>

Jefferson's collection was unique in that it was the working collection of a scholar, not a gentleman's collection for display. With the addition of his collection, which doubled the size of the original library, the Library of Congress was transformed from a specialist's library to a more general one.<ref>Murray, Stuart A.P. The Library: An Illustrated History. Skyhorse Publishing, 2012. 9781616084530, pp. 161</ref> His original collection was organized into a scheme based on [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Works by Francis Bacon#Scientific works|organization of knowledge]]. Specifically, he grouped his books into Memory, Reason, and Imagination, which broke down into 44 more subdivisions. His library included subjects such as philosophy, history, law, religion, and many other topics.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4|location=New York|pages=162}}</ref> The library followed Jefferson's organization scheme until the late 19th century, when librarian [[Herbert Putnam]] began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items.

In 1851, a fire destroyed two thirds of the Jefferson collection, with only 2,000 books remaining. By 2008, the librarians of Congress had found replacements for all but 300 of the works that were in Jefferson's original collection.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Thomas Jefferson's Library| url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0806/jefferson.html| last=Fineberg| first=Gail| journal=The Gazette| publisher=Library of Congress| date=June 2007| volume=67| number=6| access-date=2015-01-04}}</ref>

===1851–1865: Weakening===
On December 24, 1851, the largest fire in the library's history destroyed 35,000 books, about two–thirds of the library's collection and two-thirds of Jefferson's original transfer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=History, Art & Archives, U.S. House of Representatives|title=An 1851 Library of Congress Fire|url=http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/An-1825-Library-of-Congress-fire/|website=United States House of Representatives|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref> Congress appropriated $168,700 to replace the lost books in 1852 but not to acquire new materials.<ref name="Library of Congress">{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=J.Y.|title=Jefferson's Legacy: a brief history of the Library of Congress|date=1993|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|page=14}}</ref> This marked the start of a conservative period in the library's administration by librarian [[John Silva Meehan]] and joint committee chairman [[James A. Pearce]], who restricted the library's activities.<ref name="Library of Congress"/> Meehan and Pearce's views about a restricted scope for the Library of Congress reflected those shared by members of Congress. While Meehan was librarian he supported and perpetuated the notion that "the congressional library should play a limited role on the national scene and that its collections, by and large, should emphasize American materials of obvious use to the U.S. Congress."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=J.Y.|s2cid=142764409|title=The Library of Congress Becomes a World Leader, 1815–2005|journal=Libraries & Culture|date=2005|volume=40|issue=3|page=386|doi=10.1353/lac.2005.0046}}</ref> In 1859, Congress transferred the library's public document distribution activities to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] and its international book exchange program to the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Interior Library|title=History of the Interior Library|url=https://www.doi.gov/library/about/history|website=U.S. Department for the Interior|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref>

During the 1850s, [[Smithsonian Institution]] librarian [[Charles Coffin Jewett]] aggressively tried to make the Smithsonian into the United States' national library. His efforts were blocked by Smithsonian secretary [[Joseph Henry]], who advocated a focus on scientific research and publication.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smithsonian Institution|title=An Account Of The Smithsonian: Its Origin, History, Objects and Achievements|date=1904|location=Washington, D.C.|page=12}}</ref> To reinforce his intentions for the Smithsonian, Henry established laboratories, developed a robust physical sciences library and started the ''[[Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge]]'', the first of many publications intended to disseminate research results.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mearns|first1=D.C.|title=The Story Up to Now: The Library of Congress, 1800–1946|date=1946|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=100}}</ref> For Henry, the Library of Congress was the obvious choice as the national library. Unable to resolve the conflict, Henry dismissed Jewett in July 1854. In 1865 the Smithsonian building, also called the Castle due to its Norman architectural style, was devastated by fire and presented Henry an opportunity in regards to the Smithsonian's non-scientific library. Around this time, the Library of Congress was making plans to build and relocate to the new [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], which would be fireproof.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress 1866|url=https://www.copyright.gov/reports/annual/archive/ar-1866.pdf|website=U.S. Copyright Office|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref> Authorized by an act of Congress, he transferred the Smithsonian's non-scientific library of 40,000 volumes to the Library of Congress in 1866.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gwinn|first1=Nancy|title=History|url=https://library.si.edu/about/history|website=Smithsonian Libraries|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref>

[[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed [[John G. Stephenson]] as librarian of Congress in 1861 and the appointment is regarded as the most political to date.<ref name="John G Stephenson">{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=John G Stephenson|url=https://www.loc.gov/about/about-the-librarian/previous-librarians-of-congress/john-g-stephenson/|website=John G Stephenson – Previous Librarians of Congress|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref> Stephenson was a physician and spent equal time serving as librarian and as a physician in the Union Army. He could manage this division of interest because he hired [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]] as his assistant.<ref name="John G Stephenson"/> Despite his new job, Stephenson's focus was on non-library affairs; three weeks into his term, he left Washington, D.C. to serve as a volunteer aide-de-camp at the battles of [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="John G Stephenson"/> Stephenson's term as librarian seems to have left little imprint on the library although hiring Spofford, who was left to run the library in his absence, may have been his most significant achievement.<ref name="John G Stephenson"/>

===1865–1897: Spofford's expansion===

The Library of Congress reasserted itself during the latter half of the 19th century under Librarian [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]] who directed it from 1865 to 1897. He built broad bipartisan support for it as a national library and a legislative resource, aided by an overall expansion of the federal government and a favorable political climate. He began comprehensively collecting [[Americana]] and [[American literature]], led the construction of a new building to house the library, and transformed the librarian of Congress position into one of strength and independence. Between 1865 and 1870, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], placed all copyright registration and deposit activities under the library's control, and restored the international book exchange. The library also acquired the vast libraries of the Smithsonian and of historian [[Peter Force]], strengthening its scientific and Americana collections significantly. By 1876, the Library of Congress had 300,000 volumes and was tied with the [[Boston Public Library]] as the nation's largest library. It moved from the Capitol building to its new headquarters in 1897 with more than 840,000 volumes, 40 percent of which had been acquired through copyright deposit.<ref name="loc history"/>
[[File:Hl026001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=piles of books waiting to be shelved in Thomas Jefferson building|Some of the Library of Congress' holdings awaiting shelving inside the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Building in 1897]]

A year before the library's move to its new location, the Joint Library Committee held a session of hearings to assess the condition of the library and plan for its future growth and possible reorganization. Spofford and six experts sent by the [[American Library Association]]<ref>These included future Librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] of the [[New York State Library]].</ref> testified that the library should continue its expansion towards becoming a true national library. Congress more than doubled the library's staff from 42 to 108 based on the hearings, and with the assistance of senators [[Justin Morrill]] of Vermont and [[Daniel W. Voorhees]] of Indiana, and established new administrative units for all aspects of the collection. Congress also strengthened the office of Librarian of Congress to govern the library and make staff appointments, as well as requiring Senate approval for presidential appointees to the position.<ref name="loc history"/>

===1897–1939: Post-reorganization===

The Library of Congress, spurred by the 1897 reorganization, began to grow and develop more rapidly. Spofford's successor [[John Russell Young]], though only in office for two years, overhauled the library's bureaucracy, used his connections as a former diplomat to acquire more materials from around the world, and established the library's first assistance programs for the [[Blindness|blind]] and physically disabled. Young's successor [[Herbert Putnam]] held the office for forty years from 1899 to 1939, entering into the position two years before the library became the first in the United States to hold one million volumes.<ref name="loc history"/> Putnam focused his efforts on making the library more accessible and useful for the public and for other libraries. He instituted the interlibrary loan service, transforming the Library of Congress into what he referred to as a "library of last resort".<ref name="interlibrary loan">{{cite web| title=Interlibrary Loan (Collections Access, Management and Loan Division, Library of Congress)| url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/| date=October 25, 2007| publisher=Library of Congress website| access-date =December 4, 2007}}</ref> Putnam also expanded library access to "scientific investigators and duly qualified individuals" and began publishing [[primary sources]] for the benefit of scholars.<ref name="loc history"/>

Putnam's tenure also saw increasing diversity in the library's acquisitions. In 1903, he persuaded President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to transfer by executive order the papers of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] from the State Department to the Library of Congress. Putnam expanded foreign acquisitions as well, including the 1904 purchase of a four-thousand volume library of [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]], the 1906 purchase of G. V. Yudin's eighty-thousand volume Russian library, the 1908 Schatz collection of early opera [[librettos]], and the early 1930s purchase of the Russian Imperial Collection, consisting of 2,600 volumes from the library of the [[Romanov family]] on a variety of topics. Collections of [[Hebraica]] and Chinese and Japanese works were also acquired. Congress even took the initiative to acquire materials for the library in one occasion, when in 1929 Congressman [[Ross Collins]] of Mississippi successfully proposed the $1.5 million purchase of Otto Vollbehr's collection of [[incunabula]], including one of three remaining perfect vellum copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Snapp |first=Elizabeth |title=The Acquisition of the Vollbehr Collection of Incunabula for the Library of Congress |journal=The Journal of Library History |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=April 1975 |pages=152–161 |publisher=University of Texas Press |jstor=25540624 }} (restricted access)</ref><ref name="loc history"/>
[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|alt=Gutenberg bible open to page|A copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] on display at the Library of Congress]]
In 1914, Putnam established the [[Legislative Reference Service]] as a separative administrative unit of the library. Based in the [[Progressive era]]'s philosophy of science as a problem-solver, and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures, the LRS would provide informed answers to Congressional research inquiries on almost any topic. In 1965, Congress passed an act allowing the Library of Congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments, giving the library a role as a patron of the arts. The library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as [[John D. Rockefeller]], James B. Wilbur and [[Archer M. Huntington]]. Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated five [[List of Stradivarius instruments#Violins|Stradivarius violins]] to the library and [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]]'s donations paid for a [[concert hall]] within the Library of Congress building and the establishment of an [[honorarium]] for the Music Division. A number of chairs and consultantships were established from the donations, the most well-known of which is the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate Consultant]].<ref name="loc history"/>

The library's expansion eventually filled the library's Main Building, despite shelving expansions in 1910 and 1927, forcing the library to expand into a new structure. Congress acquired nearby land in 1928 and approved construction of the Annex Building (later the John Adams Building) in 1930. Although delayed during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, it was completed in 1938 and opened to the public in 1939.<ref name="loc history"/>

===1939–present: Modern history===

When Putnam retired in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed [[Archibald MacLeish]] as his successor. Occupying the post from 1939 to 1944 during the height of World War II, MacLeish became the most visible librarian of Congress in the library's history. MacLeish encouraged librarians to oppose [[totalitarianism]] on behalf of democracy; dedicated the South Reading Room of the Adams Building to Thomas Jefferson, commissioning artist [[Ezra Winter]] to paint four themed murals for the room; and established a "democracy alcove" in the Main Reading Room of the Jefferson Building for important documents such as the Declaration, Constitution and ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. The Library of Congress even assisted during the war effort, ranging from the storage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Fort Knox]] for safekeeping to researching weather data on the [[Himalayas]] for [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilots. MacLeish resigned in 1944 to become Assistant Secretary of State, and President [[Harry Truman]] appointed [[Luther H. Evans]] as librarian of Congress. Evans, who served until 1953, expanded the library's acquisitions, cataloging and bibliographic services as much as the fiscal-minded Congress would allow, but his primary achievement was the creation of Library of Congress Missions around the world. Missions played a variety of roles in the postwar world: the mission in San Francisco assisted participants in the [[meeting that established the United Nations]], the mission in Europe acquired European publications for the Library of Congress and other American libraries, and the mission in Japan aided in the creation of the [[National Diet Library]].<ref name="loc history"/>

Evans' successor [[Lawrence Quincy Mumford]] took over in 1953. Mumford's tenure, lasting until 1974, saw the initiation of the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building, the third Library of Congress building. Mumford directed the library during a period of increased educational spending, the windfall of which allowed the library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad, including in [[Cairo]] and New Delhi. In 1967, the library began experimenting with [[book preservation]] techniques through a Preservation Office, which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the United States. Mumford's administration also saw the last major public debate about the Library of Congress' role as both a legislative library and a national library. A 1962 memorandum by Douglas Bryant of the [[Harvard University Library]], compiled at the request of Joint Library Committee chairman [[Claiborne Pell]], proposed a number of institutional reforms, including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes, all of which would shift the library more towards its national role over its legislative role. Bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the Library of Congress, which was rebuked by Mumford as "unspeakable violence to tradition". Debate continued within the library community until the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970]] shifted the library back towards its legislative roles, placing greater focus on research for Congress and congressional committees and renaming the Legislative Reference Service to the [[Congressional Research Service]].<ref name="loc history"/>

After Mumford retired in 1974, Gerald Ford appointed [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] as librarian. Boorstin's first challenge was the move to the new Madison Building, which took place between 1980 and 1982. The move released pressures on staff and shelf space, allowing Boorstin to focus on other areas of library administration such as acquisitions and collections. Taking advantage of steady budgetary growth, from $116 million in 1975 to over $250 million by 1987, Boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars, authors, publishers, cultural leaders, and the business community. His active and prolific role changed the post of librarian of Congress so that by the time he retired in 1987, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation".

President Ronald Reagan nominated [[James H. Billington]] as the 13th librarian of Congress in 1987, and the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed the appointment.<ref name="loc.gov">{{Cite web|title = Key Milestones of James H. Billington's Tenure {{!}} News Releases – Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2015/15-105.html|website = Loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref> Under Billington's leadership, the library doubled the size of its analog collections from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items in 2014. At the same time, it established new programs and employed new technologies to, "get the champagne out of the bottle". These included:
* '''American Memory''' created in 1990, which became '''The National Digital Library''' in 1994, providing free access online to digitized American history and culture resources with curatorial explanations for [[K-12 education]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = American Memory from the Library of Congress – Home Page|url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html|website =Memory.loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref>

During Billington's tenure as the 13th librarian of Congress, the library acquired Lafayette's previously inaccessible papers in 1996 from a castle at La Grange, France; and the only copy of the 1507 [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller]] world map ("America's birth certificate") in 2003 for permanent display in the library's Thomas Jefferson Building. Using privately raised funds, the Library of Congress reconstructed Thomas Jefferson's original library, which was placed on permanent display in the Jefferson building in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Thomas Jefferson's Library {{!}} Exhibitions – Library of Congress|url = http://loc.gov/exhibits/thomas-jeffersons-library/|website = loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref> Billington also enlarged and technologically enhanced public spaces of the Jefferson Building into a national exhibition venue, and hosted over 100 exhibitions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = All Exhibitions – Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/all/|website =Loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref> These included exhibits on the [[Vatican Library]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], several on the Civil War and Lincoln, on African-American culture, on Religion and the founding of the American Republic, the Early Americas (the Kislak Collection became a permanent display), on the global celebration commemorating the 800th anniversary of [[Magna Carta]], and on early American printing featuring the Rubenstein [[Bay Psalm Book]]. Onsite access to the Library of Congress was also increased when Billington advocated successfully for an underground connection between the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center and the library in 2008 to increase congressional usage and public tours of the library's Thomas Jefferson Building.<ref name="loc.gov"/>

Under Billington, the library launched a [[mass deacidification]] program in 2001, which has extended the lifespan of almost 4 million volumes and 12 million manuscript sheets; and new collection storage modules at Fort Meade, the first opening in 2002, to preserve and make accessible more than 4 million items from the library's analog collections. Billington established the Library Collections Security Oversight Committee in 1992 to improve protection of collections, and also the Library of Congress Congressional Caucus in 2008 to draw attention to the library's curators and collections. He created the library's first Young Readers Center in the Jefferson Building in 2009, and the first large-scale summer intern (Junior Fellows) program for university
students in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2015 Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Home (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/|website = Loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref> Under Billington, the library also sponsored the Gateway to Knowledge in 2010–2011, a mobile exhibition to 90 sites covering all states east of the Mississippi in a specially designed 18-wheel truck, increasing public access to library collections off-site, particularly for rural populations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gateway to Knowledge – Educational Resources – Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/gateway/resources.html|website = Loc.gov|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref>

Billington raised more than half a billion dollars of private support to supplement Congressional appropriations for library collections, programs, and digital outreach. These private funds helped the library to continue its growth and outreach in the face of a 30% decrease in staffing caused mainly by legislative appropriations cutbacks. He created the library's first development office for private fundraising in 1987, and, in 1990, established the James Madison Council, the library's first national private sector donor-support group. In 1987, Billington also asked the GAO to conduct the first library-wide audit, and he created the first Office of the Inspector General at the library to provide regular independent review of library operations. This precedent led to regular annual financial audits, leading to unmodified ("clean") opinions from 1995 onwards.<ref name="loc.gov"/>

In April 2010, it announced plans to archive all public communication on [[Twitter]], including all communication since Twitter's launch in March 2006.<ref name=Grier>{{cite news| first=Peter| last=Grier| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0416/Twitter-hits-Library-of-Congress-Would-Founding-Fathers-tweet| title=Twitter hits Library of Congress: Would Founding Fathers tweet?| work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 April 2010 |access-date=2015-01-04}}</ref> {{As of|2015}}, the Twitter archive remains unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Michael|title=The Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress: Challenges for information practice and information policy|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5619/4653|website=First Monday}}</ref>

Before retiring in 2015, after 28 years of service, Billington had come "under pressure" as librarian of Congress.<ref>"[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article41942157.html Librarian of Congress gets a Due Date]" by Maria Recio, McClatchy DC, Oct. 30. 2015</ref> This followed a [[Government Accountability Office]] report which revealed a "work environment lacking central oversight" and faulted Billington for "ignoring repeated calls to hire a chief information officer, as required by law."<ref>"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html America's 'national library' is lacking in leadership, yet another report finds]" by Peggy McGlone, The Washington Post, March 31, 2015.</ref>

When Billington announced his plans to retire in 2015, commentator George Weigel described the Library of Congress as "one of the last refuges in Washington of serious bipartisanship and calm, considered conversation," and "one of the world's greatest cultural centers."<ref>{{Cite web|title = America's Next 'Minister of Culture': Don't Politicize the Appointment|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419664/americas-next-minister-culture-dont-politicize-appointment|access-date = 2015-09-22}}</ref>

The library developed a system of book classification called [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC), which is used by most US research and [[university library|university libraries]].

The library serves as a legal repository for [[copyright]] protection and [[copyright registration]], and as the base for the [[United States Copyright Office]]. Regardless of whether they register their copyright, all publishers are required to submit two complete copies of their published works to the library—this requirement is known as ''mandatory deposit''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/mandatory_deposit.html| title=Mandatory Deposit| publisher=Copyright.gov| access-date=August 8, 2006}}</ref> Nearly 15,000 new items published in the U.S. arrive every business day at the library. Contrary to popular belief, however, the library does not retain all of these works in its permanent collection, although it does add an average of 12,000 items per day.<ref name="Fascinating Facts" /> Rejected items are used in trades with other libraries around the world, distributed to federal agencies, or donated to schools, communities, and other organizations within the United States.<ref name="Fascinating Facts" /> As is true of many [[Legal deposit|similar libraries]], the Library of Congress retains copies of every publication in the English language that is deemed significant.

The library also administers the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]], an audio book and [[braille]] library program provided to more than 766,000 Americans.

=== Digitization ===
The library's first digitization project was called "[[American Memory]]." Launched in 1990, it initially planned to choose 160 million objects from its collection to make digitally available on [[LaserDisc|laserdiscs]] and [[Compact disc|CDs]] that would be distributed to schools and libraries. After realizing that this plan would be too expensive and inefficient, and with the rise of the Internet, the library decided to instead make digitized material available over the Internet. This project was made official in the National Digital Library Program (NDLP), created in October 1994. By 1999, the NDLP had succeeded in digitizing over 5 million objects and had a budget of $12 million. The library has kept the "American Memory" name for its public domain website, which today contains 15 million digital objects, comprising over 7 [[petabyte]]s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|title=The Library of Last Resort|last=Chayka|first=Kyle|date=2016-07-14|publisher=n+1 Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235106/https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|archive-date=January 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

American Memory is a source for [[public domain]] image resources, as well as audio, video, and archived Web content. Nearly all of the lists of holdings, the ''catalogs'' of the library, can be consulted directly on its web site. Librarians all over the world consult these catalogs, through the Web or through other media better suited to their needs, when they need to catalog for their collection a book published in the United States. They use the [[Library of Congress Control Number]] to make sure of the exact identity of the book. Digital images are also available at [[Snapshots of the Past]], which provides archival prints.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snapshotsofthepast.com/about-us|title=About Us|website=Snapshots of the Past|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>

The library has a budget of between $6–8 million each year for digitization, meaning that not all works can be digitized. It makes determinations about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to Congress or potentially interesting for the public. The 15 million digitized items represent less than 10% of the library's total 160-million item collection.

The library has chosen not to participate in other digital library projects such as [[Google Books]] and the [[Digital Public Library of America]], although it has supported the [[Internet Archive]] project.<ref name=":1" />

====THOMAS and Congress.gov projects====
In 1995, the Library of Congress established online archive of the proceedings of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], [[THOMAS]]. The THOMAS website included the full text of proposed legislation, as well as bill summaries and statuses, [[Congressional Record]] text, and the Congressional Record Index. The THOMAS system received major updates in 2005 and 2010. A migration to a more modernized Web system, [[Congress.gov]], began in 2012, and the THOMAS system was retired in 2016.<ref>David Gewirtz, [https://www.zdnet.com/article/thomas-gov-an-exclusive-inside-look-at-the-retirement-and-transition-of-a-classic-web-1-0/ So long, Thomas.gov: Inside the retirement of a classic Web 1.0 application], ZDNet (May 4, 2016).</ref> Congress.gov is a joint project of the Library of Congress, the House, the Senate and the [[Government Publishing Office]].<ref>Adam Mazmanian, [https://fcw.com/articles/2016/04/28/thomas-loc-retired.aspx Library of Congress to retire Thomas], ''[[Federal Computer Week]]'' (April 28, 2016).</ref>

The Library of Congress is physically housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill and a conservation center in rural [[Virginia]]. The library's Capitol Hill buildings are all connected by underground passageways, so that a library user need pass through security only once in a single visit. The library also has off-site storage facilities for less commonly requested materials.

===Thomas Jefferson Building===

The library is open for academic research to anyone with a Reader Identification Card. One may not remove library items from the reading rooms or the library buildings. Most of the library's general collection of books and journals are in the closed stacks of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings; specialized collections of books and other materials are in closed stacks in all three main library buildings, or are stored off-site. Access to the closed stacks is not permitted under any circumstances, except to authorized library staff, and occasionally, to dignitaries. Only the reading room reference collections are on open shelves.

Since 1902, American libraries have been able to request books and other items through [[interlibrary loan]] from the Library of Congress if these items are not readily available elsewhere. Through this system, the Library of Congress has served as a "library of last resort", according to former librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]].<ref name="interlibrary loan"/> The Library of Congress lends books to other libraries with the stipulation that they be used only inside the borrowing library.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/loanweb1.html |title=Subpage Title (Interlibrary Loan, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2010-07-14 |access-date=2012-11-04}}</ref>
