'''Henley on Klip''' is situated next to Highbury off exit 27 on the [[R59 (South Africa)|R59]] along the [[Klip River]] between [[Johannesburg]] and [[Vereeniging]].
The village was founded in 1904,<ref>Van Eck, Koos (2010) ''A River runs through: A history of Henley on Klip''. Vanderbijlpark: Corals Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0-9814389-7-9}}</ref> by Advocate Horace Kent. Born in 1855 in [[Henley on Thames]], [[England]], Kent came to [[South Africa]] in 1898. The area where Henley on Klip is located reminded Kent of his hometown in [[England]], [[Henley on Thames]]. Kent, in conjunction with the Small Farms Company (SFC), bought the land from a Mr Van Der Westhuizen for a price of 5000 pounds, and the land was divided into [[smallholding]]s from {{convert|1|to|80|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}}.

In 1904, the SFC decided to build the [[Kidson Weir]] on the Klip River in Henley on Klip. The weir was named after Fenning Kidson, the grandson of an
1820 settler. Fenning was educated in [[England]], but returned to [[South Africa]]
as a young man and became a transport rider, a contemporary of Sir Percy
Fitzpatrick. Soon after the outbreak of the Anglo Boer War, news came to
Kidson that a commando was on his way to his farm to arrest him. Under the
noses of the Boers he escaped, riding sidesaddle, his burly frame crammed
into his wife's riding habit. He finally made his way to Natal, but
returned to the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] after the war, settling in Henley on Klip with his
wife, Edith. The family home was named Tilham, which is the manor house on
the river at the corner of Regatta and Shillingford Roads

Johan le Roux, a matric scholar at Dr Malan Hoerskool in [[Meyerton, Gauteng|Meyerton]], saved two children by pushing them out of a bus window before the train hit the bus, and he died in the accident.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.midvaal.gov.za/files/press%20releases/johan_le_roux_memorial_website.pdf | title=Midvaal Local Municipality | accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="Beeld">{{cite web|url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2010/02/01/B1/6/wzhenleybus.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140304062143/http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2010/02/01/B1/6/wzhenleybus.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2014 |title=’n Roudiens en ‘die lewe gaan aan’ |accessdate=29 July 2015 }}</ref>
