The '''Church of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Eaglais na hÉireann}} (IPA:[ˈaɡləʃˈnˠaˈheːɾʲən̪ˠ]); [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Kirk o Airlann'')<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130225223255/http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/census/UlsterScots.pdf 2001 Northern Irish census leaflet, Ulster-Scots] NI Statistics and Research Agency. Retrieved 25 September 2012.</ref> is a [[Christian church]] in [[Ireland]] and an autonomous province of the [[Anglican Communion]]. It is organised on an [[all-Ireland]] basis and is the [[Christianity in Ireland|second largest]] Christian church on the island after the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Roman Catholic Church]]. Like other [[Anglican]] churches, it has retained elements of pre-Reformation practice, notably its [[episcopal polity]], while rejecting the primacy of the Pope. 

In theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the [[Reformation]], particularly those of the [[English Reformation]], but self-identifies as being both [[Protestantism|Reformed]] and [[Catholic_(term)|Catholic]], in that it sees itself as the inheritor of a continuous tradition going back to the founding of [[Celtic_Christianity|Christianity in Ireland]].<ref>[http://ireland.anglican.org/about/ "About Us", Church of Ireland website]</ref> As with other members of the global Anglican communion, individual parishes accommodate different approaches to the level of ritual and formality, variously referred to as [[High church|High]] and [[Low Church]].<ref>[http://stgeorges.connor.anglican.org/about-the-church-of-ireland/ Church of Ireland] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113815/http://stgeorges.connor.anglican.org/about-the-church-of-ireland/ |date = 2 April 2015 }}</ref> 

== Overview ==
The Church of Ireland is 'that part of the Irish Church which was influenced by the [[Reformation]], and has its origins in the early Celtic Church of St Patrick'. As the inheritor of a continuous tradition of faith and practice going back to the founding of [[Celtic_Christianity|Christianity in Ireland]], it considers itself [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]. However, it is also [[Protestant]], or Reformed, since it rejects the authority of [[Rome]], along with changes in doctrine and liturgy imposed on the original church and removed by the Reformation.{{sfn|Church of Ireland|url=https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/protestant-and-catholic}} Modern scholarship argues although the early Irish church was separate from Rome, much of its liturgy and practice was the same, which means both the Church of Ireland and the Irish Catholic church can claim descent from St Patrick.<ref>Thomas O'Loughlin, Journeys on the edges: the Celtic tradition,(London, 2000), Caitlin Corning, The Celtic and Roman traditions: conflict and consensus in the early medieval church (Basingstoke, 2006), Alan Ford, 'Shaping history: James Ussher and the Church of Ireland', The Church of Ireland and its past: history, interpretation and identity, ed. Mark Empey, Alan Ford and Miriam Moffitt (Dublin, 2017).</ref>

The Irish church was independent until 1155, when [[Pope Adrian IV]] purported to declare it a papal fief and granted [[Henry II of England]] the [[Lordship of Ireland]] in return for paying [[tithes]]; his right to do so has been disputed ever since.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=45-48}} In 1534, [[Henry VIII]] broke with the Papacy and became head of the [[Church of England]]; two years later, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] followed suit by appointing him head of the Irish church. Although many bishops and most of the clergy refused to conform, the church retained possession of diocesan buildings and lands, since under the feudal system bishops held that property as [[vassal]]s of the Crown.{{sfn|Church of Ireland|url=https://www.ireland.anglican.org/our-faith/apck/irish-and-universal}}

Despite the political and economic advantages of membership, a large majority of the Irish remained Catholic, while in [[Ulster]], the church was outnumbered by Presbyterians. However, it remained the official state church until [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablished]] by the [[First Gladstone ministry]] on 1 January 1871. The modern Church of Ireland is the second largest religious institution in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and the third largest in [[Northern Ireland]], after the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches.{{sfn|O’Mahony |2010}}

==History==
{{See also|History of Christianity in Ireland}}

===Formation===
{{Main|Reformation in Ireland}}
[[Image:PopeAdrianIVCameo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Pope Adrian IV]], who claimed Ireland for the Papacy in 1155]]
Prior to the 12th century, the Irish church was independent of [[Pope|Papal]] control, and developed its own practices and structures. It was primarily governed by the leaders of powerful [[Monastery|monasteries]], rather than [[bishops]], while the former [[Vikings|Viking]] [[Kingdom of Dublin]] looked to the English [[Diocese of Canterbury]] for guidance. In the 1152 [[Synod of Kells]], [[Pope Anastasius IV]] claimed Ireland as a [[Ecclesiastical fief|papal fief]], and imposed a system bringing it more into line with [[Rome]].{{sfn|Young|2020|pp=18-19}}

Under the [[Laudabiliter]] in 1155, English-born [[Pope Adrian IV]] granted [[Henry II of England]] the [[Lordship of Ireland]] in return for paying [[tithes]] to Rome. His claim was based on the 4th century [[Donation of Constantine]], which allegedly gave the Papacy religious control over all Christian territories in the western [[Roman Empire]]. Its legality was disputed at the time, since Ireland was never part of the Roman Empire, while the Donation itself was later exposed as a forgery.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|pp=45-70}} 

The Irish church was divided into [[Diocese]]s, headed by bishops, while adopting English [[liturgy]] and saints, such as [[Edward the Confessor]], and [[Thomas Becket]].{{sfn|Young|2020|p=19}} In 1536, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] followed their English colleagues by accepting [[Henry VIII of England]] as head of the church, rather than the Pope. This marks the founding of the reformed Church of Ireland, confirmed when Henry became [[Kingdom of Ireland|King of Ireland]] in 1541. Largely restricted to [[Dublin]], led by [[George Browne (archbishop of Dublin)|Archbishop George Browne]], it expanded under [[Edward VI]], until Catholicism was restored by his sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1553.{{sfn|Walshe |1989|p=358}}

[[File:BecketHenryII.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] with [[Thomas Becket]]; the 1155 intervention was the start of efforts to Anglicise the Irish church]]

When [[Elizabeth I of England]] became queen in 1558, only five bishops accepted her [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Religious Settlement]], and most of the Irish clergy had to be replaced.{{sfn|Walshe |1989|p=60}} This was hampered by the church's relative poverty, while adapting to the changes of regime damaged the reputation of those who remained. [[Hugh Curwen]] was [[Dean of Hereford]] until 1555, when Mary made him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]], before returning to the reformed church in 1558. Despite accusations of 'moral delinquency', he remained Archbishop and [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland|Lord Chancellor]] until 1567, when he was appointed [[Bishop of Oxford]].{{sfn|Murray|2009|pp=242-245}}

The absence of Gaelic-speaking ministers led to the adoption of a gradualist policy, similar to that used in Catholic areas of Northern England.{{sfn|Muldoon|2000|pp=248–250}} 'Occasional conformity' allowed the use of pre-Reformation rites, combined with acceptance of the established Church; this practice persisted in both England and Ireland well into the mid-18th century.{{sfn|Flaningam|1977|pp=39–41}}

Lack of [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] literature was another restriction; shortly before his death in 1585, [[Nicholas Walsh (bishop)|Nicholas Walsh]] began translation of the [[New Testament]]. Continued by John Kearny and [[Nehemiah Donnellan]], it was finally printed in 1602 by [[William Daniel (archbishop)|William Daniel]], who also translated the [[Book of Common Prayer]], or BCP, in 1606. An Irish version of the Old Testament was published in 1685 by [[Narcissus Marsh]], but the revised BCP was not available until 1712.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Book of Common Prayer of the Church of Ireland (1666) |url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Ireland/BCP_Ireland1666.htm |website=Justus.anglican.org |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref>

===17th century===
[[File:James Ussher by Sir Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[James Ussher]], Archbishop of Armagh]]
{{Main|Nonjuring schism}}
At the beginning of the 17th century, most native Irish were Catholic, with Protestant settlers in [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] establishing an independent Presbyterian church. Largely confined to an English-speaking minority in [[The Pale]], the most important figure of the Church's development was Dublin-born theologian and historian, [[James Ussher]], Archbishop of Armagh from 1625 to 1656. In 1615, the Church of Ireland drew up its own confession of faith, similar to the English version, but more detailed, less ambiguous and often explicitly Calvinist.{{sfn|Wallace|1949 |pp=1–15}} When the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] were formally adopted by the Irish church in 1634, Ussher ensured they were in addition to the Irish Articles; however, they were soon superseded by the Thirty Nine Articles, which remain in use to the present day.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume I. The History of Creeds. | Christian Classics Ethereal Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the Church of Ireland claimed to be the original and universal church, while the Papacy was an innovation, thus vesting it with the supremacy of [[Apostolic succession]].{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=55}} This argument was supported by Ussher, and Charles' former personal chaplain, [[John Leslie (bishop of Raphoe)|John Leslie]], a key supporter of Caroline reforms in Scotland, appointed bishop of [[Diocese of Derry and Raphoe|Derry & Raphoe]] in 1633.{{sfn|Diamond|2009}}

During the 1641–1653 [[Irish Confederate Wars]], nearly two-thirds of Ireland was controlled by the largely Catholic [[Confederate Ireland|Confederacy]], and in 1644, [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] became [[Papal Nuncio]] to Ireland. Irish Catholicism had developed greater tolerance for Protestants, while sharing their hostility to elaborate ritual. Rinuccini's insistence on following Roman liturgy, and attempts to re-introduce ceremonies such as [[Maundy (foot washing)|foot washing]] divided the Confederacy, and contributed to its rapid collapse in the 1649-1652 [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwell's re-conquest of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Yates |first=Nigel |title=Catholic Reformation in Ireland: The Mission of Rinuccini 1645–1649 |url = https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/catholic-reformation-in-ireland-the-mission-of-rinuccini-1645-1649/ |website=History Ireland |access-date=12 September 2018 |date=24 February 2013 }}</ref>
[[File:AcquittalSevenBishops.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The [[Seven Bishops]] acquitted, June 1688; a key factor in the removal of [[James II of England|James]], five later became [[Nonjuring schism|Non-Jurors]]]]
The church was re-established after the 1660 [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration of Charles II]] and in January 1661, meetings by 'Papists, Presbyterians, Independents or separatists' were made illegal.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=88}} In practice, the penal laws were loosely enforced and after 1666, Protestant [[Dissenter]]s and Catholics were allowed to resume their seats in the [[Parliament of Ireland]].

In 1685, the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] became king with considerable backing in all three kingdoms; this changed when his policies seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and into an attack on the established church. His prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] in England for seditious libel in June 1688 destroyed his support base, while many felt James lost his right to govern by ignoring his [[Coronation Oath Act 1688|coronation Oath]] to maintain the primacy of the Protestant religion.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=179–181}}

This made oaths a high profile issue, since ministers of the [[State religion|national]] churches of England, Scotland and Ireland were required to swear allegiance to the ruling monarch. When the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] replaced James with his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]], a minority felt bound by their previous oath and refused to swear another. This led to the [[Nonjuring schism|Non-Juring schism]], although for the vast majority, this was a matter of personal conscience, rather than political support for James.{{sfn|Overton|1902|p=14}}

The Irish church was less affected by this controversy, although the [[William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh)|Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] became a Non-Juror, as did a handful of the clergy, including [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] propagandist [[Charles Leslie (nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]].{{sfn|Higgins|2014|p=78}} The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland is traditionally viewed as beginning in 1691 when the [[Treaty of Limerick]] ended the [[Williamite War in Ireland|1689-1691 Williamite War]]. The Church re-established control and the 1697 Bishop's Banishment Act expelled Catholic bishops and [[regular clergy]] from Ireland, leaving only the so-called [[secular clergy]].{{sfn|Simms|1970|pp=185–186}}

===18th century===
[[File:John Smibert - Bishop George Berkeley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Irish philosopher and Church of Ireland bishop [[George Berkeley]]]]
In 1704, the [[Test Act]] was extended to Ireland; this effectively restricted public office to members of the Church of Ireland and officially remained in place until the 1829 [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]]. However, the practice of occasional conformity continued, while many Catholic gentry by-passed these restrictions by educating their sons as Protestants, their daughters as Catholics; [[Edmund Burke]] is one example.{{sfn|O'Brian|2015|p=10}}

It is estimated fewer than 15 - 20% of the Irish population were nominally members of the church, which remained a minority under pressure from both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists. The [[Toleration Act 1719|1719 Toleration Act]] allowed Nonconformists freedom of worship, while the Irish Parliament paid their ministers a small subsidy known as the 'regium donum.'{{sfn|James|1979|p=433}}

Although willing to permit a degree of flexibility, like their English counterparts, Irish bishops viewed their status as the national church to be non-negotiable and used their seats in the [[Irish House of Lords]] to enforce this. However, in 1725 Parliament passed the first in a series of 'temporary' Indemnity Acts, which allowed office holders to 'postpone' taking the oaths; the bishops were willing to approve these, since they could be repealed at any point.{{sfn|James|1979|p=444}}

In the 17th century, religious and political beliefs were often assumed to be the same; thus Catholics were considered political subversives, simply because of their religion. During the 18th century, sectarian divisions were replaced by a growing sense of Irish autonomy; in 1749, [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] issued an address to the Catholic clergy, urging them to work together with the church in the (Irish) national interest.{{sfn|James|1979|p=451}} After 1750, the government increasingly viewed Catholic emancipation as a way to reduce the power of Protestant nationalists like the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]]; this had potential implications for the church since the requirement non-church members pay tithes was deeply resented.{{sfn|Barlett|1993|p=2}} The movement ended after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion]] and Ireland's incorporation with Britain.

===19th to 20th centuries===
[[File:Ardclinis Church of Ireland Carnlough.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The Church of Ireland parish church in [[Carnlough]]]]

Following the legal union of Ireland and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] by the [[Act of Union 1800]], the Church of Ireland was also united with the Church of England to form the '''United Church of England and Ireland'''. At the same time, one archbishop and three bishops from Ireland (selected by rotation) were given seats in the [[House of Lords]] at Westminster, joining the two archbishops and twenty-four bishops from the Church of England.

The Irish Church was over-staffed, with 22 bishops, including 4 archbishops, for an official membership of 852,000, less than that of the [[Diocese of Durham|Church of England's Diocese of Durham]]. The [[Church Temporalities (Ireland) Act 1833]] reduced these to 12, as well as making financial changes. Part of a series of reforms by the [[Whig government, 1830–1834|1830-1834 Whig government]] that included the [[Reform Act 1832]], it caused deep political splits. The implications of government legislating church governance was a contributory factor in the [[Oxford Movement]] and had wide repercussions for the Anglican Communion.{{sfn|Condon|1964|pp=120–142}}

Another source of resentment was the funding of the Church by [[tithes]] imposed on all Irish subjects, even though the majority were not members. This led to anomalies like the incumbent of a living near Bessborough, who in 1833 was receiving £1,000 per year, despite the fact the parish had no Protestants or even a church.{{sfn|Pearce|2005|p=119}} The "[[Tithe War]]" of 1831–36 led to their replacement by the ''tithe rent charge'' but they did not entirely disappear until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]].

The Act ended the Church's status as a state organisation; its bishops were removed from the House of Lords and its property transferred to the government. Compensation was paid but in the immediate aftermath, parishes faced great difficulty in local financing after the loss of rent-generating lands and buildings.<ref>[http://www.crossdenominationalmission.org.uk/churchinireland.html Cross Denominational Mission "The Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869 came into effect in 1871 and the Church of Ireland ceased to be the state church. This terminated both state support and parliamentary authority over its governance, and took into public ownership much church property. Compensation was provided to clergy, but many parishes faced great difficulty after the loss of rent-generating land, property and buildings."]</ref>

==Governance==
The head of the Church of Ireland is, ''ex officio'', the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]. In 1870, immediately prior to its disestablishment, the Church provided for its internal government, led by a General Synod, and with financial and administrative support by a Representative Church Body. Like other Irish churches, the Church of Ireland did not divide when Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] in the 1920s and it continues to be governed on an all-Ireland basis.

===Structure===

{{see also|List of Anglican dioceses in the United Kingdom and Ireland}}
The polity of the Church of Ireland is [[episcopal church governance]], as in other Anglican churches. The church maintains the traditional structure dating to pre-Reformation times, a system of geographical [[Ecclesiastical parish|parishes]] organised into [[diocese]]s. There were more than 30 of these historically, grouped into four provinces; today, after consolidation over the centuries, there are [[List of Church of Ireland dioceses|12 Church of Ireland dioceses or united dioceses]], each headed by a bishop and belonging to one of two surviving provinces.

The leader of the [[Province of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|southern province]] is the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]], at present [[Michael Jackson (bishop)|Michael Jackson]]; that of the [[Province of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|northern province]] is the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]], at present [[John McDowell (bishop)|Francis John McDowell]]. These two archbishops are styled [[Primate of Ireland]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]] respectively, suggesting the ultimate seniority of the latter. Although he has relatively little absolute authority, the Archbishop of Armagh is respected as the church's general leader and spokesman, and is elected in a process different from those for all other bishops.

===General synod and policy-making===
Doctrine, canon law, church governance, church policy, and liturgical matters are decided by the church's [[general synod]]. The general synod comprises two houses, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. The House of Bishops includes the 10 diocesan bishops and two archbishops, forming one order. The House of Representatives is made up of two orders, clergy and [[laity]]. The order of clergy holds one third of the seats while the laity holds two-thirds of the seats.<ref>Dublin, Ireland,
 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.1 The General Synod of the Church of Ireland shall consist of three distinct orders, namely, the bishops, the clergy, and the laity. / 1.2 The General Synod shall consist of two Houses, namely, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives... / 1.3 The House of Bishops shall consist of all the archbishops and bishops of the Church of Ireland for the time being.{{rp|page=1.1}}</ref> As of 2017, there are 216 clergy members and 432 lay members in the House of Representatives.<ref>Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.4(i) The House of Representatives shall consist of 216 representatives of the clergy and 432 representatives of the laity...{{rp|page=1.1}}</ref> The membership of the House of Representatives is made up of delegates from the dioceses, with seats allocated to each diocese's clergy and laity in specific numbers; these delegates are elected every three years.<ref>Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.4-5{{rp|page=1.1}}</ref>

The general synod meets annually, and special meetings can be called by the leading bishop or one third of any of its orders.<ref>Dublin, Ireland, 2003:  Constitution of the Church of Ireland, 1.14-15 There shall be an ordinary meeting of the General Synod in every year, at such time and place as shall from time to time be prescribed in that behalf by the General Synod....{{rp|page=1.3}}</ref>

Changes in policy must be passed by a simple majority of both the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. Changes to doctrine, for example the decision to ordain women as priests, must be passed by a two-thirds majority of both Houses.

The two houses sit together for general deliberations but separate for some discussions and for voting.  While the House of Representatives always votes publicly, often by orders, the House of Bishops has tended to vote in private, coming to a decision before matters reach the floor of the synod. This practice has been broken only once when, in 1999, the House of Bishops voted unanimously in public to endorse the efforts of the Archbishop of Armagh, the Diocese of Armagh and the Standing Committee of the General Synod in their attempts to resolve [[Drumcree conflict|the crisis at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree]] near [[Portadown]].<ref>[http://www.ireland.anglican.org/archives/synods/synod99/synodnews/sectrepmot.html Sectarianism Report Motions]. Ireland.anglican.org. Retrieved 23 July 2013.</ref>

====Statutes and constitution====
The church's internal laws are formulated as bills proposed to the Houses of the general synod, which when passed become Statutes. The church's governing document, its constitution, is modified, consolidated and published by way of statute also, the most recent edition, the 13th, being published in 2003.

====Representative body====
The representative body of the Church of Ireland, often called the "Representative Church Body" (RCB), is the corporate trustee of the church, as established by law, and much of the church's property is vested in it. The members of the RCB are the bishops plus diocesan delegates and twelve co-opted members, and it meets at least four times a year. The staff of the representative body are analogous to clerical civil servants, and among other duties they oversee property, including church buildings, cemeteries and investments, administer some salaries and pensions, and manage the church library. While parishes, dioceses, and other parts of the church structure care for their particular properties, this is often subject to RCB rules.<ref>[https://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Resources/ParishResources/SelectVestry/Church-of-Ireland-Overview-28-03-17.pdf Church of Ireland overview (Parish Handbook)]{{rp|page=4}}</ref>

===Orders of ministry and positions===
The Church of Ireland embraces three orders of ministry: deacons, priests (or presbyters) and bishops. These orders are distinct from positions such as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]], [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] or [[Canon (priest)|canon]].

===Diocesan governance===
Each diocese or united diocese is led by its Ordinary, one of the ten bishops and two archbishops, and the Ordinary may have one or more Archdeacons to support them, along with a Rural Dean for each group of parishes.  There is a diocesan synod for each diocese; there may be separate synods for historic dioceses now in unions. These synods comprise the bishop along with clergy and lay representatives from the parishes, and subject to the laws of the church, and the work of the general synod and its committees and the representative body and its committees, oversee the operation of the diocese. Each diocesan synod in turn appoints a diocesan council to which it can delegate powers.

===Parochial governance===
Each parish has a presiding member of the clergy, assisted by two churchwardens and often also two glebewardens, one of each type of warden being appointed by the clerical incumbent, and one by popular vote. All qualified adult members of the parish comprise the general vestry, which meets annually, within 20 days each side of Easter, as the Easter Vestry. There is also a select vestry for the parish, or sometimes for each active church in a parish, comprising the presiding cleric and any curate assistants, along with relevant churchwardens and glebewardens and a number of members elected at the Easter Vestry meeting.  The select vestry assists in the care and operation of the parish and one or more church buildings.

===Cathedral governance===
Special provisions apply to the management and operation of five key cathedrals, in Dublin (which contains two Church of Ireland cathedrals), Armagh, Down, and Belfast.

===Tribunals===
The church has disciplinary and appeals tribunals, and diocesan courts, and a court of the general synod.

==Present==
===Membership===
The Church of Ireland experienced a major decline in membership during the 20th century, both in Northern Ireland, where around 65% of its members live, and in the Republic of Ireland. The church is still the second-largest in the [[Republic of Ireland]], with around 126,400 members in 2016 (minus 2% compared to the 2011 census results)<ref name="Census 2016 Results">[http://www.thejournal.ie/census-2016-statistics-3326599-Apr2017/ ''Census 2016 Results''].</ref> and the third-largest in [[Northern Ireland]], with around 260,000 members.<ref name=2011ks>{{cite web |title = Census 2011: Key Statistics for Northern Ireland |url = http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_stats_bulletin_2011.pdf |website = nisra.gov.uk |access-date=11 December 2012 }}</ref><ref name="nisra.gov.uk">[http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_report_2011.pdf 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Northern Ireland, December 2012, p. 19.]</ref>

===Cathedrals===
The Church of Ireland has two cathedrals in Dublin: within the line of the walls of the old city is [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], the seat of the Archbishop of Dublin, and just outside the old walls is [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], which the church designated as the National Cathedral for Ireland in 1870. Cathedrals also exist in the other dioceses.

There is also the metropolitan cathedral church of Ireland, situated in Armagh, [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral]]. This cathedral is the seat of the archbishop and metropolitan, [[the Most Reverend]] [[Richard Clarke (bishop)|Richard Clarke]].

===Offices, training of priests and teachers===
The church's central offices are in [[Rathmines]], adjacent to the former [[Church of Ireland College of Education]], and the church's library is in Churchtown. Teacher training now occurs within the [[Dublin City University]] Institute of Education, overseen by the Church of Ireland Centre, based at the former [[All Hallows College]]. The church operates a seminary, the [[Church of Ireland Theological Institute]], in [[Rathgar]], in the south inner suburbs of Dublin.

===Anglican Communion===
[[File:Saul church County Down sign.jpg|thumb|[[Saul, County Down|Saul]] church, a modern replica of an early church with a [[Irish round tower|round tower]], is built on the reputed spot of [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick's]] first church in Ireland.]]
The churches of the Anglican Communion are linked by affection and common loyalty. They are in full communion with the [[Episcopal see|See]] [[Archdiocese of Canterbury|of Canterbury]] and thus the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in his person, is a unique focus of Anglican unity. He calls the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of Primates, and is President of the Anglican Consultative Council.<ref>[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/acis/docs/unity.cfm Anglican Communion Official Website.]</ref> The contemporary Church of Ireland, despite having a number of [[High Church]] (often described as [[Anglo-Catholic]]) parishes, is generally on the [[Low Church]] end of the spectrum of world [[Anglicanism]]. Historically, it had little of the difference in organisation between parishes characteristic of other Anglican provinces, although a number of markedly liberal, High Church or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] parishes have developed in recent decades. It was the second province of the Anglican Communion after the [[Anglican Church of New Zealand]] (1857) to adopt, on its 1871 disestablishment, [[Synod|synodical government]]. It was also one of the first provinces to begin ordaining women to the priesthood (1991).

====Relation with the GAFCON movement====
[[Global Anglican Future Conference|GAFCON]] Ireland was launched on 21 April 2018, in [[Belfast]], with 320 attendees from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. International speakers included Archbishops [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]], retired Archbishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Sydney]], and [[Gregory Venables]], Primate of the [[Anglican Church of South America]].<ref>[https://www.gafcon.org/news/bringing-the-true-gospel-of-jesus-christ-to-ireland Bringing the true Gospel of Jesus Christ to Ireland, GAFCON official website, 26 April 2018]</ref> The Church of Ireland was represented at [[Global Anglican Future Conference|GAFCON III]], held on 17–22 June 2018 in [[Jerusalem]], by a six-member delegation, which included two bishops, [[Ferran Glenfield]], of [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]], and [[Harold Miller (bishop)|Harold Miller]], of [[Diocese of Down and Dromore|Down and Dromore]].<ref>[http://anglicanink.com/article/gafcon-iii-largest-pan-anglican-gathering-toronto-congress-1963 GAFCON III largest pan-Anglican gathering since Toronto Congress of 1963, Anglican Ink, 20 June 2018]</ref><ref>[https://www.downanddromore.org/news/2018/06/Bishop-Harold-reflects-on-his-experience-of-the-recent-GAFCON-conference#.W3i2o-j7QdV "Bishop Harold reflects on his experience of the recent GAFCON conference", Diocese of Down and Dromore official website, 25 June 2018]</ref> Their participation was criticised by some members of the Church of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/bishops-presence-at-gafcon-an-absolute-disgrace-1.3542265|title=Bishops' presence at Gafcon an 'absolute disgrace'|last=McGarry|first=Patsy|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> The Church of Ireland is not a member of GAFCON and the church communicated that attendance by clergy was unofficial in "a personal capacity," and the General Synod has voted against GAFCON's statement on the Lambeth Conference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/29-june/news/world/irish-gafcon-participants-are-out-of-touch-with-laity|title=Irish GAFCON participants are 'out of touch with laity'|last=Ryan|first=Gregg|date=29 June 2018|website=Church Times}}</ref> GAFCON supporters refuted their critics claims, saying that they endorse Lambeth 1.10 resolution on human sexuality, which is still the official stance of the Church of Ireland, but has been rejected by the liberal provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]]. Rev. Charles Raven stated: "the charge that GAFCON is a breakaway or separatist group is not supported by the evidence. It is a movement of reform and revitalisation which has enabled faithful Anglicans to remain within the Communion, especially in North America and Brazil. While being clear that participation in its common life is based upon fidelity to the biblical gospel, not merely upon historic ties, the Jerusalem Statement and Declaration of 2008 says quite unequivocally that 'Our fellowship is not breaking away from the Anglican Communion'."<ref>[https://www.gafcon.org/news/authentic-anglicanism-and-false-fears?fbclid=IwAR2CkyUcxsuDYmTJeIe6Huj31ZqTbwKMt7RKN0ZTGGRbDJbX_BNbbInFDOE "Authentic Anglicanism and False Fears"], GAFCON official website, 28 January 2020.</ref>

===Ecumenical relations===
Like many other Anglican churches, the Church of Ireland is a member of many ecumenical bodies, including the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Conference of European Churches]], [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] and the [[Irish Council of Churches]]. It is also a member of the [[Porvoo Communion]].

===Flags===
[[File:St Patrick's saltire.svg|thumb|right|St. Patrick's Flag]]
In 1999,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Journal of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland 1999|url=https://www.ireland.anglican.org/cmsfiles/pdf/Synod/Journal1999.pdf|journal=1999|pages=69}}</ref> the church voted to prohibit the flying of flags other than [[St Patrick's flag]] and the [[Flag of the Anglican Communion]].<ref>Flags of the World: [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ie-stpat.html#cofi St. Patrick's Flag as flag of Church of Ireland]: "The General Synod of the Church of Ireland recognises that from time to time confusion and controversy have attended the flying of flags on church buildings or within the grounds of church buildings. This Synod therefore resolves that the only flags specifically authorised to be flown on church buildings or within the church grounds of the Church of Ireland are the cross of St Patrick or, alternatively, the flag of the Anglican Communion bearing the emblem of the Compassrose. Such flags are authorised to be flown only on Holy Days and during the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, the Ascension of Our Lord, Pentecost, and on any other such day as may be recognised locally as the Dedication Day of the particular church building. Any other flag flown at any other time is not specifically authorised by this Church ..."</ref> However, the [[Union Flag]] continues to fly on many churches in [[Northern Ireland]].

===Publications===
The church has an official website. Its journal is ''[[The Church of Ireland Gazette]]'', which is editorially independent, but the governing body of which is appointed by the church. Many parishes and other internal organizations also produce newsletters or other publications, as well as maintaining websites.

==Doctrine and practice==

[[File:Lady Chapel St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin 010.JPG|thumb|right|Lady Chapel, [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Dublin]]]]

===Core doctrine===
The centre of the Church of Ireland's teaching is the life, death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]]. The basic teachings of the church include:
* [[Chalcedonianism|Chalcedonian]] [[Christology]]; Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God in one person. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
* Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
* The Old and New Testaments of the Bible ("God's Word written") were written by people "under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit". The Apocrypha are additional books that are to be read, but not to determine doctrine. The [[Biblical apocrypha#King James Version|Apocrypha of the King James version]] of the Bible constitutes the books of the [[Vulgate]] version that are present neither in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Old Testament]] nor the Greek [[New Testament]].
* The "two great and necessary" [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion and the Lord's Supper).
* Those [[Anglican sacraments|"commonly called Sacraments that are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel"]] are [[confirmation]], [[ordination]], marriage, [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of a penitent]] and [[unction]].
* Belief in [[heaven]], [[hell]] and [[second coming|Jesus's return in glory]].

The 16th-century apologist, [[Richard Hooker]], posits that there are three sources of authority in Anglicanism: scripture, tradition and reason. It is not known how widely accepted this idea is within Anglicanism. It is further posited that the three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine; things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.<ref>[http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705192528/http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm |date=5 July 2008 }} Detail on how scripture, tradition and reason work to "uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way".</ref>

===Modern doctrinal debates===
==== Ordination of women ====
In recent decades, the church has ordained women to all offices. In 1990 the church began ordaining women to the priesthood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/church-of-ireland-ordains-first-two-women-priests/article_578ce529-8789-5d1b-b069-1db8d76a4b88.html|title=Church of Ireland Ordains First Two Women Priests|website=Tulsa World|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> The first two women ordained were [[Kathleen Margaret Brown]] and Irene Templeton.

==== Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy ====
{{See also|Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion}}

The church has been divided over aspects of human sexuality. In 2002, the issue became pertinent as a vicar provided a blessing for a lesbian couple.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tierney|first1=Ciaran|title=Lesbian couple get church blessing.(News)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92208364.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92208364.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 October 2012|work=The Mirror|accessdate=11 January 2016}}</ref> The denomination announced a period of discernment to allocate time to the perspectives within the discussion.

===Liturgical issues===
====Irish language====
The first translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Irish was published in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was published in 1712.

The Church of Ireland has its own Irish language body, ''Cumann Gaelach na hEaglaise'' ("Irish Guild of the Church". This was founded in 1914 to bring together members of the Church of Ireland interested in the [[Irish language]] and Gaelic culture and to promote the Irish language within the Church of Ireland. The guild aims to link its programmes with the Irish language initiatives which have been centred round [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]]. It holds services twice a month in Irish.<ref>Church of Ireland Notes, page 2, ''Irish Times'', 10 January 2009.</ref>

From 1926 to 1995, the church had its own Irish-language teacher training college, ''[[Coláiste Moibhí]]''. Today, there are a number of interdenominational ''[[Gaelscoileanna]]'' (schools where [[Irish-medium education]] is applied).
