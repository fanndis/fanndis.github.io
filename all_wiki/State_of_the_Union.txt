The '''State of the Union''' '''Address''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''SOTU''') is an annual message<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web | url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/SOTU/State-of-the-Union/ | title=State of the Union Address {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives | website=history.house.gov | language=en | access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> delivered by the [[President of the United States]] to a [[joint session of the United States Congress]] at the beginning of each calendar year in office.<ref name=CNN>{{cite web | last=Diaz | first=Daniella | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/donald-trump-address-not-state-of-the-union/ | title=Why Trump's Tuesday speech isn't a State of the Union address | publisher=CNN| date=February 28, 2017 | accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> The message typically includes a budget message and an economic report of the nation, and also allows the President to propose a legislative agenda and national priorities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gpoaccess.gov/sou/index.html |title= Ben's Guide to U.S. Government |publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office]] |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225175013/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/sou/index.html |archivedate= February 25, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The address fulfills the requirement in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential responsibilities|Article II, Section 3, Clause 1]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] for the President to periodically "give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."<ref name="house.gov"/> The date of the event may be rescheduled. During most of the country's first century, the President primarily only submitted a written report to Congress. After 1913, [[Woodrow Wilson]], the 28th U.S. President, began the regular practice of delivering the address to Congress in person as a way to rally support for the President's agenda.<ref name="house.gov"/> With the advent of radio and television, the address is now broadcast live across the country on many networks.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/31-7-million-viewers-tune-in-to-watch-pres-obamas-state-of-the-union-adress.html |title=31.7 Million Viewers Tune In To Watch Pres.

==Formality==
The practice arises from a duty of the President under the [[State of the Union Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]:<ref name="KesavanSidak">{{cite journal|author=Vasan Kesavan and [[J. Gregory Sidak]]|title=The Legislator-In-Chief|journal=William and Mary Law Review|year=2002|volume=44|issue=1|accessdate=June 28, 2012|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1345&context=wmlr}}</ref>
{{quote|He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.|[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution}}

Though the language of the clause is not specific, since the 1930s, the President has made this report annually in late January or early February. Between 1934 and 2013 the date has been as early as January 3,<ref name="CRS2">{{cite book |title=The President's State of the Union Address: Tradition, Function, and Policy Implications |publisher=Congressional Research Service |page=2 |date=January 24, 2014 |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40132.pdf }}</ref> and as late as February 12.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=USA Today |first=David |last=Jackson |title=Obama State of the Union set for Feb. 12 |date=January 11, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/01/11/obama-boehner-state-of-union-feb-12/1826865/}}</ref>

While not required to deliver a speech, every president since [[Woodrow Wilson]], with the notable exception of [[Herbert Hoover]],<ref name="AppSou">{{cite web|title=State of the Union Addresses and Messages: research notes by Gerhard Peters|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php|website=The American Presidency Project (APP)|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> has made at least one State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before that time, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report.<ref name="CRS2"/>

Since Franklin Roosevelt, the State of the Union is given typically each January before a [[joint session of the United States Congress]] and is held in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chamber of the [[United States Capitol]]. Newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents generally deliver an address to Congress in February of the first year of their term, but this speech is not officially considered to be a "State of the Union".<ref name="CRS2"/>

What began as a communication between president and Congress has become in effect a communication between the president and the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live on most networks, preempting scheduled programming. To reach the largest audience, the speech, once given during the day, is now typically given in the evening, after 9 p.m.&nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]&nbsp;([[UTC-5]]).

==History==
[[Image:Washington - State of the Union.djvu|right|thumb|200px|[[George Washington]]'s handwritten notes for the first State of the Union Address, January 8, 1790. [[:File:Washington - State of the Union.djvu|Full 7 pages]].]]
[[George Washington]] delivered the first regular annual message before a joint session of Congress on January 8, 1790, in [[New York City]], then the provisional U.S. capital. In 1801, [[Thomas Jefferson]] discontinued the practice of delivering the address in person, regarding it as too monarchical (similar to the [[Speech from the Throne]]). Instead, the address was written and then sent to Congress to be read by a clerk until 1913 when [[Woodrow Wilson]] re-established the practice despite some initial controversy, and an in-person address to Congress has been delivered nearly every year since. However, there have been exceptions to this rule, with some messages being given solely in writing, and others given both in writing and orally (either in a speech to Congress or through broadcast media).<ref name="app" /> The last President to give a written message without a spoken address was [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1981, days before his term ended after his defeat by [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name="app">{{cite web |first=Gerhard |last=Peters |title=State of the Union Messages |publisher=The American Presidency Project |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php|accessdate = September 25, 2006}}</ref>

For many years, the speech was referred to as "the President's Annual Message to Congress".<ref name=CRSFAQ>{{cite web |first1= Michael |last1= Kolakowski  |first2= Thomas H. |last2= Neale |name-list-style= amp |title= The President's State of the Union Message: Frequently Asked Questions |work= [[Congressional Research Service]] Report for Congress |date= March 7, 2006 |url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/stateoftheunion.pdf |accessdate= January 28, 2010}}</ref> The actual term "State of the Union" first emerged in 1934 when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used the phrase, becoming its generally accepted name since 1947.<ref name=CRSFAQ/>

Prior to 1934, the annual message was delivered at the end of the calendar year, in December. The ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]] on January 23, 1933, changed the opening of Congress from early March to early January, affecting the delivery of the annual message. Since 1934, the message or address has been delivered to Congress in January or February.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The Twentieth Amendment also established January 20 as the beginning of the presidential term. In years when a new president is inaugurated, the outgoing president may deliver a final State of the Union message, but none has done so since [[Jimmy Carter]] sent a written message in 1981. In 1953 and 1961, Congress received both a written State of the Union message from the outgoing president and a separate State of the Union speech by the incoming president. Since 1989, in recognition that the responsibility of reporting the State of the Union formally belongs to the president who held office during the past year, newly inaugurated Presidents have not officially called their first speech before Congress a "State of the Union" message.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

[[Harry S. Truman]]'s 1947 address was the first to be broadcast on television.  In 1968, television networks in the United States for the first time imposed no time limit for their coverage of a State of the Union address. Delivered by [[Lyndon B.

[[Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's]] 1986 State of the Union Address was the first to have been postponed.

On January 23, 2019, the [[2019 State of the Union Address|2019 State of the Union]] speech by [[Donald Trump]], originally planned for January 29, 2019, was canceled after an exchange of letters with [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] in which she stated she would not proceed with a vote on a resolution to permit him to deliver the speech in the House chamber until the end of [[2018–19 United States federal government shutdown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/politics/donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-state-of-the-union/index.html|title=Pelosi denies Trump use of House chamber for State of the Union|last=Liptak|first=Kevin|website=CNN|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> This decision rescinded an earlier invitation from the Speaker, reportedly the first time in American history that a Speaker had "disinvited" the President from delivering the address.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-first-president-in-history-disinvited-from-delivering-state-of-the-union-2019-1|title=Trump is right, he's the first president in US history to be disinvited from delivering the State of the Union|last=Haltiwanger|first=John|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> They later agreed to hold the speech on February 5, 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/state-of-the-union-pelosi-trump.html|title=Trump to Deliver State of the Union Next Week|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|date=2019-01-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The next state of the union address delivered by [[Joe Biden]] will mark the first time two women—Vice President [[Kamala Harris]] in her role as president of the senate, and Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]]—will sit behind the president’s rostrum.

==Delivery of the speech==

Because the address is made to a joint session of Congress, the House and Senate must each pass a resolution setting a date and time for the joint session.  Then, a formal invitation is made by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] to the President typically several weeks before the appointed date.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-extends-president-obama-formal-invitation-deliver-state-union-address |title=Speaker Boehner Extends President Obama Formal Invitation to Deliver State of the Union Address |date=January 11, 2011 |work=Speaker Boehner's Press Office}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/speaker-boehner-invites-president-obama-report-state-union |title=State of the Union 2015 |date=December 19, 2014 |work=Speaker Boehner's Press Office}}</ref>

===Invitations===
Every member of Congress can bring one guest to the State of the Union address. The President may invite up to 24 guests with the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in her box. The Speaker of the House may invite up to 24 guests in the Speaker's box. Seating for Congress on the main floor is by a first-in, first-served basis with no reservations. The [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]], members of the [[Diplomatic Corps]], and the military leaders constituting the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] have reserved seating.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Customarily, one cabinet member (the [[designated survivor]]) does not attend the speech, in order to provide continuity in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] in the event that a catastrophe disables the President, the Vice President, and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber.

Both the Speaker and the Vice President sit at the Speaker's desk, behind the President for the duration of the speech. If either is unavailable, the next highest-ranking member of the respective house substitutes. Once the chamber settles down from the President's arrival, the Speaker officially presents the President to the joint session of Congress.

State of the Union speeches usually last a little over an hour, partly because of the large amounts of applause that occur from the audience throughout. The applause is often political in tone, with many portions of the speech being applauded only by members of the President's own party. As non-political officeholders, members of the Supreme Court or the Joint Chiefs of Staff rarely applaud in order to retain the appearance of political impartiality. In recent years, the presiding officers of the House and the Senate, the Speaker and the Vice President, respectively, have departed from the neutrality expected of presiding officers of deliberative bodies, as they, too, stand and applaud in response to the remarks of the President with which they agree.

==Significance==

Although much of the pomp and ceremony behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen as one of the most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] constituting the [[legislature]], the President's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] constituting the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] and [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] constituting the [[judiciary]]. In addition, the military is represented by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], while foreign governments are represented by the [[Diplomatic corps|Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]]. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans, who are typically invited by the President to sit with the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]].<ref name="Bonding"/>

==Local versions==
Certain states have a similar annual address given by the governor. For most of them, it is called the [[State of the State address]]. In Iowa, it is called the Condition of the State Address; in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the speech is called the State of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] address. The mayor of Washington, D.C. gives a State of the District address. [[American Samoa]] has a State of the Territory address given by the governor. [[Puerto Rico]] has a State Address given by the governor. In [[Guam]], the governor delivers an annual [[List of Governors of Guam#Powers and Duties|State of the Island Address]].

Some cities or counties also have an annual [[State of the City Address]] given by the mayor, county commissioner or board chair, including [[Sonoma County, California]]; [[Orlando, Florida]]; [[Cincinnati]], Ohio; [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; [[Parma, Ohio]]; Detroit, Michigan; [[Seattle]], Washington; [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Rochester, New York]]; [[San Antonio]], Texas; [[McAllen, Texas]]; and [[San Diego]], California. The Mayor of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] gives a speech similar called the State of Metro Address. Some [[university president]]s give a State of the University address at the beginning of every [[academic term]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.unh.edu/president/sotu-2015 |title=UNH State of the University 2015 |date=February 17, 2015 |work=The University of New Hampshire}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.scu.edu/president/publiccommentary/state-of-university-2015.cfm |title=State of the University 2015 |date=February 19, 2015 |work=Santa Clara University}}</ref> some elementary and secondary schools and school districts also hold a "State of the School(s)" address at the beginning of each calendar year. Private companies usually have a "State of the Corporation" or "State of the Company" address given by the respective CEO.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.inc.com/jeremy-goldman/why-your-company-deserves-a-state-of-the-union-address.html |title=Why Your Company Deserves a 'State of the Union' Address |first=Jeremy |last=Goldman |date=January 20, 2015 |work=Inc.}}</ref>

The State of the Union model has also been adopted by the [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/9/30747 |title=EU has survived economic crisis, Barroso says in first State of Union address |date=September 7, 2010 |work=EUobserver.com}}</ref> and in France since the presidency of [[Emmanuel Macron]].

==Historic speeches==
[[File:Second Bill of Rights Speech.ogv|thumb|right|250px|Roosevelt's [[Second Bill of Rights]] (excerpt)]]
* President [[James Monroe]] first stated the [[Monroe Doctrine]] during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress on December 2, 1823. It became a defining moment in the [[foreign policy of the United States]] and one of its longest-standing tenets, and would be invoked by many U.S. statesmen and several U.S. presidents, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=23|title=Monroe Doctrine (1823)|publisher=ourdocuments.gov|accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref>

Roosevelt on January 6, 1941. - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref> In an address known as the Four Freedoms speech, he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people "everywhere in the world" ought to enjoy: [[freedom of speech]] and expression, [[freedom of worship]], freedom from want, and freedom from fear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fdrfourfreedomspark.org/fdr-the-four-freedoms|title=The Four Freedoms|publisher=Four Freedoms Park Conservancy|accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref>
* During his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944, FDR proposed the [[Second Bill of Rights]]. Roosevelt's argument was that the "political rights" guaranteed by the constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] had "proved inadequate to assure us equality in the [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness|pursuit of happiness]]". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/archives/address_text.html|title=State of the Union Message to Congress|publisher=Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref> This was technically a "Message" and not a speech, as Roosevelt had "a case of the grippe" and could not come; there was no joint session, and the Clerk of the Senate read the message. (Although he did manage to read it as a Fireside Chat over the radio, from his office that same day, that still doesn't count.)<ref name=DruryS>

* During his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson introduced legislation that would come to be known as the "[[War on Poverty]]". This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national poverty rate of around nineteen percent. The speech led the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which established the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lbjlibrary.org/press/civil-rights-tax-cuts-and-the-war-on-poverty|title=President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 State of the Union Address called for a war on poverty - LBJ Presidential Library|website=www.lbjlibrary.org|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref><ref name="cnbc.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/trump-reportedly-plans-to-meet-with-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-in-vietnam-on-february-27-28.html  |title=Trump says his meeting with North Korea's Kim will be held in Hanoi

* During his State of the Union address on January 15, 1975, [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] very bluntly stated that "the state of the Union is not good: Millions of Americans are out of work...  We depend on others for essential energy. Some people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions and stick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual." Ford said he didn't "expect much if any, applause. The American people want action, and it will take both the Congress and the President to give them what they want. Progress and solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/750028.asp|title=Gerald R.

* During his [[2002 State of the Union Address|State of the Union address]] on January 29, 2002, President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] identified North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as representing significant threats to the United States. He said, "States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an [[axis of evil]], arming to threaten the peace of the world". In this speech, he would outline the objectives for the [[War on Terror]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html|title=President Delivers State of the Union Address|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>
