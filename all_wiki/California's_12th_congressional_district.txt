'''California's 12th congressional district''' is a [[congressional district]] in [[California]].

[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], has represented the district since January 2013, though she’s represented the city of San Francisco since 1987. Currently, the 12th district is entirely within [[San Francisco]], encompassing most of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maps: Final Congressional Districts |url=http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-congressional-districts.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310180458/http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-congressional-districts.html# |archive-date=March 10, 2013 |access-date=February 24, 2013 |publisher=Citizens Redistricting Commission}}</ref>

Prior to redistricting by the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]] of 2011, the district consisted of most of [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] and part of southwestern San Francisco. It is the [[List of United States congressional districts|smallest district]] by area outside [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

{{TOC limit|2}}

==History==
When the district was created after the [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]], it was located in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. As California's population grew, however, the district generally was moved northward, eventually to the San Francisco peninsula.<ref>[[California Constitution]], Article 21, Section 1(c) (congressional districts), Section 2(f) (state government districts).</ref>

[[Richard Nixon]], who would subsequently serve as the 37th [[president of the United States]], represented this district from 1947 to 1951. [[Nancy Pelosi]], the current [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]], is the current representative of the district, after previously serving [[California's 8th congressional district]] from 1993 to 2013.
