'''''Biography''''' is an American [[documentary television series]] and [[media franchise]] created in the 1960s by [[David L. Wolper]] and owned by [[A&E Networks]] since 1987. Each episode depicts the life of a notable person with narration, on-camera interviews, photographs, and [[stock footage]]. The show originally ran in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1962–1964,  and in 1979, on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] from 1987 to 2006, and on The Biography Channel (later Bio, now [[FYI (American TV channel)|FYI]]) from 2006 to 2012. After a five-year hiatus, the franchise was relaunched in 2017. Over the years, the ''Biography'' media franchise has expanded domestically and internationally, spinning off several cable television channels, a website, a children's program, a line of books and records, and a series of made-for-TV movies, specials, and miniseries, among other media properties. ''Biography'' has won a [[Peabody Award]] (1962) and three [[Emmy Awards]] (1997, 1999, 2002).

''Biography'' began as an early 1960s syndicated television series produced by David Wolper and narrated by [[Mike Wallace]]. It won a Peabody Award, launched Wallace's journalism career, and became a standard in biography films, widely shown in classrooms. After a one-year revival in 1979, the show returned on A&E Networks in 1987. In 1990, A&E began producing new episodes, and expanded the show into a multimedia franchise. By the turn of the century, ''Biography'' became A&E's "flagship" program, winning three Emmy Awards, growing from one night per week to seven, and spawning its own cable television channel, several spin-off shows, a website, made-for-TV movies, mini-series, books, audio books, records, and even a board game. The show's ratings eventually slipped and its airtime was reduced to one night per week, then exclusive to The Biography Channel (now FYI). Production of new episodes ceased in 2011 and ''Biography'' was almost entirely off the air by 2012. In 2017, A&E relaunched the ''Biography'' franchise with a series of TV specials and miniseries.

The program became popular in syndication, and in 1962, won a Peabody Award (Television Education), the first of several for both Wolper and Wallace. ''Biography'' has been credited with turning Wallace's journalism career around, and in 1963, he left to join ''[[CBS Morning News|The CBS Morning News with Mike Wallace]]'', and, later, 60 Minutes. ''Biography'' stopped releasing new episodes in 1964, although some episodes continued to be used as educational films in classrooms, became standards for filmed biographies of the persons profiled, and it played for decades in syndication.<ref name="dir" /><ref name="docu" /><ref name="films" /> The series was briefly revived for syndication in 1979 with host [[David Janssen]], profiling [[Idi Amin]] and [[Walt Disney]], among others.<ref name="dir" />

=== 1987 A&E acquisition ===
The Arts & Entertainment Network (now A&E), a joint venture started in 1984 by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], the [[Hearst Corporation]], and the [[Rockefeller Group]], acquired the broadcast rights to ''Biography'' and began airing the show on Tuesday nights at 8pm beginning on April 6, 1987, with [[Peter Graves]] as host. In the words of one observer, A&E's ''Biography'' "picked up where Wolper left off."<ref name="docu" />

In 1990, A&E acquired the rights to the ''Biography'' trademark and library, and began producing new episodes of the show, which expanded the subjects from historical figures to contemporary figures, including political leaders and popular celebrities, and which changed the program from one that reported history to one that recorded it as it unfolded. A&E also added on-camera interviews to the ''Biography'' format.<ref name="trib">{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-03-15-9903150141-story.html |title=HARRY SMITH JOINS THE FACES ON 'BIOGRAPHY' |last1=Johnson |first1=Allan |date=March 15, 1999 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115112856/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-03-15-9903150141-story.html |archive-date=November 15, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="thc">{{cite news |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2002-03-01-0203011019-story.html |title='BIOGRAPHY': A FORMULA WITH STAYING POWER |last1=Endrst |first1=James |date=March 1, 2002 |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |access-date=November 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115071450/https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2002-03-01-0203011019-story.html |archive-date=November 15, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="idc">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |publisher=[[St. James Press]] |year=2000 |volume=32 |chapter=A & E Television Networks History |access-date=November 13, 2018 |chapter-url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-e-television-networks-history/ |via=Funding Universe.com}}</ref>

In 1994, A&E expanded the show from one night per week to five (every weeknight at 8pm) and commissioned over 100 hours of new programming. Journalist [[Jack Perkins (reporter)|Jack Perkins]] joined the show as an alternate host along with Graves. For the 1995–96 season, A&E expanded ''Biography'' again, adding a sixth night, ''Biography This Week'', which profiled someone from the previous weeks' news, such as [[Yitzak Rabin]], [[George Burns]], and [[Gene Kelly]].<ref name="dir" /><ref name="thc" /><ref name="idc" />

In the mid-1990s, A&E expanded ''Biography'' into a [[media franchise]], including multiple cable channels, a website, a monthly magazine, home videos, books for adults and children, audiobooks, music CDs, CD-ROMs, several spin-off shows, mini-series, and made-for-TV movies, and even a board game called "Who Am I? The Biography Game."<ref name="trib" /><ref name="thc" />

In January 1995, A&E launched [[The History Channel]], followed in November by [[History Channel (UK)|The History Channel U.K.]], which included a British version of ''Biography'' with a British host.
