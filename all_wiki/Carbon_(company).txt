== Products ==
Carbon is a vertically integrated manufacturer that offers its own software, hardware, and materials products that leverage Digital Light Synthesis™,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbon3d.com/|title=Carbon - The Future of 3D Manufacturing Printers & Systems|website=Carbon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> or DLS™, technology to produce isotropic end-use parts.

=== Hardware ===
Carbon hardware uses the same basic principles of DLS™ to produce isotropic parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbon3d.com/hardware/|title=Hardware|website=Carbon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> All of Carbon’s hardware offerings are available as a subscription that includes service, support, and software upgrades. Different models have different build areas for building either more parts or larger parts. All the devices are connected to the [[Cloud computing|cloud]] by default to allow for [[predictive maintenance]], remote monitoring and control, and over-the-air software updates.

=== M1 Printer ===
The Carbon M1 printer was Carbon’s first offering, which has since been replaced by the M2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/carbon-reinforces-dental-drive-with-launch-of-m2d-3d-printer-new-materials-and-software-149779/|title=Carbon reinforces dental drive with launch of M2d 3D printer, new materials and software|date=2019-02-25|website=3D Printing Industry|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> as Carbon’s general-purpose printing device. It could produce parts sized up to 144 millimeters x 81 millimeters x 330 millimeters, with the light engine display [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] using 75μm pixels. The printer supports using a variety of resin materials, including some already in production commercial applications.<ref name="2016-ASTested">{{cite web |url=http://www.tested.com/tech/3d-printing/570365-meet-carbon-m1-super-fast-3d-printer/|title=Meet the Carbon M1 Super Fast 3D Printer|author=Fameli, Joey|publisher=Adam Savage's [[Whiskey Media#Tested|Tested.com]]|date=2016-05-16|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>

=== M2 Series Printer ===
The Carbon M2 printer can produce parts larger than the original M1 printer, up to 189mm x 118mm x 326mm, with the same 75μm resolution. The M2d is an entry-level device for dental labs<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carbon3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Carbon_Dental_Solutions.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529054715/https://www.carbon3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Carbon_Dental_Solutions.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-29  |title=Revolutionizing Dental Labs |date=April 2019 |website=Carbon.com}}</ref> with the same base hardware as the M2 except for a smaller build area for lower throughput. The M2d printer is upgradable to an M2 printer.

=== Smart Part Washer ===
The Smart Part Washer machine washes, serializes, and data-scans parts to automatically record production information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/16/carbon-moves-into-high-volume-manufacturing-with-speedcell-system-and-bigger-3d-printers/|title=Carbon moves into high-volume manufacturing with SpeedCell system, and bigger 3D printers – TechCrunch|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=March 6, 2017|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>

=== L1 Printer ===
The L1 printer offers 10 times the build area of the original M1 printer for high-volume production. It is offered as part of a complete manufacturing solution tailored to the application, such as the Adidas 4D midsoles<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adidas.com/us/4D|title=Adidas 40: Feel the Future|last=|first=|date=May 28, 2019|website=Adidas.com |access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref> or the Riddell SpeedFlex Precision Fit Diamond Edition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbon3d.com/riddell/|title=#ProtectItAll - Introducing Riddell® Diamond Technology powered by Carbon®|website=Carbon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>

== Materials ==
All Carbon materials are sold as a liquid resin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbon3d.com/case-studies/adidas/|title=The perfect fit: Carbon + adidas collaborate to upend athletic footwear|website=Carbon|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> Each material is cured by UV light, which defines the overall geometry, and the engineering-grade resins have a secondary thermal cure, which sets the final material properties. Prototyping and modeling resins undergo only the UV cure.
