{{Politics of Scotland}}
The '''Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament''' ({{lang-gd|Oifigear-Riaghlaidh}}, {{lang-sco|Preses o the Scots Pairlament}}) is the [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]].  They are [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament]] elected by the Scottish Parliament by means of an [[exhaustive ballot]], and is ''ex officio'' the head of the [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]].  He is considered a figurehead of the Scottish Parliament and holds an office in [[Queensberry House]].

The office of the Presiding Officer was established by an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. The current Presiding Officer is [[Ken Macintosh]], who was elected on 12 May 2016, following the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]].

==Office==
The Presiding Officer presides over the Parliament's debates, determining which members may speak, and maintains order during debate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6651101.stm |title=Q&A: Holyrood presiding officer |first=Andrew |last=Black |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=14 May 2007}}</ref> The Presiding Officer is expected to be strictly non-partisan, with some similarities in this respect to the tradition of the [[Speaker of the  House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the  House of Commons]]. For this reason, they renounce all affiliation with their former political party for the duration of their term.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/inside-politics/former-scottish-parliament-presiding-officers-devolution-years |title=Former Scottish Parliament Presiding Officers on the devolution years |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> They do not take part in debate, or vote except to break ties.  Even then, the convention is that when the Presiding Officer uses their tie-breaking vote, they do so in favour of advancing debate, but on final ballots, retaining the status quo. The Presiding Officer is also assisted in their duties by 2 deputies. They have the same powers as the Presiding Officer but they keep their party affiliation but remain impartial when presiding.

In 2006 the St Andrews Fund for Scots Heraldry commemorated the hosting of the [[International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences|Heraldic & Genealogical Congress]] in Scotland by commissioning a ceremonial robe for the Presiding Officer to wear, however as of May 2017, it appears no Presiding Officer has worn the robe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2010/presiding-officers-gown/|title=The Presiding Officer’s Gown  {{!}}  andrewcusack.com|last=Cusack|first=Andrew|date=3 June 2010|website=www.andrewcusack.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref>

The [[Scottish National Party]] proposes that in the event of [[Scottish independence|independence]], the Presiding Officer's post be replaced with that of [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor of Scotland]]. In addition to presiding over the Scottish Parliament, the Chancellor would possess additional constitutional powers during the absence of the Monarch from Scotland; chiefly, the Chancellor should act in a role similar to a [[Governor-General]] in the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s.<ref>
