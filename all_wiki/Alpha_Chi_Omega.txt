== History ==
[[File:Alpha Chapter AXO 1885.jpg|thumb|Alpha Chapter at Depauw University, 1885|alt=|left]]
Alpha Chi Omega was formed at [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]] on October 15, 1885.<ref name="AboutAXO">{{cite web |url=http://www.alphachiomega.org/about_axo/main.asp |title=About ΑΧΩ |publisher=Alpha Chi Omega |accessdate=2008-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424114157/http://www.alphachiomega.org/about_axo/main.asp |archive-date=2008-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the fall of 1885, Professor [[James Hamilton Howe]], the first Dean of the [[DePauw University#Music|Music School]], invited seven young women from the school to a meeting with the purpose of forming a fraternity. Those young women were Anna Allen Smith, Olive Burnett Clark, Bertha Deniston Cunningham, Amy DuBois Rieth, Nellie Gamble Childe, Bessie Grooms Keenan, and Estelle Leonard.<ref name="AboutAXO" /> Howe collaborated with James G. Campbell, a [[Beta Theta Pi]], to form a national fraternity. Campbell laid out the first constitution and by-laws.  This first constitution read: "The object of this fraternity is as follows: To attain the highest musical culture and to cultivate those principles that embody true womanhood."<ref name="HistoryofAX">{{cite book|title=History of Alpha Chi Omega Fraternity (1885–1921)|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofalphach00armsuoft|last=Armstrong|first=Florence A.|author2=Mabel Harriet Siller|publisher=Alpha Chi Omega Fraternity|year=1922|edition=3}}</ref>  On February 26, 1886, the fraternity was given its formal introduction by a soiree musical.<ref name="HistoryofAX" />

Alpha Chi Omega joined the National Panhellenic Conference in 1903.

=== Early musical requirements ===
Association with the music school was required early on, as the fraternity only allowed School of Music students. Later on, this was changed and the minimum requirement became registration in one music course of any kind. Members then graduated in many other departments of the university, including the liberal arts department.<ref name="HistoryofAX" /> In 1889, a national literary fraternity offered to merge with Alpha Chi Omega; however, unlike professional fraternities, Alpha Chi never considered taking members of other fraternities.<ref name="HistoryofAX" /> In its early years it was externally considered to be a professional music society,<ref>{{cite book|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|year=1898|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVMPNd0AefUC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The cyclopædia of fraternities, a compilation of existing authentic information and the results of original investigation as to more than six hundred secret societies in the United States|first=Albert C.|last=Stevens|url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopdiaoffra00stevrich|year=1899|page=347| ol=23292199M |quote=Alpha Chi Omega– Professional (Music) Society}}</ref> but due to disagreement with this designation, in 1900, the sorority added literary qualifications, which led to it being considered a general (social) sorority by 1905.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|edition=6|year=1905|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SArAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>

=== Beginnings of philanthropy ===
In 1911, Alpha Chi Omega began supporting the [[MacDowell Colony]], as [[Marian MacDowell]] was an alumna of Alpha Chi Omega.<ref name="phil">{{cite web|url=http://www.alphachiomega.org/foundation/about_foundation/history.asp|title=About Chi Omega Foundation History|publisher=Alpha Chi Omega|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615145827/http://www.alphachiomega.org/foundation/about_foundation/history.asp|archive-date=2008-06-15|url-status=dead|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> During World War I and II Alpha Chi Omega offered its support by helping working mothers who were married to service men by providing day nurseries and helping orphaned French children. In 1947, Alpha Chi Omega adopted [[Easter Seals (US)|Easter Seals]] as its philanthropy and supported other projects associated with [[cerebral palsy]].<ref name="phil" />

In 1978, the fraternity created the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation to merge funds for the fraternity's philanthropic projects and educational programming into one nonprofit organization.<ref name="phil" /> In 1992, the fraternity voted adopt a new primary philanthropy of supporting victims of domestic violence.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alphachiomega.org/meet-us/make-a-difference/domestic-violence-awareness/|title=DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS|website=Alpha Chi Omega|access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.alphachiomega.org:80/foundation/philanthropic_projects/domestic_violence.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607084503/http://www.alphachiomega.org/foundation/philanthropic_projects/domestic_violence.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-06-07|title=Foundation [ Domestic Violence ]|date=2007-06-07|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref> Alpha Chi Omega was the first major organization to speak out and adopt Domestic Violence Awareness as their philanthropy. Alpha Chi Omega continues to support Easter Seals.

== Symbols ==

Alpha Chi Omega's Founders chose "[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]" (Α), the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], because they were forming the first fraternity in the school of music. Since they thought they might also be founding the last such fraternity, "[[Omega (letter)|Omega]]" (Ω) seemed appropriate, considering it stands for the end. "[[Kai (conjunction)|Kai]]", meaning "and", was added to form "the beginning and the end". "Kai" was soon changed to "[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]" (Χ), a letter of the Greek alphabet.<ref name="AboutAXO" />

Alpha Chi Omega's colors of [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet red]] and [[Olive (color)|olive green]] were chosen to commemorate the fraternity's [[Autumn|fall]] founding.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alphachiomegaunl.com/about-us.html |title=Alpha Chi Omega – About Us |access-date=2016-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323174230/http://www.alphachiomegaunl.com/about-us.html |archive-date=2016-03-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The fraternity's official symbol is a three-stringed [[lyre]]<ref>[http://www.alphachiomega.org/ Alpha Chi Omega<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the official flower is a red [[carnation]], which exemplifies the fraternity's colors. There is no official stone. The badge (pin) worn by initiated members is in the shape of a [[lyre]], typically featuring pearls and the fraternity's Greek letters on the crossbar. Alpha Chi Omega chose the lyre to be their official symbol since it was the first instrument played by the Gods on Mount Olympus. Although Alpha Chi Omega no longer is strictly a musical sorority, they are still connected to their musical heritage through their symbol of the lyre.

The new member badge (pin) worn by uninitiated members is a [[lozenge]] emblazoned with the symbol of a lyre and the sorority's colors of scarlet red on the upper half of the badge and olive green on the lower half of the badge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/203154633160553567/|title=New member pin {{!}} Chi omega, Alpha chi, Alpha chi omega|website=Pinterest|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

== Philanthropy ==
The fraternity manages its philanthropy through its nonprofit arm, the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation. This branch continues to grant funds to the fraternity's former partners, the [[MacDowell Colony]] and [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]], as well as to services and programs for domestic violence victims and on education on the subject.<ref name=":1" /> The Foundation also helps to support members and those closely related to Alpha Chi Omegas through other funds and grants to ensure continuous support for its members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alpha Chi Omega Foundation |url=http://www.alphachiomega.org/foundation/main.asp |publisher=Alpha Chi Omega |accessdate=2007-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811061442/http://www.alphachiomega.org/foundation/main.asp |archive-date=2007-08-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Individual chapters focus their attention on increasing the awareness of [[domestic violence]], its effects on individuals, families, and children, as well as actively aiding victims of domestic violence through hands-on activities and service projects.  This work is done through local agencies, which [[undergraduate]] and [[alumnae]] chapters support physically and financially. Local agencies include [[rape]] crisis centers, [[emergency shelter]]s and safe houses for victims of domestic violence and their children, and long-term assistance centers for battered women across the nation.

As of 2018 Alpha Chi Omega is partnered with [[Mary Kay]], [[Allstate]] Foundation Purple Purse, The One Love Foundation, [[Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network|RAINN]], and [[It's On Us]], various organizations which also support domestic/sexual violence awareness and education and survivor support.<ref name=":0" /> The fraternity also supports [http://www.kristinsstory.com/ Kristin's Story] in cooperation with [[Delta Delta Delta]], a nonprofit set up by the Delta Delta Delta mother of an Alpha Chi Omega member who committed suicide following a sexual assault.<ref>[http://www.kristinsstory.com/ Kristin's Story<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Membership ==
There are 194 chapters of Alpha Chi Omega at colleges and universities in the United States. There are also 279 alumnae chapters, which allow women of all post-graduate ages to come together and continue the mission and values of Alpha Chi Omega. Collegiate chapters work directly with alumnae chapters to link sisters from around the country. In addition, alumnae chapters continue the cause of working to eliminate domestic violence. The fraternity states its membership values as "academic interest, character, financial responsibility, leadership, and personal development."[[File:The founders of AXO.jpg|thumb|The founders of Alpha Chi Omega]]
