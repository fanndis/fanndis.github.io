The '''Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize''' was established in 1990 by [[UNESCO]]:

:"to honour living individuals and active public or private bodies or institutions that have made a significant contribution to promoting, seeking, safeguarding or maintaining peace in conformity with the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and the Constitution of UNESCO."

The prize bears the name of [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], the late former dictator of [[Côte d'Ivoire]], who served from independence in 1960 until his death in 1993.  It is awarded annually.  The prize includes a cheque of USD 150,000, a gold medal and a peace diploma. If there are multiple recipients, the cheque is shared equally.
