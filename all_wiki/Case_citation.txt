[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[United States Reports]]'' is the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]

'''Case citation''' is a system used by legal professionals to identify past [[court case]] decisions, either in series of books called [[Reporter (law)|reporters]] or [[law report]]s, or in a neutral style that identifies a decision regardless of where it is reported. Case citations are formatted differently in different [[jurisdiction]]s, but generally contain the same key information.

A '''legal citation''' is a "reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position."<ref>{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2012|publisher=West|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-314-26578-4|edition=9th Abridged|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|page=221}}</ref> Where cases are published on paper, the citation usually contains the following information:
* Court that issued the decision
* Report title
* Volume number
* Page, section, or paragraph number
* Publication year

In some report series, for example in England, Australia and some in Canada, volumes are not numbered independently of the year: thus the year and volume number (usually no greater than 4) are required to identify which book of the series has the case reported within its covers. In such citations, it is usual in these jurisdictions to apply square [[bracket]]s "{{bracket|year}}" to the year (which may not be the year that the case was decided: for example, a case decided in December 2001 may have been reported in 2002).

The Internet brought with it the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on websites and most published court decisions now appear in that way.  They can be found through many national and other websites, such as [[WorldLII]] and [https://www.africanlii.org/ AfricanLII], that are operated by members of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

The resulting flood of non-paginated information has led to numbering of paragraphs and the adoption of a medium-neutral citation system. This usually contains the following information:
* Year of decision
* Abbreviated title of the court
* Decision number (not the court file number)
Rather than utilizing page numbers for pinpoint references, which would depend upon particular printers and [[Web browser|browser]]s, pinpoint quotations refer to paragraph numbers.

==Pronunciation of case titles==

In [[common law]] countries with an [[adversarial system]] of justice, the names of the opposing parties are separated in the case title by the abbreviation ''v'' (usually written as ''v'' in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and always as ''v.'' in the U.S.) of the Latin word ''versus'', which means ''against''. When case titles are read out loud, the ''v'' can be pronounced, depending on the context, as ''and'', ''against'', ''versus'', or ''vee''.

===Commonwealth pronunciation===

Some Commonwealth countries{{which|date=May 2020}} follow English legal style:

* [[Civil law (common law)|Civil cases]] are pronounced with ''and''. For example, ''Smith v Jones'' would be pronounced "Smith {{em|and}} Jones".<ref name=":0">[[SOAS University of London|School of Oriental & African Studies]] (SOAS) Library, ''[http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf Understanding UK Case Law]'', Research Guide (London: SOAS Library, August 2012), pp. 5–6. 'The small letter “v” is an abbreviation of versus. However, the term “and” is used to pronounce it, rather than “v” or “versus”, e.g. the case “Smith v Jones” would be pronounced “Smith and Jones.” . . . A [criminal] case can be pronounced in a number of ways, e.g. “R. v Smith” would be pronounced either “the Crown against Smith”, or it can be referred to as simply “Smith.” '</ref>
* [[Criminal law|Criminal cases]] are pronounced with ''against''. For example, ''R v Smith'' would be pronounced "the Crown {{em|against}} Smith".<ref name=":0" /> The Latin words ''Rex'', ''Regina'', and ''versus'' are all rendered into English.
* In Australia and the United Kingdom, ''versus'' and ''vee'' are arguably incorrect.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Melbourne University Law Review Association|title=Australian Guide to Legal Citation|date=2010|isbn=9780646527390|page=43|edition=3rd|url=http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc|quote=In speech, the 'v' between the parties' names is rendered 'and' in a civil action and 'against' in a criminal action both in Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not pronounced 'versus' as it is in the United States of America.}}</ref>

===American pronunciation===

In the United States, there is no consensus on the pronunciation of the abbreviation ''v.'' This has led to much confusion about the pronunciation and spelling of court cases:<ref name="nyt1989">{{cite news|title=On Language: Child's Garden of Vs.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/magazine/on-language-child-s-garden-of-vs.html|agency=The New York Times|date=June 4, 1989}}</ref>

* ''Versus'' is most commonly used, leading some newspapers to use the common abbreviation ''vs.'' in place of the legal abbreviation ''v.''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kuttner|first1=Robert|title=How the Airlines Became Abusive Cartels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/how-the-airlines-became-abusive-cartels.html|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2017|quote=Today’s auction system on oversold flights, ironically, is the stepchild of a 1976 Supreme Court case, Nader vs. Allegheny, in which the late and little lamented Allegheny Airlines (known to its long suffering passengers as Agony Airlines) picked the wrong passenger to bump.}}</ref>
* ''Vee'' is also heard but is not as common.{{cn|date=September 2020}}
* ''Against'' is a matter of personal style. For example, [[Warren E. Burger]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] preferred to announce cases at the Supreme Court with ''against''.<ref name=oyez_betamax>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1687|title=''Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.''|quote=Warren E. Burger: Before we hear the arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City Studios ...}}</ref><ref name=oyez_smith>{{cite web|title=''Smith v. Massachusetts''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-8661|website=Oyez|quote=John Paul Stevens: We'll hear argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts.}}</ref>
* ''And'' is used by some law professors, but other law professors regard it as an affectation.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

During [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the participants demonstrated the lack of consensus on the pronunciation of "''v.''", using different pronunciations. Solicitor General [[Ken Starr]] even managed to use all three of the most common American pronunciations interchangeably:<ref name=oyez_casey>{{cite web|title=''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey''|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744|website=Oyez|access-date=27 December 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|text=[[Ken Starr|Kenneth W. Starr]]: This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe ''versus'' Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold ''against'' Connecticut. ... Well, I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe ''vee'' Wade.}}

==Australia==
Legal citation in Australia generally mirrors the methods of citation used in [[England]]. A widely used guide to Australian legal citation is the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (commonly known as AGLC), published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

The standard case citation format in Australia is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]''
| (1992)
|
| 175
| CLR
|
| 1.
|}

As in Canada, there has been divergence among citation styles. There exist commercial citation guides published by Butterworths and other legal publishing companies, academic citation styles and court citation styles. Each court in Australia may cite the same case slightly differently. There is presently a movement in convergence to the comprehensive academic citation style of the [[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]] published jointly by the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]''.

===Neutral citation===
Australian courts and tribunals have now adopted a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.  Most cases are now published on AustLII using neutral citations.<ref name="austlii">[http://austlii.edu.au Austlii.edu.au]</ref>

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|HCA
|1
|}
So the above-mentioned ''Mabo'' case would then be cited like this: ''Mabo v Queensland (No 2)'' [1992] HCA 23.

There is a unique court identifier code for most courts.  The court and tribunal identifiers include:
{| class="wikitable"

==Canada==

=== ''The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' ===
There are a number of citation standards in Canada. Many legal publishing companies and schools have their own standard for citation. Since the late 1990s, however, much of the legal community has converged to a single standard—formulated in ''[[The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation|The Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la référence juridique]]'',<ref>''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation / Manuel canadien de la référence juridique'', 9th ed. (Carswell, 2018-06-29), {{ISBN|978-0-7798-8582-4}}.</ref> commonly known as the "[[McGill Guide]]" after the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', which first published it. The following format reflects this standard:

:''[[Hunter v. Southam|Hunter v Southam]]'', [1984] 2 SCR 145.

Broken into its component parts, the format is:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court.
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.|R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]'',
|
| [1985]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 295.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''[[R. v. Oakes|R v Oakes]]'',
|
| [1986]
| 1
| SCR
|
| 103.
|
|- valign="top"
| ''Re Canada Trust Co and OHRC''
| (1990),
|
|69
|DLR
|(4th)
|321
|(Ont CA).
|}

The ''Style of Cause'' is italicized as in all other countries and the party names are separated by ''v'' (English) or ''c'' (French). Prior to 1984 the appellant party would always be named first. However, since then case names do not switch order when the case is appealed.

Undisclosed parties to a case are represented by initials (e.g., ''[[R. v. R.D.S|R v RDS]]''). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by ''R'' for ''Regina'' (queen) or ''Rex'' (king). [[reference question|Reference questions]] (advisory opinions) are always entitled ''Reference re'' followed by the subject title.

If the year of decision is the same as the year of the report and the date is a part of the reporter's citation, then the date need not be listed after the ''style of cause''. If the date of the decision is different from the year of the report, then both should be shown.

Where available, cases should be cited with their neutral citation immediately after the ''style of cause'' and preceding the print citation. For example,

:''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 SCR 791.

This format was adopted as the standard in 2006, in the sixth edition of the McGill Guide. Prior to this format, the opposite order of parallel citation was used.

The seventh edition of the McGill Guide, published 2010-08-20, removes most full stop/period (".") characters from the citations, e.g., a citation to the Supreme Court Reports that previously would have been [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, is now [2005] 1 SCR 791. Most full stops are also removed from styles of cause. The seventh edition also further highlights the significance of neutral citations (i.e., tribunal-assigned citations that are publisher-independent).

== Denmark ==
Denmark has no official standard or style guide governing case citation. However, most case citations include the same elements.

=== Published decisions ===
Citations of decisions published in a [[Law report|reporter]] usually consist of the ''name or abbreviation of the reporter'', the ''year or volume'', the ''page number'' where the decision begin (sometimes followed by an ''identifying number'' if more than one judgment is on a page), as well as the ''name or abbreviation of the court which decided the case''. As an example, the "Aalborg Kloster-judgment", a precedent-setting [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] judgment regarding [[strict liability]], is published in [[Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen]] volume 1968 as the second judgment on page 84. A citation of this case could take the form {{Nowrap|U.1968.84/2H}}, {{Nowrap|UfR 1968 84/2 H}}, {{Nowrap|Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 1968, p. 84/2}}, or something similar. In this case ''U'', ''UfR'' and ''Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen'' identify the reporter, ''1968'' identifies the year or volume, ''84'' identifies the starting page, ''/2'' indicates that the judgment is the second one on that particular page, and ''H'' identifies the court which decided the case.

Certain reporters, such as Tidsskrift for Skatter og Afgifter, do not identify published decisions by page number, but by a [[serial number]]. Citations to these reporters use the serial number in place of a page number.

=== Unpublished decisions ===
If a decision has not been published in a reporter, more identifying information is needed. Generally, citations to unreported cases involve the ''name of the court'', the ''date of the decision'' and the ''case number'' assigned by the court. For example: Sø- og Handelsrettens dom af 3. maj 2018 i sag nr. V-17-17 (The [[Maritime and Commercial Court (Denmark)|Maritime and Commercial Court]]'s judgment of May 3 in case no. V-17-17). Certain authors format these citations to mimic the "short citation" of published cases.

=== Neutral citations and the ECLI ===
The [[Danish Court Administration]] is currently working on a public database which will make all judgments available to the public (currently only the Supreme Court as well as the Maritime and Commercial Court do this). The database is expected to implement the [[European Case Law Identifier]], which will make uniform, neutral citations of decisions possible.

==Germany==
{{main|German legal citation}}
In Germany there are two types of citation: the full citation of a case and its shortened form. In e.g. scientific articles, the full citation of a particular case is only used at its first occurrence; after that, its shortened form is used. In most law journals, the articles themselves only use the shortened form; the full citations for all articles sometimes are summarized at the beginning of that journals edition.

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the [[European Case Law Identifier]], a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the [[Council of the European Union]] in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

===Federal Constitutional Court of Germany===
The most important cases of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] are published by the court in its official collection. This collection is abbreviated ''BVerfGE'', whereas ''BVerfG'' is short for ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'', the German court name, and ''E'' stands for ''Entscheidung'' (decision).

Starting in 2004, the court also publishes the BVerfGK collection, containing decisions made only by a ''Kammer'', a specific part of the court.

The so-called [[:de:Volkszählungsurteil|Volkszählungsurteil]] for example could be cited
:BVerfGE 65, 1 (43), Urteil des Ersten Senats vom 15. Dezember 1983 auf die mündliche Verhandlung vom 18. und 19. Oktober 1983, Az. 1 BvR 209, 269, 362, 420, 440, 484/83.

For the meaning of the different case numbers of the BVerfG see [[:de:Aktenzeichen#Verwendete Aktenzeichen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts|the German article]].

If decisions are not yet published by the court, or will not be published at all, law journals can be cited, e.g.,
:BVerfG, NJW 2009, 1234 (1235 f.).
Where ''NJW'' stands for the law journal [[:de:Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|Neue Juristische Wochenschrift]], 2009 is the year, 1234 the page of the beginning and 1235 the cited page(s) – "f." stands for "seq.". In general, citations of the official collections are preferred.

The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] (Bundesgerichtshof, short BGH) publishes the official collections ''[[:de:BGHSt|BGHSt]]'' for decisions in [[penal law]] and ''[[:de:BGHZ|BGHZ]]'' for those in [[private law]].

The [[:de:Katzenkönigfall|Katzenkönigfall]] e.g. would be cited
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff., Urteil des 4. Strafsenats vom 15. September 1988, Az. 4 StR 352/88.
in full and
:BGHSt 35, 347 ff.
in short (in this example, not a specific page but the case as such is cited; "ff." means "sqq.").

===Other federal courts===
The official collection of the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court of Germany]] (Bundessozialgericht, BSG) is abbreviated ''BSGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] (Bundesfinanzhof, BFH) is ''BFHE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]] (Bundesarbeitsgericht, BAG) is ''BAGE''.

The official collection of the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany]] (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) is ''BVerwGE''.

===Other courts===
For other courts, generally the same rules apply, though most do not publish an official collection, so they must be cited from a law journal.

===European Case Law Identifier===
According to the [[European Case Law Identifier|ECLI]] system the ''Volkszählungsurteil'' would be cited as 
:ECLI:DE:BVerfG:1983:rs19831215.1bvr020983
and the ''Katzenkönigfall'' as 
:ECLI:DE:BGH:1988:150988U4STR352.88.0

==India==
India's vast federated judicial system admits to a large number of reporters, each with their own style of citation. There are over 200 law reports in India – subject-wise and state (province)-wise, authorized and unauthorized.

===Supreme Court of India===
The official reporter for Supreme Court decisions is the Supreme Court Reports. These reports however lag behind other journals in the speed of reporting. While decisions themselves are uploaded by the Supreme Court itself on ''www.courtnic.nic.in'', the edited versions with headnotes in the official reporter take years to compile. However, some reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is an old and respected reporter that, in addition to the Supreme Court, also reports decisions of the various State High Courts. Other popular reporters include ''Supreme Court Cases'', which has become the most cited report in the Supreme Court, the ''Supreme Court Almanac'', and ''Judgements Today''.

[[File:All India Reporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''All India Reporter'']]

''[[Sebastian Hongray v. Union of India]]'':
* AIR 1984 SC 571 – "AIR" refers to the ''All India Reporter'', "1984" is the year of judgement (AIR does not use a volume-based classification), "SC" refers to the Supreme Court of India, and "571" is the first page number of the report within the volume;
* (1984) 1 SCC 339 – "1984" is the year of publication, "1" is the volume number of the reporter, "SCC" stands for ''Supreme Court Cases'' (the name of the reporter), and "339" is the first page number of the report within the volume; and
* 1984 Cri LJ 289 (SC) – "1984" is the year of publication, "Cri LJ" is an abbreviation for the ''Criminal Law Journal'' (the name of the reporter), and "289" is the first page number of the report within the volume. The "SC" in parentheses indicates that the case was heard by the Supreme Court.

A citation of the "Supreme Court Almanac":
* ''[[Additional Secretary, Government of India v. Alka Subhash Gadia]]'' (1990) 2 Scale 1352

A citation in "Judgements Today":
* ''[[Premium Granites v. State of Tamil Nadu]]'' JT (1994) 1 SC 374

The "Supreme Court Cases (SCC)" published supplementary reports for a few years in the early 1990s. Those citations looked like this:
* ''[[Federation of Mining Associations v. State of Rajasthan]]'' 1992 Supp (2) SCC 239, which points to page 239 of the Second Supplementary Volume of the SCC reports in the year 1992. From 1996 the Supplementary Volumes were numbered in sequence after the regular volumes.

The SCC also have a separate series of subject-based reporting of the decisions of the Supreme Court:
* ''[[Rathinam Nagbhushan Patnaik v. Union of India]]'' 1994 SCC (Cri) 740, which refers to the SCC Criminal Reports
* ''[[Delhi Transport Corporation v. Mazdoor Congress]]'' 1991 SCC (L&S) 1213, which refers to the SCC Labour & Services Reports

===High Courts===
The ''All India Reporter'' (AIR) is the most popular nationwide reporter for decisions of the High Courts. An AIR High Court citation looks like: ''[[Surjya Kumar Das v. Maya Dutta]]'' AIR 1982 Cal 222, where "Cal" refers to the [[Calcutta High Court]] in [[Kolkata]]. This is a uniform style for AIR High Court reports. Only the shortened indicator of the forum changes for different High Courts. ''The Calcutta Weekly Notes'' is the oldest continuously published [[law journal]] in India having uninterrupted publication since 1896 reporting reportable decisions of the High Court at Calcutta. Reports are cited in the style 105 CWN 345 where 105 refers to the volume number calculated at one volume per year from the initial volume, which had been published in 1896. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]])===

National Judicial Reference System ([[NJRS]]) is a project started by the Income-tax Department, Government of India. It has been envisaged as a tool to achieve efficiency in the tax litigation process of Income Tax Department (ITD). Within this project the Judicial Research & Reference System (JRRS) – JRRS is a repository of judicial orders as a single, indexed, searchable, cross-linked, database of Judgments / orders of ITAT, Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), HC and SC.

The Citation nomenclature followed within [[NJRS]] :
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

This Citation further allows to add the Authority where the judgment / order was pronounced.
* ''[[Chandra Ranganathan & Ors. v. Commissioner of Income-tax]]'' 2009-LL-1021-SC, which refers to [[NJRS]] citations.

==New Zealand==
The standard case citation format in New Zealand is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision)
! [year of reporter]
! volume
! reporter
! page
|- valign="top"
| ''Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board''

| NZLR
| 394
|- valign="top"
|  ''R v Howse''
| (2005)
|
| 21
| CRNZ
| 823
|}

Several leading law reviews in New Zealand have also adopted the ''[[Australian Guide to Legal Citation]]'' (AGLC) such as the ''[[University of Canterbury|Canterbury]] Law Review''. The AGLC style is also rather similar to citation style in New Zealand.

===Reporters===

|}

Additionally, a number of other report series exist for specialist areas such as Family, Employment and Tax Law. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Neutral citation===
New Zealand courts and tribunals have begun to adopt a neutral citation standard for case law. The format provides a naming system that does not depend on the publication of the case in a law report.

The standard format looks like this:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Year of decision
!Court identifier
!Ordinal number
|- valign="top"
|[2005]
|NZSC
|1
|}

There is a unique court identifier for each court or tribunal.  These identifiers are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Court Identifier
!Court
!Years
|- valign="top"
|NZSC
|[[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]
| 2005–
|- valign="top"
|NZCA

| NZEnvC
|[[Environment Court of New Zealand]]
| 2010–
|- valign="top"
| NZFC
|[[Family Court of New Zealand]]
| 2012–
|}

Where both a neutral citation and a reporter citation exist, the neutral citation should come first e.g. ''R v AM'' [2010] NZCA 114, [2010] 2 NZLR 750

==Norway==
The Norwegian standard case citation format for published court decisions is:

:Rt. 1952 s. 989 ''(Telefonsjikanedommen)''

where:

* '''Rt.''' identifies the report series.
** All [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court judgments]] are published in Retstidende (Court Times), abbreviated Rt.
** Many judgments and decisions from lower courts are published in Rettens gang (RG).
* '''1952''' is the year of reporter
* '''s.''' is the Norwegian abbreviation for page. This is optional.
* '''989''' is the first page number of the decision in the reporter.
* Finally, one can add the popular name of the decision. It is unusual to refer to name of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s), but often there is an unofficial name. ''Telefonsjikanedommen'' refers to a 1952 case where the Supreme Court ruled that telephone harassment ("telefonsjikane") was not illegal under the current criminal code.

==Philippines==
Despite the long-standing [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition in the Philippines, reliance on judicial precedents has become indispensable since the period of American rule. [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decisions are expressly recognized as part of the internal law, and are thus frequently cited in court decisions and legal pleadings. Though there is only one Supreme Court in the Philippines, the citation of its decisions varies, depending on which reporter of a case is relied on by the person citing that case.

=== Supreme Court ===

==== ''Philippine Reports''{{Anchor|Official reporter}} ====
The ''Philippine Reports'' is the official reporter of decisions of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uW-bBQAAQBAJ&q=philippine+reports+official+Supreme&pg=PA116|title=Philippines Constitution and Citizenship Law Handboook - Strategic Information and Basic Laws|date=2013-04-04|publisher=IBP, Inc|isbn=978-1-4387-7966-9|language=en}}</ref> The standard format for citation of the ''Philippine Reports'' is:

:''People v. Flores'', 442 Phil. 561 (2002)

where:

* ''People v. Flores'' is the name of the case
* ''442'' is the volume number of the ''Philippine Reports'' where the case may be found
* ''Phil.'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Philippine Reports''
* ''561'' is the page number in the ''Philippine Reports'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''442 Phil. 561, 563''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found
* ''(2002)'' is the year the case was decided.

As of present,{{When|date=June 2020}} Philippine cases are contained in quarterly issues.The Supreme Court Reports Annotated or SCRA are cited as such:

Juarez v. Court of Appeals 214 SCRA 475

where 214 is the volume of the book, and 475 is the page number. There are already over 700 SCRAs in circulation.

==== ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' {{Anchor|Unofficial reporter}} ====
In the last few decades,{{When|date=June 2020}} the ''Philippine Reports'' has suffered from production problems, resulting in long delays in publication, as well as significant gaps within its published series. As a result, the privately published ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' (published by Central Professional Books, Inc.) has become more widely used than the ''Philippine Reports'', even by the courts. The proper format for citation of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' is:

:''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1998, 289 SCRA 624

where:

* ''Fortich v. Corona'' is the name of the case
* ''G.R. No. 131457'' is the case docket number originally assigned by the Supreme Court at the time the action was filed with the Court (G.R. stands for General Register)<ref>{{Cite act|type={{abbr|A.M.|administrative matter}}|index=10-4-20-SC|date=May 4, 2010|article=II.6.4|article-type=Part|legislature=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|title=The Internal Rules of the Supreme Court|url=https://lawphil.net/courts/supreme/am/am_10-4-20-sc_2010.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hodder|first=Rupert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQ3GBAAAQBAJ&q=G.R.+%22General+Register%22+%22Philippines%22&pg=PA91|title=High-level Political Appointments in the Philippines: Patronage, Emotion and Democracy|date=2013-10-08|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-981-4560-05-4|pages=91|language=en}}</ref>
* ''24 April 1998'' is the exact date the decision of this case was promulgated
* ''289'' is the volume number of the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' where the case may be found
* ''SCRA'' is the standard abbreviation of ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated''
* ''624'' is the page number in the ''Supreme Court Reports Annotated'' that contains the beginning of the decision. If this number is followed by a comma then another page number (i.e., ''289 SCRA 624, 627''), the latter number indicates the particular page where the annotated text can be found

When citing cases not yet reported in the SCRA or ''Philippine Reports'', the above citation without reference to the SCRA is preferred (i.e., ''Fortich v. Corona'', G.R. No. 131457, 24 April 1988)

===Lower court decisions===
As there are no official or unofficial reporters that regularly publish decisions of the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and other lower courts, citation of their decisions hews to the same format as cases not reported either in the Philippine Reports or the SCRA. Thus: (case name), (docket number), (date of promulgation of decision). For the Court of Appeals, docket numbers begin as CA-G.R. No., followed by either CR for criminal, CV for civil, and SP for the "Special Cases Section".<ref>{{Cite web|year=1999|title=Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (IRCA)|url=https://lawphil.net/courts/appeals/rc_1-16_appeals.html|access-date=2020-06-14|website=The LawPhil Project|publisher=Court of Appeals}}</ref>

==Switzerland==
Citations vary by court and by language. Cases of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] are cited as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Schweizerisches Bundesgericht - Zitierregeln|url=https://www.bger.ch/index/juridiction/jurisdiction-inherit-template/jurisdiction-zitierregeln.htm|website=Swiss Federal Supreme Court|access-date=28 April 2018|language=de}}</ref>

Officially published cases are cited as ''BGE 133 II 292 [E. 3.2 S. 296]'' (German: ''Bundesgerichtsentscheide'') or ''ATF 133 II 292 [consid. 3.2 p. 296]'' (French: ''arrêts du tribunal fédéral''). In this example, 133 is the annual issue of the court reports, II the part indicating the division of the Court, and 292 the page on which the decision begins. Optionally, "E. 3.2" and "S. 296" are the section and page specifically cited.

Supreme Court decisions not selected for official publication are cited as ''Urteil [des Bundesgerichts] 5C.260/2006 vom 30. März 2007'' or ''arrêt [du Tribunal fédéral] 5C.260/2006 du 30 mars 2007'' respectively. In this example, 5C is the division of the Court, 260 the case number and 2006 the year in which the case was opened.

The citation style for cases of the inferior [[federal courts of Switzerland]] is similar.

==United Kingdom==

===Neutral citation===
{{main|British and Irish Legal Information Institute#Case citations}}
Since 2001, judgments in the House of Lords, Privy Council, Court of Appeal and Administrative Court have been issued with neutral citations. This system was extended to other parts of the High Court in 2002. Judgments with neutral citations are freely available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website (www.bailii.org).
	
Neutral citations identify judgments independently of any series of reports, and cite only parties, year of judgment, court and case number. For example, <br />''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20 <br/>identifies the 20th judgment in 2002 in the UK House of Lords. UKHL stands for UK House of Lords. EWHC and EWCA identify the England and Wales High Court and Court of Appeal respectively. These abbreviations are generally followed by an abbreviation indicating the court or division (e.g. Admin, Ch, Crim, Pat).

===How to cite a case===
{{see also|Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities}}
If a neutral citation is available for a judgment, it should immediately follow the party names. If the judgment has also been reported in a law reports series, follow the neutral citation with the ''best report'', which is usually from the official Law Reports series (Appeals Cases – AC, Chancery – Ch, Family – Fam, Queen's Bench – QB etc.).

The case of ''Rottman v MPC'' was reported in the Appeals Cases, so the citation should be:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692.

This means that a report of the case and the judgment can be found in the 2002 volumes, vol 2, of the Law Reports series called Appeals Cases, beginning at page 692.

To cite a particular paragraph from the judgment, add the paragraph number in square brackets at the end of the citation:
*''Rottman v MPC'' [2002] UKHL 20, [2002] 2 AC 692 [58].

If a case is not reported in the Law Reports, the next best report is the Weekly Law Reports (e.g. [2002] 2 WLR 1315), and then the All England Reports (e.g., [2002] 2 All ER 865). In some situations, it might be preferable to cite a specialist series, e.g., ''Rottman v MPC'' was also cited in the Human Rights Law Reports, at [2002] HRLR 32.

For cases before 2001, cite the best report. If referring to a particular page of the judgment, give that page number after the page number on which the report begins. The following citation refers to page 573 of the ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' judgment:

*''Donoghue v Stevenson'' [1932] AC 562, 573.
*See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150617084928/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/published/oscola.shtml Oxford Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities]

===England and Wales===
The standard case citation format in [[England and Wales]] is:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Style of cause''
! (year of decision),
! [year of report]
! volume
! report
! (series)
! page
! jurisdiction/court
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''
|
| [1932]
| 
| AC
|
| 562
| (HL).
|-valign="top"
|''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''
|(1884)
|
|14
|QBD
|
|273.
|
|}

In [[England and Wales]] as with certain Commonwealth countries, the abbreviation "R" for ''rex'' (king) or ''regina'' (queen), is used for cases in which the state is a party (typically criminal cases or [[judicial review]] cases).

[[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|Square brackets]] "[ ]" are used when the year is essential to locating the report (e.g., the official law reports either—as with ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', above—do not have volume numbers or, if there are multiple volumes in a single year, they are numbered 1, 2, etc.). [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|Round brackets]] "( )" are used when the year is not essential but is useful for information purposes, e.g., in reports that have a cumulative volume number such as ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', above.

===Law Reports===
The term "reporter", meaning a law report or a series of them, is not widely used in England and Wales. Before 1865, English courts used a large number of privately printed reports, and cases were cited based on which report they appeared in. (This system was also used in the United States and other common law jurisdictions during that period.)

Two main unofficial law reports report all areas of law: the ''Weekly Law Reports'' (WLR) and the ''All England Reports'' (All ER). In addition, a number of unofficial specialist law reports focus on particular areas, e.g., ''Entertainment and Media Law Reports'' (EMLR) or the ''Criminal Appeal Reports'' (Cr App R).

For the citation of "The Law Reports" of the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, see [[Law Reports]]. These have been published since 1865. They have always been split into a number of different series, the current series being the Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), and Queen's Bench (QB) (or King's Bench—KB—depending on the monarch of the time). These four series are cited in preference to all others in court.

The Supreme Court has issued a practice note on the use of neutral citation. The ''[[Scots Law Times]]'' is cited as "SLT".<ref>''Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice'' (1999), p. xix.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>

==United States==
The standard case citation format in the United States is:
:''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
where:
*''Roe v. Wade'' is the abbreviated name of the case. Generally, the first name (here, ''Roe'') is the surname of the [[plaintiff]], who is the party who filed the suit for an original case, or the [[appellant]], the party appealing in a case being appealed from a lower court, or the [[petitioner]] when litigating in the [[Supreme court|high court]] of a jurisdiction; and the second name (here, ''Wade'') is the surname of the [[defendant]], the party responding to the suit, or the [[appellee]], the party responding to the appeal, or the [[respondent]], when defending in the high court of the jurisdiction. Litigants are generally referred to by their last name (when they are natural persons), and a case is generally referred to by the first named litigant on each side of the case. In this example, ''Roe'' refers to "[[Jane Roe]]," a pseudonym commonly used when it is appropriate to keep the identity of a litigant out of the public spotlight, and ''Wade'' refers to [[Henry Wade]], the [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney at the time.
*410 is the volume number of the "[[Reporter (law)|reporter]]" that reported the Court's written opinion in the case titled ''Roe v. Wade''.
*U.S. is the abbreviation of the reporter, or printed book of court opinions. Here, "U.S." stands for ''[[United States Reports]]''.
*113 is the page number (in volume 410 of ''United States Reports'') where the opinion begins.
*1973 is the year when the court rendered its decision.
*The abbreviated name of the court is included inside the parenthesis before the year if the name of the court is not obvious from the reporter. This rule comes into play because certain reporters, such as members of the West [[National Reporter System]], publish opinions originating from multiple courts.  In this example, the name of the court (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in ''United States Reports'') and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.

Case citations are used to find a particular case, both when looking up a case in a printed reporter and when accessing it via the Internet or services such as LexisNexis or Westlaw.

This format also allows different cases with the same parties to be easily differentiated. For example, looking for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Miller v. California]]'' would yield four cases, some involving different people named Miller, and each involving different issues.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
Cases from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] are officially printed in the ''[[United States Reports]]''. A citation to the ''United States Reports'' looks like this:

*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
*''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

Many court decisions are published in more than one reporter. A citation to two or more reporters for a given court decision is called a "parallel citation". For U.S. Supreme Court decisions, there are several unofficial reporters, including the [[National Reporter System|''Supreme Court Reporter'']] (abbreviated S.&nbsp;Ct.) and ''United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition'' (commonly known simply as ''Lawyers' Edition'') (abbreviated L.&nbsp;Ed.), which are printed by private companies and provide further annotations to the opinions of the Court. Although a citation to the latter two is not required, some attorneys and legal writers prefer to cite all three case reporters at once:

*''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965)

The "2d" after the L.&nbsp;Ed. signifies the second series of the ''Lawyers' Edition''. United States case reporters are sequentially numbered, but the volume number is never higher than 999. When the 1,000th volume is reached (the threshold in earlier years was lower), the volume number is reset to 1 and a "2d" is appended after the reporter's abbreviation. Some case reporters are in their third series, and a few are approaching their fourth.

Some very old Supreme Court cases have odd-looking citations, such as ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). The "(1 Cranch)" refers to the fact that, before there was a reporter series known as the ''United States Reports'' compiled by the Supreme Court's [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]], cases were gathered, bound together, and sold privately by the Court's Reporter of Decisions. In this example, ''Marbury'' was first reported in an edition by [[William Cranch]], who was responsible for publishing Supreme Court reports from 1801 to 1815. Such reports, named for the individual who gathered them and hence called "[[nominative reports]]", existed from 1790 to 1874. Beginning in 1874, the U.S. government created the ''United States Reports'', and at the same time simultaneously numbered the volumes previously published privately as part of a single series and began numbering sequentially from that point. In this way, "5 U.S. (1&nbsp;Cranch)" means that it is the 5th overall volume of the ''United States Reports'' series, but the first that was originally published by [[William Cranch]]; four volumes of opinions prior to that were (for example) published by [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]] (for example, "4 U.S. (4 Dall.)"), and after Cranch's 9 volumes, 12 more were published by [[Henry Wheaton]] (e.g., "15 U.S. (2&nbsp;Wheat.)"). See the [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions]] for other edition names. The name of the reporter of decisions has not been used in citations since the U.S. government began printing the ''United States Reports''.

When a case has been decided, but not yet published in the case reporter, the citation may note the volume but leave blank the page of the case reporter until it is determined. For example, ''Golan v. Holder,'' 565 U.S. 302 (2012) was properly cited as ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', {{nowrap|565 U.S. ___ (2012)}} before publication.

In the caption of a Supreme Court case, the first name listed is the name of the petitioning (appealing) party, followed by the party responding (respondent) to the appeal.  In most cases, the appealing party was the losing party in the prior court.  This is no longer the practice used in cases in the federal courts of appeal, in which the original alignment of parties from the lower court is preserved.

===Lower federal courts===
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]
[[United States court of appeals]] cases are published in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (F., F.2d, or F.3d). [[United States district court]] cases and cases from some specialized courts are published in the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, or F. Supp. 3d). Both series are published by [[Thomson West]]; they are technically unofficial reporters, but have become widely accepted as the ''de facto'' "official" reporters of the lower federal courts because of the absence of a true official reporter. (Of the federal appeals and district courts, only one, the [[D.C. Circuit]], has an official reporter, ''United States Court of Appeals Reports'', and even that one is rarely used today.)<ref>D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1 provides: "Citations to decisions of this court must be to the Federal Reporter. Dual or parallel citation of cases is not required."</ref>

When lower federal court opinions are cited, the citation includes the name of the court. This is placed in the parentheses immediately before the year. Some examples:

*''[[Geary v. Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary School]]'', 7 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 1993) – a 1993 case in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]
*''[[Glassroth v. Moore]]'', 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002) – a 2002 case in the [[U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]]

U.S. circuit and district court cases from 1789 to 1880 were reported in [[Federal Cases]], abbreviated F. Cas. An example of the citation form is: ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486).

===State courts===
State court decisions are published in several places. Many states have their own official state reporters, which publish decisions of one or more of that state's courts. Reporters that publish decisions of a state's highest court are abbreviated the same as the state's name (note: this is the traditional abbreviation, not the postal abbreviation), regardless of what the actual title of the reporter is.  Thus, the official reporter of decisions of the [[California Supreme Court]] (titled ''California Reports'') is abbreviated "Cal." (or, for subsequent series, "Cal. 2d," "Cal. 3d", or "Cal. 4th").

*''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.]]'', 248 N.Y. 339 (1928), a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], reported in ''New York Reports''. Note that the New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. Because the ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Green v. [[Chicago Tribune]] Company'', 286 Ill. App. 3d 1 (1996) – a case in the [[Illinois Appellate Court]], reported in ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports''. Note that, in contrast to New York, the Illinois Appellate Court is only the [[List of state intermediate appellate courts|intermediate court of appeals]] in Illinois; decisions of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] are reported in ''Illinois Reports'', abbreviated "Ill." (or "Ill. 2d"). Because the ''Illinois Appellate Court Reports'' are dedicated solely to reporting decisions of the Illinois Appellate Court, there is no need to repeat the court designation before the year.
*''Harte v. Hand'', 438 N.J. Super. 545 (Ch. Div. 2014). Note that although all published opinions of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]] are published in the ''New Jersey Superior Court Reports'', the organization of the Superior Court into three divisions (the Law Division, the Chancery Division, and the [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]) means the citation must specify which division issued the opinion. This is especially salient as the Appellate Division hears appeals from the Law and Chancery Divisions, as occurred with the example case (a rehearing on remand of ''Harte v. Hand'', 433 N.J. Super. 457 (App. Div. 2013)).

[[File:National Reporter System regions.png|thumb|400px|right|The [[Thomson West]] National Reporter System regions.]]
In addition to the official reporters, [[Thomson West]] publishes several series of "regional reporters" that cover several states each. These are the ''[[North Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Atlantic Reporter]]'', ''[[South Eastern Reporter]]'', ''[[Southern Reporter]]'', ''[[South Western Reporter]]'', ''[[North Western Reporter]]'', and ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''. [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] also each have their own line of Thomson West reporters, because of the large volume of cases generated in those states (titled, respectively, ''West's California Reporter'', ''Illinois Decisions'', and ''West's New York Supplement'').  Some smaller states (like [[South Dakota]]) have stopped publishing their own official reporters, and instead have certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their "official" reporter.

Here are some examples of how to cite West reporters:

*''Jackson v. Commonwealth'', 583 S.E.2d 780 (Va. Ct. App. 2003) – a case in the [[Virginia Court of Appeals]] (an intermediate appellate court) published in the ''South Eastern Reporter'''s 2nd series
*''Foxworth v. Maddox'', 137 So. 161 (Fla. 1931) – a case in the [[Florida Supreme Court]] published in the ''Southern Reporter''
*''People v. Brown'', 282 N.Y.S.2d 497 (N.Y. 1967) – a case in the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (New York's highest court) published in  ''West's New York Supplement'''s 2nd series. The case also appears in West's regional reporter: ''People v. Brown'', 229 N.E.2d 192 (N.Y. 1967). Note, in both forms, that "N.Y." is placed in the parenthetical, because both ''West's New York Supplement'' and the ''North Eastern Reporter'' report the opinions of more courts than only the New York Court of Appeals. A citation to the officially published reports, ''People v. Brown'', 20 N.Y.2d 238 (1967), however, does not require the court name in the parenthetical, because the official ''New York Reports'' only report opinions of the New York Court of Appeals.

Abbreviations for lower courts vary by state, as each state has its own system of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts. When a case appears in both an official reporter and a regional reporter, either citation can be used. Generally, citing to the regional reporter is preferred, since out-of-state attorneys are more likely to have access to these. Many lawyers prefer to include both citations. Some state courts require that parallel citations (in this case, citing to both the official reporter and an unofficial regional reporter) be used when citing cases from any court in that state's system.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Like the United States Supreme Court, some very old state case citations include an abbreviation of the name of either the private publisher or the [[reporter of decisions]], a state-appointed officer who originally collected and published the cases. For example, in ''Hall v. Bell'', 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843), the citation is to volume 47 of ''Massachusetts Reports'', which, like ''United States Reports'', was started in the latter half of the 19th century and incorporated into the series a number of prior editions originally published privately, and began numbering from that point; "6 Met." refers to the 6th volume that had originally been published privately by [[Theron Metcalf]]. An example of a case cited to a reporter that has not been subsequently incorporated into an officially published series is ''[[Pierson v. Post]]'', 3 Cai. 175 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1804), reported in volume 3 of ''Caines' Reports'', page 175, named for [[George Caines]], who had been appointed to report New York cases; the case was before the New York Supreme Court of Judicature (now defunct). Most states gave up this practice in the mid-to-late 19th century, but [[Delaware]] persisted until 1920.

Some states, notably [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have their own citation systems that differ significantly from the various federal and national standards.<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/New_Styman.htm "New York Law Reports Style Manual"]</ref> In California, the year is placed ''between'' the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter; in New York, the year is wrapped by in [[Bracket#Square brackets .5B .5D|bracket]]s instead of [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]. Both New York and California styles wrap an entire citation in parentheses when used as a stand-alone sentence, although New York places the terminating period outside the parentheses, whereas California places it inside. New York wraps just the reporter and page references in parentheses when the citation is used as a clause. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Either way, both state styles differ from the national/[[Bluebook]] style of simply dropping in the citation as a separate sentence without further adornment. Both systems use less punctuation and spacing in their reporter abbreviations.

For example, assuming that it is being placed as a stand-alone sentence, the ''Brown'' case above would be cited (using the official reporter) to a New York court as:

*(''People v. Brown'', 20 NY2d 238 [1967]).

And, again, as a stand-alone sentence, the famous ''Greenman'' [[product liability]] case would be cited to a California court as:

*(''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 Cal.2d 57.)<ref>[http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/59C2d57.htm ''Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.'' (1963) 59 C2d 57<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Unpublished decisions===
{{main|Non-publication}}
A growing number of court decisions are not published in case reporters.  For example, only 7% of the opinions of the California intermediate courts (the [[California Court of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]]) are published each year. This is mainly because judges certify only significant decisions for publication, due to the massive number of frivolous appeals flowing through the courts and the importance of avoiding [[information overload]].<ref>''Schmier v. Supreme Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/78CA4t703.htm 78 Cal. App. 4th 703] (2000). The plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully challenged the selective publication policy as unconstitutional. The court retorted: "Appellant either misunderstands or ignores the realities of the intermediate appellate process." The court went on to describe the variety of frivolous appeals regularly encountered by the Courts of Appeal, and concluded: "Our typical opinions in such cases add nothing to the body of stare decisis, and if published would merely clutter overcrowded library shelves and databases with information utterly useless to anyone other than the actual litigants therein and complicate the search for meaningful precedent."</ref>

It is also argued that this is in part because in many states, especially California, the legislature has failed to expand the judiciary to keep up with population growth (for various political and fiscal reasons). To deal with their crushing caseloads, many judges prefer to write shorter-than-normal opinions that dispose of minor issues in the case in a sentence or two. They avoid publishing such abbreviated opinions, however, so as not to risk creating bad [[precedent]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Attorneys have several options in citing "unpublished" decisions:
* For cases that have not been published or put in an electronic database, or very recently decided cases that have not ''yet'' been published or put in an electronic database, a citation to the case's docket number before the court that decided it is required.
**''Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.'', No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977) – a decision of the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]; the docket number and specific date allow a researcher to track down the printed copy maintained by the court if needed (legal citation forms strongly prefer citations to traditional printed resources).
* Even though only some decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal are considered "published" (those appearing in ''Federal Reporter''), Thomson West has recently started making available all decisions officially considered "unpublished" in a separate publication called ''Federal Appendix'' (abbreviated "F. App'x").
* Cases intentionally left officially unpublished are nonetheless often "published" on computer services, such as [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]]. These services have their own citation formats based on the year of the case, an abbreviation indicating the computer service (or a specific database of that computer service), and an identification number; citations to online databases also usually include the case's [[docket (court)|docket]] number and the specific date when it was decided (due to the preference for citation to traditional printed resources). Examples include:
**''[[Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Beattie]]'', No. 03-3587, 2004 WL 2495842 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2004) – a case found on the Westlaw electronic database, decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 03-3587), and a citation to the electronic database that indicates the date of decision, the database (WL for Westlaw) and a unique serial number in that database (2495842).
**''[[Chavez v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n]]'', No. 3:02CV458(MRK), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. Conn. June 1, 2004) – a case decided by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]]; the citation includes the case's original docket number (No. 3:02CV458(MRK)), the date of decision, the database (U.S. Dist. LEXIS, indicating the LexisNexis database for U.S. District Court cases), and a unique serial number in that database (11266).

Some court systems—such as the [[California]] state [[Judiciary of California|court system]]—forbid attorneys to cite unpublished cases as precedent. Other systems allow citation of unpublished cases only under specific circumstances. For example, in [[Kentucky]], unpublished cases from that state's courts can only be cited if the case was decided after January 1, 2003, and "there is no published opinion that would adequately address the issue before the court".  From 2004 to 2006, federal judges debated whether the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] (FRAP) should be amended so that unpublished cases in all circuits could be cited as precedent. In 2006, the Supreme Court, over the objection of several hundred judges and lawyers, adopted a new Rule 32.1 of FRAP requiring that federal courts allow citation of unpublished cases. The rule took effect on January 1, 2007.

===Vendor-neutral citations===
With the rise of the web, many courts placed new cases on websites.  Some were published while others never lost their "unpublished" status. The major legal citation systems required cites to the officially published page numbers, in which publishers such as [[West Publishing]] claimed a copyright interest.

A vendor-neutral citation movement<ref>[http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions AALL Citation Formats Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209023521/http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Leadership-Governance/Committees/taskforce.html#Definitions |date=2015-02-09 }}; accessed May 31, 2014.</ref> led to provisions being made for citations to web-based cases and other legal materials. A few courts modified their rules to specifically take into account cases "published" on the web.

An example of a vendor-neutral citation:
*''[[Equal. Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati]]'', 1997 FED App. 0318P (6th Cir.) – a 1997 case decided by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]; the citation to the numbering system adopted by the court ("1997 FED App. 0318P") eliminates the need to cite to a specific vendor's product, in this case [[West (publisher)|Thomson West]]'s ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (i.e., 128 F.3d 289).

===Pinpoint citations===
In practice, most lawyers go one step farther, once they have developed the correct citation for a case using the rules discussed above. Most court opinions contain holdings on multiple issues, so lawyers need to cite to the page that contains the specific holding they wish to invoke in their own case. Such citations are known as pinpoint citations, "pin cites", or "jump cites".<ref name="Putnam">{{cite book |last1=Putnam |first1=William H. |title=Legal Research, Analysis and Writing |date=2010 |publisher=Delmar |location=Clifton Park, NY |isbn=9781428304420 |page=295 |edition=2nd |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Legal_Research_Analysis_and_Writing/M0nlVU6M26AC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA295&printsec=frontcover |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

For example, in ''Roe v. Wade'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the word "person" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn.  That particular holding appears on page 158 of the volume in which the ''Roe'' decision was published.  A full pin cite to ''Roe'' for that holding would be as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158 (1973).

And a parallel cite to all three U.S. Supreme Court reporters, combined with pin cites for all three, would produce:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 729, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 180 (1973).

But in its opinions, the Court usually provides a direct pin cite only to the official reporter. The two unofficial reporters, when they reprint the Court's opinions, add on parallel cites to each other, but do not add pin cites.  Therefore, a citation to ''Roe v. Wade'' in a later Supreme Court decision as viewed on Lexis or Westlaw would appear as follows:

* ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113, 158, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973).

Even then, such citations are still quite lengthy, and may look quite mysterious and intimidating to laypersons when they read court opinions. Since the 1980s, there has been an ongoing debate among American judges as to whether they should relegate such lengthy citations to footnotes to improve the readability of their opinions, as strongly urged by [[Bryan A. Garner]], one of the leading authors on [[legal writing]] and style.<ref name="Garner">{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |title=The Winning Brief: 100 Tips for Persuasive Briefing in Trial and Appellate Courts |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199378357 |pages=176–182 |edition=3d}}</ref> Most judges do relegate ''some'' citations to footnotes, but jurists such as Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] and Judge [[Richard Posner]] refuse to use footnotes in their opinions.

===Types of citations===
There are two types of citations: proprietary and [[public domain]] citations. There are many citation guides; the most commonly acknowledged is called ''[[The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', compiled by the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. ''Public domain citations'' refer to the official reporters, rather than a publication service such as [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], particular legal journals, or specialization-specific reporters. States with their own unique style for court documents and case opinions also publish their own style guides, which include information on their citation rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
