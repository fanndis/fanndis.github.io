The host unit at Andrews is the [[316th Wing]], assigned to the [[Air Force District of Washington]]. It is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). The 316th Wing also provides installation security, services and airfield management to support the President, Vice President, other U.S. senior leaders and more than 50 tenant organizations and federal agencies. 

The 316th Wing provides security, personnel, contracting, finance and infrastructure support for 5 Wings, 3 Headquarters, more than 80 tenant organizations, 148 geographically separated units, 6,500 Airmen in the Pentagon, as well as 60,000 Airmen and families in the national capital region and around the world. The 316th Wing supports contingency operations in the capital of the United States with immediate response rotary-assets. It also provides security for the world's highest visibility flight line and is responsible for ceremonial support with the United States Air Force Band, Honor Guard and Air Force Arlington Chaplaincy.<ref>[https://www.jba.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/2216129/316th-wing/]</ref>

The airfield had {{convert|5500|ft}} runways by 1944 when the [[90th Fighter Control Squadron]] was formed (28 March 1944),{{r|Mueller}} and the last Camp Springs combat units (e.g., [[535th Fighter Escort Squadron]]) departed for World War II combat on 10 April 1944.<ref>Maurer, Maurer.

===Andrews Field===
'''Andrews Field''' was named on 7 February 1945 in honor of [[Frank Maxwell Andrews|Lt Gen. Frank Andrews]] and in 1946, Andrews was a sub-base of [[Bolling Field]] (3 January 1946 – 20 November 1946){{r|Mueller}}. [[Strategic Air Command]] headquarters transferred from Bolling Field to Andrews. The command of CONAF's [[Radar Bomb Scoring]] detachments (e.g., at [[Dallas Love Field]]) transferred to Andrews on 17 March 1946 when the "[[3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group#Andrews Field|263 AAF BU" was assigned (transferred 23 February 1948)]] to [[Carswell AFB]]).{{r|Mueller}}

Andrews was transferred from the Army to the Air Force in 1947, and it was a [[Headquarters Command]] installation from 1947 through 1952 and again after 1957.{{Dubious|reason=Headquarters Command wasn't designated until 17 March 1958|date=October 2013}} Headquarters Military Air Transport Service controlled the base during the interim period. The year 1947 marked the arrival of the first permanently assigned jet-powered aircraft, the [[F-80 Shooting Star]], at Andrews. The long-lived and versatile training version of the F-80, the T-33, still played an important role in proficiency flying programs at Andrews more than 30 years later.

===Andrews Air Force Base===
[[File:FMApic2.jpg|thumb|left|Andrews AFB and Joint Base Andrews are named for [[Lieutenant General]] [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] (1884–1943), former Commanding General of United States Forces in the World War II [[European Theater of Operations]]. General Andrews organized and commanded the General Headquarters, Air Force (1935–1939), and at the time of his death on 3 May 1943 in the crash of a [[B-24 Liberator]] in Iceland, he was Commanding General, United States Forces, European Theater of Operations.]]
'''Andrews Air Force Base''' was designated on 24 June 1948, and in June 1950, Andrews rapidly became involved in combat readiness training for [[B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber crews. Combat readiness training and proficiency flying for military pilots assigned non-flying duties in the Washington area have remained two key elements in the local mission since the establishment of the base.  HQ Air Research and Development Command (later, [[Air Force Systems Command]]) moved to Andrews from [[Baltimore]], 24 June 1958. With the construction of new facilities beginning in 1959, Andrews had become by early 1962 the primary USAF flight installation serving the Washington, DC, area with the closing of the runway at [[Bolling AFB]].

Andrews' air defense role was strengthened in the 1950s with the latest in fighter-interceptor hardware appearing on the flight line. [[F-94 Starfire]]s, [[F-102 Delta Dagger]]s and finally, [[F-106 Delta Dart]]s formed the backbone of the three fighter interceptor squadrons which operated from the base until 1963.<ref>Ravenstein, Charles A. ''Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947–1977''. [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]]: Office of Air Force History 1984. {{ISBN|0-912799-12-9}}.</ref>{{Verify source|date=October 2013}}

In the late 1950s Andrews began an annual open house and air show on base. This event later evolved into the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Joint Services Open House, an annual event that now brings more than 700,000 visitors to the base every year. The open house is held every year over Armed Forces Day weekend.

In the years since 1959, Andrews' flight operations and importance have increased greatly. In 1961, the last of the Military Air Transport Service's flying units at Washington National Airport transferred to Andrews. This was followed a year later by the transfer to Andrews of all fixed-wing flying activities from [[Bolling Air Force Base]]. Andrews has become firmly established as the main port of entry for foreign military and government officials en route to Washington and the United States. In July 1961, the official presidential aircraft was stationed here, known as "Air Force One" when the president is on board. Before 1961, the presidential airplane had been kept at Washington National Airport and Bolling AFB.

In 1963, the Naval Air Facility (NAF), originally established at the former NAS Anacostia in 1919, moved to Andrews. The NAF handles Naval VIP flight operations. The Marine Corps detachment that flies the [[FA-18 Hornet]] is located here.

In a major reorganization, Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, was disbanded 1 July 1976, restructured under the [[Military Airlift Command]] as the [[76th Airlift Division]] and transferred its headquarters from Bolling AFB to Andrews. The 76th remained the parent unit of the Andrews host command, redesignated as the 1st Air Base Wing.

In October 1977, the 76th Airlift Division became the 76th Military Airlift Wing. The 1st Air Base Wing was redesignated the 76th Air Base Group, and the 89th Military Airlift Wing became the 89th Military Airlift Group. The 76th MAW remained the parent unit at Andrews. On 15 December 1980, the [[76th Airlift Division]] was reestablished, the 76th Air Base Group became the 1776th Air Base Wing and the 89th Military Airlift Group became the 89th Military Airlift Wing. On 1 October 1985, the 76th Airlift Division was inactivated as the result of activation of the Headquarters [[Air Force District of Washington]] at [[Bolling AFB]]. The 1776th Air Base Wing was designated the "host wing" for Andrews AFB and assumed base support responsibilities.

During [[Operation Desert Storm]], Andrews handled 16,540 patients in makeshift hospital facilities located in the base tennis center.
[[File:And-c-32-89aw.jpg|thumb|A C-32, a specially configured version of the [[Boeing 757]]-200 commercial intercontinental airliner (89th Airlift Wing)|alt=|left]]On 12 July 1991, the 89th Military Airlift Wing was redesignated as the [[89th Airlift Wing]] and assumed duties as the host wing at Andrews AFB. Support functions previously performed by the 1776th Air Base Wing now fall under the 89th and the 1776th was inactivated. With the consolidation of the two wings, the newly formed 89th Airlift Wing is one of the largest wings in [[Air Mobility Command]] with a work force approaching 9,000 people.

Known as "The President's Wing," the [[89th Airlift Wing]] continues to contribute to Andrews' rich history as the elite [[Air Mobility Command]] wing for transporting VIPs around the world. Not only does Andrews provide service for America's senior officials, but also kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, popes, and local and foreign military leaders make Andrews AFB their first stop in the United States.

On 5 January 2005 the Air Force reactivated the [[Air Force District of Washington]] (AFDW) as the single Air Force voice for planning and implementing Air Force and joint solutions within the National Capital Region (NCR). This event brought with it significant changes at Andrews. On 12 May 2006, the [[89th Medical Group]] at Andrews and the 11th Medical Group, [[Bolling Air Force Base]], [[Washington, D.C.]] combined into the [[79th Medical Wing]] where it established its headquarters at Andrews. In June 2006, the 316th Wing stood up under the command of AFDW as the new host unit for Andrews Air Force Base and its nearly 50 tenant units to include organizations from the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Air Force Reserve Command]], [[Air National Guard]], [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]], [[Marine Corps Reserve]] and the [[Civil Air Patrol]]. The activation of the 316th prompted the transfer of the 1st Helicopter Squadron from the 89th Airlift Wing to the 316th Operations Group. In May 2007 the AFDW, as well as the 844th Communications Group, transferred from Bolling AFB to Andrews AFB.

===Merger===

The merger was effective from 1 October 2009, when the joint base was established, with the US Air Force being the lead organization providing management and support services for both installations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jba.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/336385/naf-washington-history/|title=NAF Washington History|website=Joint Base Andrews|publisher=US Air Force|language=en-US|access-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>

Although sharing parallel runways, NAF Washington was originally considered a separate air installation and maintained a separate Navy/Marine Corps–unique FAA airfield identifier of NSF and an ICAO airfield identifier of KNSF.  Prior to merging, these separate airfield identifiers were discontinued on 29 March 2009 and all flight operations in and out of NAF Washington now use the Andrews AFB airfield identifiers of ADW and KADW as appropriate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afdw.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123148293 |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629202523/http://www.afdw.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123148293 |archive-date=29 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
