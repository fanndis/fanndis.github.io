The [[Brenninkmeijer family]] owns the C&A group through its Swiss company [[Cofra Group|Cofra Holding AG]]. The company's success has led the family to be among the wealthiest in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nisnews.nl/dossiers/royal_house/061103_1309.htm |title=Brenninkmeijers Still Netherlands' Richest Family |date=6 November 2003 |publisher=NIS News |accessdate=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308232726/http://www.nisnews.nl/dossiers/royal_house/061103_1309.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Brenninkmeijer family, however, live in [[Geneva]] and [[Zug]], Switzerland.

==History==
The company was founded, in Sneek, by brothers Clemens and August [[Brenninkmeijer family|Brenninkmeijer]] in 1841 as a Dutch textile company, taking its company name from their initials. In 1906 Clemens' son, Bernard Joseph, started discounting in Amsterdam ([[Contribution margin-based pricing#Use in Retail: Rekenen in Centen, in Plaats van Procenten|''Rekenen in Centen, in plaats van Procenten'']]) and by 1910 there were ten stores in the Netherlands. These were from the German Brenninkmeyer family that traded in linen and textiles since the 17th century from its hometown of [[Mettingen]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-and-a.com/uk/en/corporate/company/about-us/history/ |title=C&A – a success story |publisher=C&A |accessdate=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304120303/http://www.c-and-a.com/uk/en/corporate/company/about-us/history/ |archivedate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

For many years, C&A retail clothing stores were a major presence in town centres throughout the United Kingdom. C&A also opened stores in a number of out-of-town locations, such as its store at the [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], which opened in November 1989. The company's strategy of selling budget clothes from high-rent city-centre retail stores made it vulnerable to a new breed of competitors operating in cheaper, out-of-town locations, including [[Matalan]] and the rapidly expanding clothing operations of supermarket food chains such as [[Tesco]] and [[Asda]], and to expanding high street names such as [[H&M]], [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], and [[Topshop]]. C&A in the United Kingdom was a notable example of an incorporated private [[unlimited company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ |title=Company Details: C & A (company number 00524665) |publisher=United Kingdom Companies House webcheck |accessdate=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229053844/http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ |archivedate=29 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> which meant that it was not required to publish its [[financial statements]] under [[United Kingdom company law]]. In 2000, C&A announced its intention to withdraw from the British market, where it had been operating since 1922, and the last UK retail stores closed in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/792028.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=C&A quits UK | date=15 June 2000 |accessdate=20 December 2012 }}</ref> [[Primark]] bought 11 of the C&A stores.

In June 2009, the company withdrew from the Argentinian market. C&A China competes with main clothing companies such as H&M and Zara.

Singer [[Beyoncé]] released her own clothing line, [[House of Deréon|Deréon]], in cooperation with C&A in the summer of 2010.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

On 14 January 2018, [[Germany|German]] newsmagazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported on its web site that C&A's owners were considering selling the company to an unnamed [[China|Chinese]] investor. In a statement, Cofra Holding AG said that they "remain fully committed to a successful, future-proof C&A business and as such at C&A we have embarked on a transformation and growth program." Without directly mentioning the sale, they added: "The ongoing transformation of C&A includes an investigation of ways to accelerate in high growth priority areas such as China, emerging markets and digital, and that could potentially include partnerships and other types of additional external investment."<ref name="spiegel2018">{{cite news |last=Salden |first=Simone |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/c-a-steht-offenbar-vor-verkauf-an-chinesen-a-1187808.html |title=C&A steht offenbar vor Verkauf an Chinesen |language=German |trans-title=C&A is apparently on sale to Chinese |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location=Hamburg |date=2018-01-14 |accessdate=2018-01-14 }}</ref>
