== Background and release ==
Prior to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, Beyoncé had repeatedly used her platform to raise her voice against racial inequality.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Mariah|date=June 20, 2020|title=Beyonce Drops Surprise New Song 'Black Parade' in Support of Black-Owned Businesses|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/beyonce-drops-new-song-black-parade-listen/|accessdate=June 20, 2020|website=[[US Magazine]]}}</ref> A few days after the [[killing of George Floyd]], Beyoncé took to social media to demand justice for his death, urging fans and followers to sign the petition "Justice for George Floyd".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=May 30, 2020|title=Beyoncé: 'We Need Justice for George Floyd'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beyonce-george-floyd-justice-1007977/|accessdate=June 20, 2020|website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> On June 14, 2020, she issued an open letter to Kentucky Attorney General [[Daniel Cameron (Kentucky politician)|Daniel Cameron]], calling out the lack of arrests in the case of [[Shooting of Breonna Taylor|Breonna Taylor]], an unarmed Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her own home in March 2020.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mizelle|first1=Shawna|last2=Sgueglia|first2=Kristina|date=June 14, 2020|title=Beyoncé pens open letter to Kentucky attorney general demanding justice for Breonna Taylor|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/14/politics/beyonce-letter-breonna-taylor-trnd/index.html|accessdate=June 20, 2020|website=[[CNN (Cable News Network)|CNN]]}}</ref> Beyoncé urged Cameron to "take swift and decisive action in charging the officers".<ref>{{cite web|last=Folley|first=Aris|date=June 14, 2020|title=Beyoncé writes open letter calling for charges in Breonna Taylor case|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/502689-beyonce-writes-open-letter-calling-for-charges-in-breonna|accessdate=June 20, 2020|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref>

Mesfin Fekadu of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' wrote that after these events, "the world was driven to the significance of this year's [[Juneteenth]] more than ever before, and Beyoncé knew she wanted to release a song on that momentous day".<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2020-11-25|title=Amid racial reckoning, Grammys honor the Black experience|url=https://apnews.com/article/grammys-honor-black-experience-beyonce-4b6c8d5a16f262c9ebd1b2a922702900|access-date=2020-11-26|website=AP NEWS}}</ref> Co-writer and co-producer Derek Dixie explained his intention behind the song, writing: ""Black Parade" exists to give a much needed boost to a community that has been fighting for civil and equal rights in the world for centuries. "Black Parade" exists to give black people a reminder that their excellence goes beyond the stolen cultured, appropriated swagger, and underestimated intelligence and creative nature that others have both forcefully and passively taken as their own."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Login • Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref>

The song was released on June 19, 2020, which marked the 155th anniversary of [[Juneteenth]], the holiday celebrating the emancipation of those who had been [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved in the United States]] and which originated in Beyoncé's home state of Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cineas|first=Fabiola|date=2020-06-18|title=Juneteenth, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21294825/history-of-juneteenth|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref> Upon announcing the release of the single on Instagram, Beyoncé wrote: "Happy Juneteenth Weekend! I hope we continue to share joy and celebrate each other, even in the midst of struggle. Please continue to remember our beauty, strength and power. "BLACK PARADE" celebrates you, your voice and your joy and will benefit Black-owned small businesses."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Listen to Beyoncé's New Song "Black Parade"|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/06/beyonce-black-parade|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref>

All proceeds from the song benefit the BeyGOOD Black Business Impact Fund, a fund established by Beyoncé that supports black-owned small businesses in need.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=June 20, 2020|title=Beyoncé Drops Surprise New Song 'Black Parade' on Juneteenth|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beyonce-new-song-black-parade-juneteenth-1018095/|accessdate=June 20, 2020|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> As of November 25, 2020, the fund had given nearly 250 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to nearly $2.5 million donated.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BeyGOOD|url=https://m.facebook.com/beygood/photos/a.312148552529920/999651333779635/?type=3&source=54&ref=page_internal|access-date=2020-11-26|website=m.facebook.com}}</ref> Together with the song, Beyoncé launched the "Black Parade Route" initiative that highlights black-owned businesses and creatives.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-20|title=Beyonce Gives Praise To The Ancestors With ’Black Parade’|url=https://uproxx.com/music/beyonce-black-parade/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=UPROXX|language=en-US}}</ref>
Dixie noted that they could have delayed the release of the song in order to release it together with Beyoncé's visual album and film ''[[Black Is King]]'' on July 31 in order to capitalize off of it, however they "really wanted to get it out during a time where we could all remember the feeling and the energy". Dixie added:<ref name=":3" /><blockquote>It's not always about the money and about catching streaming numbers and things like that. Sometimes it’s just about what it is — which was making our people proud... It's just good to see that she's willing to put that type of energy out and not necessarily be thinking about: 'What's going to guarantee me a No. 1? What’s going to guarantee me this?' It's a part of our conversation, it's a part of the process, but when it's necessary to put that art out there, to put that energy out there, she's usually [...] leading the pack in that regard. So I'm grateful to be associated with her on that path.</blockquote>The song was later used in the end credits in ''Black Is King'' and included in the accompanying deluxe edition of ''[[The Lion King: The Gift]]'', both released on July 31, 2020.<ref name=":5" />

Nina Corcoran of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' described "Black Parade" as "timely and moving", praising the "celebratory blend" of various musical genres and the lyrics that portray "the unique joys of being Black, touching on everything from womanhood to her heritage and the ways in which Blackness proudly permeates throughout it all".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-20|title=Beyoncé drops new song "Black Parade" to honor Juneteenth: Stream|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/06/beyonce-black-parade-juneteenth-stream/|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> Mark Savage of ''[[BBC News]]'' praised the track's "powerful lyrics about black history, police brutality and the George Floyd protests",<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-06-20|title=Beyoncé releases surprise new song, Black Parade, on Juneteenth|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53119767|access-date=2020-11-29}}</ref> while Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the track as "a sweeping yet fine-grained salute to blackness in its many forms".<ref name=":0" /> Olivia Blair of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' analyzed the historical and cultural references in "Black Parade", commenting that the "I'm goin' back to the South... Where my roots ain't watered down. Growin', growin' like a [[Baobab Tree|Baobab tree]]" lyric in the song references "the Black history and continued culture of the deep South", as the baobab tree is native to Africa and grows despite the unfavorably warm and dry conditions. Blair also noted that the "Made a picket sign off your [[picket fence]]. Take it as a warning" lyric describes turning a symbol of white, suburban neighbourhoods ("which for too long have historically shut out Black people") into a symbol of protest against racism, suggesting that Beyoncé "is committed to dismantling white supremacist structures which have allowed systemic racism and discrimination to continue for so many years".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blair|first=Olivia|date=2020-06-23|title=The Historical And Cultural References In Beyoncé's 'Black Parade' Lyrics|url=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a32930736/beyonce-black-parade-lyrics/|access-date=2020-11-29|website=ELLE|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Jeetendr Sehdev wrote for ''[[Forbes]]'' that "the first lesson Beyoncé's "Black Parade" teaches us is that we must put our money where our mouth is", with Beyoncé not just releasing the song but also launching the Black Parade Route initiative and founding the Black Business Impact Fund, to which all proceeds from the song are donated. Sehdev continues, writing that "the second lesson that Beyoncé's "Black Parade" teaches us is that we must also provide people with a sense of optimism and hope", a goal which he describes "Black Parade" as "leading the charge" for. Sehdev describes "Black Parade" as "hit[ting] the nail on the head", as a track that addresses "the issue of racism head-on" through "powerful lyrics about black history, police brutality, and the George Floyd protests", but also delivers "content that is both joyful and uplifting in its music and messaging". Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' agreed, describing how there is no consensus on what the song of the summer should be like, however, he continues: "Ideally, one song could exult, could object, could mourn, could reassure. And indeed, just such a tune appeared last week from Beyoncé, whose exuberant "Black Parade"... celebrates blackness in its many glories, even as it acknowledges the persistent threats of racism and police violence."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wood|first=Mikael|date=2020-06-26|title=What is the song of summer?

Jessica McKinney of ''[[Complex Networks|Complex]]'' similarly noted that "Black Parade" is "not your typical protest song", writing: "You’ll probably hear people chanting, "We got rhythm, we got pride," at the next BLM event, but don’t be surprised if this record comes on at the next summer party, as well".<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=5 Big Takeaways From Beyoncé’s New Song “Black Parade”|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/06/beyonce-new-song-black-parade-takeaways|access-date=2020-11-29|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref> McKinney also described the "irresistible" energy of Beyoncé's "gritty and raw" delivery on the track, noting that Beyoncé "comes out the gate rapping with a rhythmic flow" while also singing on the majority of the record.<ref name=":4" /> Patrick Johnson for ''[[Hypebeast]]'' praised Beyoncé's "incredible, uplifting vocals" on the track.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beyoncé and TIDAL Release Extended A Cappella Version of "Black Parade"|url=https://hypebeast.com/2020/6/beyonce-black-parade-acappella-version-tidal-exclusive|access-date=2020-06-23|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined that the track makes "ambitious, far-reaching connections", and wrote that "Beyoncé flaunts new melody ideas in each verse.

The directory highlights black-owned small businesses across a wide array of industries: agriculture, arts & design, beauty, fashion, home & living, lifestyle, manufacturing, restaurants & bars, services, technology, and wellness & health.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beyoncé|url=https://www.beyonce.com/black-parade-route/?q=&page=1&category=all&nation=all|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Beyoncé|language=en-US}}</ref>

Due to the release of "Black Parade" and the accompanying "Black Parade Route" initiative, several Black-owned businesses have received increased attention. The Black-owned laundromat Celsious experienced "a massive uptick in online orders" after the release of "Black Parade". Brooklyn Tea co-founders Ali Wright and Jamila McGill described how they "went from having three orders a day to over 100. The year-over-year is like 2,300 percent".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=The|date=2020-07-24|title=We Asked 16 Black Business Owners What the Past Few Months Have Been Like|url=https://nymag.com/strategist/2020/07/sixteen-black-business-owners-on-the-past-few-months.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=The Strategist|language=en-us}}</ref> Ellis Island Tea founder Nailah Ellis stated that a surge of online orders occurred after Beyoncé's shout-out.

The initiative also boosted sales of a number of African-owned businesses. Nigerian fashion brand Studio Imo saw an increase in activity after its inclusion in the directory, with owner Edwin Okolo noting: "A lot of people are showing interest. I have already gotten new commissions and more people have ordered from the online store." Kenyan fashion designer Anyango Mpinga also explained that her business experienced increased attention, saying: "I was excited to see that my business is on Beyoncé's site... It brought a wider audience to my platform. What has happened is that I've been getting a lot more requests from people asking how they can get the pieces from my collection, people wanting to make orders." Mpinga also noted that the "Black Parade Route" is proof that there are numerous black and African creatives across different industries, despite retailers saying that they cannot find good black creatives, adding: "What Beyoncé has done is show everyone where to find these creatives so that there are no more excuses".<ref>{{cite web |last1=CNN |first1=Aisha Salaudeen |title=Beyoncé's Black Parade Route catalog giving African-owned businesses a boost |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/12/africa/beyonce-black-parade-website/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>
