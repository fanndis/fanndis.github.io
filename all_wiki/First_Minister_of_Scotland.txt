The '''First Minister of Scotland''' ({{lang-sco|Heid Meinister o Scotland}}; {{lang-gd|Prìomh Mhinistear na h-Alba}}) is the leader of the [[Scottish Government]]. The First Minister chairs the [[Scottish Cabinet]] and is primarily responsible for the formulation, development and presentation of Scottish Government policy.<ref name="role">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/first-minister/ |title=About the Scottish Government > Who runs government > First Minister |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref> Additional functions of the First Minister include promoting and representing Scotland in an official capacity, at home and abroad, and responsibility for constitutional affairs, as they relate to devolution and the Scottish Government.<ref name="role"/>

The First Minister is nominated by the [[Scottish Parliament]] from among its [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|members]], and is formally appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Monarch]]. Members of the Scottish Cabinet and junior ministers of the Scottish Government as well as the Scottish law officers, are appointed by the First Minister. As head of the Scottish Government, the First Minister is directly accountable to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and the actions of the wider government.

[[Nicola Sturgeon]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] is the current First Minister of Scotland.<ref name="SturgeonFM">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30105262 | title=Nicola Sturgeon becomes Scottish first minister | work=[[BBC News]] | date=19 November 2014 | accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
Following the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum in 1997]], in which the Scottish electorate gave their consent, the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive was established (later the Scottish Government) by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First Blair ministry|government]] of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Tony Blair]]. The former [[Parliament of Scotland]] had been abolished following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], forming the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The re-establishment of a dedicated [[legislature]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] for Scotland was known as [[devolution]] and initiated a measure of [[home rule]] or self-governance in its domestic affairs, such as [[NHS Scotland|health]], [[Education in Scotland|education]] and [[Law in Scotland|justice]].<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/pathtodevolution/index.htm |title=The Scottish Parliament – History – The Path to Devolution |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=6 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914143535/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/pathtodevolution/index.htm |archivedate=14 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Scottish devolution]] resulted in administrative and legislative changes to the way Scotland was governed, and resulted in the establishment of a post of First Minister to be head of the devolved Scottish Government. The term "First Minister" is analogous to the use of [[Premier]] to denote the heads of government in [[administrative division|sub-national entities]] of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], such as the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces of Canada]], the [[states and territories of Australia|states of Australia]], and the [[provinces of South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lords Hansard text for 28 Oct 1998 (181028-25)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo981028/text/81028-25.htm|access-date=2020-09-12|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> 

Prior to devolution the comparable functions of the First Minister were exercised by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], whose [[Scottish Office]] was a department of the [[British Government]] set up in 1885. The Secretary of State is a member of the [[British Cabinet]] appointed by the Prime Minister to have responsibility for the domestic affairs of Scotland.

Since 1999, the Secretary of State for Scotland has a much reduced role at the renamed [[Scotland Office]] (the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland) as a result of the transfer of responsibilities to the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.<ref name="Secretary">{{cite web |url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/devolution/guidance/dgn03.pdf |title=Devolution Guidance Note 3 – The role of the Secretary of State for Scotland |publisher=Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) |date=October 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2007 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926134229/http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/devolution/guidance/dgn03.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== Election and term ==

The First Minister is nominated by the Scottish Parliament from among its members at the beginning of each term, by means of an [[exhaustive ballot]]. He or she is then formally appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]].<ref name="powers">{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--d.htm#45 |title=Section 45 – Scotland Act 1998 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=30 July 2007}}</ref>

In theory, any member of the Scottish Parliament can be nominated for First Minister.  However, the government must maintain the confidence of the Scottish Parliament in order to gain supply (access to exchequer funds) and remain in office. For this reason, the First Minister is almost always the leader of the largest party, or the leader of the senior partner in any majority [[coalition]].  There is no term of office for a First Minister; he or she holds office "at Her Majesty's pleasure". In practice, however, a First Minister cannot remain in office against the will of the Scottish Parliament; indeed, the Scotland Act explicitly requires the First Minister to either resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution (and with it, new elections)  if his or her government "no longer enjoys the confidence of the Parliament."  Whenever the office of First Minister falls vacant, the Sovereign is responsible for appointing the new incumbent upon nomination by the Scottish Parliament; the appointment is formalised at a meeting between the Sovereign and the First Minister designate.<ref name="powers"/>

Given the [[additional member system]] used to elect its members, it is difficult for a single party to gain an overall majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament.<ref name="pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/domestic-policy/elections/proportional-representation/proportional-representation-$366642.htm |title=Proportional Representation – What is Proportional Representation? |publisher=Politics UK |accessdate=7 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211094208/http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/domestic-policy/elections/proportional-representation/proportional-representation-%24366642.htm |archivedate=11 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When the Westminster Labour government devolved powers to Scotland, the SNP gained an overall majority of seats in the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], and thus had enough numbers to vote in its leader, [[Alex Salmond]], as First Minister for a second term.

After the [[Elections in Scotland|election of the Scottish Parliament]], a First Minister must be nominated within a period of 28 days.<ref name="powers"/> Under the terms of the Scotland Act, if the Parliament fails to nominate a First Minister, within this time frame, it will be dissolved and a fresh election held.<ref name="powers"/> If an incumbent First Minister is defeated in a general election, they do not immediately vacate office. The First Minister only leaves office when the Scottish Parliament nominates a successor individual.<ref name="powers"/>

After accepting office, the First Minister takes the [[Official Oath]], as set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868.<ref name="oath">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2007/05/17115334 |title=First Minister takes oath |publisher=Scottish Government |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref> The oath is tendered by the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] at a sitting of the Court in [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] in Edinburgh.<ref name="oath"/> The oath is:
{{quote|I, [''name''], do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in the office of First Minister, So help me God.}}

The period in office of a First Minister is not linked to the term of [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]]. The Scotland Act set out a four-year maximum term for each session of Parliament.<ref name="elections">{{cite web |url=
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Ordinary General Elections |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) |accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref> The Act specifies than an election to the Scottish Parliament will be held on the first Thursday in May, every four years, starting from 1999.<ref name="elections"/> Parliament can be dissolved and an extraordinary general election held, before the expiration of the four-year term, but only if two-thirds (or more) of elected MSPs vote for such action in a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.  If a simple majority of MSPs voted a no-confidence motion in the First Minister/Government, that would trigger a 28-day period for the nomination of a replacement; should that time period expire without the nomination of a new First Minister, then an extraordinary election would have to be called.<ref name="elections2">{{cite web |url=
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#3 |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Extraordinary General Elections |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) |accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref>

The First Minister, once appointed continues in office as the head of the devolved Scottish Government until either he or she resigns, is dismissed or dies in office. Resignation can be triggered off by the passage of a [[Motion of No Confidence]] in the First Minister or the Scottish Government or by rejecting a [[Motion of Confidence]] in the Scottish Parliament.<ref name="powers"/> In those situations, the First Minister must tender their resignation and the resignation of their government to the monarch.<ref name="powers"/> In such circumstances, the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]] appoints an interim First Minister, until the Scottish Parliament determines on a new nominee to be presented to the Sovereign for formal appointment.<ref name="powers"/>

== Powers ==
[[File:Wfm donald dewar statue.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Donald Dewar]] was the inaugural First Minister of Scotland, and held office from May 1999, until his death in October 2000.]]

The role and powers of the First Minister are set out in Sections 45 to 49 of the [[Scotland Act 1998]].<ref name="powers"/>

Following their appointment, the First Minister may then nominate [[List of Scottish Executive ministerial teams|ministers]] to sit in the Scottish Cabinet and Junior Ministers to form the Scottish Government. They are then formally elected by the Scottish Parliament. Ministers hold office at Her Majesty's Pleasure and may be removed from office, at any time, by the First Minister. The First Minister also has the power to appoint the Law Officers and Chief Legal Officers of the Scottish Government – the [[Lord Advocate]] and the [[Solicitor General for Scotland|Solicitor General]] but only with the support of the Scottish Parliament.

The First Minister is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and the actions of the overall Scottish Government. MSPs can scrutinise the activities of the First Minister and their Cabinet by tabling written questions or by asking oral questions in the Scottish Parliament. Direct questioning of the First Minister takes place at [[First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)|First Minister's Questions]] (FMQs) each Thursday at noon when Parliament is sitting. The 30-minute session enables MSPs to ask questions of the First Minister, on any issue. The leaders of the largest opposition parties have an allocation of questions and are allowed to question the First Minister each week. Opposition leaders normally ask an opening question to the First Minister, relating to their meeting with the Scottish Cabinet, or when they next expect to meet the Prime Minister, and then follow this up by asking a supplementary question on an issue of their choosing.

In addition to direct questioning, the First Minister is also able to deliver oral statements to the Scottish Parliament chamber, after which members are invited to question the First Minister on the substance of the statement. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary term, the First Minister normally delivers a statement, setting out the legislative programme of the Government, or a statement of government priorities over the forthcoming term.<ref name="Programme for Government">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/Performance/programme-for-government |title=About: Performance: Programme for Government |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>

Associated with the office of First Minister, there is also the post of [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]]. Unlike the office of First Minister, the post of Deputy is not recognised in statute and confers no extra status on the holder. Like the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister is an elected Member of the Scottish Parliament and a member of the Scottish Government. From 1999 to 2007, when Scotland was governed by a Labour–Liberal Democrat coalition, the leader of the Liberal Democrats – the junior government party – was given the role of Deputy First Minister; a title which they held in conjunction with another ministerial portfolio. For example, [[Nicol Stephen]], Deputy First Minister from 2005 to 2007, simultaneously held the post of [[Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning]].
[[File:Deputy Secretary Blinken Meets With Scottish First Minister Sturgeon (18490445358).jpg|thumbnail|right|US Deputy Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken]] meets with Nicola Sturgeon at the US Department of State in Washington, D.C., on 10 June 2015]]

On two occasions since 1999, the Deputy First Minister has assumed the role of 'Acting' First Minister, inheriting the powers of the First Minister in their absence or incapacitation. From 11 October 2000 to 26 October 2000, following the death in office of the then First Minister [[Donald Dewar]], his deputy [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] became Acting First Minister, until the Labour party appointed a new leader, and consequently First Minister.<ref name="acting">{{cite web |url=
http://www.worldstatesmen.org/United_Kingdom.html#Scotland |title=World Statesmen – United Kingdom, Scotland |publisher=World Statesmen  |accessdate=4 August 2007}}</ref> Wallace also became Acting First Minister between 8 November 2001 and 22 November 2001, following the resignation of [[Henry McLeish]].<ref name="acting"/>

An officer with such a title need not always exist; rather, the existence of the post is dependent on the form of Cabinet organisation preferred by the First Minister and their party. The Deputy First Minister does not automatically succeed if a vacancy in the premiership is suddenly created. It may be necessary for the Deputy to stand in for the First Minister on occasion, for example by taking the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]] at First Minister's Questions.

== Precedence and privileges ==

[[Image:Bute House, Charlotte Square Edinburgh.JPG|left|thumb|[[Bute House]] at 6 [[Charlotte Square]] is the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland.]]

The First Minister is, by virtue of section 45(7) of the Scotland Act 1998, ''[[ex officio]]'' the Keeper of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] and their place in the [[order of precedence in Scotland]] is determined by the holding of that office.<ref>Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7)</ref><ref name="precedence">{{cite web |url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/scotland/page31a.aspx |title=The Scale of General Precedence in Scotland |publisher=Burkes Peerage |accessdate=4 August 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224203929/http://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/scotland/page31a.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The scale of precedence in Scotland was amended by [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]] on 30 June 1999 to take account of devolution and the establishment of the post of First Minister.<ref name="precedence"/> The amended scale reflected the transfer of the office of Keeper of the Great Seal from the Secretary of State for Scotland to the First Minister and also created a rank for the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament]].<ref name="precedence"/> Throughout Scotland, the First Minister outranks all others except the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], [[Lord Lieutenant]]s, the [[Sheriff Principal]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[List of Commonwealth Prime Ministers|Commonwealth Prime Ministers]] (whilst in the United Kingdom), the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and the [[Lord Speaker]].<ref name="precedence"/>

As of April 2015, the First Minister is entitled to draw a total salary of £144,687, which is composed of a basic MSP salary of £59,089 plus an additional salary of £85,598 for the role as First Minister.<ref name="pay">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/BusinessBulletins/bba15-48.pdf |title=BUSINESS BULLETIN No. 48/2015 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> This can be compared to the UK Prime Minister who is entitled to draw a total salary of £142,500, composed of a basic [[Member of Parliament|MP]] salary of £67,060 and an additional office holder's salary of £75,440 (the total entitlement for the Prime Minister had peaked at £198,661 in April 2011 but this was then dropped by around 25%).<ref name="salary">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP13-33/members-pay-and-expenses-current-rates-from-1-april-2013 |title=Members' pay and expenses – current rates from 1 April 2013 RESEARCH PAPER 13/33 |publisher=House of Commons |date=31 May 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The First Minister is the highest paid member of the Scottish Government.

Appointments to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] are made by the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]], although in practice they are made only on the advice of the [[UK government]]. To date all First Ministers have been appointed [[List of current members of the British Privy Council|members]] of the Privy Council, and therefore entitled to use the style '[[Right Honourable]]'.

The First Minister is one of the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the [[Royal Banner of Scotland]].
