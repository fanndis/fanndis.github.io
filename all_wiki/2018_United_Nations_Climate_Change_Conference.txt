The '''2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference''' was the 24th [[United Nations Climate Change conference|Conference of the Parties]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] ('''COP24'''), also known as the '''Katowice Climate Change Conference'''.<ref name="COP24">{{cite web |title=COP24 Katowice United Nations Climate Change Conference |url=http://www.cop24.katowice.eu |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref> It was held between 2 and 15 December 2018 in [[Katowice]], Poland. The conference was held in the '''International Congress Centre'''. The president of COP24 was '''[[Michał Kurtyka]].''' The conference also incorporated the fourteenth meeting of the parties for the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ('''CMP14'''), and the third session of the first meeting of the parties for the [[Paris Agreement]] ('''CMA1-3''' or '''CMA1.3''') which agreed on rules to implement the Agreement.

After the [[United States]] left the Paris Agreement, [[China]] took a leading role by hosting many of the preparatory meetings in the weeks beforehand.<ref name="chi">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7c1f16f8-e7ec-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3 |title=China emerges as powerbroker in global climate talks |author=Leslie Hook |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=16 November 2018 |newspaper=[[The Financial Times]]}}</ref>

In November 2018, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] released a report stating that 2017 [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm), a level not seen in three to five million years.<ref name="clch">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46289829 |title=Climate change: Warming gas concentrations at new record high |author=Matt McGrath |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=22 November 2018 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> In October 2018, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) published its [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]] (SR15).

== Speeches ==
On 3 December 2018, the noted British naturalist [[Sir David Attenborough]] told delegates at the conference that:<ref>{{Cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |date=3 December 2018 |title=David Attenborough: collapse of civilisation is on the horizon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/david-attenborough-collapse-civilisation-on-horizon-un-climate-summit |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref>
{{Block quote|Right now we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: [[global warming|climate change]]. If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.}}

On 4 December 2018, 15 year-old [[Individual and political action on climate change|climate change activist]] [[Greta Thunberg]] addressed the summit and explained the severity of the problem this way:<ref>{{Cite news |last = Carrington |first = Damian |title ='Our leaders are like children', school strike founder tells climate summit |date = 4 December 2018 |work = [[The Guardian]] |location = London, United Kingdom |issn = 0261-3077 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/04/leaders-like-children-school-strike-founder-greta-thunberg-tells-un-climate-summit |access-date = 2018-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Greta Thunberg full speech at UN Climate Change COP24 Conference |author-first=Greta |author-last=Thunberg |author-link=Greta Thunberg |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFkQSGyeCWg |date=2018-12-15}}</ref>
{{Block quote|What I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that [[Global catastrophic risk|we are facing an existential threat]]. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.

The same day, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] wrote to the participants of the conference: "Climate change is not a concern of just one or two nations. It is an issue that affects all humanity, and every living being on this earth. This beautiful place is our only home. We have to take serious action now to protect our environment and find constructive solutions to global warming."<ref>Tenzin Dharpo, [http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=40999 We need serious action now, Dalai Lama to participants of COP24 climate meet], Phayul.com, 2018-12-04</ref>

[[Al Gore]] told delegates they faced “the single most important moral choice in history of humanity”.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/un-chief-antonio-guterres-attempts-to-revive-flagging-climate-change-talks Climate change talks lead to heightened pledge to cut emissions] [[The Guardian]], 2018-12-12</ref>

[[António Guterres]] the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] told “We’re running out of time. To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.” The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it.”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/un-chief-antonio-guterres-attempts-to-revive-flagging-climate-change-talks "Climate change talks lead to heightened pledge to cut emissions"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2018-12-12.</ref>

A US energy official, Preston Wells Griffith, senior director for energy and environment, said on 10 December 2018: "We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mangalam.com/en-news/detail/271537-world-saudi-us-snub-of-climate-report-unsettles-un-talks.html|title=Saudi, US snub of climate report unsettles UN talks|last=|first=|date=2018-12-11|website=www.mangalam.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> He added also: "We can achieve all of these goals and they are complementary."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/white-house-takes-an-america-first-approach-at-the-cop24-summit/|title=White House takes America First approach at COP24 summit|last=Paola Tamma|first=Kalina Oroschakoff|date=2018-12-10|website=POLITICO|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> During his speech, he reinforced that impression: "Alarmism should not silence realism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mangalam.com/en-news/detail/271537-world-saudi-us-snub-of-climate-report-unsettles-un-talks.html|title=Saudi, US snub of climate report unsettles UN talks|last=|first=|date=2018-12-10|website=www.mangalam.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://larutadelclima.org/2018/12/10/activist-us/|title=Activists, Trump Administration Clash Over U.S. Energy Future|last=Goodman|first=Sam|date=2018-12-10|website=La Ruta del Clima|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref>

A youth conference with children representing over 30 countries was also held during the conference.

== Events ==
Side events at the conference allow for admitted observers which have limited speaking opportunities, to host side events that are categorized under three categories as part of the Paris Agreement.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020|title=COP 22/ CMP12/CMA 1 SEE one-stop page|url=https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/marrakech-climate-change-conference-november-2016/events-and-programme/side-events-and-exhibits|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-27|website=United Nations Climate Change}}</ref>

The categories include: Enhancing Ambition, Promoting Implementation, and Providing Support to Developing Countries. There are also outside events that are hosted by the UNFCCC secretariat, Parties and observer organizations.

There were 5 thematic days at the conference:

* 4th of December - Research into Practice Day
* 5th of December - Farmers Day
* 6th of December – Business and Industry Day

== Result ==

The conference agreed on rules to implement the [[Paris Agreement]], which will come into force in 2020, that is to say the rulebook on how governments will measure,  and report on their emissions-cutting efforts.<ref name="Harvey">Fiona Harvey, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/15/progress-and-problems-as-un-climate-change-talks-end-with-a-deal "Progress and problems as UN climate change talks end with a deal "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2018-12-15 (page visited on 2016-12-16).</ref><ref name="agreed">Fiona Harvey, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/what-was-agreed-at-cop24-in-poland-and-why-did-it-take-so-long "What was agreed at COP24 in Poland and why did it take so long?"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2018-12-16 (page visited on 2016-12-16).</ref>

Due to difficulty to reach agreement between parties, some difficult questions such as ways to scale up existing commitments on cutting emissions, ways to provide financial help for poor countries, wording that does not allow double counting and whether countries are doing enough to cut their emissions (in the light of the [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C|IPCC report]]) were postponed to the next conference.<ref name="Harvey"/><ref name="agreed"/>

David Waskow, of the [[World Resources Institute]], said the deal was "a good foundation for countries to go about implementing the Paris agreement" and added that "It sets the direction of travel and will spur countries to take action. Now countries need to go home and do their homework, by increasing their commitments [on emissions]".<ref name="Harvey"/>

Some achievements have been made:

* 50 countries signed the “Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration”, which emphasizes the need for emission-reducing policies to include “a just transition of the workforce” and to create “decent work and quality jobs”.
* The [[Poland|Polish]] presidency declared a “forests for climate” policy highlighting the important role of forests in solving climate problems.
* Some countries say that they will increase their climate pledges in 2020, including [[India]], [[Canada]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Jamaica]].
* Several dozen countries forming “High Ambition Coalition” – including the [[European Union|EU]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], and [[Canada]] – pledged to raise their targets by 2020.
* New members join the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]]; now there are around 80.
*[[Germany]] made a €70m contribution to the Adaptation Fund.  Smaller pledges made by [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Italy]] and the [[European Union|EU]] raised the total to $129m – an annual record for the fund.
* Germany gave €1.5bn for the [[Green Climate Fund]] – double their 2014 contribution.
*[[Norway]] pledged $516m to the Green Climate Fund.
* The [[World Bank]] gave $200bn for climate programms in 2021-2025, two times more that in 2015 - 2020. It was also one of nine banks which pledged to “align... their activities” with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
* Five other banks – [[ING Group|ING]], [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Standard Chartered]] – with a capital of €2.4tn, pledged to adjust the climate alignment of their lending portfolios to achieve the “well below 2C” target.
* The [[United Kingdom|UK]] say it will increase by £100m the funding for renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and by £170m the funding to support the creation low carbon industry in the UK by 2040.
*[[Maersk]], the world's largest shipping company, said it will totally eliminate its carbon impact by 2050.
* Shell committed to link short-term carbon targets to executive pay from  the year 2020.
* There were many smaller pledges from businesses.
* COP24 welcomes “timely completion” of the  [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]] and “invited” countries to make use of the report. The governments of four countries (the gas/oil-producers USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) blocked a proposal to welcome the Special Report outright.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46496967|title=Climate change: COP24 fails to adopt key scientific report|last=McGrath|first=Matt|date=2018-12-08|website=bbc|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

Many say, that there is a “lack of urgency” in the COP decisions, but some good decisions have been made.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Simon |last2=Timperley |first2=Jocelyn |title=COP24: Key outcomes agreed at the UN climate talks in Katowice |url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop24-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-katowice |website=Carbon Brief |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>
