'''Atlanta''' is a city in [[Cass County, Texas|Cass County]], northeastern [[Texas]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 5,675.<ref name=CensusQF/>

==History==
Atlanta was established in 1871 with the building of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] and was named for [[Atlanta]], Georgia, former home of many early settlers. This area of Texas had been settled by planters who brought enslaved African Americans with them to work the land. A post office was opened in 1871.

By 1885 the community had 1,500 residents, who had founded three white and two black churches, two schools, a bank, several sawmills, a number of general stores, and a weekly newspaper, the ''Citizens' Journal.'' [[Lumbering]] was the chief industry. The lumber boom reached its peak around 1890, when the population was 1,764. When the community was incorporated in 1929, it had 1,900 residents and 105 businesses.

The onset of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s forced many businesses to close, and in 1936 Atlanta had 85 rated businesses. The opening of the Rodessa oilfield in 1935, however, helped mitigate the worst effects of the Depression. By 1940 the town had modern canneries, lumber mills, wholesale houses, a brick plant, a hospital, and a population of 2,453. Subsequently, Atlanta grew steadily, topping the 4,000 mark for the first time in the early 1960s. In 1990 the population was 6,118. By 2000 the population had dropped to 5,745. Principal industries include farming, forestry, oil, and tourism.

The City of Atlanta is in close proximity to three major interstate highways. Interstate 20 to the south, interstate 30 to the north, and interstate 49 to the east. It is also home to U.S. Highway 59, the highest trafficked non-interstate highway in the nation which is a future Interstate 369 corridor. Atlanta is an ideal hub for transportation and distribution centers due to its close proximity to interstate highways and safe distance from coastal areas prone to hurricanes.
