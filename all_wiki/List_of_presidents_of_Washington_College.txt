[[Washington College]] is a private [[liberal arts college]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]], which is on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland]]. The college was founded in 1782 by [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|William Smith]], but is the successor institution to the earlier Kent County Free School, which was founded in 1732.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dumschott|1980|pp = 9–10}}</ref> From the college's founding until 1922 the executive officer of the college was known as the [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of the college; subsequently, the executive officer is the [[College president|president]] of the college.<ref name="Dumschott180">{{Harvnb|Dumschott|1980|p = 180}}</ref>{{efn|The 1922 change to Washington College's Charter changed the official title of the office {{harv|Dumschott|1980|p = 180}}, but {{Harvtxt|Watts|1894|p=94}} first refers to the position as the president with Charles W. Reid's election in 1889 and {{Harvtxt|Dumschott|1980|p=146}} starts using president and principal interchangeably with James W. Cain's election in 1903.}} While the title changed, the office is considered to be the same and officeholders who were referred to as principals by their contemporaries are now referred to as presidents.{{efn|In contemporary documents such as {{Harvtxt|Thompson|2000}}, the college refers to William Smith as the first president of the college. {{Harvtxt|Dumschott|1980}} and primary documents from the era, however, refer to him as the first principal.}} Before the title change in 1922, the president of Washington College was the president of the Board of Visitors and Governors; since 1922, that position is the chair of the Board of Visitors and Governors.<ref name="Dumschott180"/>

The president of Washington College is appointed by the Board of Visitors and Governors and serves at the pleasure of the board.<ref name="Bylaws">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washcoll.edu/live/files/581-bylaws|title=The By-Laws of Washington College|last=Spire|first=Linda J.|date=6 December 2008|publisher=Washington College|pages=12–13|url-status=dead|access-date=2 April 2020}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> They are the chief executive officer and chief spokesperson of the college. As a part of their role, they are a voting member of the college's faculty and ''ex officio''  member of the Board of Visitors and Governors. There is no fixed compensation or pay scale for the position; each president negotiates a contract independently with the board.<ref name="Bylaws"/> As a part of the position's compensation, the President of Washington College is given access to the [[Hynson-Ringgold House]], which has been the official residence of the Washington College president since 1944.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Williams|first=Lynn|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-09-15-1991258207-story.html|title=Chestertown's Historic Hynson-Ringgold House|date=15 September 1991|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

At least 31 people have been the president of Washington College since 1782, four of whom have been interim presidents.{{efn|It is unknown who the principal was between 1805 and 1813.}} Of the 31 presidents only one, Joseph McLain, was an alumnus of the college and only one, [[Sheila Bair]], was a woman. The presidents of the college have been drawn from a variety of areas including religion, military service, governmental service, and academia. Six Washington College presidents were [[ordained]] in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] or the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] before their term. Several were also the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]] of Emanuel Parish in Chestertown concurrent to their term as president. Washington College presidents have come from many parts of public life. Two were engaged in military service before their term and four were in public service. A singular president, Kurt M. Landgraf, was working in the [[private sector]] before his term. Most of the remaining presidents were academics before becoming president of the college. Three were presidents of other colleges, seven were [[Academic administration#United States|academic administrators]], five were [[Academic personnel|faculty members]] at other colleges, and three were faculty members at Washington College before their terms.
