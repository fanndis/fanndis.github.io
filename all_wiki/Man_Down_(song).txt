"'''Man Down'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] from her fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). Singer [[Shontelle]] and production duo [[R. City]] wrote the song with its main producer, Sham. They wrote it during a writing camp, in Los Angeles of March 2010, held by Rihanna's record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then-untitled album. Rock City were inspired by [[Bob Marley]]'s 1973 song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective. "Man Down" is a [[reggae]] song which incorporates elements of [[ragga]] and [[electronic music]]. Lyrically, Rihanna is a [[fugitive]] after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets. Several critics singled out "Man Down" as ''Loud''{{'}}s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.

[[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] released "Man Down" on May 3, 2011, as the fifth single from the album. In the United States, the single reached number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. It has been certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song topped the chart in France for five consecutive weeks and reached the top three in Belgium and the Netherlands. [[Anthony Mandler]] directed its music video, in which Rihanna's character shoots a man after he [[rape]]s her. The video was criticized by the [[Parents Television Council]], Industry Ears and Mothers Against Violence, who faulted Rihanna for suggesting that murder is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims. However, actress [[Gabrielle Union]], a rape victim, praised the video for being relatable. "Man Down" was on the [[set list]] for three of Rihanna's tours&nbsp;– the [[Loud Tour]] (2011), the [[Diamonds World Tour]] (2013) and the [[Anti World Tour]] (2016).

==Background==
In March 2010, record label [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] held a writing camp in Los Angeles for songwriters and producers to compose material for possible inclusion on [[Rihanna]]'s then-untitled fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]''.<ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite web|last=Ketchum III|first=William|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.18167/title.sak-pase-reveals-queens-influence-on-watch-the-throne-tracks-rihannas-man-down-controversy|title=Sak Pase Reveals Queen's Influence On 'Watch The Throne' Tracks, Rihanna's 'Man Down' Controversy|work=[[HipHopDX]]|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="NRP">{{cite web|last=Chace|first=Zoe|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/07/05/137530847/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-hit-song|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Hit Song?|work=[[NPR]]|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Def Jam rented out nearly every recording studio in Los Angeles in order to create as many songs as possible.<ref name="HipHopDX"/> Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo [[Rock City (musical duo)|Rock City]] (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during the sessions, and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day.<ref name="NRP"/> Daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music, and where producers have music but no lyrics.<ref name="NRP"/>

[[Shama Joseph]], professionally known as Sham, was hired as one of the producers to work on crafting songs at the camp.<ref name="HipHopDX"/> Sham's manager had arranged his attendance at the camp through an acquaintance who was an employee of the record label. Sham explained that he found a flight to Los Angeles and began working on music as soon as he arrived, stating that he had "nothing to lose and everything to gain".<ref name="HipHopDX"/> He was inspired by a vision of Rihanna performing songs at a concert that were Caribbean themed.<ref name="HipHopDX"/> Sham felt that Rihanna had not explored Caribbean-themed music since her debut album, ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005).<ref name="HipHopDX"/>

==Production and recording==
[[File:Bob-Marley.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Bob Marley onstage with a guitar|[[Rock City (production duo)|Rock City]] wanted to recreate [[Bob Marley]]'s ''(pictured)'' 1973 song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" from a female perspective.]]
According to Daniels, Rock City knew Sham but they had not heard the West Indian/Caribbean-themed music that he had composed during the camp. Sham played the music to them, to which the brothers responded "Let's give Rihanna a one-drop! Like, a response to 'I shot the sheriff'!"<ref name="NRP"/> Together, Sham and Rock City wrote the lyrics to "Man Down" in twelve minutes.<ref name="NRP"/> In an [[MTV News]] interview, Rock City said they intended to write a song that would embody [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" (1973) from a female perspective and to "tap [Rihanna's] island origins in a way that sounded authentic".<ref name="RockCity MTV Interview">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1665450/rihanna-man-down-bob-marley/|title=Rihanna's 'Man Down' Is Her Answer To Bob Marley Classic|work=[[MTV News]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name="NME Rock City Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/rihanna/57210|title=Rihanna's 'Man Down' is 'answer to Bob Marley's 'I Shot The Sheriff'|work=[[NME]]|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref> Singer [[Shontelle]] said that Rihanna called her during the [[Last Girl on Earth]] tour and asked her to be involved with the song.

Rihanna later described the sentiment she wanted to express as "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: "I'm super inspired by reggae music [and it] has been a part of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that."<ref name="Rihanna MTV Interview">{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1652415/rihanna-says-louds-man-down-is-gangsta/|title=Rihanna Says Loud's 'Man Down' Is 'Gangsta'|work=MTV News|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}</ref> The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at [[The Village (studio)|The Village]] in Los Angeles. [[Kuk Harrell]] produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at [[Westlake Recording Studios]], also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Manny Marroquin]] at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.<ref name="LoudNotes">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]|date=November 12, 2010|others=[[Rihanna]]|page=5|type=Inlay cover|work=[[Def Jam Recordings]]}}</ref>

Daniels estimated the total cost of the writing camp to be approximately $200,000, averaging $18,000 for each of the eleven songs which were included on ''Loud''; the camp consisted of forty writers and producers.<ref name="NRP"/> Daniels confirmed that Rock City received $15,000 and Sham $20,000 for their part in the production of "Man Down". He said that "to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive — even before you take into account the fee for the songwriters".<ref name="NRP"/> A cost of $53,000 for "Man Down" was already incurred prior to Rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer.<ref name="NRP"/> Although [[Makeba Riddick]] did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her as an example of how the process works and how much she would charge. It is the responsibility of the vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound.<ref name="NRP"/> Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He estimated the final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering "Man Down" to be $78,000.<ref name="NRP"/> When combined with the marketing and promotional costs, the total expense was $1,078,000.<ref name="Million Cost">{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=Neil|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11619043/How-many-songwriters-does-it-take-to-change-a-chorus.html|title=How many songwriters does it take to change a chorus?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref>

I think it was very hypocritical for some of the parents against violence in media, those same parents have probably allowed their kids to watch all types of movies and programs that have depictions, or things that insinuate violence. So for them to be mad about, number one, an issue that actually exists?&nbsp;... A woman feeling like she wants to shoot somebody who’s still alive because of something that they took from her, that’s real and that’s honest. So the emotion is a very true emotion&nbsp;... and they relive it on a daily basis. I think it was crazy and blown out of proportion&nbsp;.... But people benefit from controversy, and those same people who probably were trying to bring awareness, now they have a voice and now they’re 'specialists,' and they can speak for a group of people all of a sudden.<ref name="HipHopDX"/>}}

==Release and reception==
On March 1, 2011, Rihanna asked fans to help her choose the next single from ''Loud'' using [[Twitter]], saying that she would film a music video in the forthcoming weeks.

The video opens as the protagonist (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a flashback to the previous day, when she rides her bike, meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied [[sexual assault]], and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a dresser drawer.<ref name="Man Down Video Synopsis">{{cite web|last=Dinh|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1664864/rihanna-man-down-video/|title=Rihanna Pulls The Trigger In 'Man Down' Video|work=MTV News|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Analysis and reception===
Janell Hobson analysed the imagery presented in the video for "Man Down" in her book ''Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender'', which "challenges postmodernist dismissals of identity politics and the delusional belief that the Millennial era reflects a 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' world."<ref name="Hobson">{{cite book |last=Hobson |first=Janell |date=October 18, 2012 |title=Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMpKLdkpnp8C&q=%22rihanna%22+%22man+down%22&pg=PA82 |location= |publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|page=82 |isbn=978-1438444000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender Paperback – 18 Oct 2012|date=October 12, 2012|id={{ASIN|1438444001|country=uk}}}}</ref> In the chapter titled "Disclosures: Black Women's Resistance to Sexual Violence", Hobson explores how black women have "found the courage" to speak out about sexual violence, protest against it and not remain a silent victim.<ref name="Hobson"/> She recalled Rihanna's interview for ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' with [[Diane Sawyer]], which aired on November 6, 2009.<ref name="Hobson"/> Having remained silent about her altercation with Brown on the evening of the Grammy Party in February that year, whereby Brown assaulted her, Rihanna decided to speak about it for the first time.<ref name="Hobson"/> The author noted how Sawyer decided to approach the interview by presenting the couples relationship and assault case as an "anomaly" and accused Rihanna of "projecting a 'fake' imagery of strong black woman", rather than presenting her another domestic violence victim not only in the United States, but in the world.<ref name="Hobson"/> "I ''am'' strong," Rihanna responded.<ref name="Hobson"/> Hobson wrote that from then on, the singer decided to project an image of "hardcore masculinity and dominatrix-type femininity in her music trajectory".<ref name="Hobson"/>

Subsequently, several of Rihanna's songs and music videos have courted controversy for their violent themes, which Hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers "battered face" on the evening of the assault by [[TMZ]] which circulated the internet without the permission of Rihanna.<ref name="Hobson"/> Hobson writes: "Because of this, Rihanna has had to wrest back control of the 'victim' image foisted on her, and she in turn has challenged us rhetorically and visually to question and examine the power, danger, and violences that shape our relationships."<ref name="Hobson"/> She continued to highlight the music videos for "[[Russian Roulette (Rihanna song)|Russian Roulette]]", "[[Hard (Rihanna song)|Hard]]", "[[We Found Love]]", "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" with [[Eminem]] which documents domestic violence, and "[[S&M (song)|S&M]]", which contains references to [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] and is, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics, as examples.<ref name="Hobson"/> At one point in the video for "S&M", Rihanna is literally tied up as a victim.<ref name="Hobson"/>

However, Hobson noted that Rihanna "rejects  the victim stance" in the video for "Man Down", and elucidated that she played the role of a rape survivor who shot her attacker.<ref name="Hobson"/> She attributed the location of shooting the video in Jamaica as significant, due to how the image of a gun proliferated during 1990s Jamaican [[dance hall]]'s to "express female rage".<ref name="Hobson"/> The prologue depicts Rihanna as a "dark-hooded" ''[[femme fatale]]'' whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and provokes the spectator to sympathize with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club, which Hobson suggests is "somehow deserving of rape".<ref name="Hobson"/> She continued to explain that Rihanna is inviting the audience to consider what justice means by "pointing both a literal and lyrical gun at the issue".<ref name="Hobson"/> Hobson concluded that Rihanna is protecting her vulnerability and countering the image of the abused black woman who is looked at unsympathetically in society.<ref name="Hobson"/>

Beck Bain of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] described the video as "visually stunning",<ref>{{cite web|last=Bain|first=becky|url=http://www.idolator.com/5883402/rihanna-shoots-to-kill-in-her-man-down-video|title=Rihanna Shoots To Kill In Her 'Man Down' Video|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=May 31, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref> while ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer Lee Ann labelled it as "shocking".<ref name="Mothers Against Violence"/> Co-writer of "Man Down" Theron Thomas felt that the video was very theatrical and that Rihanna played her role "perfectly".<ref name="NME Rock City Interview"/> He continued to say that had the video been a lyric-by-lyric representation, the narrative would have been more "graphic".<ref name="NME Rock City Interview"/>

===Controversy===
[[File:GabrielleUnionFeb09 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Actress [[Gabrielle Union]] ''(pictured)'', a rape victim, said that she could relate to the music video's storyline.|alt=A woman with her head tiled up slightly, smiling.]]
The [[Parents Television Council]] (PTC) criticized Rihanna for her portrayal of "cold, calculated execution of murder" in the music video, and argued that murdering a rapist as socially-acceptable justice is impermissible.

After the PTC's statement, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of [[AlterNet]] wrote that the group seemed to employ a [[double standard]]; it had not condemned [[Kanye West]]'s music video for "[[Monster (Kanye West song)#Music video|Monster]]", in which dead women hang from ceilings and West holds a severed head.

Rihanna responded to the PTC's criticism on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that "touchy subject matters" should not be hidden from children because they will otherwise not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape.<ref name="DS Video 1"/><ref name="Hollywood Report Explain"/> The singer continued to state that "the industry isn't 'Parents R Us{{' "}} and that singers "have the freedom to create art".<ref name="DS Video 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a322851/rihanna-man-down-murder-video-is-the-real-world.html|title=Rihanna: 'Man Down murder video is the real world' – Music News |work=Digital Spy|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref> In an interview for ''BET'', Rihanna further explain why rape was used as the vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened.

Actress and women's-health advocate [[Gabrielle Union]], a rape victim, voiced support for the video on Twitter.

She admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist, but missed, and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better.

She wrote that she did not understand why a truck [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] was in the middle of the stage.<ref name="Context"/> Maza praised the tracks placement on the set-list. "Man Down" was performed as the fourth song on the Loud Tour, following its opener "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]", "[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]" and "[[Shut Up and Drive (Rihanna song)|Shut Up and Drive]]". Maza noted that the tempo of "Man Down" should have "slowed down the momentum she'd accumulated until then but that was instead an ideal marriage of production and performance." Instead, the red lights on the stage played up the "ominous" tone of the song as it gradually increased its tempo to the point whereby the end of the song was on the verge of sounding like an [[incantation]].<ref name="Baltimore">{{cite web|last=Maza|first=Erik|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/midnight_sun/blog/2011/06/rihanna_review_june_four.html|title=Rihanna at 1st Mariner Arena, first stop of Loud Tour|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref>
