==Background==
The song was first mentioned in Gaga's March 2020 interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'', when then unknown to be with Grande, was described as a "monster of a dance tune, but its message is about submitting yourself to devastation – a flawless dance floor crier as a "celebration of all the tears."<ref name="PaperInterview">{{cite web |url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html?rebelltitem=32#rebelltitem32 |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |website=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=May 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515235006/https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html?rebelltitem=32#rebelltitem32|archive-date=May 15, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Gaga disclosed that she had collaborated with a "fellow female pop star who [had similarly experienced] immense trauma while in the public eye" and went into depth about the genesis of their song: "I sat with her and we talked about our lives. It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do."<ref name="PaperInterview" />

In her May 21, 2020 interview with [[Zane Lowe]] on [[Apple Music]]'s [[Beats 1]], Gaga further talked about the writing process of the song:{{Quote|text=[Grande] was so wonderful and I think that maybe she assumed that she was gonna come in and I would be like "here, just sing this and thank you so much for your time" right. But instead I asked her what she needed, how she wanted to do things. ...When she came to the studio I was still crying, she came up to me and said, "You're gonna be alright, call me, here's my number", and she was very persistent, she tried being friends with me so many times. But I was very ashamed, I didn't want to project all that negativity onto her. Then she came up to me and said "you're hiding", and I said "yeah, you're right, I'm absolutely hiding", and that's where our friendship blossomed.<ref name="Beats1">{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga: The Chromatica Interview |url=https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/lady-gaga-the-chromatica-interview/pl.8a0d43ae41f14c1d88367fcc9b34b7ec |last=Lowe |first=Zane |date=May 21, 2020 |website=[[Apple Music]] |language=en-us|url-status=live|access-date=May 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522221148/https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/lady-gaga-the-chromatica-interview/pl.8a0d43ae41f14c1d88367fcc9b34b7ec|archive-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|text=We all knew that "Rain on Me" had huge potential and was an incredible song, but the production didn't fit with the overall sound. So, Blood[pop] had asked if I could try some stuff with it. I took the vocal and wanted to try some new movement of the chords and explored different progressions to see if it changed the mood. It was kind of subconscious that I started playing the bassline from "All This Love That I'm Givin" by [[Gwen McCrae]] under the chorus, and that felt like another lightbulb moment. I remember Blood turning to me and smiling like we'd just cracked a code.<ref name="EWproduction">{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga's 'Chromatica' team reveals the history and future of her new era |url=https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|access-date=2020-06-12 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=EN |first=Joey |last=Nolfi |date=2020-06-12|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200613100924/https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|archive-date=June 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>}}
