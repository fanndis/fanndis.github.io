{{Precedence}}
The '''order of precedence in the United Kingdom''' is the [[Order of precedence|sequential hierarchy]] for Peers of the Realm, officers of state, senior members of the [[clergy]], holders of the various [[Chivalric order|Orders of Chivalry]] and other persons in the three legal jurisdictions within the [[United Kingdom]]:
* [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|England and Wales]]
* [[Order of precedence in Scotland|Scotland]]
* [[Order of precedence in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]

Separate orders exist for males and females.

==Determination of precedence==
The [[order of precedence]] is determined by various methods. The Precedence Act (which technically applies only to determine seating in the House of Lords Chamber) and the Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland generally set precedence for members of the nobility. The statutes of the various Orders of Chivalry set precedence for their members. In other cases, precedence may be decided by the sovereign's order, by a [[Royal Warrant of Precedence]], by [[letters patent]], by Acts of Parliament, or by custom.

==Source of precedence==
One may acquire precedence for various reasons. Firstly, one may be an office-holder. Secondly, one may be of a particular degree such as [[duke]]. Thirdly, in the case of women, one may be the wife of a title-holder (note that wives acquire precedence due to their husbands, but husbands do not gain any special precedence due to their wives). Finally, one may be the son or daughter of a title-holder. 

One does not gain precedence as a child of a lady, unless that lady is a peeress in her own right. Furthermore, if a daughter of a peer marries a commoner, then she retains her precedence as a daughter of a peer. However, if she marries a peer, then her precedence is based on her husband's status, and not on her father's.

==British royal family==
The King or Queen of the United Kingdom, as the sovereign, is always first in the order of precedence. A king is followed by his [[queen consort]], the first in the order of precedence for women. The reverse, however, is not always true for [[Queen regnant|queens regnant]]. There is no established law of precedence for a [[prince consort]], so he is usually specially granted precedence above all other males by [[letters patent]] or, on the other hand, may rank lower than the heir apparent or the heir presumptive, even if the heir is his own son.

===Current practice===
* By (the Queen's) Order-in-Council, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] has "place, pre-eminence and precedence" over all men in the United Kingdom—except, where provided by Parliament, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].
* In 2005, [[Elizabeth II]] changed the order of precedence for private occasions, putting [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], fourth in the order of precedence, after herself, [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]], contrary to the usual position of the heir apparent's wife. Charles's first wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], had ranked above the Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra.{{cn|date=June 2020}} The Duchess of Cornwall continues to rank second in the order of precedence at official occasions, such as state dinners. 
* Princesses of the blood royal, such as [[Princess Beatrice of York]] and [[Princess Eugenie]], rank above [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] and [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]], when the latter are not accompanied by their husbands. When the Duchess of Cambridge or Duchess of Sussex are joined by their husbands, the roles are reversed with the duchesses outranking the princesses.
* The [[Court Circular]] lists [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], above his uncles, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].
* There is no specific place in the order for a great-grandchild of the sovereign (no matter how senior in the [[order of succession]]). The sons of a ''duke of the blood royal'' are entitled to precedence after all non-royal dukes, pursuant to the unrevoked Lord Chamberlain's Order of 1520 as amended in 1595. The daughters have the equivalent position in the women's order.<ref name="squibb">{{cite book | author=Squibb, G.

==Officers of State==
In England and Wales, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the highest in precedence following the royal family. Then come, assuming the post of [[Lord High Steward]] is vacant (as it usually has been since 1421), the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Archbishop of York]] and the [[Archbishop of Wales]]. Next come the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the [[Lord President of the Council|Lord President of the Privy Council]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]], the [[Lord Speaker]] of the [[House of Lords]] (since July 2006), the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (since October 2009), the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]] (since November 2007) and the [[Lord Privy Seal]].

The precedence of the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Earl Marshal]], the [[Lord Steward]] and the [[Lord Chamberlain]] are determined by the rank and class of the peerage of the holders of such offices.

In Scotland, the [[Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland]] and the [[Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland]], if Peers, rank after the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords. If not so, then they rank after the younger sons of dukes. The Hereditary [[High Constable of Scotland]] and the [[Master of the Household in Scotland]] rank above dukes. If the Keepers of the Seals are Peers, then the Keepers precede the High Constable and Master.
{{see also|Cabinet rank}}

==Peers of the Realm==
{{confusing|date=October 2018}}
The ranks of Peers are as follows: Duke (and Duchess), Marquess (and Marchioness), Earl (and Countess), Viscount (and Viscountess), and Baron (and Baroness) together with Scottish [[Lord of Parliament|Lord (and Lady) of Parliament]].

Within their own respective ranks, the rank of Peers correspond to the venerability (age) of the creation of their peerages, but the Peerage of England (pre-1707) takes precedence over the Peerage of Scotland (pre-1707), together taking precedence over the Peerage of Great Britain (1707–1801), together over the Pre-Union Peerage of Ireland (pre-1801), and together they all take precedence over either the senior Peerage of the United Kingdom (post-1801), or the junior Post-Union Peerage of Ireland (1801–1922).

Subject to the same governing rules as detailed in the paragraphs above {{clarify|date=October 2018}}, the rank of the wives of Peers is also governed by the venerability (age) of the peerage. A dowager Peeress (widow of a deceased Peer) would however always precede the wife of the present Peer.

Barons and Baronesses of the [[life peer]]age rank immediately below Barons and Baronesses of the hereditary peerage and Scottish Lords and Ladies in Parliament.

==Primates, archbishops, bishops, Scottish Lord High Commissioners and moderators==
In England and Wales, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Primate of All England, is the most senior person outside of Royalty, and after the [[Lord Chancellor]], immediately followed by the [[Archbishop of York]], Primate of England, and immediately followed by the [[Archbishop of Wales]]. Primates, archbishops and bishops of the [[Church of England]] in England and the [[Church in Wales]] rank immediately above Peers. First come the Bishops of London and Durham, followed by the Bishop of Winchester, followed by the other diocesan bishops in order of seniority, and then the suffragan bishops in order of seniority.

The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop in Europe|Anglican Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]], whose ''[[Episcopal see|Sees]]'' are full and integral parts of the Ecclesiastical [[Province of York|Provinces of York]] and [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]], respectively, are also usually included as suffragan bishops of the Church of England for the purpose of precedence.

See the [[list of Lords Spiritual]] for the most senior 21 diocesan bishops ordered by seniority.

In Scotland, the [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] ranks immediately below the sovereign or consort (depending on their respective sex), but only when the General Assembly is in session, and immediately followed by the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].

According to the ''unofficial'' order of precedence for Northern Ireland published by the publishers of ''[[Burke's Peerage]]'', 106th Edition, [http://www.burkes-peerage.co.uk/articles/Peerage/page62-4f.aspx ], the precedence of ''all'' of the primates and archbishops of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]] and the [[Church of Ireland]], together with the [[List of Moderators of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Moderator]] of the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], are to be determined solely by seniority, according to the dates of consecration or translation, or the date of election, in the case of the Presbyterian Moderator, without any presumption of automatic Roman Catholic or Protestant seniority, [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] or Presbyterian.

==Baronets, knights and holders of state honours==
The two highest [[Chivalric order|orders of chivalry]] in England and Wales, and in Scotland, are the Orders [[Order of the Garter|of the Garter]], and [[Order of the Thistle|the Thistle]], respectively. Knights of the Order of the Garter precede [[baronets]]. After the baronets come the members of all the other orders of chivalry in the following order of their ranks: [[Knight Grand Cross|Knight or Dame Grand Cross]], [[Knight Commander|Knight or Dame Commander]], Commander or Companion, Lieutenant or Officer, and Member. 

For individual members with equivalent ranks but of different orders, precedence is accorded based on the seniority of the orders of chivalry: the [[Order of the Bath]], the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]], and the [[Order of the British Empire]]. For equivalent ranks and orders, those appointed earlier precede those appointed later. [[Knight Bachelor|Knights Bachelor]] come after Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

Wives of Knights of the Garter, Knights of the Thistle, Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commanders, and Commanders or Companions receive precedence based on their husbands' positions. Wives of individuals of a certain rank follow in precedence after female holders of the same rank. Thus, wives of Knights Grand Cross follow Dames Grand Cross.

Wives of baronets go immediately above all Dames Grand Cross, but are below (though not immediately below) Ladies and Wives of Knights of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick. Baronets' widows follow rules similar to dowager peeresses; a widow of a previous baronet comes immediately before the wife of the present baronet.
