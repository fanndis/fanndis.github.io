The '''Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation''' is the head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the United States' primary [[Federal law|federal]] [[law enforcement agency]], and is responsible for its day-to-day operations. The FBI Director is appointed for a single 10-year term by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Directors, Then and Now |url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/directors |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=March 21, 2017 |language=en-us |quote=On October 15, 1976, in reaction to the extraordinary 48-year term of J.

The Director briefed the President on any issues that arose from within the FBI until the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]] was enacted following the [[September 11 attacks]].

=== Bureau of Investigation chiefs and directors (1908–1935) ===
When the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was established in 1908, its head was called Chief of the Bureau of Investigation.<ref name="DirectorsList">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/directors/the-position-of-fbi-director|title= The FBI Director: Background on the Position |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> It was changed to the Director of the Bureau of Investigation in the term of [[William J.

== Dismissals ==
Since the office's inception, only two Directors have been dismissed: [[William S. Sessions]] by President Bill Clinton in 1993, and [[James Comey]] by President Donald Trump in 2017. It is accepted that the holder of this post serves [[at the pleasure of the President]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-20/news/mn-15006_1_law-enforcement-agencies|work=Los Angeles Times|first1=Ronald J.|last1=Ostrow|first2=Robert L. |last2=Jackson|title=Defiant FBI Chief Is Fired by President : Law enforcement: Alleged ethical abuses by Sessions are cited as reason for dismissal. He refused to resign|date=July 20, 1993}}</ref>

=== William S. Sessions === 
Just before [[Bill Clinton]] was inaugurated as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1993, allegations of ethical improprieties were made against Sessions. A report by outgoing Attorney General [[William P. Barr]] presented to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] that month by the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] included criticisms that he had used an FBI plane to travel to visit his daughter on several occasions, and had a security system installed in his home at government expense.<ref name="Johnston">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/us/fbi-chief-plans-to-fight-for-job.html |work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Johnston|title=F.B.I. Chief Plans to Fight for Job|date=January 19, 1993}}</ref> [[Janet Reno]], the 78th [[Attorney General of the United States]], announced that Sessions had exhibited "serious deficiencies in judgment."<ref name="Time's Up for William Sessions">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/opinion/time-s-up-for-william-sessions.html |work=The New York Times|title=Time's Up for William Sessions|date=January 22, 1993}}</ref>

Although Sessions denied that he had acted improperly, he was pressured to resign in early July, with some suggesting that President Clinton was giving Sessions the chance to step down in a dignified manner. Sessions refused, saying that he had done nothing wrong, and insisted on staying in office until his successor was confirmed. As a result, President Clinton dismissed Sessions on July 19, 1993, five and a half years into a ten-year term. Clinton's public explanation was that there had been a loss of confidence in Sessions’ leadership, and then-Attorney General Reno recommended the dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-independent-is-the-fbis-director|title=How independent is the FBI’s director? - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}</ref>

[[Ronald Kessler]]'s book, ''The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency'', led to the dismissal by President Clinton of Sessions as FBI director over his abuses. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "A Justice Department official...noted that the original charges against Sessions came not from FBI agents but from a journalist, Ronald Kessler [who uncovered the abuses while writing a book about the FBI, leading to Sessions' dismissal by President Clinton]..."<ref>''The Washington Post'', June 19, 1993, p. A1; ''The Washington Post'', July 20, 1993, p.

Clinton nominated [[Louis Freeh]] to be FBI Director on July 20. Then-FBI Deputy Director, [[Floyd I. Clarke]], who Sessions suggested had led a coup to force his removal, served as Acting Director until September 1, 1993, when Freeh was sworn in.<ref>Johnston, David (July 20, 1993) [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/20/us/defiant-fbi-chief-removed-from-job-by-the-president.html "Defiant FBI chief removed from job by the President"], ''The New York Times''.</ref>

Comey's termination was immediately controversial, even being characterized as corrupt by news commentators. It was compared, by the aforementioned news outlets, to the [[Saturday Night Massacre]], President [[Richard Nixon]]'s termination of special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]], who had been investigating the [[Watergate scandal]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/09/white-house-fires-fbi-director-james-comey.html|publisher=The Daily Beast |title=CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin Goes Off on Trump for Firing Comey: ‘What Kind of Country Is This?’|author=Wilstein, Matt|date=May 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thesilicontimes.com/everyone-is-comparing-donald-trump-to-richard-nixon/|title=Everyone is comparing Donald Trump to Richard Nixon|publisher=The Silicon Times|date=May 9, 2017|author=Abbruzzese, Jason|access-date=May 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730011516/http://thesilicontimes.com/everyone-is-comparing-donald-trump-to-richard-nixon/|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and to the firing of Acting Attorney General [[Sally Yates]] in January 2017.

In the dismissal letter Trump stated that Comey had asserted “on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation" which was later confirmed by Comey to the Senate while under oath.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox59.com/2017/05/09/fbi-director-james-comey-fired-by-president-trump/ |title=FBI Director James Comey fired by President Trump|author=Associated Press|date=May 9, 2017 |publisher=Fox59}}</ref> This is disputed by reporting from multiple news agencies with multiple sources. According to the reporting, Trump had been openly talking about firing Mr. Comey for at least a week before his dismissal. Trump and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leaders had long questioned Comey's judgment. Moreover, Trump was angry that Comey would not support his claim that President [[Barack Obama]] had his campaign offices wiretapped, frustrated when Comey revealed in Senate testimony the breadth of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's effort to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that Comey was giving too much attention to the Russia probe and not to internal leaks within the government. On May 8, 2017, he gave Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein a directive to explain in writing a case against Comey. That directive was forwarded to Trump as a recommendation to dismiss Comey the following day, which Trump did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Haberman|first1=Maggie |last2=Thrush|first2=Glenn|title=‘Enough Was Enough’: How Festering Anger at Comey Ended in His Firing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/how-trump-decided-to-fire-james-comey.html|website=The New York Times |accessdate=May 11, 2017|date=May 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dawsey|first1=Josh|title='He got tired of him' |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/comey-firing-trump-loyalty-238239|website=POLITICO|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Parker|first2=Ashley|last3=Barrett|first3=Devlin|last4=Costa|first4=Robert |title=Inside Trump’s anger and impatience – and his sudden decision to fire Comey|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trumps-anger-and-impatience-prompted-him-to-fire-the-fbi-director/2017/05/10/d9642334-359c-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html |website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Comey first learned of his termination from television news reports that flashed on screen while he was delivering a speech to agents at the Los Angeles Field Office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/05/09/us/politics/ap-us-trump-comey-the-latest.html|title=The Latest: Comey Learned of Ouster as He Spoke at FBI in LA|last=The Associated Press|date=May 9, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 10, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Sources said he was surprised and caught off guard by the termination. Comey immediately departed for Washington, D.C., and was forced to cancel his scheduled speech that night at an FBI recruitment event at the [[Directors Guild of America]] in Hollywood, California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-comey-los-angeles-20170509-story.html|title=Comey was 'caught flat-footed' and learned of firing from TV while talking to FBI agents in L.A., source says|last=Winton|first=Richard|date=May 9, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 10, 2017|last2=Queally|first2=James |language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In the absence of a Senate-confirmed FBI Director, Deputy Director [[Andrew McCabe]] automatically became the acting director, serving until the confirmation of [[Christopher A.
