Originally, Anders Lange wanted the party to be an anti-tax protest movement rather than a common political party. The party had a brief political platform on a single sheet of paper that on one side listed ten things the party was "tired of", and on the other side ten things that they were in favour of.{{Sfn|Arter|1999|p=105}} The protest was directed against what Lange claimed to be an unacceptable high level of taxes and [[subsidy|subsidies]].<ref name=saga>{{cite web|url=http://virksommeord.uib.no/taler?id=103|title=Anders Lange's speech at Saga Kino, 8 April 1973|publisher=Virksomme Ord|accessdate=11 November 2009|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230050802/http://virksommeord.uib.no/taler?id=103|archive-date=30 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the [[1973 Norwegian parliamentary election|1973 parliamentary election]], the party won 5 percent of the vote and gained four seats in the [[Stortinget|Norwegian parliament]]. The main reasons for the success has later been seen by scholars as a mixture of tax protests, the charisma of Anders Lange, the role of television, the aftermath of the [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972 European Community membership referendum]] and the political development in Denmark.{{Sfn|Jungar|Jupskås|2010|p=5}} The first party conference was held in [[Hjelmeland]] in 1974, where the party established its first political conventions.<ref name=svfrp>{{cite web|url=http://www.svelvik-frp.no/websider/historie.htm|title=Fremskrittspartets historie|trans-title=History of the Progress Party|publisher=Svelvik FrP|date=30 April 2003|last=Sandnes|first=Børge|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724184523/http://www.svelvik-frp.no/websider/historie.htm|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Progress Party and Carl I. Hagen ===
In early 1974, Kristofer Almås, Deputy Member of Parliament [[Carl I. Hagen]], along with some others, broke away and formed the short-lived [[Reform Party (Norway, 1974)|Reform Party]].<ref name=tv2frp>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/frps-historie-2577871.html|title=FrPs historie|trans-title=History of the Frp|publisher=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV2]]|first=Kjetil|last=Løset|date=15 June 2009|accessdate=11 November 2009|language=no}}</ref> The background for this was a criticism of ALPs "undemocratic organisation" and lack of a real party program. However, in the same year, Anders Lange died; consequently Hagen stepped in as a regular Member of Parliament in Lange's place. As a result, the Reform Party merged back into ALP already the following year. The party adopted its current name, the ''Progress Party'', on 29 January 1977, inspired by the great success of the Danish Progress Party.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Store norske leksikon]] | url = http://www.snl.no/Fremskrittspartiet/Frp|title=Fremskrittspartiet – Frp|trans-title=The Progress Party – Frp | first = Knut Are|last=Tvedt|author-link=Knut Are Tvedt|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=11 November 2009|language=no}}</ref> The Progress Party performed poorly in the [[1977 Norwegian parliamentary election|1977 parliamentary election]], and was left without parliamentary representation. In the 1978 party convention, Carl I. Hagen was elected as party chairman. Hagen soon started to expand the political program of the party, and built a conventional party organisation, a step which Lange and some of his followers had opposed.<ref name=kinos/>{{Sfn|Arter|1999|p=106}} The party's youth organisation, the [[Progress Party's Youth]], was also established in 1978.<ref name=dbmg/> Hagen succeeded in sharpening the image of the party as an anti-tax movement. His criticism of the wisdom of hoarding billions of dollars in the "[[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|Oil Fund]]" hit a nerve owing to perceived declines in infrastructure, schools, and [[social service]]s and long queues at hospitals.<ref name=afp040506>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article1303263.ece|work=[[Aftenposten]]|title=Fra parentes til mektig partieier|trans-title=From parenthesis to powerful party owner|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|date=4 May 2006|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604122155/http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article1303263.ece|archive-date=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

While the Progress Party dropped out of parliament altogether in 1977, it returned in the following [[1981 Norwegian parliamentary election|1981 parliamentary election]] with four representatives. In this election, the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support.<ref name=dbmg>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2001/03/05/245386.html|work=[[Dagbladet Magasinet]]|title=Fremskritt fra dag en|trans-title=Progress from day one|date=5 March 2001|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no}}</ref> The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared that it was a libertarian party at its national convention in [[Sandefjord]] in 1983.{{Sfn|Simonsen|2007|p=40}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=44073&page=5&query=%22carl+i.+hagen%22+ideologi&date=2.5.1983|title=Ønsker samarbeide med Høyre på sikt: Liberalismen Fr.p.s nye ideologi|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first=Per|last=Danielsen|accessdate=28 November 2010|language=no|date=2 May 1983|page=5|quote=Fremskrittspartiet ønsker et samarbeide med Høyre.

The first real breakthrough for the party in Norwegian politics came in the [[1987 Norwegian local elections|1987 local elections]], when the party nearly doubled its support from 6.3% to 12.3% (county results). This was largely as immigration was for the first time seriously taken up as an issue by the party (although Hagen had already in the late 1970s called for a strongly restrictive immigration policy),<ref name=afp040506/> successfully putting the issue on the national agenda.{{Sfn|Skjørestad|2008|p=40}} Its campaign had mainly been focused on the issue of [[asylum seeker]]s,{{Sfn|Hagelund|2005|p=152}} but was additionally helped by the infamous "[[Mustafa-letter]]", a letter read out by Hagen during the electoral campaign that portrayed the [[Counter-jihad|future Islamisation of Norway]].<ref name=tv2frp/>{{Sfn|Hagelund|2005|p=155}} In April 1988 the party was for the first time the second largest party in Norway in an opinion poll with 23.5%.<ref name=dbmg/> In September 1988, the party further proposed in parliament for a referendum on the immigration policy, which was regarded by political scientists as the start of the party's 1989 election campaign.<ref name=aft279>{{Cite news|title=Hagen: Folket må selv bestemme innvandring|trans-title=Hagen: The people must make the decions on immigration themselves|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=75229&page=10&query=folkeavstemning+innvandring&date=27.9.1988|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=27 September 1988|accessdate=13 October 2010|language=no|first=Geir|last=Salvesen}}</ref> In 1989, the party made its breakthrough in national politics.

=== 1990s: libertarian schism and consolidation ===
{{further|1994 Progress Party national convention}}
The [[1993 Norwegian parliamentary election|1993 parliamentary election]] halved the party's support to 6.3% and ten members of parliament. This drop in support can be seen as the result of an internal conflict within the party that came to a head in 1992, between the more radical libertarian minority and the majority led by Carl I. Hagen.<ref name=ssjsnl>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Siv_Jensen/utdypning|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Helle, Knut |title=Siv Jensen|first=Lise Merete|last=Olaussen|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no|editor-link=Knut Helle}}</ref>{{Sfn|Simonsen|2007|p=5}} The libertarians had removed the party's focus on immigration, declaring it a "non-issue" in the early 1990s, which was heavily punished by voters in 1993, as well as 1991.<ref>"Det nye landet: Kampen", 26 January 2010.

While many of the libertarians, including [[Pål Atle Skjervengen]] and [[Tor Mikkel Wara]], had left the party before the 1993 election<ref name=dbmg/> or had been rejected by voters,{{Sfn|Simonsen|2007|p=42}} the conflict finally culminated in 1994. Following the party conference at ''Bolkesjø Hotell'' in [[Telemark]] in April of that year, four MPs of the "libertarian wing" in the party broke off as [[Independent (politician)|independents]]. This was because Hagen had given them an ultimatum to adhere to the political line of the party majority and parliamentary group, or else to leave.<ref name=dbmg/> This incident was later nicknamed "[[1994 Progress Party national convention|Dolkesjø]]", a [[pun]] on the name of the hotel, with "dolke" meaning to "[[Literal translation|lit.]] stab (in the back) /betray".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.no/no/Mot_oss/Historie/Fakta_Kort_om_partiets_historie/|publisher=FrP.no|title=Kort om partiets historie|trans-title=Briefly on the party's history|accessdate=17 February 2010|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716202750/http://www.frp.no/no/Mot_oss/Historie/Fakta_Kort_om_partiets_historie/|archive-date=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

These events have been seen by political scientists as a turning point for the party.{{Sfn|Skjørestad|2008|p=9}} Subsequently the libertarians founded a libertarian organisation called the [[Free Democrats (Norway)|Free Democrats]] which tried to establish a political party, but without success. Parts of the younger management of the party and the more libertarian youth organisation of the party also broke away, and even tried to disestablish the entire youth organisation.{{Sfn|Skjørestad|2008|p=42}} The youth organisation was however soon running again, this time with more "loyal" members, although it remained more libertarian than its mother organisation. After this, the Progress Party had a more [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] profile, which resulted in it gaining electoral support.<ref name =snl/>

In the [[1995 Norwegian local elections|1995 local elections]] the Progress Party regained the level of support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been as a result of a focus on Progress Party core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the [[1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.no/no/Mot_oss/Historie/|publisher=Frp.no|title=Fremskrittspartiets historie: Valgåret 1995|trans-title=The history of the Progress Party: The election year 1995|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125145458/http://www.frp.no/no/Mot_oss/Historie/|archive-date=25 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001990047545|title=Pitbullene er løs!|trans-title=The pitbullsa re lose!|first=Halvor|last=Elvik|work=[[Dagbladet]]|date=3 September 1999|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no}}</ref> The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=74894&page=4&query=fremskrittspartiet&date=8.9.1995|title=Velgerstrøm til Fr.p.|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first=Carsten|last=Bleness|accessdate=28 November 2010|language=no|date=8 September 1995|page=4}}</ref> In the [[1997 Norwegian parliamentary election|1997 parliamentary election]], the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway.

In the [[2001 Norwegian parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary election]] the party lost the gains it had made according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] government of [[Jens Stoltenberg]] and replace it with a [[Bondevik's Second Cabinet|three-party coalition]] led by [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrat]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]]. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1603256.stm|work=[[BBC Online]] |title=Norway far-right sets new course|date=16 October 2001|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/nyheter/30521/article/item/null|work=[[Klassekampen]]|title=Høyre taper til Frp|trans-title=Conservative Party loses to the Frp|first=Bjørgulv|last=Braanen|author-link=Bjørgulv Braanen|date=2 May 2002|accessdate=27 August 2010|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135508/http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/nyheter/30521/article/item/null|archive-date=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/nyheter/30752/article/item/null|work=[[Klassekampen]]|title=Trussel mot demokratiet|trans-title=A threat to democracy|first1=Espen|last1=Løkeland-Stai|author2=Marsdal, Magnus|author-link2=Magnus E.

The Progress Party withdrew from the government coalition in January 2020.

The position of the Progress Party was that no such person should receive assistance to return to Norway.

The party officially identifies itself in the preamble of its platform as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] (''liberalistisk''; "liberal", "[[Libertarian party|libertarian]]"){{Sfn|Widfeldt|2014|p=95-96}} party, built on Norwegian and Western traditions and [[cultural heritage]], with a basis in a Christian understanding of life and [[Humanism|humanist]] values.<ref name=pri>{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.no/no/Vi_mener/Prinsipprogram_2009-2013/|publisher=FrP.no|title=Fremskrittspartiets prinsipper 2009–2013|accessdate=8 August 2010|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904021954/http://www.frp.no/no/Vi_mener/Prinsipprogram_2009-2013/|archive-date=4 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its main declared goal is a strong reduction in taxes and government intervention.<ref name=pri/>

Many within the party reject the description of the party as liberal. The party has a wing that identifies itself as economically liberal or libertarian, and a wing that identifies itself as [[national conservative]] and that focuses strongly on [[anti-immigration]] politics.

The core issues for the party revolve around immigration, crime, [[foreign aid]], the [[elderly]] and [[social security]] in regards to health and care for the elderly.

=== Economy ===
The party aims to reduce the power of the state and the public sector. It believes that the public sector should only be there to secure a minimum standard of living, and that individuals, businesses and organisations should take care of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various [[duty (economics)|duties]], as well increased [[market economy]].<ref name=ndla/>

The party regards the family to be a natural, necessary and fundamental element in a free society.

The party believes that artists should be less dependent on public support, and instead be more dependent on making a living on what they create. The party believes that regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants.

The party supports an increase in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an [[ombudsman]] for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus too much on the criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police to be able to use more [[non-lethal weapon]]s, such as [[electroshock weapon]]s. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.<ref name=frpjus>{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.no/?module=Files;action=File.getFile;ID=29859|title=Vi mener: Justispolitikk |accessdate=26 November 2010|language=no|publisher=FrP.no|format=PDF}}</ref>

The party sees the most viable form of [[foreign aid]] policy to be for [[developing countries]] to gradually manage themselves without Western aid. It believes that [[free trade]] is the key for developing countries to gain economic growth, and that "the relationship between aid and development is at best unclear." The party is strongly critical of "forced contribution to government development aid through taxation", which it wants to limit, also as it believe this weakens the individual's personal sense of responsibility and generosity (voluntary aid). The party instead supports an increase in support for global health and vaccination initiatives against global epidemics such as HIV, AIDS and [[tuberculosis]], and to increase the support after emergencies and disasters.<ref name="frputv">{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.no/no/Vi_mener/|title=Vi mener: Utviklingspolitikk|accessdate=26 November 2010|language=no|publisher=FrP.no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203075801/http://www.frp.no/no/Vi_mener/|archive-date=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
