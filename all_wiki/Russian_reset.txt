The '''Russian reset''' was an attempt by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] to improve relations between the [[Russia–United States relations|United States and Russia]] in 2009–13.

==Symbolic reset==

On 6 March 2009 in Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] presented Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] with a red button with the English word "reset" and the [[Roman alphabet]] transliteration of the Russian [[Cyrillic alphabet]] word перегрузка ("peregruzka"). It was intended that this would be the Russian word for "reset" but actually was the word for "overload".<ref name="TimeNewReset">{{cite web | url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1971651,00.html | title=U.S.-Russia Relations: In Need of a New Reset | accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Shuster, Simon}}</ref> (The correct translation would be перезагрузка ["perezagruzka"].)  Additionally, the button switch was the type commonly used as an emergency stop on industrial equipment. Hillary Clinton was later praised by the Russian diplomats for resolving the issue politely, stating her team's good intentions. Lavrov and Clinton pushed the button simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web |title=В МИД рассказали, как Клинтон подарила Лаврову кнопку "перегрузка" |trans-title=The Foreign Ministry on How Clinton Gave Lavrov the "Overload" Button|url=https://ria.ru/20190306/1551585020.html |website=ria.ru |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |accessdate=10 November 2020 |language=ru |date=6 March 2019}}</ref>

==Substantive reset==

Prior to the reset, US-Russia relations had been hurt by the [[2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis]] in [[Ossetia]] and the [[Russo-Georgian War]], leading to [[Immediate Response 2008]] by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].  In private, several Obama administration officials expressed doubts about the reset and were concerned that it was overly optimistic, particularly Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] and U.S. ambassador to Russia [[John Beyrle]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|title=U.S.-Russian Ties Still Fall Short of ‘Reset’ Goal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/europe/us-russian-ties-still-fall-short-of-reset-goal.html|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=New York Times|date=2 September 2013}}</ref>

In July 2009, Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced that U.S. forces and supplies could pass through Russian airspace on their way to [[Afghanistan]]. On 17 September 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the U.S. was dropping the Bush Administration's plan to build a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe. Russia had viewed the planned missile shield as a military threat. [[Vladimir Putin]] said the decision was "correct and brave". In March, 2010, the U.S. and Russia agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals.<ref>{{cite news| first=Peter| last=Baker|author2=Ellen Barry| title=Russia and U.S. Report Breakthrough on Arms| date=2010-03-24| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25start.html| work=The New York Times| accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>

In May 2010, major powers including the U.S., [[China]] and Russia agreed on sanctions against [[Iran]]. Three days later, the Obama Administration cancelled sanctions against the Russian state arms export agency, which had been sanctioned for exporting arms to Iran.<ref name="NYTConcessions">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/world/22sanctions.html?_r=0 | title=U.S. Makes Concessions to Russia for Iran Sanctions | accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Peter Baker | author2=David E.

In response to the adoption of the [[Magnitsky Act]] in 2012, the Russian government [[Dima Yakovlev Law|denied Americans adoption of Russian children]] and issued a list of US officials prohibited from entering Russia.

At the 2015 [[Munich Security Conference]], Vice President Biden specified the substantive progress, and setbacks: {{Quote|[...] once we pressed that reset button in 2009, between then and 2012, we achieved a great deal in cooperation with Russia to advance our mutual interests and I would argue the interests of Europe -- the [[New START Treaty]] that reduced our strategic nuclear arsenal by one-third; a vital supply route for coalition troops in and out of Afghanistan; at the United Nations Security Council, resolutions that pressured [[North Korea]] and Iran and made possible serious nuclear discussions in Tehran, which continue as I speak.

All of us, we all invested in a type of Russia we hoped -— and still hope -— will emerge one day: a Russia integrated into the world economy; more prosperous, more invested in the international order.

It was in that same spirit that we supported the establishment of the [[NATO-Russia Council]] and Russian membership in countless other institutions, from the [[Council of Europe]] to the [[WTO]]. Unfortunately, and I mean it when I say unfortunately, as the [[Angela Merkel|Chancellor]] pointed out this morning, President Putin has chosen a different path.|source=[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/07/remarks-vice-president-munich-security-conference Munich, February 07, 2015]}}

==Subsequent deterioration of relations==
As early as the March 2014, censure of Russia by the United Nations over the Russian [[annexation]] of [[Crimea]], the days after ousted pro-Russian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] fled Ukraine, the reset was described in the press as "failed". Stated reasons included the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]], the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], and lack of Russian cooperation with the U.S. on [[Syria]]. Former Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Adam Rotfeld]] stated that the reset showed "weakness".  [[Jeb Bush]] also called the reset a failure, stating that Russia had "invaded [[Ukraine]]", which Russia had not done prior to the reset.  He said that Putin was a "bully" and that "nuanced" behavior by the U.S. towards Putin tended to "enable bad behavior." Russia denied that it had sent troops into Ukraine. However, Hillary Clinton defended the reset as a "brilliant stroke", pointing to the Russian agreement to sanctions against Iran and permission to fly over its territory to supply joint NATO troops in Afghanistan.<ref name="LATimesJebBush">{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-bush-putin-20150610-story.html | title=Jeb Bush calls Putin a 'bully'| accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Mehta, Seema}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/03/17/the-failure-of-the-u-s-russia-reset-in-9-photos/ | title=The failure of the U.S.-Russia reset in 9 photos | accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Taylor, Adam}}</ref><ref name="TimeFailed">{{cite web | url=http://time.com/2819889/obama-russia-europe-poland/ | title=A Failed Russia ‘Reset’ Haunts Obama in Europe | accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Shuster, Simon}}</ref><ref name=brillianStroke>{{cite web | url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/clinton-russian-reset-brilliant-stroke/ | title=Clinton: Russian Reset ‘Brilliant Stroke’ |website=FreeBeacon.com |publisher= | accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>

In October 2014, Medvedev said that a reset of relations with the U.S. was "impossible", and that relations had been damaged by "destructive" and "stupid" Western sanctions against Russia. The sanctions had been imposed because of the Ukraine crisis and the shooting down of flight [[MH17]], which Western powers said was the result of a missile fired from rebel-controlled territory.<ref name=impossible>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102086463 | title=Russia-US relations reset ‘impossible’: PM Medvedev | accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>

In April 2015, CNN reported that "Russian hackers" had "penetrated sensitive parts of the White House" computers in "recent months."  It was said that the FBI, the Secret Service, and other U.S. intelligence agencies categorized the attacks "among the most sophisticated attacks ever launched against U.S. government systems."<ref>{{cite news|author=Evan Perez|author2=Shimon Prokupecz|title=How the U.S. thinks Russians hacked the White House|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/07/politics/how-russians-hacked-the-wh/index.html|accessdate=17 December 2016|work=CNN|date=8 April 2015|quote=Russian hackers behind the damaging cyber intrusion of the State Department in recent months used that perch to penetrate sensitive parts of the White House computer system, according to U.S. officials briefed on the investigation.}}</ref>

In April 2016, two Russian jets flew over the US destroyer USS Donald Cook almost a dozen times, American officials said. At one point the jets were so close - about 9&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) - that they created wakes in the water around the ship. The jets had no visible weaponry and the ship took no action.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36043826 | title=Russia denies breaking rules over low pass of US destroyer | accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>

This sharp decline in relations has been termed [[Cold War II]] by some.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/04/welcome-to-cold-war-ii/ |title=Welcome to Cold War II |author=Dmitri Trenin |date=4 March 2014 |website=Foreign Policy |publisher=Graham Holdings |accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>
