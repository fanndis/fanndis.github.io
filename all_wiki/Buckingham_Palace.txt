'''Buckingham Palace''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|b|ʌ|k|ɪ|ŋ|ə|m}})<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/buckingham?showCookiePolicy=true |title=Buckingham |date=n.d. |publisher=Collins Dictionary |access-date=23 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/palace?showCookiePolicy=true |title=Palace |date=n.d. |publisher=Collins Dictionary |access-date=23 September 2014}}</ref> is the [[London]] [[official residence|residence]] and administrative headquarters of the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]].{{efn|By tradition, the [[Court of St James's|British Royal Court]] is officially resident at [[St James's Palace]], which means that, while foreign [[ambassador]]s assuming their new position are received by the [[British sovereign]] at Buckingham Palace, they are accredited to the "Court of St James's Palace". This anomaly continues for the sake of tradition, as Buckingham Palace is to all intents and purposes the [[official residence]]. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20100529122601/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/History.aspx History of St James's Palace] (Official website of the British Monarchy).}}<ref name="royal.uk">{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-residences-buckingham-palace |title=Buckingham Palace |last=Royal Household |date=12 November 2015 |website=Royal Family website |access-date=21 April 2016}}</ref> Located in the [[City of Westminster]], the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the [[British people]] at times of national rejoicing and mourning.

Originally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building at the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by [[King George&nbsp;III]] in 1761<ref name="rob14">Robinson, p. 14.</ref> as a private residence for [[Queen Charlotte]] and became known as ''The Queen's House''. During the 19th&nbsp;century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[Edward Blore]], who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837.

The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the [[British royal family]] traditionally congregates to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the [[Second World War]]; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough|Sir&nbsp;Charles Long]]. [[King Edward&nbsp;VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle Époque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The palace has 775 rooms, and [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the garden]] is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.

==History==

===Site===
[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|Buckingham House, c. 1710, was designed by [[William Winde]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.<!--note - "Normanby" is correct spelling, do not change please --> This façade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above it.]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], the site of the future palace formed part of the [[Manor of Ebury]] (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.<ref>Goring, p. 15.</ref> Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th&nbsp;century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{efn|The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1–4.}}

In 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St&nbsp;James, which became [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]],<ref>Goring, p. 28.</ref> from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.<ref>Goring, p. 18.</ref> These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair |work=[[Survey of London]] |publisher=London County Council |year=1977 |volume=39 |pages=1–5 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Acquisition of the Estate |access-date=3 February 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820}}</ref>

Various owners leased it from royal landlords, and the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th&nbsp;century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.<ref>Wright, pp. 76–78.</ref> Needing money, [[James&nbsp;I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today's palace.)<ref>Goring, pp. 31, 36.</ref> [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to "new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th&nbsp;century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir&nbsp;[[Hugh Audley]] by the great heiress Mary Davies.{{efn|Audley and Davies were key figures in the development of Ebury Manor and also the Grosvenor Estate (see [[dukes of Westminster]]), which still exists today. They are remembered in the streetnames North Audley Street, [[South Audley Street]], and Davies Street, all in [[Mayfair]].}}

===First houses on the site===

====Goring House====
Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir&nbsp;William Blake, around 1624.<ref>Wright, p. 83.</ref> The next owner was [[George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich|Lord Goring]], who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden.<ref>Goring, Chapter V</ref><ref name="Harris, p.21">Harris, p. 21.</ref> He did not, however, obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document "failed to pass the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] before [[Charles I of England|King Charles&nbsp;I]] fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution".<ref>Wright, p. 96.</ref> It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under [[King George&nbsp;III]].<ref>Goring, p. 62.</ref>

====Arlington House====
When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rents<ref>Goring, p. 58.</ref> [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington]] was able to purchase the lease of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in 1674,<ref name="Harris, p.21" /> following which he constructed Arlington House on the site—the location of the southern wing of today's palace—the next year.<ref name="Harris, p.21" /> In 1698, [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|John Sheffield]], later the first [[Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]], acquired the lease.<ref name="who built">{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/buckinghampalace/about/who-built-the-palace |title=Who built Buckingham Palace? |publisher=Royal Collection Trust |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624153126/https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/buckinghampalace/about/who-built-the-palace |archive-date=24 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Buckingham House====
[[File:Buckingham Palace engraved by J.Woods after Hablot Browne & R.Garland publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|The palace c. 1837, depicting the [[Marble Arch]], which served as the ceremonial entrance to the Palace precincts. It was moved to make way for the east wing, built in 1847, which enclosed the quadrangle.]]
The house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]]<!--note - "Normanby" is correct spelling, do not change please --> in 1703 to the design of [[William Winde]]. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.<ref>Harris, p. 22.</ref> Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's illegitimate son, [[Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Sheffield]], in 1761<ref name="rob14" /> to George&nbsp;III for [[Pound (currency)|£]]21,000.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 12 and Nash, p. 18.</ref>{{efn|The purchase price is given by Wright p. 142 as £28,000.}} Sheffield's [[leasehold]] on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 12</ref>

===From Queen's House to palace===
{{anchor|Queen's House}}<!-- [[Queen's House (disambiguation)]] links here-->
Under the new Crown ownership, the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George&nbsp;III's wife, [[Queen Charlotte]], and was accordingly known as '''The Queen's House'''. Remodelling of the structure began in 1762.<ref>Harris, p. 24.</ref> In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to [[Somerset House]],<ref name="Old and New">{{Cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45183 |title=Old and New London |publisher=Cassell, Petter & Galpin |year=1878 |volume=4 |pages=61–74}}</ref>{{efn|The tradition persists of foreign ambassadors being formally accredited to "the [[Court of St James's]]", even though it is at Buckingham Palace that they present their credentials and staff to the Monarch upon their appointment.}} and 14 of her 15 children were born there. Some furnishings were transferred from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], and others had been bought in France after the [[French Revolution]]<ref>Jones, p. 42.</ref> of 1789. While [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]] remained the official and ceremonial royal residence,<ref name="Old and New" /> the name "Buckingham-palace" was used from at least 1791.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Zg-AAAAYAAJ |title=The Annual Register |year=1791 |editor-last=Burke |editor-first=Edmund |page=8 |quote=Buckingham-palace was the dwelling house of the king. |access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref>

After his accession to the throne in 1820, [[King George&nbsp;IV]] continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. However, in 1826, while the work was in progress, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]].<ref>Harris, pp. 30–31.</ref> The external façade was designed, keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George&nbsp;IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as the architect. On the death of George&nbsp;IV in 1830, his younger brother [[King William&nbsp;IV]] hired [[Edward Blore]] to finish the work.<ref>Harris, p. 33.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/History.aspx |title=The Royal Residences > Buckingham Palace > History |publisher=www.royal.gov.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328161802/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/History.aspx |archive-date=28 March 2010}}</ref> After the destruction of the [[Palace of Westminster]] by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.<ref>{{Cite book |title=King William IV |last=[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] |publisher=Collins |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-00-211934-4 |page=280}}</ref>

Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |title=The Royal Residences > Buckingham Palace |publisher=www.royal.gov.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327220845/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |archive-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> who was the first monarch to reside there; her predecessor William&nbsp;IV had died before its completion.<ref>Hedley, p. 10.</ref> While the [[state room]]s were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the palace was often cold.<ref name="ws249">Woodham-Smith, p. 249.</ref> Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty.<ref name="ws249" /> Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], concerned himself with a reorganisation of the [[Royal Household|household]] offices and staff, and with addressing the design faults of the palace.<ref name="Rappaport">Rappaport, p. 84.</ref> By the end of 1840, all the problems had been rectified. However, the builders were to return within the decade.<ref name="Rappaport">Rappaport, p. 84.</ref>

By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family,<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 33.</ref> and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by [[Thomas Cubitt]],<ref>''Holland & Hannen and Cubitts&nbsp;– The Inception and Development of a Great Building Firm'', published 1920, p. 35.</ref> enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front, facing [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], is today the "public face" of Buckingham Palace, and contains the balcony from which the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual [[Trooping the Colour]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/feature/history-buckingham-palace-balcony-appearance-focal-point-national-celebration |title=Buckingham Palace's balcony: a focal point for national celebration |last=Owens |first=Ed |publisher=Immediate Media/BBC |access-date=12 June 2017}}</ref> The [[ballroom]] wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student [[James Pennethorne|Sir&nbsp;James Pennethorne]].<ref name="Twilight">King, p. 217.</ref>

Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments,<ref>Hedley, p. 19.</ref> and the most celebrated contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. The composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]] is known to have played there on three occasions.<ref>Healey, pp. 137–138.</ref> [[Johann Strauss&nbsp;II]] and his orchestra played there when in England.<ref>Healey, p. 122.</ref> Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the usual royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/buckinghampalace/about/who-has-lived-at-the-palace |title=Who has lived at Buckingham Palace? |publisher=Royal Collection Trust |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623215833/https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/buckinghampalace/about/who-has-lived-at-the-palace |archive-date=23 June 2017 |access-date=12 June 2017}}</ref>

Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at [[Windsor Castle]], [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Osborne House]]. For many years the palace was seldom used, even neglected. In 1864, a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace, saying: "These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late occupant's declining business."<ref name="Gardiner2006">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dipe9nVHV3cC&pg=PA142 |title=The Victorians: An Age in Retrospect |last=John Gardiner |publisher=A&C Black |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-85285-560-4 |page=142}}</ref> Eventually, public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black, while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.<ref name="rob9">Robinson, p. 9.</ref>

The principal rooms are contained on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and {{convert|55|yd|m}} long.<ref name="Harris, p.41">Harris, p. 41.</ref> The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by [[Rembrandt]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]];<ref>Harris, pp. 78–79 and Healey, pp. 387–388.</ref> other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the [[Throne Room]] and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase.<ref name="Harris, p.41" /> The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining but are open to the public every summer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace |title=Visit the State Rooms, Buckingham Palace |publisher=Royal Collection Trust |access-date=7 February 2016}}</ref>

Directly underneath the [[State room|State Apartments]] are the less grand semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private [[Head of state|audiences]]. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the ''1844 Room'', decorated in that year for the state visit of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]], and the ''1855 Room'', in honour of the visit of Emperor [[Napoleon&nbsp;III of France]].<ref>Harris, p. 81.</ref> At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's [[garden parties]].<ref>Harris, p. 40.</ref> The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.<ref name="Packard1982">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfk_5uIFtqIC |title=The Queen and Her Court: A Guide to the British Monarchy Today |last=Packard, Jerrold M. |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-684-17648-2 |page=48}}</ref>

[[File:Duke of Edinburgh 9 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|The Duke of Edinburgh in the Chinese Luncheon Room]]
Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the [[Brighton Pavilion]] was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by [[Robert Jones (designer)|Robert Jones]] and sculpted by [[Richard Westmacott]].<ref name="Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 87.">Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 87.</ref> It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion.<ref name="Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 87." /> The ornate clock, known as the [[Qilin|Kylin Clock]], was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by [[Benjamin Vulliamy]] circa 1820.<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 135.</ref> The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and fearsome winged [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], designed by Robert Jones.<ref>Healey, pp. 159–160.</ref>

At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer [[Sir&nbsp;Charles Allom]], created a more "binding"<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 93.</ref> Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the [[lacquer]] doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the ''piano nobile'' of the east wing is the Great Gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle.<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 91.</ref> It has mirrored doors and mirrored cross walls reflecting [[porcelain]] pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room in between.<ref name="HarrisBellaigue1968">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pscQAQAAMAAJ |title=Buckingham Palace and its Treasures |last=John Harris |last2=Geoffrey De Bellaigue |last3=Oliver Millar |publisher=Viking Press |year=1968 |page=90}}</ref>

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of Sir&nbsp;Charles Long. [[King Edward&nbsp;VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a [[Belle Époque|Belle époque]] cream and gold colour scheme.<ref name="Jones43">Jones, p. 43.</ref>

When paying a state visit to Britain, foreign [[heads of state]] are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated an extensive  suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. Narrow corridors link the rooms of the suite, one of them is given extra height and perspective by [[saucer dome]]s designed by Nash in the style of Soane.<ref name="harrisp82">Harris, p. 82.</ref> A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced [[Vault (architecture)|cross-over vaulting]].<ref name="harrisp82" /> The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after King [[Leopold I of Belgium]], uncle of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when [[King Edward&nbsp;VIII]] occupied them.<ref name="fact" />

===Court ceremonies===

====Investitures====
[[Investiture]]s, which include the conferring of [[knight]]hoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace's Ballroom, built in 1854. At {{convert|36.6|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}} wide and {{convert|13.5|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} high,<ref name="fact" /> it is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the throne room in importance and use. During investitures, the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, known as a [[shamiana]] or a [[baldachin]], that was used at the [[Delhi Durbar]] in 1911.<ref>Harris, p. 72.</ref> A military band plays in the musicians' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their [[honour]]s, watched by their families and friends.<ref name="Healey, p.364">Healey, p. 364.</ref>

====Other ceremonies and functions====
Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the "1844 Room". Here too, the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room or the State Dining Room.<ref name="Healey, pp. 363–365">Healey, pp. 363–365.</ref> Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War&nbsp;II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room.

Formerly, men not wearing [[military uniform]] wore knee [[breeches]] of 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and [[tiara]]s or feathers in their hair (often both). The dress code governing formal [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniform and dress]] has progressively relaxed. After the [[First World War]], when [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a [[lady-in-waiting]] to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King's reaction. [[King George&nbsp;V]] disapproved, so the Queen kept her hemline unfashionably low.<ref>Healey, p. 233, quoting ''The Memoirs of Mabell, Countess of Airlie'', edited and arranged by Jennifer Ellis, London: Hutchinson, 1962.</ref> Following his accession in 1936, [[King George&nbsp;VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code.<ref name="fact" /> Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear [[service uniform]] or [[lounge suit]]s;<ref name="fact" /> a minority wear [[morning coat]]s, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, [[black tie]] or [[white tie]].<ref name="Seldon1999">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj2AAAAAIAAJ |title=10 Downing Street: The Illustrated History |last=Anthony Seldon |publisher=Harper Collins Illustrated |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-00-414073-5 |page=202}}</ref>

====Court presentation of débutantes====
[[Débutante]]s were aristocratic young ladies making their first entrée into society through a presentation to the monarch at court. These occasions, known as "coming out", took place at the palace from the reign of Edward&nbsp;VII. The débutantes entered—wearing full court dress, with three ostrich feathers in their hair—curtsied, performed a backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the "court [[drawing room]]s" of Victoria's reign.<ref>Peacocke, pp. 178–179, 244–247.</ref> After World War&nbsp;II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, omitting the requirement court evening dress.<ref>Peacocke, pp. 264–265.</ref> In 1958, the Queen abolished the presentation parties for débutantes,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp |title=Mailbox |website=Royal Insight Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123231607/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp |archive-date=23 January 2008 |access-date=23 January 2008}}</ref> replacing them with [[Garden at Buckingham Palace#Garden parties|Garden Parties]],{{efn|[[Princess Margaret]] is reputed to have remarked of the débutante presentations: "We had to put a stop to it, every tart in London was getting in."<ref>{{Cite book |title=You look awfully like the Queen |last=Blaikie |first=Thomas |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-00-714874-5 |location=London}}</ref>}} for up to 8,000 invitees in the Garden.

===Garden and surroundings===

At the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1381/1092/ |title=''Buckingham Palace'' |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502231028/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1381/1092/ |archive-date=2 May 2008 |access-date=3 February 2009}} ([[Museum of London]].)

Adjacent to the palace is the [[Royal Mews]], also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the [[Gold State Coach]], are housed. This [[rococo]] gilt coach, designed by [[Sir&nbsp;William Chambers]] in 1760, has painted panels by [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani|G. B. Cipriani]]. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George&nbsp;III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since George&nbsp;IV. It was last used for the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth&nbsp;II]].<ref>{{Royal Collection|5000048|Gold State Coach}}</ref> Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/TheRoyalMews/TheRoyalMews.aspx |title=The Royal Residences > The Royal Mews |publisher=www.royal.gov.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710044631/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/TheRoyalMews/TheRoyalMews.aspx |archive-date=10 July 2009}}</ref>

[[The Mall, London|The Mall]], a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Sir&nbsp;[[Aston Webb]] and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to [[Queen Victoria]]. It extends from [[Admiralty Arch]], across [[St&nbsp;James's Park]] to the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]]. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions—such as the annual [[Trooping the Colour]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=London |last=Nicholson, Louise |publisher=Frances Lincoln |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7112-1187-2 |location=London |page=56 |author-link=Louise Nicholson}}</ref>

==20th century==
[[File:Barack Obama Michelle Obama Queen Elizabeth II Buckingham Palace London.jpg|thumb|Visiting heads of state are received by the Queen at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. Here, United States President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Michelle Obama]] are greeted in 2009 in the first-floor audience chamber in the private apartments in the north wing.]]
In 1901, the new King Edward VII began redecorating the palace. The King and his wife, [[Queen Alexandra]], had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as "the [[Marlborough House]] Set", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the [[Belle Époque]] cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.<ref>Robinson (Page 9) asserts that the decorations, including plaster swags and other decorative motifs, are "finicky" and "at odds with Nash's original detailing".</ref>

The last major building work took place during the reign of King George&nbsp;V when, in 1913, Sir&nbsp;Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part [[Giacomo Leoni]]'s [[Lyme Park]] in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of [[Portland stone]]) was designed to be the backdrop to the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]], a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates.<ref>Harris, p. 34.</ref> George&nbsp;V, who had succeeded Edward&nbsp;VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.<ref>Healey, p. 185.</ref> He arranged a series of [[Royal Command Performance|command performances]] featuring [[jazz]] musicians such as the [[Original Dixieland Jazz Band]] (1919; the first jazz performance for a head of state), [[Sidney Bechet]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a [[Brecon Jazz Festival#(Kind of) Blue Plaque|(Kind of) Blue Plaque]] by the [[Brecon Jazz Festival]] as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do |title=Buckingham Palace hits right note with jazz fans |date=3 August 2009 |work=London Evening Standard |access-date=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426000757/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do |archive-date=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/03/buckingham-palace-jazz-plaque-brecon |title=By royal approval: Buckingham Palace's place in jazz history |last=Stephen Bates |date=3 August 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=11 August 2010 |location=London}}</ref> 

King George&nbsp;V's wife, Queen Mary, was a [[connoisseur]] of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble [[Empire style]] chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.<ref>Healey pp. 221–222.</ref> This room, {{convert|69|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.<ref>Harris, p. 63.</ref>

[[File:Victoria Memorial from within Buckingham Palace.jpg|thumb|upright|Sculptor Sir [[Thomas Brock]] created the [[Victoria Memorial, London|Victoria Memorial]] in 1911; it was erected in front of the main gates at the palace on a surround constructed by architect Sir Aston Webb.]]
During [[World War I]], the palace, then the home of King George&nbsp;V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor, but the royal family remained in residence. The King imposed [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household.<ref>{{Cite book |title=King George V |last=Rose |first=Kenneth |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-297-78245-2 |location=London |pages=176–177 |author-link=Kenneth Rose}}</ref> To the King's later regret, [[David Lloyd George]] persuaded him to go further and ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe, and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence.<ref>Rose, pp. 178–179.</ref> In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.<ref>Allison and Riddell, p. 69.</ref>

During [[World War II]], the palace was bombed nine times;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/exhibitions/letter-from-queen-elizabeth-to-queen-mary-describing-the-bombing-of-buckingham-palace-13 |title=Letter from Queen Elizabeth to Queen Mary describing the bombing of Buckingham Palace, 13 September 1940 |publisher=Royal Collection Trust |access-date=31 March 2016}}</ref> the most serious and publicised incident destroyed the palace chapel in 1940. This event was shown in cinemas throughout the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George&nbsp;VI and Queen Elizabeth were in the palace, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Royal Feud |last=Thornton |first=Michael |publisher=M. Joseph |year=1984 |page=216}}</ref> War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the [[East End]] in the face."{{cn|date=September 2020}} The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as ''[[The Sunday Graphic]]'' reported:

On 15 September 1940, known as the [[Battle of Britain Day]], an RAF pilot, [[Ray Holmes]] of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF]] rammed a German [[Dornier Do 17]] bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace.

On [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]—8 May 1945—the palace was the centre of British celebrations.
