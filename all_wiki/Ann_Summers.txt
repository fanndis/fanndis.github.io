'''Ann Summers''' is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] retailer company specialising in [[sex toy]]s and [[lingerie]], with over 140 [[high street]] stores in the UK, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the [[Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annsummers.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StaticPageDisplay?catalogId=40151&identifier=UKSTORES&langId=-1&storeId=10001 |title=Ann Summers Store Finder |accessdate=29 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095823/http://www.annsummers.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StaticPageDisplay?catalogId=40151&identifier=UKSTORES&langId=-1&storeId=10001| archivedate= 25 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the Knickerbox brand,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/699230.stm |title=Ann Summers to buy Knickerbox |publisher=BBC News |date=3 April 2000 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> a label with an emphasis on more comfortable and feminine underwear, while the Ann Summers-labelled products tend to be more erotic in style. The chain had an annual turnover of £117.3 million in 2007–2008.

==History==
The company was named after Annice Summers, the female secretary of the male founder, [[Michael Caborn-Waterfield]].

Annice Summers, who was born Annice Goodwin in 1941 but later took her stepfather's surname, left the company soon after it opened following a row with Caborn-Waterfield. She went to live in [[Umbria]], [[Italy]], two hours from Rome, and died of cancer in October 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MRS+SEX%3B+Girl+behind+Ann+Summers+legend+is+now+rich+recluse.-a064652241|title=MRS SEX; Girl behind Ann Summers legend is now rich recluse |via=The Free Library|date=3 April 2000}}</ref>

In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the underwear brand Knickerbox for an undisclosed sum. However, in 2014 they announced plans to sell the brand.<ref>{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first= Ashley |date=15 March 2014 |title=Ann Summers to sell Knickerbox |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10700727/Ann-Summers-to-sell-Knickerbox.html |newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 March 2014 }}</ref>

===Retail===
The first Ann Summers shop was opened in 1970 in [[Marble Arch]], London, from which it grew to six shops.

Ann Summers was purchased in 1971 by brothers Ralph and [[David Gold (businessman)|David Gold]],<ref>{{cite web|author=ZapelliA Web Solutions - www.zapellia.co.uk |url=http://www.annsummerspartyplan.co.uk/about/history.php |title=The History of Ann Summers |publisher=Ann Summers Party Plan |date=31 March 2000 |accessdate=9 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222025532/http://www.annsummerspartyplan.co.uk/about/history.php |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> who turned it from a standard sex shop into an established high street brand and lingerie boutique. In 1981, David Gold installed his daughter [[Jacqueline Gold]] (who is the current [[Chief Executive]] of Ann Summers) and she introduced the Party Plan concept.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} The retail operations for all of Ann Summers' shops are managed from the Head Office in [[Whyteleafe]], [[Surrey]], and as of December 2010 Ann Summers operates 144 retail outlets across the UK, [[Ireland]], the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Spain]].

The shops offer lingerie, underwear, [[cosmetics]], swimwear and sex toys. The stores sell 2 million [[Rabbit vibrator|Rampant Rabbits]], a kind of [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] exclusive{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} to Ann Summers, per year.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8224107/Jacqueline-Gold-profile-of-the-chief-executive-of-Ann-Summers.html |title=Jacqueline-Gold-profile-of-the-chief-executive-of-Ann-Summers |work=The Telegraph|date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110130041257/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8224107/Jacqueline-Gold-profile-of-the-chief-executive-of-Ann-Summers.html| archivedate= 30 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Party Plan===
Jacqueline Gold initiated the Party Plan concept in 1981.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Initially, the Ann Summers parties were as much a way of circumventing regulations restricting the display of sex toys as they were a marketing tactic, but their popularity quickly grew and Ann Summers now employs over 7,500 Party Organisers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbconsulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2011-Ann-Summers-BI.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134728/http://www.dbconsulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2011-Ann-Summers-BI.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-02-22|title=DB Consulting : Ann Summers |website=Dbconsulting.co.uk |accessdate=2016-01-20 }}</ref> coordinated from the Head Office in Surrey. There are around 4,000 Ann Summers Parties every week in the UK.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2003/feb/09/wageslaves.valentinesday2003 |title=Ann Summers Party Organisers |work=The Guardian|date=3 September 2003 |accessdate=29 December 2010 |location=London |first=Barbara |last=Oaff}}</ref>

The Ann Summers parties are exclusively women-only,<ref name="guardian"/> and include the presentation of sex toys and lingerie in the informal setting of someone's home; usually the home of one of the attendees. It can also involve the perusal of a catalogue, and often there are party games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://party.annsummers.com/files/cat64a.pdf |title=Ann Summers Catalogue pdf |publisher=Ann Summers |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707144859/http://party.annsummers.com/files/cat64a.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Due to the adult nature of the business, Ann Summers has frequently faced opposition, both legal and social. For example, in 2003, they won a legal battle to advertise for employees in [[job centres]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=930&id=672582003 |title=Sex toy chain overturns job adverts ban |publisher=Business.scotsman.com |accessdate=19 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029164541/http://business.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=930&id=672582003 |archivedate=29 October 2007 }}</ref> and an [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]] complaint was rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/2930525.stm |title='Hotbot' adult poster banned |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2003 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

They have also encountered opposition to their advertising. The company received a letter of complaint from [[Buckingham Palace]], due to a non-endorsed advert featuring the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jun/26/advertising.themonarchy |title=Queen is not amused by Ann Summers sex ad &#124; Media &#124; MediaGuardian |work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2002 |accessdate=19 May 2010 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Cozens}}</ref>

In 2003, the company's payments to party organisers were discussed by a number of media sources.<ref>{{cite web|author=Barbara Oaff |url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/work/wageslaves/story/0,,892659,00.html |title=Wage slaves: Ann Summers party organisers &#124; Money &#124; The Guardian |website=Money.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref>

In 2004, two complaints were upheld by the ASA.<ref>[http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/4DCA7C6C-61C4-4836-810D-07DFD178D6ED/0/ASA_Annual_Report_2004.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317051307/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/4DCA7C6C-61C4-4836-810D-07DFD178D6ED/0/ASA_Annual_Report_2004.pdf |date=17 March 2007 }}</ref> The ASA decided that the first ad was degrading to women, offensive and unsuitable for use as a poster. In the second case the ASA ruled that the use of a reference to the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ride a Cock Horse]]" was likely to attract the attention of children and that the advertisement was unsuitable for the medium in which it appeared.

Ann Summers lingerie factory in [[Portsmouth]] closed in 2005, with over 50 redundancies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/biz/Jobs-fear-at-saucy-lingerie.1215807.jp |title=Jobs fear at saucy lingerie plant |publisher=Portsmouth.co.uk |accessdate=19 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609120525/http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/biz/Jobs-fear-at-saucy-lingerie.1215807.jp |archivedate=9 June 2010 }}</ref>

Additionally, Ann Summers in [[Perth, Scotland]], was forced to close after the local people complained about the store (mostly from parents embarrassed by questions raised by their children), which also led to other problems with the store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/feed/tm_method=full%26objectid=18409874%26siteid=64736-name_page.html |title=The latest news, sport, showbiz and comment from |work=the Sunday Mail|date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928053616/http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/feed/tm_method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18409874%26siteid%3D64736-name_page.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Perth was originally the only UK town where an Ann Summers store failed to take off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/opinion/mailopinion/tm_method=full%26objectid=18412863%26siteid=64736-name_page.html |title=The latest news, sport, showbiz and comment from |work=the Sunday Mail|date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011160309/http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/opinion/mailopinion/tm_method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18412863%26siteid%3D64736-name_page.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 }}</ref> However, in May 2007 the Middleton Grange, [[Hartlepool]] store which opened in November 2005 was closed after less than two years of trading due to poor sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Willis |first=Ian |url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news?articleid=2877476 |title=It's the last of the Summers line |work=Hartlepool Mail|date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Islam|Muslim]] groups complained about the release of a blow up doll named Mustafa Shag, claiming that the doll was offensive to Muslims as Mustafa was one of the names given to the [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohamed]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/pandora/article344202.ece |title=Emma, Ann and a sex doll that upsets Muslims |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=9 February 2006 |accessdate=19 May 2010 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011183443/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/pandora/article344202.ece |archivedate=11 October 2008}}</ref>

In 2007, the company faced legal issues with [[Apple Inc]] due to its release of an electronic add-on to music players called the iGasm. The company has not backed down despite [[cease and desist]] orders by Apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=18110 |title=Apple v Ann Summers in iGasm spat |publisher=Macworld.co.uk |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> Also, a former director, who is now a [[Beate Uhse AG]] employee<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Vaughan, Beate Uhse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2372027.stm |title=Sex war threat haunts UK High Streets |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> is pursuing a libel claim against Jacqueline Gold.<ref>[http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/viewer.aspx?issue=13002007091600000000001001&page=8&article=cc897791-4557-4506-8451-2dc4385745e6&key=Xp7m6GUcZW3qiK+3JssRFA==&feed=rss]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623164837/http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/viewer.aspx?issue=13002007091600000000001001&page=8&article=cc897791-4557-4506-8451-2dc4385745e6&key=Xp7m6GUcZW3qiK%203JssRFA%3D%3D&feed=rss |date=23 June 2015 }}</ref> An advert was banned from the London Underground in the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/733405/ |title=Ann Summers Rabbit ads banned from the Tube |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, Ann Summers' [[Halloween]] advert was banned by the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre, which decided the advert used "fairly overt sexual references in terms of sound effects."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/844865-ann-summers-has-offensive-halloween-advert-banned |title=Ann Summers has 'offensive' Halloween advert banned &#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref>
