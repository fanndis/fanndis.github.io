He was a supporter of the Iraq war. He was a finalist for the 2004 [[Michael Kelly Award]].

''[[The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America]]'', focuses on the ways that America changed in the years between 1978 and 2012.

In 2019, Packer released a 600-page book titled ''Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century.''
