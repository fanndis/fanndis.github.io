"'''Born This Way'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], and the lead single from her second studio [[Born This Way (album)|album of the same name]]. Written by Gaga and [[Jeppe Laursen]], who produced it along with [[Fernando Garibay]] and DJ White Shadow, the track was developed while Gaga was on the road with [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. Inspired by 1990s music which empowered women and the [[gay community]], Gaga explained that "Born This Way" was her freedom song. She sang part of the [[refrain|chorus]] at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]] in 2010 and announced the song as the lead single from the album, released on February 11, 2011.

"Born This Way" is backed by rumbling synth sounds, a humming bass and additional chorus [[percussion]], with sole [[organ (music)|organ]] toward the end. The lyrics discuss the self-empowerment of minorities including the [[LGBT]] community as well as racial minorities, referring to "[[cholo|chola]]s" and "[[orient]]s". Critics positively reviewed the song, calling it a "club-ready anthem", though it faced criticism for having similarities with [[Madonna]]'s 1989 single "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]". The song reached number one in over 25 countries and was her third single to top the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the 1,000th song in that chart's history (since 1958) to reach number one. "Born This Way" has sold 8.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the [[list of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]].

[[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]] directed the accompanying music video, which was inspired by [[surrealism|surrealist]] painters like [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Gaga is depicted as giving birth to a new race during a prologue. After a series of dance sequences, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted the video's references to the work of Madonna, [[Michael Jackson]], [[Björk]], and the late fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]], as well as to [[Greek mythology]] and surrealism.

Gaga performed the song at the [[53rd Grammy Awards]] after coming out of an incubating vessel. Shortly after, she added it to the setlist of the last leg of [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. "Born This Way" was later performed on television shows, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', many of the singer's tours, and it was notably part of her [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]] set. The song was treated with different remixes, including a "Country Road" version recorded by Gaga herself and another by Indian production duo [[Salim-Sulaiman]]. [[Alice Cooper]], Madonna, [[Katy Perry]], [[Maria Aragon]], and the cast of the TV series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' have covered the song. In 2019, the song was covered in the series finale of the Disney Channel series ''[[Andi Mack]]''.

==Background==
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=The nexus of 'Born This Way' and the soul of the record reside in this idea that you were not necessarily born in one moment. You have your entire life to birth yourself into becoming the ultimate potential vision that you see for you. Who you are when you come out of your mother's womb is not necessarily who you will become. 'Born This Way' says your birth is not finite, your birth is infinite.|source=—Gaga talking about the meaning of "Born This Way".<ref name="bbcover"/>}}

In 2010, [[Lady Gaga]] was touring for her second world tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour|The Monster Ball]].

<blockquote>
I want to write my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't want it to be hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, especially in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when [[Madonna]], [[En Vogue]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]] were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'.

Once the first chorus starts, the song chugs alongside the harmonica sounds. Just before the three-minute mark, Gaga sings new lyrics, "If I wanna make it country, baby, then it's OK, cuz I was born, I was born, I was born this way," over a picked [[mandolin]]. According to Gil Kaufman of [[MTV]], the song breaks into full-on country-rock mode, reminiscent of late-period [[Bon Jovi]] music, in the final minute.

An Indian version of the song was done by Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, when they came to learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], was interested in a Bollywood remix for "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. She loved it and that's how we went about it," he added. The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, [[sitar]] by Sunil Das, and the [[dhol]] and [[dholak]] in the chorus.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |title=Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way' Bollywood Remix Is 'Magical,' Producers Say |publisher=MTV News |date=April 13, 2011 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661911/lady-gaga-born-this-way-bollywood-remix.jhtml |access-date=April 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416105413/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661911/lady-gaga-born-this-way-bollywood-remix.jhtml |archive-date=April 16, 2011 }}</ref> Salim said that he sang a little bit of [[Indian classical music|alaap]] to give the remix a [[Sufi music|Sufi]] touch, "as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature."

"Born This Way" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release. Michael Cragg from ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the song an "almost [[disco]] anthem", and said the chorus "crashes in with the weight of a discarded [[meat dress of Lady Gaga|meat dress]]".

When interviewed by [[ABC News]] in 2012, Madonna was asked about the similarities between "Born This Way" and "Express Yourself", stating: "When I heard ['Born This Way'] on the radio ...

<blockquote>When she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message.<ref name="laurie1"/>

"We rehearsed there because the choreography is really modern-based. It's, like, more technical than anything she's ever done," she recalled. Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days.

She is dressed in white billowing cloth and many jewelry. The woman is flanked by two brunette girls, who face each other and seem to be pulling out a white circular orb from between the woman's legs. The girls are dressed in identical transparent garments, while a chain connects their bosom. A bluish halo is visible behind the woman and crystalline spiked structure radiate from her back.]]
Released on Monday, February 28, 2011,<ref name="jmont"/> the video begins with a brief shot of a [[unicorn]]'s silhouette in a steam-filled alley, inside a [[pink triangle]] frame. The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, inspired by [[Janus]], the Roman god of transition and beginnings, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. As [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s prelude to the movie ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' plays,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/28/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video/|title=Lady Gaga Debuts first 'Born This Way' video|last=Blauvelt|first=Christian|date=February 28, 2011|access-date=June 23, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211307/http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/28/lady-gaga-born-this-way-video/|archive-date=July 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gaga tells the story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race that "bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom." Gaga sits in the throne, giving birth to a "new race within the race of humanity." She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, "How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?"

Gaga, with shoulder and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking [[subdermal implants]]) walks in a seemingly endless black space, where people are on their hands and knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.

In the video's conclusion, Gaga's silhouette struts in an alley in a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]".<ref name="slantmusic"/> Gaga has commented that she was teased as kids would call her "rabbit teeth".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://patriotpost.us/opinion/suzanne-fields/2011/02/18/superstar-meets-supermom/|title=Superstar meets Supermom|last=Fields|first=Suzanne|date=February 18, 2011|access-date=August 4, 2011|work=[[The Patriot-News]]|publisher=Advance Publications|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621035838/http://patriotpost.us/opinion/suzanne-fields/2011/02/18/superstar-meets-supermom/|archive-date=June 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city and a rainbow appear in the background, and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.

American singer-songwriter and parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] had sought permission from Gaga to parody "Born This Way", providing a brief description of the concept for his song. Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval.
