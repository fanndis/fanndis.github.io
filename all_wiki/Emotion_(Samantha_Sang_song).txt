"'''Emotion'''" is a song written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]. It was first recorded by Australian singer [[Samantha Sang]], whose version reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1978. The [[Bee Gees]] recorded their own version of the song in 1994 as part of an album called ''Love Songs'', which was never released, but it was eventually included on their 2001 collection titled ''[[Their Greatest Hits: The Record]]''. In 2001, "Emotion" was covered by the American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] girl group [[Destiny's Child]]. Their version of the song was an international hit, reaching the top ten on the US Hot 100 chart and peaking in the top five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. English singer [[Emma Bunton]] also covered the song on her 2019 album ''[[My Happy Place]]''.

==Original version==

===Background===
Originally, the song "Emotion" was recorded by [[Samantha Sang]] for the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label. The song was Sang's only hit single, reaching number 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. ''Billboard'' ranked her version as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1978|No. 14 song for 1978]]. There is a promotional video made for this song.

When Sang arrived in Miami, instead of recording "[[(Our Love) Don't Throw it All Away|Don't Throw It All Away]]", Barry Gibb offered her a new song called "Emotion". On this track, Sang sticks to a breathy, Barry-like sound. Gibb himself provided harmony and background vocals in his signature [[falsetto]]. The B-side was "When Love Is Gone", a [[Francis Lai]] composition. It was recorded around April 1977 in [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] around the same time that Barry contributed writing and producing "[[Save Me, Save Me]]" for the band Network. [[Blue Weaver]] identified the musicians as shown from memory. On the session, Joey Murcia plays guitar, George Bitzer on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], Harold Cowart on [[Bass (guitar)|bass]] and Ron "Tubby" Zeigler on [[Drum kit|drums]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1977 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> It was originally intended for use in the 1977 film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'',{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but ended up being featured in the film ''[[The Stud (film)|The Stud]]'' (1978) starring [[Joan Collins]]. Also in 1978, "Emotion" was used as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Deniece Williams]]'s single "[[Too Much, Too Little, Too Late]]", which reached [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1978|number one]] in the US.

===Background===
In 2001, "Emotion" was recorded by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]] for their third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001). Produced and arranged by [[Mark J. Feist]], it features a slower tempo than the [[Samantha Sang]] original, although a more uptempo [[The Neptunes|Neptunes]]-produced [[remix]] of the song was also produced and included in the band's [[remix album]] ''[[This Is the Remix (Destiny's Child album)|This Is The Remix]]'' (2002). Feist had previously produced the song for Filipino singer [[Regine Velasquez]] for her album ''[[Drawn (album)|Drawn]]'' in 1998 and used exactly the same backing track for [[Destiny's Child]].

Issued as that album's fourth [[Single (music)|single]], the song continued the group's streak of top-ten hits in the United States, peaking at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on 20 November 2001. It was also a hit in the [[United Kingdom]], where it peaked at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and sold over 145,000 copies, and reached the top ten in several major music markets, including [[New Zealand]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].

The single was accompanied by a [[Francis Lawrence]]-directed [[music video]] featuring a triple [[split screen (film)|split screen]] effect. The song was heavily on radio station playlists during the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and eventually became a tribute song to the family of the victims. The group also paid tribute to late R&B singer [[Aaliyah]], [[Death of Aaliyah|who died in an August 2001 plane crash]], at the [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award]]s with a performance of this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1448482/aaliyahs-absence-felt-at-lady-of-soul-awards/|title=Aaliyah's Absence Felt At Lady Of Soul Awards|last=van Horn|first=Teri|website=[[MTV]]|date=August 29, 2001|accessdate=March 9, 2020}}</ref>

===Music video===
The music video featured a triple split-screen effect. It was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]]. Rowland on the left, Knowles in the center, and Williams on the right. Rowland is seen saying goodbye to her boyfriend before he leaves in a taxi. Knowles catches her boyfriend with another woman and runs around the house in tears. Williams is with her grandmother, who has died in her bed. At the end of the video Williams calls the other group members to her home. The three girls meet there and comfort each other. The screen returns to normal.

The music clip is featured as an enhanced video on the European editions of the CD single and on the 2004 [[Wal-Mart]] exclusive DVD titled ''[[Destiny Fulfilled#Wal-Mart Exclusive DVD|Fan Pack]]''.
