"'''Lose My Breath'''" is a song by American group [[Destiny's Child]]. It was written by [[Beyoncé]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], [[LaShawn Daniels]], [[Fred Jerkins III]], [[Sean Garrett]] and [[Jay-Z]] for the group's fourth studio album, ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' (2004). [[Columbia Records]] released "Lose My Breath" as the first single from the album in late 2004. The song was partially developed by Jerkins before being presented to Destiny's Child and its chorus was afterwards written by Jay-Z.

An uptempo [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[dance-pop]] song, "Lose My Breath" has a marching, military [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-led instrumentation with different sound effects in its [[backing track]]. It received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]] who generally praised its melody and instrumentation. The track further received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the category for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]]. "Lose My Breath" was commercially successful peaking at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and reaching the top spot on many charts in Europe as well as appearing in the top ten in almost every chart.

The single's [[music video]] directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]] and filmed in Los Angeles, California, featured Destiny's Child performing dance choreographies portraying three different characters. The song was performed during the group's tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It]] (2005) and on numerous televised appearances and awards ceremonies in 2004 and 2005. The [[American Broadcasting Company]] used "Lose My Breath" as the official song for the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004]] and [[2005 NBA Playoffs|2005]].

== Background and release ==
"Lose My Breath" was written by [[Beyoncé]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], [[Fred Jerkins III|Fred Jerkins]], [[Sean Garrett]], [[LaShawn Daniels]] and [[Jay-Z]]. The production of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes|title=Destiny Fulfilled|others=[[Destiny's Child]]|year=2004 |publisher=[[Columbia Records]]}}</ref> Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for "[[Say My Name]]" (2000), had worked on "Lose My Breath" without informing [[Destiny's Child]]. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their bandmate [[Kelly Rowland]] presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines "Can you keep up" without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and [[bridge (music)|bridge]] around it.<ref name="Corey" /> During an interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, "There was so much magic going on in the studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards the latter part of the album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/11/sean-garrett-25-essential-songs/destinys-child-lose-my-breath|title=Sean Garrett Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media LLC|first=Lauren|last=Nostro|page=5|date=2012-11-22|accessdate=2014-07-02}}</ref>

=== Background and synopsis ===
[[Image:Lose My Breath (Screenshot).jpg|240px|thumb|left|Kelly, Beyoncé and Michelle in the music video for "Lose My Breath" (2004).]]
The music video for "Lose My Breath" was directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]] (under the pseudonym of [[Alan Smithee]]) and was shot in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] on October 8, 2004.<ref name="Corey">{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Beyoncé Healing Fast Thanks To Serena Williams |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1492003/beyonce-healing-fast-thanks-to-serena-williams/ |publisher=[[MTV News]].

MTV Networks |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> Destiny's Child had dance rehearsals for the video in late September and continued the following month.<ref name="Corey"/> During the rehearsals, Beyoncé tore her right [[hamstring]], while overdoing the choreography. Following the injury, she was advised by a specialist to avoid dancing and other physical activities for a week; MTV News further reported that the injury could further postpone the filming of the video.<ref name="injury" /> However, the next week, the group revealed in an interview with the publication that the video would be filmed as originally planned as Beyoncé's leg healed fast. She said, "My leg was actually a blessing in disguise because it gave us more time to prepare for the video".<ref name="Corey"/> Speaking about the concept of the video, Beyoncé revealed
<blockquote>
It's really a dance-off between a more sophisticated 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's a lot of hard work for us because we have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.<ref name="Corey"/>
</blockquote>

The video mainly takes place in an alleyway, where the members of Destiny's Child are having a dance-off. As the song opens, it begins with Beyoncé, Williams and Rowland walking, representing the "fierce Destiny's Child" dressed in stilettos and fur.<ref name="Corey"/><ref name="people"/> It transitions to the group being dressed in-fashion with red burgundy suits as they meet their identical street-styled, [[hip hop]] copies with hoodies and Timberland boots, starting to perform a dance-off;<ref name="people"/> the camera focuses on each member of the group performing a separate choreography with their rival in front of them during their solo lines. As the song progresses, Beyoncé, Williams and Rowland are joined by other male and female dancers at the start of the song's chorus. During her lines, Rowland performs a dance sequence with two male dancers. Following the song's bridge, the two different groups head towards another place where they are welcomed by more dancers and their third "fierce" rivals appear for the final chorus. The video ends in the same way it opened, with the "fierce" group members walking.<ref name="Corey"/>
