'''''Vice''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] magazine focused on lifestyle, arts, culture, and news/politics. Founded in 1994 in [[Montreal]] as an alternative punk magazine, the founders later launched the youth media company [[Vice Media]], which consists of divisions including the printed magazine as well as a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. As of February 2018, the magazine's editor-in-chief is Ellis Jones.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Sterne | first = Peter | title = Vice E.I.C.

==History==
Founded by [[Suroosh Alvi]], [[Gavin McInnes]], (who later founded the [[Proud Boys]]), and [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]] (the latter two being childhood friends),<ref name="Rob">{{cite news|author1=Robert Levine|title=A Guerrilla Video Site Meets MTV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/media/19vice.html?hp&_r=0|access-date=7 November 2014|work=The New York Times|date=19 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107145350/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/media/19vice.html?hp&_r=0|archive-date=7 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> the magazine was launched in 1994 as the ''Voice of Montreal'' with government funding. The intention of the founders was to provide work and a community service.<ref name=gua/> When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Alix Laurent, they bought him out and changed the name to ''Vice'' in 1996.<ref name="smith"/>

Richard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late 1990s. Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and [[politically incorrect]] content. Under Szalwinski's ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the [[dot-com bubble]], the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand, followed by closure of the stores.<ref name="Rob" />

The British edition of ''Vice'' was launched in 2002 and [[Andy Capper]] was its first editor. Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication's remit was to cover "the things we're meant to be ashamed of", and articles were published on topics such as [[bukkake]] and bodily functions.<ref name="Pug">{{cite web|author1=Andrew Pugh|title='Maybe we've grown up': Ten years on, how ''Vice'' magazine got serious|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/‘maybe-we’ve-grown-up’-ten-years-how-vice-magazine-got-serious|website=Press Gazette|publisher=Progressive Media International|access-date=7 November 2014|date=28 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123191001/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/%E2%80%98maybe-we%E2%80%99ve-grown-up%E2%80%99-ten-years-how-vice-magazine-got-serious|archive-date=23 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By the end of 2007, 13 foreign editions of ''Vice'' magazine were published, the Vice independent record label was functional, and the online video channel VBS.com had 184,000 unique viewers from the U.S. during the month of August. The media company was still based in New York City, but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious, such as armed conflict in Iraq, than previous content. Alvi explained to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 2007: "The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village."<ref name="Rob" />

McInnes left the publication in 2008, citing "creative differences" as the primary issue. In an email communication dated 23 January, McInnes explained: "I no longer have anything to do with Vice or VBS or DOs & DON'Ts or any of that. It's a long story but we've all agreed to leave it at 'creative differences,' so please don't ask me about it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Co-Founder Gavin McInnes Finally Leaves 'Vice'|url=http://gawker.com/348019/co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-finally-leaves-vice|website=Gawker|publisher=Gawker|access-date=7 November 2014|date=23 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010093200/http://gawker.com/348019/co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-finally-leaves-vice|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the commencement of 2012, an article in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine referred to the Vice company as "Vice Media", but the precise time when this title development occurred is not public knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Jeff Bercovici|title=Tom Freston's $1 Billion Revenge: Ex-Viacom Chief Helps Vice Become the Next MTV|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/01/03/tom-frestons-1-billion-revenge-ex-viacom-chief-helps-vice-become-the-next-mtv/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes, LLC|access-date=8 November 2014|date=3 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108083023/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/01/03/tom-frestons-1-billion-revenge-ex-viacom-chief-helps-vice-become-the-next-mtv/|archive-date=8 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Vice acquired the fashion magazine ''[[i-D]]'' in December 2012 and, by February 2013, Vice produced 24 global editions of the magazine, with a global circulation of 1,147,000 (100,000 in the UK). By this stage, Alex Miller had replaced Capper as the editor-in-chief of the UK edition. Furthermore, Vice consisted of 800 worldwide employees, including 100 in London, and around 3,500 freelancers also produced content for the company.<ref name="Pug" />

In February 2015, Vice Media named Ellis Jones editor-in-chief of Vice magazine and former UK editor-in-chief, Alex Miller, was appointed to the position of global head of content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/12/vice-media-alex-miller-ellis-jones|title=Vice announces new global head of content and editor-in-chief|last=Baird|first=Dugald|date=12 February 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 February 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205152848/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/12/vice-media-alex-miller-ellis-jones|archive-date=5 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Content==
===Scope===
''Vice'' magazine includes the work of journalists, columnists, fiction writers, graphic artists and cartoonists, and photographers. Both ''Vice''{{'}}s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and [[pop culture|pop cultural]] matters to covering more serious news topics. Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication, ''Vice''{{'}}s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory. Articles on the site feature a range of subjects, often things not covered as by mainstream media. The magazine's editors have championed the [[Immersion journalism|immersionist school of journalism]], which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show [[Balls Deep (TV Series)|''Balls Deep'']] on the [[Viceland]] Channel. This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets, and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos. Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of [[Iraqi people]],<ref name="iraqissue"/> [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],<ref name="nativeissue"/> [[Russian people]],<ref name="ru"/> people with [[mental disorders]],<ref name="ill"/> and people with [[mental disabilities]].<ref name="special"/> ''Vice'' also publishes an annual guide for students in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="student"/>

In 2007, a ''Vice'' announcement was published on the Internet: <blockquote>After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month, we started to get bored with it. Besides, too many other magazines have ripped it and started doing their own lame take on themes. So we're going to do some issues, starting now, that have whatever we feel like putting in them.<ref name="dearreaders" /></blockquote>

===Politics===
In a March 2008 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Smith was asked about the magazine's political allegiances and he stated, "We're not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left/right way…  We don't do that because we don't believe in either side. Are my politics [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]? I think both are horrific.  And it doesn't matter anyway.  Money runs America; money runs everywhere."<ref name=gua/>

''Vice'' founded its website as Viceland.com in 1996, as Vice.com was already owned. In 2007, it started [[VBS.tv]] as a domain, which prioritized videos over print, and had a number of shows for free such as ''[[The Vice Guide to Travel]]''. In 2011, Viceland.com and VBS.tv were combined into Vice.com,<ref name="vicecome">{{cite news

=== Book ===
In 2007, ''Vice'' published ''The Vice Photo Book'' ({{ISBN|1576874109}}),<ref name="vicephotobook" /><ref name="thevicephotobook" /> with a collection of photos of [[Jaimie Warren]], [[Jerry Hsu]], [[Michael Rababy]] and [[Patrick O’Dell]]. The book is divided in five parts: "Vice Photographers”, ”Vice’s Photojournalism”, "Vice Fashion”, and the final two sections are a collage of previously published ''VICE'' photos. The book also contains interviews with some of the photographers.
