Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the [[Federal National Council|United Arab Emirates Government]] and the [[Supreme Petroleum Council]]. The city is home to the [[President of the United Arab Emirates|President of the UAE]], who is a member of the [[Al Nahyan family]]. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and [[urbanization]], coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's center of [[politics]] and [[Industrial sector|industry]], and a major [[culture]] and [[commerce]] center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $400&nbsp;billion UAE economy.<ref>[http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/06/abu-dhabi-economy-grows-5-2-2013-slower-expected/ Gulfnews: Abu Dhabi Economy Grows 5.2% In 2013, Slower Than Expected] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173001/http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/06/abu-dhabi-economy-grows-5-2-2013-slower-expected/ |date=3 September 2014 }}. www.gulfnews.com (3 June 2014).

== History ==
[[File:الشيخ سلطان بن زايد 19-1-1961.jpg|thumb|upright|Sheikh [[Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], brother of Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Zayed]], ruled Abu Dhabi from 1928 to 1966]]

{{See also|Timeline of Abu Dhabi}}

The [[Abu Dhabi Central Capital District|area surrounding Abu Dhabi]] is full of archaeological evidence from historical civilizations, such as the [[Umm an-Nar Culture]], which dates back from the third millennium BCE. Other settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi, including the [[Al-Ain Region, Abu Dhabi|eastern]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Potts |first=Daniel |title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates |year=2003 |publisher=Trident Press}}</ref> and [[Al Gharbia, Abu Dhabi|western]] regions of the Emirate.<ref name="DCTAD2017">{{citation |work=[[Abu Dhabi Department of Culture & Tourism|Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi]] |title=Annual Report 2017 |volume=1 |page=119|url=https://tcaabudhabi.ae/DataFolder/reports/2017%20Annual%20report%20-%20EN.pdf |year=2017 |access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref>

=== Etymology ===
"Abu" is Arabic for father, and "Dhabi" is the Arabic word for [[gazelle]]. ''[[Ab (Semitic)|Abu]] Dhabi'' means "Father of Gazelle." It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving [[Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan]].<ref name="name" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uae-tour.com/ |title=United Arab Emirates |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122534/http://uae-tour.com/ |archivedate=21 July 2013}}</ref>

=== Origins of Al Nahyan ===
{{Main|Al Nahyan family}}

The [[Bani Yas]] bedouin was originally centered on the [[Liwa Oasis]] in the western region of the Emirate. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections. In 1793, the ''Al Bu Falah'' subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of freshwater there. One family within this section was the [[Al Nahyan family|Nahyan family]], which is now the ruling family of Abu Dhabi.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bani Yas |url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum |access-date=13 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020194213/http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |archivedate=20 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Pearl trade ===
[[File:Umm Al Nar Cup.jpg|thumb|left|Decorated stone cup from [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar site]], Abu Dhabi on display at the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]]|alt=]]
The pearl diving business was a key industry prior to the discovery of oil reserves. According to a source about pearling, the [[Persian Gulf]] was the best location for pearls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://traveltips.usatoday.com/pearl-diving-united-arab-emirates-27520.html|title=Pearl Diving in the United Arab Emirates|website=Travel Tips – USA Today|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> Pearl divers dive for one to one-and-a-half minutes and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Trench |first=Richard |title=Arab Gulf Cities |year=1995 |publisher=Archive International Group |location=Oxford}}</ref> The divers were not paid for a day's work but received a portion of the season's earnings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pearl Diving |url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum |access-date=13 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020194213/http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/ |archivedate=20 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Trucial coast ===
In the 19th century, as a result of treaties (known as "truces" which gave the coast its name) entered into between Great Britain and the sheikhs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, Britain became the predominant influence in the area.<ref>[http://www.eceme.ensino.eb.br/cihm/Arquivos/PDF%20Files/99.pdf Trucial Gulf Sheikdoms and Great Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624113052/http://www.eceme.ensino.eb.br/cihm/Arquivos/PDF%20Files/99.pdf |date=24 June 2013 }}</ref> The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates, hence, the earlier name for the area, the "Pirate Coast". After piracy was suppressed, other considerations came into play, such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region. Following their withdrawal from India in 1947, the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Michael Quentin |title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=February 2016 |publisher=Reaktion Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-78023-580-6 |page=151 |url=http://greenmountainpress.co.uk/keepersgoldenshore.html |access-date=17 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118043448/http://greenmountainpress.co.uk/keepersgoldenshore.html |archivedate=18 November 2016}}</ref>

=== First oil discoveries ===
In the mid to late 1930s, as the pearl trade declined, interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd (PDTC), an associate company of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, [[Sheikh]] [[Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], to explore for oil. This was followed by a seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of [[BP]], obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about {{convert|8755|ft|m|disp=flip}}. This was followed in 1959 by PDTC's onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.<ref name="AB">Morton, Michael Quentin, "The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries", GEO Expro article, issue 3, 2011.[http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx GEO ExPro – The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217233022/http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx |date=17 February 2012 }}</ref>

In 1962, the company discovered the Bu Hasa field and ADMA followed in 1965 with the discovery of the Zakum offshore field. Today, in addition to the oil fields mentioned, the main producing fields onshore are Asab, Sahil and Shah, and offshore are al-Bunduq, and Abu al-Bukhoosh.<ref name="AB" />

=== A pictorial essay of old Abu Dhabi ===
In 1904, German explorer, [[Hermann Burchardt]], took many photographs of historical sites in Abu Dhabi, photos that are now held at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>See [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625077&bt=europeanaapi The old citadel (''Qaṣr'') of Abu Dhabi] (click on photo to enlarge); [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=626029&bt=europeanaapi Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the ''Majlis''] (click on photo to enlarge).</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Abu Dhabi SPOT 1034.jpg|thumb|Abu Dhabi seen from SPOT satellite]]

The city of Abu Dhabi is on the south[[Eastern Arabia|eastern side]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], adjoining the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is on an island less than {{convert|250|m|-1}} from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and [[Mussafah]] Bridges. A third, [[Sheikh Zayed Bridge]], designed by [[Zaha Hadid]], opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to [[Saadiyat Island]] by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to [[Al Reem Island|Reem Island]] and was completed in early 2011. This is a multi-layer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges in the project, the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abu Dhabi Municipality {{!}} Media Center|url=http://www.adm.gov.ae/|work=Municipality of Abu Dhabi City|access-date=7 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202175555/http://www.adm.gov.ae/|archivedate=2 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself, but it has many suburban districts on the mainland, for example, Khalifa City A, B, and C;<ref>{{|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Khalifa City Al Raha Beach;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danathotels.com/Hotels-Resorts/Al-Raha-Beach-Hotel |title=Al Raha Beach Hotel ***** – Luxury Hotel Abu Dhabi – OFFICIAL SITE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124063521/http://www.danathotels.com/Hotels-Resorts/Al-Raha-Beach-Hotel |archivedate=24 November 2012}}</ref> Al Bahia City A, B, and C; Al Shahama; Al Rahba; Between Two Bridges; Baniyas; Shamkha; AL Wathba and Mussafah Residential.

=== Climate ===
Abu Dhabi has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above {{convert|41|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During this time, sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sandstorms-sweep-across-region |title=Sandstorms sweep across region |first=Gregor |last=McClenaghan |date=13 February 2009 |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] | location=Abu Dhabi, UAE |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203081319/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sandstorms-sweep-across-region |archivedate=3 December 2012 }}</ref>

The cooler season is from November to March, which ranges between moderately hot to mild. This period also sees dense fog on some days and a few days of rain. On average, January is the coolest month of the year, while August is the hottest. Since the Tropic of Cancer passes through the emirate, the southern part falls within the [[Tropics]]. However, despite the coolest month having an {{convert|18.8|C|F}} average, its climate is far too dry to be classed as tropical.

Its construction was initiated under the administration of the late President HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, a key figure in the foundation of the modern UAE.<ref name="szgmc.ae">[SZGMC www.szgmc.ae SZGMC]</ref>

The mosque was constructed with materials from countries around the world, including Italy, Germany, Morocco, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Iran, China, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.szgmc.ae/en/theory-and-implementation |title=Theory & Implementation – Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212081541/http://www.szgmc.ae/en/theory-and-implementation |archivedate=12 February 2015}}</ref> More than 3,000 workers and 38 contracting companies took part in the construction of the mosque. Consideration of durability motivated the choice of many materials specified in the design of the structure. These materials include marble, stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals, and ceramics. Construction began on 5 November 1996. The building is large enough to safely contain a maximum of approximately 41,000 people.  The overall structure is {{convert|22412|m2|lk=out|abbr=off}}. The internal prayer halls were initially opened in December 2007.<ref name="szgmc.ae" />

As one of the most visited buildings in the UAE, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center was established to manage the day-to-day operations, as a place of worship and Friday gathering and as a center of learning and discovery through its education and visitor programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.szgmc.ae/en/ |title=Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre Abu Dhabi |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104182015/http://www.szgmc.ae/en/ |archivedate=4 January 2017}}</ref>

The UAE's large hydrocarbon wealth gives it one of the highest GDP per capita in the world and Abu Dhabi owns the majority of these resources—95% of the oil and 92% of gas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emirates247.com/eb247/economy/uae-economy/abu-dhabi-s-oil-reserves-to-last-another-150-years-2010-03-31-1.100837 |title=Abu Dhabi's oil reserves to last another 150 years |first=Shuchita |last=Kapur |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227104043/http://www.emirates247.com/eb247/economy/uae-economy/abu-dhabi-s-oil-reserves-to-last-another-150-years-2010-03-31-1.100837 |archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref> Abu Dhabi thus holds 9% of the world's proven oil reserves (98.2bn barrels) and almost 5% of the world's natural gas ({{convert|5.8|disp=or|lk=on|e9m3|abbr=off}}). Oil production in the UAE was about 2.3&nbsp;million barrels per day (BPD) in 2010,<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://omrpublic.iea.org/supply/ue_cr_ov.pdf |title=UAE Crude Oil Supply 4-year overlay |journal=Oil Market Report |publisher=International Energy Agency |access-date=20 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929003110/http://omrpublic.iea.org/supply/ue_cr_ov.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}</ref> and projects are in progress to boost production to 3m BPD. In recent years, the focus has turned to gas as increasing domestic consumption for power, desalination and reinjection of gas into oil fields increases demand. Gas extraction is not without its difficulties, however, as demonstrated by the sour gas project at Shah where the gas is rich in hydrogen sulfide content and expensive to develop and process.<ref name="AB" />

[[File:Etihad Airways - Airbus A380-861.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Airbus A380]] belonging to [[Etihad Airways]], the second-largest airline in the UAE after [[Dubai]]-based [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]]]]
In 2009, the government diversified its economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country's non-oil and gas GDP outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE's total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, [[real estate]], tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalization program to reduce the UAE's reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This is evident in the emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of free zones, Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, [[twofour54]] Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote tourism and real estate with the [[Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority]] and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These will be served by improved transport infrastructure, with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/191913051.html |title=Abu Dhabi – Economic Base Diversifying |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=5 January 2009 |access-date=7 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}</ref>

Abu Dhabi's Emirate is the wealthiest of the UAE in terms of [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) and [[per capita income]]. More than $1&nbsp;trillion is invested worldwide in the city. In 2010, the GDP [[per capita]] reached $49,600, which ranks ninth in the world. [[Taxation in the United Arab Emirates|Taxation in Abu Dhabi]], as in the rest of the UAE, is nil for a resident or a non-bank, non-oil company. Abu Dhabi is also planning many future projects sharing with the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC) and taking 29% of all the GCC future plannings. The UAE has a fast-growing economy: in 2006 the [[per capita income]] grew by 9%, providing a GDP per capita of $49,700 and ranking third in the world at [[purchasing power parity]]. Abu Dhabi's [[sovereign wealth fund]], the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]] (ADIA), currently estimated at $875&nbsp;billion, is the world's wealthiest sovereign fund in terms of total asset value.<ref name="adia">[https://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10533428 Asset-backed insecurity].

Many Hollywood and other national film production teams have used parts of the UAE as filming locations. Neighboring Dubai gets a lot of attention, but in recent years Abu Dhabi has become a popular destination.

In 2020, low oil prices and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] pressed the regional banks of Abu Dhabi to cut off their employees.

The Abu Dhabi Fire Service runs 13 fire stations that attend about 2,000 fire and rescue calls per year.

State-owned [[Etisalat]] and private [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|du]] communication companies provide telephone and cell phone service to the city. Cellular coverage is extensive, and both GSM and CDMA (from Etisalat and Du) services are available. [[Etisalat]], the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Abu Dhabi prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC – better known as [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|Du]]) in 2006.

Abu Dhabi in the 1970s was planned for a predicted topmost population of 600,000. Following the urban planning ideals of the time period, the city has high-density tower blocks and wide grid-pattern roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officeplusuae.com/company/contactus.php |title=www.OfficePlusUAE.com – Contact Us |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106055701/http://www.officeplusuae.com/company/contactus.php |archivedate=6 January 2013}}</ref>
The population density is at its apex on the most northerly part of the island. At this point, the main streets have a large amount of 20- to 30-story towers. These towers are in a rectangular pattern, and inside is an ordinary grid pattern of roads with low rise buildings such as 2-story villas or 6-story low-rise buildings.

Due to this planning, a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards, and busy shops is present. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street, and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organized. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street No. 1, Khalifa Street is Street No. 3, Hamdan Street is Street No. 5, Electra Street is Street No. 7 and so on. Conversely, [[Salam Street]] is St No. 8.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google Map of Abu Dhabi |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&time=&date=&ttype=&q=abu+dhabi&ll=24.48543,54.374685&spn=0.022264,0.047035&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1&output=embed&s=AARTsJrE00-YUggvMJHd59dndcY7Dx3zCA |publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organizations.
There are many parks throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however, there is often an entrance fee for adults. The Corniche, the city's seaside promenade, is about {{convert|10|km|mi}} in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/skateboard ring.<ref>[http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/attractions/abu.dhabi.corniche.aspx The Corniche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222330/http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/what.to.see/attractions/abu.dhabi.corniche.aspx |date=2 December 2013 }}</ref>

In 2007 the [[Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council]] (UPC) was established, which is the agency responsible for the future of Abu Dhabi's urban environments and the expert authority behind the visionary Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan that was published in September 2007.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The UPC is also working on similar plans for the regions of Al-Ain and Al-Gharbia.

Because of the rapid development of Abu Dhabi, a number of challenges to the city's urban organization have developed, among them:
* Today, the city's population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes traffic congestion, a shortage of car parking spaces, and overcrowding.
* Although there is an addressing system for the city, it is not widely used, causing problems in describing building locations. Directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.
* However, there is a new naming system under the name of Onwani which is overhauling the entire addressing system of the entire Abu Dhabi Emirate. Its phases have already been implemented and are a success. The addressing system is up to international standards

In 2018, Abu Dhabi was ranked the safest city in the world for the second year running by the statistical analysis website Numbeo.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/abu-dhabi-named-safest-city-in-the-world-for-second-year-running-1.771864 |title=Abu Dhabi named safest city in the world for second year running |work=The National |access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

Abu Dhabi has been criticised for perpetuating a class-based society, where [[Migrant workers in the Gulf region|migrant workers]] are in the [[Social class|lower classes]], and suffer abuse which "is endemic to the system".<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/the-dark-side-of-dubai-1664368.html The Dark Side of Dubai], [[Johann Hari]], [[The Independent]], 7 April 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kVUIHXHn?url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/the-dark-side-of-dubai-1664368.html |date=14 October 2009 }}</ref> Major holidays in Abu Dhabi include ''[[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid al Fitr]]'', which marks the end of ''[[Ramadan]]'', Eid ul-Adha which marks the end of Hajj, and [[National Day (United Arab Emirates)|National Day]] (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Official-holidays-in-UAE-kvOQ0zrKKl.html |title=Official holidays in UAE |publisher=Gowealthy.com |access-date=15 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208022244/http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Official-holidays-in-UAE-kvOQ0zrKKl.html |archivedate=8 February 2009}}</ref>

This unique [[socioeconomic development]] in the Persian Gulf has meant that Abu Dhabi is generally more tolerant than its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51612.htm |title=United Arab Emirates }}</ref> Emiratis have been known for their tolerance; [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, [[Hindu temple]]s, and [[Gurdwara|Sikh gurdwaras]] (with the first synagogue commencing construction in 2020) can be found alongside mosques. The cosmopolitan atmosphere is gradually growing and as a result, there are a variety of Asian and Western schools, cultural centers and themed restaurants.

Abu Dhabi is home to a number of cultural institutions including the [[Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation|Cultural Foundation]] and the National Theater. The Cultural Foundation, while closed for reconstruction as of spring 2011, is home to the [[UAE Public Library and Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abudhabi.ae/egovPoolPortal_WAR/appmanager/ADeGP/Citizen?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=p10620&lang=en |title=بوابة حكومة أبوظبي الإلكترونية |work=abudhabi.ae |access-date=12 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005050810/http://www.abudhabi.ae/egovPoolPortal_WAR/appmanager/ADeGP/Citizen?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=p10620&lang=en |archivedate=5 October 2011}}</ref> Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city.

The diversity of [[cuisine]] in Abu Dhabi is a reflection of the cosmopolitan nature of society. Arab food is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small [[shawarma]] to the upscale restaurants in the city's many hotels. Fast food and [[South Asian cuisine]] are also very popular and are widely available.

Poetry in Abu Dhabi and the UAE is highly regarded and often is centric around the themes of satire, religion, family, chivalry, and love. According to an article from an Abu Dhabi tourism page, sheikhs, teachers, sailors and princes make a large bulk of the poets within the UAE. A unique form of poetry to the UAE was formed in the 8th century by Al Khalil bin Ahmed and it was written in {{convert|16|m|abbr=off}}.  Another Emirati poet, [[Ibn Daher]] is from the 17th century. Daher is important because he used Nabati poetry (AKA Bedouin poetry), poetry written in the vernacular instead of the classical/religious Arabic. Other important poets from the UAE are Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Abdulla bin Sulayem (1905–1976). These poets made headway in the field of Classical Arabic poetry as opposed to the Nabati poetry of the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Literature and poetry |url=http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/ |work=Welcome to Abu Dhabi |access-date=28 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918233244/http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Today in Abu Dhabi there is a group called the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation that works to preserve the art and culture of the city. According to an article from the English Pen Atlas Al Jawaher wal la'li was the first manuscript to come out of the UAE. According to another article this book was written in the 1990s and was banned in the city for some time for making accusations about the ruling family.<ref>{{cite web |title=UAE |url=http://penatlas.org/online |work=English Pen World Atlas |access-date=28 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418051932/http://penatlas.org/online/ |archivedate=18 April 2011}}</ref>
