The [[New Zealand Government]] exercises executive power in New Zealand. This article lists spans of government under a party or coalition, as well as [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministries]] under a prime minister. There have been three distinctly different periods of government in New Zealand—firstly, the period before [[responsible government]]; second, from 1856 to 1890, the period of responsible government; and the third period started with the formation of [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties]] in 1891.

{{See also|Government of New Zealand#Terminology}}
This article lists the successive governments of New Zealand since 1856. The first government which formed along political lines did not appear until 1891, when [[John Ballance]] formed the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1= McLintock|first1= Alexander Hare|title= Liberal Party|url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-9|encyclopedia= [[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate= 3 November 2017|language= en|date= 22 April 2009|orig-year= Originally published in 1966}}</ref> A government is named (by political commentators, as well as self-referentially) for the largest party that leads it<ref>{{cite book|last1= Boston|first1= Jonathan|last2= Holland|first2= Martin|title= The Fourth Labour Government: Politics and Policy in New Zealand|date= 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 9780195582130|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6irVAAAAMAAJ|language= en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Garfield|first1= Norton Fausto|title= Fifth National Government of New Zealand|date= 2012|publisher=Anim Publishing|isbn= 9786138498315|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6SWCtgAACAAJ|language= en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hickey |first1=Bernard |title=It's the Sixth Labour Government |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/10/19/54406/its-the-sixth-labour-government |work=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |accessdate=9 November 2018 |date=20 October 2017}}</ref> – though compare the [[United–Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|United–Reform coalition Government]] of 1931-1935.

The term '[[Ministry (collective executive)|ministry]]', as used in this article, refers collectively to all the [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministers]] who direct the government.<ref>{{cite web|last1= Fraser|first1= Malcolm|title= The New Zealand Parliamentary Record: Being a Record of the Constitution, Successive Governors, Parliaments, and Ministries, Etc., and Containing an Alphabetical Roll of Members of Both Houses of Parliament Until September 1913, and of Members of Provincial Councils|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mr3GPQAACAAJ|publisher=Government Printer|accessdate= 6 February 2017|date= 1 January 1913}}</ref> It is described by [[Oxford Dictionaries]] as "a period of government under one prime minister".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ministry?region=us&q=Ministry |title= Definition for ministry – Oxford Dictionaries Online (US English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}</ref> At the same time, a period of government under a particular party might be led by a succession of prime ministers and comprise multiple ministries. The ministry includes ''all'' government ministers, inside and outside of [[Cabinet of New Zealand|cabinet]] alike (up to the introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]], most ministers were in the cabinet). [[Elections in New Zealand|Elections]] do not cause dissolution of the ministry unless they result in the government's defeat.

Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, all New Zealand governments have comprised coalitions of two or more political parties, whether coalescing before and/or after general elections; thus referring to such governments as "nth National Government" or as "nth Labour Government" simplifies somewhat.

==List of ministries==
===Period without responsible Government (1854–1856)===
The [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]] was an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and was the second enactment to grant the colony of New Zealand [[Self-governing colony|self-government]]. The first elections for a [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] were held during 1853, and this lower house met for the first time in 1854 in [[Auckland]]. In practice, the country was initially governed by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]], [[George Grey]], with the advice of the Civil Secretary and some officials that were appointed back in 1840/41, namely [[Andrew Sinclair (botanist)|Andrew Sinclair]] (Colonial Secretary), [[William Swainson (lawyer)|William Swainson]] ([[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]]), and [[Alexander Shepherd (public servant)|Alexander Shepherd]] ([[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Colonial Treasurer]]).{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=27}}

In the first session of the [[1st New Zealand Parliament]], three elected member took office under the leadership of [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]], to be later joined by two members of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. Whilst they were the first official Executive Government under the Constitution, the practical administration remained with the Government officials.
