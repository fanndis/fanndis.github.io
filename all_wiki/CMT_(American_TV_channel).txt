'''CMT''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television]] [[cable channel|channel]] that is owned by [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], a division of [[ViacomCBS]]. Launched on March 5, 1983 as '''Country Music Television''', CMT was the first nationally available channel devoted to [[country music]] and country [[music video]]s, with its programming also including concerts, specials, and biographies of country music stars. Over time, the network's programming expanded to incorporate original lifestyle and [[reality television|reality]] programming while downplaying its focus on country music.

As of January 2018, approximately 92 million U.S. homes <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectrumreach.com/country-music-television  |title=Spectrum Reach: Country Music Television |publisher=Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}</ref> (or 76.9% of the Nielsen-estimated 119.2 million television households <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/nielsen-estimates-119-6-million-us-tv-homes-2017-2018-tv-season.html |title=Nielsen Insights: National Television Household Universe 2017-2018 Season |publisher=Nielsen Research |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}</ref>) receive CMT. The channel's headquarters are located in [[One Astor Plaza]] in New York City, and has additional offices in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

==History==
===Early years (1983–1991)===
'''CMTV''', an initialism for '''C'''ountry '''M'''usic '''T'''ele'''v'''ision, was founded by Glenn D. Daniels, the owner of Video World Productions in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Daniels put together the ownership group of Telestar Corporation and the Blinder Robinson & Company investment bank in a three-way split. Daniels also served as the program director and the first president of the network.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wolfe |first1=Charles |last2=Akenson |first2=James |year=2001 |title=Country Music Annual 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YaH8amnEKkC&pg=PA8 |publisher=[[The University Press of Kentucky]] |page=8 |isbn=0813130883 |access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>

The network launched on March 5, 1983, at 6:19&nbsp;p.m. CT, beating its chief competitor, [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], to air by two days. The first video clip to air on CMT was [[Faron Young]]'s 1971 hit "[[It's Four in the Morning]]".<ref name="rstone">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-cmt-airs-first-country-music-video-20150306 |title=Flashback: CMT Airs First Country Music Video |work=Rolling Stone |author=Andrew Leahey |date=2015-03-06 |access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref> The following summer, [[MTV]] filed a trademark infringement lawsuit over the initials CMTV, and the network changed its name to simply '''CMT'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kingsbury |first1=Paul |last2=McCall |first2=Michael |last3=Rumble |first3=John |year=2012 |title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PA94 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=94 |isbn=9780199920839 |access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>

===Gaylord years (1991–1997)===


[[File:CMT logo 01.png|thumb|This logo was used when [[MTV]] brought this channel in 2000.]]
In 1991, [[Opryland USA]] and its owner [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Entertainment Company]] acquired CMT in a $34 million deal.<ref name=cmt>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-10392128.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102203309/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-10392128.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-02|title= Nashville Net closes CMT acquisition deal|accessdate=2009-09-03}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}</ref> The network was sold by a group led by radio station owner Robert Sillerman, record producer James Guercio and Nyhl L Henson.<ref name=cmt/> Opryland USA and owner Gaylord also owned CMT's competitor The Nashville Network.

In October 1992, CMT launched its first international channel, [[CMT Europe]], as part of the [[Sky Multichannels]] package. By 1998, Gaylord reported $10 million in losses from CMT Europe and decided to cease broadcasting the declining network on March 31, 1998.<ref name=cmt2>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467333.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title=Gaylord shutters CMT Euro|accessdate=2009-09-03|last=Katz |first=Richard|work=Variety | date=1998-02-03}}</ref> Gaylord had planned to emulate the successful model created by [[E!]], by selling large programming blocks to other European channels, but these plans never occurred.<ref name=cmt2/>

On October 1, 1994, Gaylord made its first major format change for CMT by adding several new programs:
*'''Big Ticket''': Music videos by country music artists on tour. 
*'''Jammin' Country''': Combining rock and country music together.
*'''CMT Signature Series''': Vintage, classic country music videos. 
*'''The CMT Delivery Room''': Brand new music videos.
*'''CMT Saturday Nite Dance Ranch''': Club-themed music videos.
*'''CMT Top 12 Countdown''': Counting down top 12 videos.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5053/is_199409/ai_n18378152/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702084909/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5053/is_199409/ai_n18378152/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-07-02 |title= CMT launches new series|accessdate=2009-09-03|publisher=[[BNET]]}}</ref> All shows eventually were cancelled by 2001.

In 1995, CMT dropped all videos by Canadian artists without U.S. record contracts in response to the network being replaced in Canada by [[Calgary]], Alberta-based [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|New Country Network]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/21197606.html?dids=21197606:21197606&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+10%2C+1995&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=U.S.+country+TV+drops+Canadian+videos&pqatl=google |title= U.S. country TV drops Canadian videos|accessdate=2009-09-03|work=Toronto Star | date=1995-01-10}}</ref> By March 1996, CMT had eventually returned the dropped videos to its playlist after reaching an agreement to acquire a 20% ownership of New Country Network, in addition to renaming it CMT.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/19174055.html?dids=19174055:19174055&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+08%2C+1996&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Country+music+TV+channels+in+accord&pqatl=google|title= Country music TV channels in accord|accessdate=2009-09-03|work=Toronto Star | date=1996-03-08}}</ref>

===CBS/Viacom years (1997–present)===
[[File:Cmt building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|CMT's offices are located at ViacomCBS's headquarters in New York City, but has additional offices in downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee]] (as seen here).]]
In 1997, both CMT and TNN were sold to [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse]], then-owner of [[CBS]] for a reported $1.5 billion.<ref>"CBS makes cable a 'core business;' with purchase of TNN and CMT, network doubles its cable holdings.(cable television networks)" Article from: Broadcasting & Cable: February 17, 1997 Author: Katz, Michael</ref> The acquisition of the two country-themed networks, along with the formation of the ill-fated [[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]] network, and two [[regional sports network]]s (the [[Baltimore]]-area Home Team Sports, now [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic]], and Midwest Sports Channel in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], now [[Fox Sports North]]) formed the CBS Cable division, based in Nashville at the Grand Ole Opry and a Charlotte office at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]].

In 1999, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired CBS, assuming ownership of CMT and TNN and folding them into the [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] stable. The resulting moves in 2000 led to the closing of the CBS Charlotte office, while Viacom moved TNN's operations from Nashville to its own headquarters in New York City and changed its format, eventually renaming it The National Network and then reformatting it again as [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]; it was renamed as the Paramount Network in January 2018. CMT also experienced a migration of its mainline operations from Nashville to New York (although their Nashville office building was kept as a secondary operation), and experienced a format change; being modeled after [[Sister channel|sister networks]] MTV and [[VH1]] to include series and movies, in addition to music videos. Over time, the number of music videos on the network had steadily decreased with the late May 2006 rebranding of VH1 Country to [[CMT Pure Country]], with music video programming on CMT eventually being relegated mainly to the overnight and morning hours (similar to MTV and VH1). Also, on January 3, 2006, the original Viacom split into two different companies: One being the legal successor to Viacom, [[CBS Corporation]], and the other being the 'new' [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]], with CMT, Spike TV and the MTV family of networks being part of the latter company.

[[File:CMT logo.svg|thumb|Logo used until 2017.]]
Despite the decrease in music videos, CMT has experienced significant ratings gains since its acquisition by MTV Networks in 1999. By 2007, the channel was available in more than 83 million homes.<ref name="underwood">{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Underwood|title=If it has a screen, CMT is on it|url=http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070415/ENTERTAINMENT12/704150355|date=2007-04-15|work=The Tennessean}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As of 2009, the network now reaches 88 million homes.

On April 4, 2012, CMT announced its first [[Adult animation|adult animated]] series, ''[[Bounty Hunters (American TV series)|Bounty Hunters]]'', featuring the voices of [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]] and [[Bill Engvall]] who also serve as executive producers. CMT also announced that it would air ''Trinity 911'', a 10-episode "workplace docu-comedy" that follows the police force in a small Texas town.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=CMT Picks Up Two New Series: 'Bounty Hunters,' and 'Trinity 911'|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/04/cmt-picks-up-two-new-series-bounty-hunters-and-trinity-911/127570/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407041340/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/04/cmt-picks-up-two-new-series-bounty-hunters-and-trinity-911/127570/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 7, 2012|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> ''Trinity 911'' was later renamed ''Big Texas Heat''<ref>{{cite web|title=CMT Lines Up Big Premieres for November with Returning Favorite "Redneck Island" Along with New Series "Chainsaw Gang" and "Big Texas Heat"|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/10/15/cmt-lines-up-big-premieres-for-november-with-returning-favorite-redneck-island-along-with-new-series-chainsaw-gang-and-big-texas-heat-580205/20121015cmt01/|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=May 8, 2013|date=October 15, 2012}}</ref> and removed from the schedule after airing four episodes.

On June 10, 2016, CMT announced that they would pick up the primetime network series ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'' after [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s cancellation of the series, and renewed the series for a fifth full season of 22 episodes; it will continue to be streamed beginning the day after an episode's first airing on [[Hulu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/06/nashville-picked-up-season-5-cmt-hulu-1201769711/|title='Nashville' Picked Up For Season 5 By CMT With Next-Day Play on Hulu|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=June 10, 2016|accessdate=June 10, 2016}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CMT}}
CMT's current programming consists of original southern lifestyle and reality shows and acquired general entertainment programming unrelated to country music. The channel's daily music programming currently consists of a music video block, seen during the early morning hours, as well as ''[[CMT Hot Twenty]]'', which airs on weekend mornings. Of Viacom's former music channels (not counting its suite of all-music digital channels), CMT has historically been the most devoted to music-related programming and previously set aside at least six hours of its daily schedule for music videos during the overnight and morning hours. In addition, most of CMT's original programming is centered or related to the [[Culture of Dallas]] or [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where the network's studios are located.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/cmt-nashville-squares-hollywood-squares-hip-hop/|title=CMT Orders Nashville Version of 'Hollywood Squares' (Exclusive) |publisher=The Wrap |last=Nakamura |first=Reid |date=March 11, 2019|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>

CMT's music mix is primarily focused on mainstream hit country songs, but also includes occasional videos from crossover, [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and alternative acts (dubbed "CMT Edge"). Specials seen on the network include the annual ''[[CMT Music Awards]]'', featuring awards in various categories and performances by country music artists, and ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', which pairs country music artists with musicians from other music genres.

==Spin-offs and International Networks==
* [[CMT Europe]] - Launched in October 1992 and folded in March 1998.
* [[CMT (Australian TV channel)|CMT Australia]] - Launched on July 1, 2020 as a replacement for Country Music Channel. Dedicated to country music videos. 
* [[CMT Music]] - Dedicated to [[country music]] videos. Launched on August 1, 1998 as "[[VH1]] Country" and rebranded as "CMT Pure Country" from May 27, 2006 to January 4, 2016.
* [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT (Canada)]] - Canadian version majority-owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] with Viacom managing a 10% stake in the channel. Unlike its American counterpart, CMT Canada shifted its focus toward family-oriented programming. The network has only sparingly acquired shows and specials sourced from the U.S. version in-favor of producing its own original programming. The channel previously aired country music programming during the daytime hours and general entertainment programming in the evenings; it would abandon the former format altogether in August 2017. It was originally launched as the "New Country Network" on January 1, 1995.
* [[The Nashville Network]] - A former rival network. It became a sibling to CMT in 1997 and eventually shifted to a general entertainment format to prevent overlap. Its original incarnation was relaunched as Spike TV in 2003 and, later, [[Paramount Network]] in 2018.
