The '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''' ('''ABC''') is Australia's national broadcaster, founded in 1929. It is principally funded by the direct grants from the Australian government but is expressly independent of government and partisan politics. The ABC plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in Australia.{{According to whom|date=November 2020}}

Modelled on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in the United Kingdom, which is funded by a [[television licence]], the ABC was originally financed by consumer licence fees on broadcast receivers. Licence fees were abolished in 1973 and replaced principally by direct government grants, as well as revenue from commercial activities related to its core broadcasting mission.

The ABC now provides radio, television, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia and overseas through [[ABC Australia (Asia-Pacific Television)|ABC Australia]] and [[Radio Australia]]. The ABC's headquarters is in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].

==Origins==
Founded in 1929 as the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], the ABC was a government-licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers, authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system. The "A" system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers, with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas, whilst the "B" system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology. Following the general downward economic trends of the era, as entrepreneurial ventures in National infrastructure struggled with viability, the "Company" was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 and renamed as '''Australian Broadcasting Commission''', realigning more closely to the British, BBC model.

The ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''<ref name="abc-act83" /> changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983.<ref name="abc-act83" /> Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains [[editorial independence|editorially independent]] as ensured through the ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983''.<ref name="abc-act83" />

The ABC is sometimes informally referred to as "Aunty",<ref name="NewTeethForAunty">{{cite web |title=New Teeth for Aunty: Reinvigorating the National Broadcaster |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |date=1 December 2007 |work=Monthly |author=Robert Manne |access-date=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111130151/http://www.themonthly.com.au/reinvigorating-national-broadcaster-new-teeth-aunty-robert-manne-749 |archive-date=11 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|title=Aunty celebrates 75th birthday in Townsville|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=1 August 2018|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018013704/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/aunty-celebrates-75th-birthday-in-townsville/2503718|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|title=Why I love Aunty at 80|date=28 June 2012|website=ABC|access-date=7 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904045204/http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/28/3534787.htm|archive-date=4 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> originally in imitation of the [[BBC#Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture|British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |title=Aunty, a personality of steady and solid conservatism |work=Background briefing 4 – Ken Inglis |publisher=Friends of the ABC |access-date=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127091453/http://www.fabc.org.au/fabc/fabc_archive_data/background_briefing/bb104/bb4_9.html |archive-date=27 January 2012 }}</ref>

Following a 1927 [[royal commission]] inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations.<ref name="langdon95" /> On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.<ref name="langdon95" /><ref name=ABC010712>{{cite web|title=ABC celebrates 80 years of broadcasting|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 July 2012|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-01/abc-celebrates-80-years/4103108|access-date=1 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712205932/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-01/abc-turns-80/4103108|archive-date=12 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy.<ref name="bcasthistory">{{cite web

News broadcasts were initially restricted, due to pressure from [[Keith Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch]], who controlled many Australian newspapers. However, journalists such as Frank Dixon and [[John Hinde (broadcaster)|John Hinde]] began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s. in 1939, Warren Denning was appointed to Canberra as the first ABC political correspondent, after Murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by [[Joseph Lyons]].<ref>{{cite news | title=How the newspapers tried to kill an independent ABC news before it even began | author=Stan Correy | date=1 June 2017 | publisher=ABC News | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-01/how-the-newspapers-tried-to-kill-abc-news-before-it-even-began/8568482 | access-date=2 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601221939/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-01/how-the-newspapers-tried-to-kill-abc-news-before-it-even-began/8568482 | archive-date=1 June 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1975, colour television was permanently introduced into Australia after experimental colour broadcasts since 1967, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network.<ref name="abc-60s70s" /> A year later, a national classical music network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide.

A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs.<ref name="abc-80s" /> Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach.<ref name="abc-80s" />

ABC Radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as [[Radio National]] (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as ''The World Today'', ''Australia All Over'', and ''The Coodabeen Champions'' were introduced, while [[ABC Classic FM|ABC-FM]] established an Australian Music Unit in 1989.<ref name="abc-80s" /> [[Radio Australia]] began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 Fijian coup]], [[Tiananmen Square massacre]], and the [[First Gulf War]].<ref name="abc-80s" />

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.<ref name="abc-90s" />

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.<ref name="abc-90s" /> Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990.<ref name="abc-90s" /> [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network broadcast on the [[Parliamentary and News Network]] when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.<ref name="abc-90s" />

===2000s===
In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation.<ref name="abc-00s" /> In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as "the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour".<ref name="abc-00s" /> The first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series ''[[Something in the Air (TV series)|Something in the Air]]'', ''[[Grass Roots (TV series)|Grass Roots]]'' and ''In the Mind of the Architect''.

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed "ABC New Media", becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio.<ref name="abc-00s" /> Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, [[Fly TV]] and the [[ABC Kids channel]] launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched [[Australia Network|ABC Asia Pacific]] – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network [[Radio Australia]], the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel.

The ABC launched a digital radio service, [[ABC DiG]], in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until [[DAB+]] became available in 2009.

[[ABC2]], a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005. Unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding, instead running on a budget of A$3&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="whoseabc">{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC?

===Funding===
The ABC is primarily funded by the [[Australian Government]], in addition to some revenue received commercial offerings and [[ABC Commercial|its retail outlets]]. Based on a triennial funding system, the ABC's funding is set and reviewed every three years.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wils|first=Tyson|date=May 2018|title=Funding for the national broadcasters|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview201819/Fundingfornationalbroadcasters|access-date=2 July 2020|website=Parliament of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703155615/https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview201819/Fundingfornationalbroadcasters|archive-date=3 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the ''Australian Broadcasting Act'' that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.

In 2014, the ABC absorbed A$254 million in federal budget deficits.<ref name="SydneyMH ENGF">{{Cite web|last=Hunter|first=Fergus|date=2 April 2019|title=Federal budget 2019: ABC wins local news-gathering funds|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/federal-budget-2019-abc-wins-local-newsgathering-funds-20190402-1o25za.html|access-date=2 July 2020|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703235123/https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/federal-budget-2019-abc-wins-local-newsgathering-funds-20190402-1o25za.html|archive-date=3 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the 2018 Budget handed down by then-Treasurer [[Scott Morrison]], the ABC has been subject to a pause of indexation of operation funding, saving the Federal Government a total of A$83.7 million over 3 years.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Scott|last2=Cormann|first2=Mathias|date=8 May 2018|title=Budget Measures, Budget Paper No. 2 2018-19|url=https://archive.budget.gov.au/2018-19/bp2/bp2.pdf|access-date=2 July 2020|website=2018-19 Budget}}</ref> In [[fiscal year]] 2016-17, the ABC received A$861 million in Federal Government funding, which increased to A$865 million per year from 2017-18 to 2018-19, representing a cut in funding of A$43 million over three years when accounting for inflation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Annual Report 2017 - Volume II|url=https://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ABC7171_AR_2017_Vol2_tagged_v5.pdf|access-date=2 July 2020|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Annual Report 2018 - Volume II|url=https://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AP18_Vol2_FINAL_3new.pdf|access-date=2 July 2020|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321160025/http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/AP18_Vol2_FINAL_3new.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Inflation Calculator|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|access-date=2 July 2020|website=Reserve Bank of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625131710/https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|archive-date=25 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019-20, the federal budget forecast funding of A$3.2 billion over three years (A$1.06 billion per year) for the ABC.<ref name="2019-20 Budget Expenses" /> The ''Enhanced Newsgathering Fund'', a specialised fund for regional and outer-suburban news gathering set up in 2013 by the [[Rudd Government (2013)|Rudd Government]], currently sits at A$44 million over three years, a reduction of A$28 million per year since the [[2016 Australian federal election]].

===Independence and impartiality===

In relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives, the current ABC editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview|title=The ABC: an overview|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=11 August 2014|access-date=20 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115758/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview|archive-date=26 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Criticisms ===
As a publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues, and is required to present a range of views with impartiality. Over the decades, accusations of "bias" at the ABC have arisen at different times, and various inquiries undertaken.

Reviews of the ABC are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released.<ref name=Martin>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Fiona|title=What would be the point of yet another ABC inquiry?|url=http://theconversation.com/what-would-be-the-point-of-yet-another-abc-inquiry-21213|work=The Conversation|access-date=30 November 2014|date=12 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gordon>{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=Canberra refuses to release report on ABC funding|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/canberra-refuses-to-release-report-on-abc-funding-20140305-347l7.html|access-date=30 November 2014|date=6 March 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Maxine McKew Portrait 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Lateline host [[Maxine McKew]] won a seat in federal parliament in the 2007 and served for one term.]]

The ABC's requirement of impartiality has led to persistent debates. External critics have complained in particular of [[left-wing]] political bias at the broadcaster, citing a prominence of Labor Party-connected journalists hosting masthead political programs or a tendency to favour "progressive" over "conservative" political views on issues such as immigration, refugees, the republic, multiculturalism, reconciliation, feminism, environmentalism, anti-Americanism, gay marriage, budgeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview#_Toc395086092|title=The ABC: an overview- Pt 5 The ABC and Bias|date=11 August 2014|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=1 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704022008/https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/ABCoverview#_Toc395086092|archive-date=4 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1771608.htm|title=The ABC of How To Complain|newspaper=Media Watch|date=23 October 2006|publisher=ABC|access-date=8 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418072247/http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1771608.htm|archive-date=18 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=NewTeethForAunty/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/kerry-obrien-opens-up-about-his-critics-his-family-and-a-new-life-in-byron-20101130-18el9.html|title=Kerry O'Brien opens up about his critics, his family and a new life in Byron|last=Dick|first=Tim|date=30 November 2010|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201235805/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/kerry-obrien-opens-up-about-his-critics-his-family-and-a-new-life-in-byron-20101130-18el9.html|archive-date=1 December 2010|access-date=1 August 2018}}</ref>

At the 2016 federal election, a study commissioned by the ABC and conducted by iSentia compiled share-of-voice data and found that the ABC devoted 42.6% of election coverage to the Coalition government (this compares to the 42.04% vote received by the Coalition in the House of Representatives (HOR)), 35.9% to the Labor opposition (34.73% HOR), 8% to the Greens (10.23% HOR), 3.1% to independents (1.85% HOR), 2.2% to Nick Xenophon's Team (1.85% HOR) and 8.1% to the rest. However, the ABC itself notes the "significant limitations around the value of share of voice data" as "duration says nothing about tone or context".<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2016 Federal Election Report of the Chairman, Election Coverage Review Committee |url=http://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016FederalElectionECRCRPT.pdf |year=2016 |access-date=20 June 2018}}</ref>

; Management responses to allegations of bias

In a March 2016 interview with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, ''Media Watch'' host Paul Barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don't do that kind of journalism. We don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards..."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4432757.htm Easter Special: An interview with Mark Scott]; Media Watch; Episode 09, 28 March 2016.</ref> Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" while former ''Media Watch'' host Jonathan Holmes wrote for ''The Age'' that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/comment/abc-radio-personalities-need-to-tune-out-their-leftwing-bias-20160404-gnyfse.html#ixzz48n8clYIF ABC radio personalities need to tune out their left-wing bias]; Jonathan Holmes, ''The Age''; 5 April 2016</ref>

Over the period, ABC TV and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage, upon which the wider Australian community and political parties were divided.

====Coverage of the Catholic Church====
The ABC's coverage of the Catholic Church has been controversial. The Archbishop of Brisbane, [[Mark Coleridge]], condemned the ABC in 2017 for an "antagonistic, one-sided narrative" of the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://catholicleader.com.au/news/archbishop-coleridge-says-abc-not-interested-in-the-real-story-of-the-catholic-church-following-controversial-domestic-violence-report "Archbishop Coleridge says ABC not interested in the 'real story' of the Catholic Church"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504052808/http://catholicleader.com.au/news/archbishop-coleridge-says-abc-not-interested-in-the-real-story-of-the-catholic-church-following-controversial-domestic-violence-report |date=4 May 2019 }}, ''Catholic Leader'', 26 July 2017.</ref> [[Gerard Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]] has written that "The ABC's focus on historic child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church stands in contrast to its failure to cover the public broadcaster’s own history in this area."<ref>[https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/11/anti-catholic-media-coverage-child-sexual-abuse/ "Anti-Catholicism in the Coverage of Child Sexual Abuse"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043602/https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/11/anti-catholic-media-coverage-child-sexual-abuse/ |date=6 March 2019 }}, ''Quadrant Online'', 21 November 2018.</ref> In the aftermath of the wrongful conviction of Adelaide archbishop Phillip Wilson in 2018, and the wrongful conviction of Cardinal [[George Pell]] by a jury in 2019, journalist [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]] wrote that "calculated media assaults on Pell" had been "spearheaded by the ABC", contributing to an intense and unjustified public hatred of the Catholic leader and prejudicial environment in which to conduct a trial.<ref>[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/pells-conviction-and-fall-from-high-public-esteem-is-a-question-of-judgment/news-story/c39523ba4447c7659d6b3823581f03b7 "Pell's conviction and fall from high public esteem is a question of judgment"], ''The Australian'', 2 March 2019.</ref>

The ABC's coverage of the issue has also won praise including the awarding of the 'Melbourne Press Club 2016 Quill for Coverage of an Issue or Event for the report 'George Pell and Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church' and the 2016 Golden Quill award to Louise Milligan and Andy Burns for their extensive coverage of Cardinal George Pell's evidence given at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In awarding the prize judges noted ''"Their interviews with victims were compelling, moving and handled with great humanity. The work delivered a series of scoops, including detailed allegations about the conduct of Cardinal George Pell.

Summarising his case against the ABC's coverage of Pell, conservative commentator Greg Sheridan wrote on 16 April:

{{quotation|[The ABC] should understand the multiplying, almost exponential, intimidating effect of its tendency to project the same message across all its platforms, including the social media platforms of its journalists and its comedy and satire programs. No individual can withstand a full herd assault by the ABC. No one should have to. Pell was not only abused and unfairly reported in ABC news and current affairs. The ABC featured favourites like [[Tim Minchin]] singing ''Come Home Cardinal Pell'', which included the line: "I think you’re scum". Does no one in the ABC anywhere have the slightest misgiving about this? Can anyone the ABC hates ever get a fair trial? Four Corners and the 7.30 Report devoted whole programs to vilifying Pell. The allegations they used were either dismissed or lacked sufficient evidence to come to court, despite the overwhelming desire of the Victorian system to prosecute Pell. There is an acknowledgment of this on the programs' websites, but viewers who don’t read the websites have not been informed that the slander of Pell was wrong.|Greg Sheridan, Foreign Editor, ''The Australian''<ref name="theaustralian.com.au">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/abcs-groupthink-on-george-pell-a-sin-against-journalism/news-story/ba3a43fe6ca1d4625a3857884dfaad2c ABC’s groupthink on George Pell a sin against journalism]; Greg Sheridan; ''The Australian''; 16 April 2020</ref> }}

The letters "ABC" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with [[Australian pound|£]]25 for his design.<ref name="atvh-50s60s"/>

On 19 October 1974, the Lissajous curve design experienced its first facelift with the line thickened to allow for colour to be used. It would also be treated to the 'over and under' effect, showing the crossover of the line in the design. This logo would be served as the longest-running design with a lifespan of 44 years and 28 on its first on-air run. To celebrate its 70th anniversary on 1 July 2002, the ABC adopted a new logo, which was created by (Annette) Harcus Design in 2001. This logo utilized a silver 3D texture but the crossover design was left intact. This logo would then be used across the ABC's media outlets. However, some brands may continue to use this logo. The 2002 silver logo is no longer in use by the corporation, with the exception of some of the ABC's radio station logos. After the on-air revival of the 1974 logo since 2014, the ABC gradually reinstated the classic symbol while using a new logotype in 2018. The change comes with a press release that the ABC released on 12 February announcing a new brand positioning under its tagline, ''Yours''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
