==History==
{{Main|History of Addis Ababa|Timeline of Addis Ababa}}
[[File:Statue of Menelik II.jpg|thumb|Menelik II [[Equestrian statue|Equestrian]] Monument commemorating the victory of the Ethiopians in [[Battle of Adwa]], dedicated to [[Menelik II]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] on 1 March 1896|left]]
Prior to the establishment of present-day Addis Ababa the location was called Finfinne in the Oromo language, which attests the presence of hot springs. The area was inhabited by various Oromo clans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://journalajaees.com/index.php/AJAEES/article/view/30392/57023|title= Foundation of Addis Ababa and the Emergence of Safars|author=Endalew Djirata Fayisa}}</ref> In 1886 the city was chosen by [[Menelik II]] as the capital of his kingdom of Shoa and was renamed to Addis Ababa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Finfinne|title=Addis Ababa}}</ref> 
The city's immediate predecessor as capital of Ethiopia, [[Entoto]], was situated on a high tableland and was found to be unsatisfactory because of its cold climate and an acute shortage of firewood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Addis-Ababa|title=Addis Ababa national capital, Ethiopia}}</ref> Entoto is one of a handful of sites put forward as a possible location for a medieval imperial capital known as Barara. This permanent fortified city was established during the early-to-mid 15th century, and it served as the main residence of several successive emperors up to the early 16th-century reign of [[Dawit II|Lebna Dengel]].<ref name=Addis2>Philip Briggs. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&dq=%22a+permanent+fortified+city+called+barara+was%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhrZK36JbMAhVJyRQKHdFJCJoQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&q=%22a%20permanent%20fortified%20city%20called%20barara%20was%22&f=false Ethiopia]. Bradt Travel Guides (2015) pp. 49–50</ref> The city was depicted standing between Mounts Zikwala and Menegasha on a map drawn by the Italian cartographer [[Fra Mauro]] in around 1450, and it was razed and plundered by [[Ahmed Gragn]] while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the [[Awash River]] in 1529, an event witnessed and documented two years later by the Yemeni writer Arab-Faqih. The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor [[Menelik II|Menelik]]. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.<ref name=Addis1>Philip Briggs.

The site of Addis Ababa was chosen by Empress [[Taytu Betul]] and the city was founded in 1886 by Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]].<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 6</ref> Menelik, as initially a King of the [[Shewa]] province, had found [[Mount Entoto]] a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 he visited the reputed ruins of a medieval town and an unfinished rock church that showed proof of the medieval empire's capital in the area before the campaigns of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim]]. His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.<ref name=Addis2 /><ref name=Addis1 />

However, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of [[firewood]] and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the "Filwoha" hot [[mineral springs]], where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial Palace]] which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous [[eucalyptus]] trees along the city streets.<ref>Pankhurst, p. 195</ref>
[[File:Selassie_and_Nasser,_1963.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia and President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt in Addis Ababa for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit, 1963.]]
Following all the major engagements of [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|their invasion]], [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Italian]] troops from the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with [[Dire Dawa]], the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) practiced elsewhere and [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway|its railway]] to [[Djibouti]] remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]]'s capital for unified [[Italian East Africa]] until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1941)|Amba Alagi]] and other redoubts during the [[Second World War]]'s [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. The city was liberated by Major [[Orde Wingate]] and [[negus]] [[Haile Selassie]] for Ethiopian [[Gideon Force]] and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the [[African Union]] (AU), which is also headquartered in the city. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches]] in 1965.

Addis Ababa has a [[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwb'') with precipitation varying considerably by the month.<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/532/ |title=Climate: Addis Abeba (altitude: 2350m) – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=6 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404184152/http://en.climate-data.org/location/532/ |archive-date=4 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city has a complex mix of [[highland climate]] zones, with temperature differences of up to {{convert|10|C-change}}, depending on elevation and prevailing wind patterns. The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the [[equator]] means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be [[oceanic climate|maritime]] if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above {{convert|22|C|F}} in mean temperatures.

Mid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than {{convert|23|°C}}, and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of {{convert|10|-|15|°C}}. At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterized by dark, chilly and wet days and nights. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.

The highest temperature on record was {{convert|30.6|C}} 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was {{convert|0|C}} recorded on multiple occasions.<ref name=meteoclimat/>

Pursuant to the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, the city of Addis Ababa is one of the two federal cities that are accountable to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.

The administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.

The Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer [[Takele Uma Benti]] from the [[Oromo Democratic Party]], ODP formerly [[Oromo People Democratic Organisation]] (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.

Some of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are [[Arkebe Oqubay]] (2003–06), Zewde Teklu (1985–89), Alemu Abebe (1977–85) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960–69).

===Crime===
Addis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|title=5 Reasons to Visit Addis Ababa Now|website=www.fodors.com|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235156/http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|archive-date=14 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate. Pickpocketing and petty unarmed thefts are more common within the city. Corruption and bribery are extremely common crimes in Addis Ababa. Violent crimes are very unlikely to happen in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Addis-Ababa|title=Crime in Addis Ababa|website=www.numbeo.com|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233410/https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Addis-Ababa|archive-date=14 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Places of worship ==
[[File:Anwar Mosque (211073075).jpeg|thumb|Grand Anwar mosque in Addis Ababa]]
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus]] ([[Lutheran World Federation]]), [[Ethiopian Kale Heywet Church]], [[Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers' Church]]<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘‘Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices’’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 1004-1007</ref> and also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

==Architecture==
A financial district is under construction in Addis Ababa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hahudaily.com/2015/08/05/ethiopia-building-a-financial-center-in-addis-ababa/|title=Ethiopia building a Financial District in Addis Ababa|first=Abiy|last=Solomon|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011005818/http://hahudaily.com/2015/08/05/ethiopia-building-a-financial-center-in-addis-ababa/|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Mayor [[Kuma Demeksa]] embarked on a quest to improve investment for the buildings in the city. Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] and the [[African Union]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|last=Lagasse|first=Paul|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2018|isbn=|edition=8th|location=New York, NY|pages=|via=Credo Reference}}</ref>

Notable taller architecture in Addis Ababa includes the CBE headquarters, NIB international bank, Zemen bank, Hibret bank, Huda Tower, Nani Tower, Bank Misr Building, as well as the approved Angola World Trade Center Tower, Abyssinia Bank Tower, Mexico Square Tower, and the $200m [[AU Conference Center and Office Complex]].<ref>Addis Today by Molalign GIRMA, 2014</ref>

Notable buildings include [[St George's Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|St George's Cathedral]] (founded in 1896 and also home to a museum), [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] (once the largest [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Cathedral]] and the location of [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]'s tomb) as well as the burial place of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] and the Imperial family, and those who fought the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion during World War II]].

In the Merkato district, which is the largest open market in Africa, is the Grand Anwar Mosque, the biggest mosque in Ethiopia built during the Italian occupation. A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near [[Bole International Airport]] is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.

The [[Entoto Mountains]] start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and [[Entoto]] in the north, Urael and [[Bole Medhanealem|Bole]] (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, [[Nifas Silk]] in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and [[Keranio (Addis Ababa)|Keraniyo]] and [[Kolfe]] in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in [[Nelson Mandela]]'s Autobiography "A Long Walk to Freedom", as the place he got military training.

Addis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|title=Ethiopia Capital City, About Addis Ababa Tourism and Travel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115131857/http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|archive-date=15 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all|access-date=14 November 2016}}</ref>

Parks include the [[Africa Park]], which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.

Other features of the city include the large [[Addis Mercato|Mercato]] market, the Jan Meda [[racecourse]], Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to [[Djibouti]].

The city is home to the [[Ethiopian National Library]], the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and [[Guenete Leul Palace|former Guenete Leul Palace]]), the [[Addis Ababa Museum]], the [[Ethiopian Natural History Museum]], the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.

There is also [[Menelek II of Ethiopia|Menelik]]'s old [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial palace]] which remains the official seat of government, and the [[National Palace (Ethiopia)|National Palace]] formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after [[Buckingham Palace]] in the United Kingdom. [[Africa Hall]] is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which eventually became the [[African Union]] (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished [[Akaki Prison]], on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The [[Hager Fikir Theatre]], the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the [[Derg]] regime of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in [[Finland]] before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions. [[Taitu Hotel|Itegue Taitu Hotel]], built in 1898 ([[Ethiopian Calendar]]) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.

[[Meskel Square]] is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual [[Meskel]] at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.

The fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] (known in Ethiopia as ''Dinkinesh'') is preserved at the [[National Museum of Ethiopia]].

==Sport==
Sport facilities include [[Addis Abeba Stadium|Addis Ababa]] and [[Nyala Stadium]]s. The [[2008 African Championships in Athletics]] were held in Addis Ababa.

===Development===
The city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO [[Glocal Forum]] serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.

Launched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the [[Quincy Jones]] Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], UN agencies and major companies.

==Education==
[[File:ET Addis asv2018-01 img13 University gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Addis Ababa University]]]]
[[Addis Ababa University]] was founded in 1950 and was originally named "University College of Addis Ababa", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including [[Addis Ababa Science and Technology University]], [[Ethiopian Civil Service University]], [[Admas University College–Addis Ababa|Admas University College]], [[St. Mary's University (Addis Ababa)|St. Mary's University]], [[Unity University]], Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.

==Transport==
[[File:Bole international airport.jpg|thumb|Bole international airport]]
Public transport is through public buses from three different companies ([[Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise]], Sheger, Alliance), [[Light Rail]] or blue and white [[taxi]]s. The taxis are usually [[minibus]]es that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a ''[[weyala]]'' who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.

=== Road ===
The construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions ([[Jimma]], [[Bishoftu]], [[Dessie]], [[Gojjam]] and [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]]). For this project, [[China Road and Bridge Corporation]] (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT:-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |accessdate=8 December 2010 |title=INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTI-NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Addis Ababa Ring Road Project – A Case Study of a Chinese ... |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174403/http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT%3A-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.

Intercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.

=== Air ===

The city is served by [[Addis Ababa Bole International Airport]], where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western "Old Airport" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.{{Dubious|Lideta|date=May 2009}}

=== Railway ===
Addis Ababa originally had a [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|railway connection]] with [[Djibouti City]], with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.

=== Light rail ===
[[File:ET Addis asv2018-01 img07 Light Rail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Light rail overpass at Lideta station, Addis Ababa]]
{{main|Addis Ababa Light Rail}}

Addis Ababa opened its [[Addis Ababa Light Rail|light rail system]] to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.

The Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the [[Export and Import Bank of China]] in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a {{convert|34.25|km|adj=on}} network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east–west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/chinese-funding-for-addis-abeba-light-rail.html
