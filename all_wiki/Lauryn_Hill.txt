'''Lauryn Noelle Hill''' (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Often regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, as well as being a pioneer in the [[Neo soul]] genre, Hill is widely credited for breaking barriers for female rappers, popularizing melodic rapping and for bringing [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] to [[popular music]]. She is known for being a member of [[Fugees]], and for her solo album ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'', which won [[List of awards and nominations received by Lauryn Hill|many awards]] and broke several [[Best-selling albums in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began|sales records]]. Hill has influenced many artists of various genres.

Raised mostly in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She appeared in the 1993 film ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'' alongside [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. In high school, Hill was approached by [[Pras|Pras Michel]] for a band he started, which his cousin [[Wyclef Jean]] soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released the albums ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'' (1994), and the [[Grammy Award]]–winning ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' (1996), which sold six million copies in the U.S. Hill rose to prominence for her [[African-American music|African-American]] and [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean music]] influences on her rapping and singing as well as her performance on the Fugees version of "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song|Killing Me Softly]]". Soon after Hill began to focus on solo projects, writing and producing "[[A Rose Is Still a Rose (song)|A Rose Is Still a Rose]]" by [[Aretha Franklin]], then featuring on the Grammy Award-nominated songs "[[If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)]]" by [[Nas]] and [[Guantanamera]] by Wyclef Jean. Soon after her tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began work on her solo album.

''The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' (1998) remains Hill's sole solo studio album. It received widespread critical acclaim for showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary voice within the [[neo soul]] genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and has sold approximately eight million copies there. This included the singles "[[Doo Wop (That Thing)]]", "[[Ex-Factor]]", and "[[Everything Is Everything (Lauryn Hill song)|Everything Is Everything]]". At the [[41st Annual Grammy Awards|41st Grammy Awards]], the record earned her five awards, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]. During this time, she won several other awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines.<ref>{{cite web|first=Stereo|last=Williams|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-racist-smear-campaign-destroyed-lauryn-hills-career|title=How a Racist Smear Campaign Destroyed Lauryn Hill's Career|website=The Daily Beast|date=April 22, 2018|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-date=December 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207223035/https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-racist-smear-campaign-destroyed-lauryn-hills-career|url-status=live}}</ref>

Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, dissatisfied with the music industry and suffering from the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album ''[[MTV Unplugged No. 2.0]]'' (2002), sold approximately one million copies in the U.S., and sharply divided critics upon its release, but has since received retrospective praise. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic. Her music and public statements have become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of them with [[Rohan Marley]]. In 2012, she pleaded guilty to [[tax evasion]] and served a three-month prison sentence the following year.

===1994–1996: The Fugees===

===2000–2003: Self-imposed exile and ''MTV Unplugged No. 2.0''===
Hill began writing a screenplay about the life of [[Bob Marley]], in which she planned to act as his wife [[Rita Marley|Rita]].<ref name="rollingstone" /> She also began producing a [[romantic comedy]] about [[soul food]] with a working title of ''Sauce'', and accepted a starring role in the [[Beloved (1998 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'';<ref name="rollingstone" /> she later dropped out of both projects due to pregnancy.<ref name="rollingstone" /> She also reportedly turned down roles in ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (the part that went to [[Lucy Liu]]), ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'', ''[[The Mexican]]'', ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''.<ref name="rollingstone" />

She later described this period of her life to ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' saying "People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time … I had to step away when I realized that for the sake of the machine, I was being way too compromised.
