In December 2018, President Trump called Tillerson "dumb as a rock" and "lazy as hell" after Tillerson held a speech where he described Trump as "pretty undisciplined". Tillerson said Trump "doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things".

In October 2017, ''Politico'' reported that Tillerson's major foreign policy positions include "urging the United States to stay in the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] and the [[Paris climate accord]], taking a hard line on Russia, advocating negotiations and dialogue to defuse the mounting crisis with North Korea, advocating for continued U.S. adherence to the [[Iran nuclear deal framework|Iran nuclear deal]], taking a neutral position in the [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia diplomatic conflict|dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia]], and reassuring jittery allies, from South Korea and Japan to our NATO partners, that America still has their back".<ref>Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky, "Should Rex Tillerson Resign?", [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/01/should-rex-tillerson-resign-215664 ''Politico''  October 1, 2017]</ref>

During his Secretary of State confirmation hearings, [[Marco Rubio]] asked Tillerson if he would label [[Saudi Arabia]] as a "human rights violator".

=== Climate change and carbon tax ===
Tillerson announced in 2009 that ExxonMobil favored a [[carbon tax]] as "the most efficient means of [[Carbon price|reflecting the cost of carbon]] in all economic decisions—from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/corporate-citizenship-sustainability/exxonmobil-and-the-carbon-tax|title=ExxonMobil and the carbon tax|publisher=ExxonMobil.com|date=December 2, 2015}}</ref> In October 2016, less than two months before his nomination as Secretary of State, he reaffirmed that ExxonMobil believed a carbon tax would be "the best policy of those being considered. Replacing the hodge-podge of current, largely ineffective regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon tax would ensure a uniform and predictable cost of carbon across the economy ... allow market forces to drive solutions ... maximize transparency, reduce administrative complexity, promote global participation and easily adjust" to new knowledge in climate science and in the policy consequences of various courses of action.<ref>{{cite speech |title=The Path Forward in Today's Energy Environment |first=Rex |last=Tillerson |event=37th Annual Oil and Money Conference |location=London, England |date=October 19, 2016 |url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/news-and-updates/speeches/the-path-forward-in-todays-energy-environment |access-date=December 23, 2016}}</ref>

An article in ''The New York Times'' suggested that ExxonMobil's embrace of a carbon tax in October 2009 may have simply been an effort to avoid [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] legislation that was then being considered by the U.S. Congress as an alternative method of [[carbon pricing]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |title=Tillerson Led Exxon's Shift on Climate Change; Some Say 'It Was All P.R.' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 28, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/business/energy-environment/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-exxon.html |access-date=September 4, 2020}}</ref> A ''Time'' magazine article in December 2016 asserted that since Tillerson announced his company's preference for a carbon tax, ExxonMobil "has not made a carbon tax a focus of its massive lobbying efforts and has supported a number of candidates and organizations that oppose measures to tackle the [climate change] issue".<ref>{{cite news |last=Worland |first=Justin |title=What Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State Would Mean for Climate Change |newspaper=Time |date=December 14, 2016 |url=http://time.com/4598499/rex-tillerson-donald-trump-exxon-mobil-climate-change/?xid=homepage |access-date=December 30, 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, Tillerson outlined his support for the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP), stating at the Global Security Forum: "One of the most promising developments on this front is the ongoing effort for the Trans-Pacific Partnership ... The 11 nations that have been working to lower trade barriers and end protectionist policies under this partnership are a diverse mix of developed and developing economies.

=== Free trade ===
Speaking in March 2007 at a [[Council on Foreign Relations]] event, Tillerson said:{{cquote|Should the United States seek so-called [[energy independence]] in an elusive effort to insulate this country from the impact of world events on the economy, or should Americans pursue the path of international engagement, seeking ways to better compete within the global market for energy?
