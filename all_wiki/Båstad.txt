'''Båstad''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈbôːsta(d)}})<ref>{{cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/ortnamn/0010.html|author1=Jöran Sahlgren|author2=Gösta Bergman|title=Svenska ortnamn med uttalsuppgifter|language=sv|year=1979|page=6}}</ref> (old {{lang-da|Baasted}}) is a [[Urban areas in Sweden|locality]] and the seat of [[Båstad Municipality]], [[Skåne County]], [[Sweden]], with approximately 5,000 permanent residents.<ref name=scb /> It is however one of Sweden's most typical summer resorts. The population is presumably more than twice as large between April and September, and even larger during July. Its municipality follows a similar pattern: some 15,000 permanent residents, but more than 30,000 during July. Some villages within the municipality are almost empty during the winter, but have more than a 2,000 "summer guests" during July. [[Torekov]] is a good example of this.

Within Sweden, Båstad is well known for [[tennis]]. The largest centre court in Sweden is located in the town's centre, and can take more than 5,000 attendants. Several top national players, such as [[Björn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Stefan Edberg]], have played tennis in Båstad.

==Geography==
[[Image:Båstad, Sweden.jpg|left|thumb|The [[marina]];  Hallandian ridge in background]]
The town of Båstad is located in a sheltered bay with the Hallandian ridge stretching behind it. The town borders the shore, whereafter the terrain raises until the dense vegetation of the ridge takes over.

==History==
The first city privileges were granted in the 14th or 15th century, when the area belonged to [[Denmark]]. The first certain date is 1513 when it was re-granted. At the time, the name in print was ''Botstœdœ'', which would translate to "Boat (landing) place".

In 1658, the area was [[Treaty of Roskilde|conquered]] by [[Sweden]], and Båstad was given new "special" privileges in 1664, because it was of too insignificant size to receive the full [[royal charter]] as one of [[Cities in Sweden|Sweden's cities]]. The minor privilege allowed the town to be used for commerce, [[handicraft]] and [[hostel]]ry. The minor privilege was in effect until 1858 when it got proper rights as a ''merchant town'', or ''[[köping]]''. It has been the seat of [[Båstad Municipality]] since 1971.

Båstad is known for its [[tennis]] tournament [[Swedish Open]] on the [[ATP Tour]], held each summer since 1948. The tournament boasts the largest number of courts in the country, and has fostered many internationally successful tennis players, such as [[Magnus Larsson]]. It attracts some 20,000 visitors and puts the town in a festive mood for a few weeks. Since 2009, the women's [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournament, previously held in [[Stockholm]], also is played in Båstad as part of the Swedish Open.

The city is also home of the [[Troentorp clogs|Troentorp Clog]], formerly known as Båstad Clogs. Troentorp Clogs have been handcrafted in Båstad since 1907 and continue to be produced with the original wooden design.

==Sights==
[[Image:Mariakyrkan i Båstad, maj 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Båstad Church]]]]
The [[Båstad Church|Church of Båstad]] or Saint Mary's Church is located in central Båstad. It was constructed in the 15th century. It is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church, and contains several wall paintings from various centuries; a madonna image; and a Danish altarpiece, among other things.

A few kilometers outside of Båstad there is a large garden called [[Norrviken Gardens]], which was founded by [[Rudolf Abelin]] in the 1900. It once had been chosen as the most beautiful park in Sweden, and the second most beautiful in Europe in 2006.<ref name=bastad>{{cite web |url=http://www.bastad.se/turism-evenemang/sevardheter/norrvikens-tradgardar/ |title=Norrvikens trädgårdar |publisher=[[Båstad Municipality]] |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821013921/http://www.bastad.se/turism-evenemang/sevardheter/norrvikens-tradgardar/ |archive-date=21 August 2010 |url-status=dead |accessdate=4 September 2011 }}</ref>
