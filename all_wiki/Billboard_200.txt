The '''''Billboard'' 200''' is a [[record chart]] ranking the 200 most popular [[Album|music albums]] and [[extended play|EPs]] in the United States. It is published weekly by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. It is frequently used to convey the popularity of an [[recording artist|artist]] or groups of artists. Often, a recording act will be remembered by its "[[chart-topper|number ones]]", those of their albums that outperformed all others during at least one week. The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 in May 1967, and acquired its present title in March 1992. Its previous names include the '''''Billboard'' Top LPs''' (1961–72), '''''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tape''' (1972–84), '''''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums''' (1984–85) and '''''Billboard'' Top Pop Albums'''.

The chart is based mostly on sales (both at [[retail]] and [[Music download|digital]]) of albums in the United States. The weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday when [[Nielsen Soundscan|Nielsen]] started tracking sales in 1991, but since July 2015, tracking week begins on Friday (to coincide with the Global Release Date of the [[music industry]]) and ends on Thursday. A new chart is published the following Tuesday with an issue post-dated to the Saturday of that week, four days later.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8071011/billboard-chart-magazine-dates-release-week-change|title=Billboard Chart & Magazine Dates Now to Align Closer to Release Week|magazine=Billboard|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref> The chart's [[Music streaming|streaming]] schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday.<ref name="tracking">{{cite news|last=Billboard Staff |title=Billboard to Alter Chart Tracking Week for Global Release Date |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6851718/panic-at-the-disco-first-no-1-album-death-of-a-bachelor-billboard-200-charts |work=Billboard |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=June 24, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126063257/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6851718/panic-at-the-disco-first-no-1-album-death-of-a-bachelor-billboard-200-charts |archivedate=January 26, 2016 }}</ref>

==History==
''Billboard'' began an album chart in 1945. Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position Best-Selling Popular Albums chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in [[album sales]] as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing twelve-inch albums, with 78 RPM record and long-playing ten-inch album sales decreasing dramatically, ''Billboard'' premiered a weekly Best-Selling Popular Albums chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first number-one album on the new weekly list was ''Belafonte'' by [[Harry Belafonte]]. The chart was renamed to Best-Selling Pop Albums later in 1956, and then to Best-Selling Pop LPs in 1957.

Beginning on May 25, 1959, ''Billboard'' split the ranking into two charts ''Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs'' for [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] albums (30 positions) and ''Best-Selling Monophonic LPs'' for [[Monaural|mono]] albums (50 positions). These were renamed to ''Stereo Action Charts'' (30 positions) and ''Mono Action Charts'' (40 positions) in 1960. In January 1961, they became ''Action Albums—Stereophonic'' (15 positions) and ''Action Albums—Monophonic'' (25 positions). Three months later, they became ''Top LPs—Stereo'' (50 positions) and ''Top LPs—Monaural'' (150 positions).

On August 17, 1963, the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called ''Top LPs''. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart's title was changed to ''Top LPs & Tape''; in 1984, it was retitled ''Top 200 Albums''; in 1985, it was retitled again to ''Top Pop Albums''; in 1991, it became ''The Billboard 200 Top Albums''; and it was given its current title of ''The Billboard 200'' on March 14, 1992.

===Catalog albums===
In 1960, ''Billboard'' began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These ''Essential Inventory'' charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory—Mono'' chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the ''Mono Action Chart'', and stereo albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory—Stereo'' chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the ''Stereo Action Chart''.

In January 1961, the ''Action Charts'' became ''Action Albums—Monophonic'' (24 positions), and ''Action Albums—Stereophonic'' (15 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, then were moved to an ''Essential Inventory'' list of approximately 200 titles, with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated ''Top LPs'' chart debuted in 1963.

In 1982, ''Billboard'' began publishing a ''Midline Albums'' chart (alternatively titled ''Midline LPs'') which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a bi-weekly (and later tri-weekly) basis.

On May 25, 1991, ''Billboard'' premiered the ''[[Top Pop Catalog Albums]]'' chart. The criteria for this chart were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mitchell |last=Peters |title=New Chart Parameters for Billboard, Nielsen SoundScan |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003694233 |work=Billboard |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 8, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930165102/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003694233 |archivedate=September 30, 2008 }}</ref> An album needed not have charted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at all to qualify for catalog status.

Starting with the issue dated December 5, 2009, however, the catalog limitations which removed albums over 18 months old, that have dropped below position 100 and have no currently-running single, from the ''Billboard'' 200 was lifted, turning the chart into an all-inclusive list of the 200 highest-selling albums in the country (essentially changing ''[[Top Comprehensive Albums]]'' into the ''Billboard'' 200). A new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the ''Billboard'' 200 (dubbed ''[[Top Current Albums]]'') was also introduced in the same issue.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary |last=Trust |title=Billboard 200 Undergoes Makeover |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266686/billboard-200-undergoes-makeover |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703041316/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266686/billboard-200-undergoes-makeover |archivedate=July 3, 2014 }}</ref>

===Holiday albums===
''Billboard'' has adjusted its policies for [[Christmas music|Christmas]]<ref name="Xmas">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047872/billboard-holiday-albums-chart-goes-live-early |title=Billboard Holiday Albums Chart Goes Live Early |work=Billboard |date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |last=Taylor |first=Chuck |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330044538/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047872/billboard-holiday-albums-chart-goes-live-early |archivedate=March 30, 2013 }}</ref> and holiday<ref name="Xmas" /> albums several times. The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a ''Christmas Albums'' list was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the ''Top LPs'' chart. In 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.

In 1983, the ''Christmas Albums'' chart was resurrected, but a title's appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the ''Top Pop Albums'' chart. In 1994 the chart was retitled ''Top Holiday Albums''. As of 2009 the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the ''Top Holiday Albums'' list and the ''Billboard'' 200.

===Nielsen SoundScan===
Since May 25, 1991, the ''Billboard'' 200's positions have been derived from [[Nielsen SoundScan]] sales data, {{As of|2008|lc=on}} contributed by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than [[record labels]], it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] when [[Gold album|Gold, Platinum and Diamond album]] awards are announced (RIAA awards reflect wholesale ''shipments'', not retail ''sales'').

===Incorporation of streaming data and track sales===
{{see also|album-equivalent unit}}
Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, ''Billboard'' updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a "pure sales-based ranking" to one measuring "multi-metric consumption".<ref name="2014change"/> With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Beats Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Under the new methodology, ten track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' will continue to publish a pure [[album sales]] chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on SoundScan's sales data.<ref name="2014change"/>

Beginning on January 18, 2020, ''Billboard'' will incorporate video and audio data from YouTube, along with visual plays from streaming services like [[Apple Music]], Spotify, [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], and [[Vevo]], into the ''Billboard'' 200. The change will also impact ''Billboard''{{'s}} genre-specific album charts.<ref name="Billboard 200 to Include Official V"/>

==Year-end charts==
''Billboard''{{'s}} "chart year" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album's performance on the ''Billboard'' 200 (for example, an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200, two points for a week spent at position 199... up to 200 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an album's year-end total.

After ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.

==All-Time ''Billboard'' 200 achievements (1963–2015)==
In 2015, ''Billboard'' magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing albums on the chart over the 52 years, along with the best-performing artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760797/adele-the-beatles-billboard-200-albums-artists-all-time |title=Greatest Billboard 200 Albums & Artists of All Time: Adele's '21' & The Beatles Are Tops |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009210944/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760797/adele-the-beatles-billboard-200-albums-artists-all-time |archivedate=October 9, 2016 }}</ref> Shown below are the top 10 albums and top 10 artists over the 52-year period of the ''Billboard'' 200, through October 2015.
