'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|,_|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}}) is [[Earth]]'s largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. It shares the continental [[landmass]] of [[Eurasia]] with the continent of [[Europe]] and the continental landmass of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. Asia covers an area of {{convert|44,579,000|km2|sqmi}}, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the [[human population]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The World at Six Billion |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |publisher=UN Population Division |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042434/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220025/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf Table 2]</ref> was the site of many of the [[first civilization]]s. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people ({{as of|2019|06|lc=yes}}) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationof.net/asia/|title=Population of Asia. 2019 demographics: density, ratios, growth rate, clock, rate of men to women.|website=www.populationof.net|accessdate=2 June 2019}}</ref>

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]], and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and [[cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East–West]] cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from Africa; and to the east of the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, separating it from Europe.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."</ref>

The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]].{{fact|date=June 2020}} Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni river) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] of Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.<ref>''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38.

The major geographical theorist of the empire was a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}</ref> The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.<ref name="NatGeo"/>

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The [[Maluku Islands]] in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with [[New Guinea]], to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."<ref name="Myth">{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}</ref>

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—[[Afro-Eurasia]] (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Ptolemy's Asia]]
The idea of a place called "Asia" was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]],<ref name="reid">[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).</ref> though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name. The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, "Asia". Whether "Asia" in other languages comes from Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Asia – Origin and meaning of Asia by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525113914/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> This [[metonymy|metonymical]] change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as [[Scandinavia]] (from [[Scania]]).

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet ''lawiaiai'', "captives", associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, ''aswiai'', identifies "women of Asia".<ref>{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.</ref> Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, ''Milatiai'', appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.<ref>{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}</ref> The name is also in the singular, ''Aswia'', which refers both to the name of a country and to a female from there. There is a masculine form, {{transl|grc|italic=yes|aswios}}. This ''Aswia'' appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia". This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".<ref>Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.</ref> The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word {{transl|akk|(w)aṣû(m)}}, which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning 'east'. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian {{transl|akk|erēbu(m)}} 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').<ref name="reid"/> The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.<ref name="reid"/> Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.<ref name="reid"/> [[Kazuo Ogura]] and [[Tenshin Okakura]] are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.<ref name="reid"/>

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]]
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey). There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |title=Ἀσία |author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |author3=Henry Stuart Jones |author4=Roderick McKenzie |encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon |year=2007 |location=Medford |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |orig-year=1940 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042823/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |archive-date=27 April 2011}}</ref>

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail.

Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].<ref>Book IV, Article 45.</ref> In [[Greek mythology]], "Asia" (''Ἀσία'') or "Asie" (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a "[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |title=Asie |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters |publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art |date=2000–2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604045105/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |archive-date=4 June 2010}}</ref>

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology". For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping".<ref>''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.</ref> Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:<ref>''Theogony'', Line 364ff.</ref>

{{quote|For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.}}

The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning "Asian");<ref>Μ95, Π717.</ref> and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as {{lang|grc|ασιος}}.<ref>Β461.</ref> According to many Muslims, the term came from [[Ancient Egypt]]'s Queen [[Asiya]], the adoptive mother of [[Moses]].<ref name="[[Sahih Al-Bukhari]]">Muhmmad al-Bukhari.

[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The [[Mongol Empire]] at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later [[Timurid Empire]].]]
The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]]'s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during [[Early Muslim conquests|its conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.<ref>Ping-ti Ho. "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.</ref>

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |title=History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605000815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |archive-date=5 June 2012}}</ref>

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=Sailendra Nath |title=An Advanced History of Modern India |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&pg=PA1941-IA82 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011162115/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&pg=PA1941-IA82&lpg=PA1941-IA82 |archive-date=11 October 2017 |isbn=978-0-230-32885-3 |year=2010 }}</ref> The [[Empire of Japan]] controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands until the end of [[World War II]].

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Asia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2006 |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141016/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |archive-date=18 November 2008}}</ref> It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) are [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]] lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European nation]], both [[Russian culture|culturally]] and politically.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Main regions===
There are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency [[UNSD]]. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49 Standard)|publisher=UN Statistica Division|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/}}&#32;"Geographic Regions" anklicken Zitat: "The assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the United Nations."</ref>

* [[South Asia]] ([[Indian subcontinent]])
* [[East Asia]] ([[Far East]])
* [[Southeast Asia]] ([[East Indies]] and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]])

===Climate change===
A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, Pakistan and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].<ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173957/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf |date=26 February 2014 }}, [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013</ref>

East Asia had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.<ref name="UNDP">{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=22 December 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161015/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |archive-date=21 November 2010}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

===Religions===
{{See also|Eastern philosophy|Religion in Asia|List of Asian mythologies}}
Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding [[irreligion]]), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] for example, as presented to Jews in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the narrative of [[Noah]]—and later to Christians in the [[Old Testament]], and to [[Islam|Muslims]] in the [[Quran]]—is earliest found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the [[Enûma Eliš]] and ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] similarly tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] also tells of a [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

{{as of|2012}}, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

The [[polymath]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], a [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] poet, dramatist, and writer from [[Santiniketan]], now in [[West Bengal]], India, became in 1913 the first Asian [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]].

Some may consider the American writer, [[Pearl S. Buck]], an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931) and ''[[The Mother (1934 novel)|The Mother]]'' (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents of their time in China, ''[[The Exile (1936 book)|The Exile]]'' and ''[[Fighting Angel]]'', all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.

Also, [[Mother Teresa]] of India and [[Shirin Ebadi]] of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize.

Chinese dissident [[Liu Xiaobo]] was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" on 8 October 2010. He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, [[Kailash Satyarthi]] from India and [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education".
