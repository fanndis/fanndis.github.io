Located in south-central Kansas on the [[Arkansas River]],<ref name="GNIS"/> Wichita began as a trading post on the [[Chisholm Trail]] in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from [[Texas]] to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown".<ref name="wichita_magic_city">Miner, Prof. Craig (Wichita State Univ.

In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including [[Beechcraft]], [[Cessna]], and [[Stearman Aircraft]]. The city became an aircraft production hub known as "The Air Capital of the World."<ref name="wbj_2013_back_to_beechcraft">McCoy, Daniel (interview with Beechcraft CEO Bill Boisture), "[http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/print-edition/2013/02/22/back-to-beechcraft.html?page=all Back to Beechcraft]," ''Wichita Business Journal'', February 22, 2013</ref> [[Textron Aviation]], [[Learjet]], [[Airbus]], and [[Spirit AeroSystems]] continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American [[aircraft industry]]. Wichita is also home to [[McConnell Air Force Base]],<ref name="harris_air_capital_story" /><ref name="ks_av_cent_longstory" /> and [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport]], the largest airport in Kansas.

As an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, shopping centers, and entertainment venues, most notably [[Intrust Bank Arena]] and [[Century II Convention Hall|Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center]]. The city's [[Old Cowtown Museum]] maintains historical artifacts and exhibits the city's early history. [[Wichita State University]] is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.

Claimed first by [[Kingdom of France|France]] as part of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] and later acquired by the United States with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, it became part of [[Kansas Territory]] in 1854 and then the state of [[Kansas]] in 1861.<ref>{{cite web | title = Louisiana Purchase | work = Kansapedia | publisher = [[Kansas Historical Society]] | url = http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/louisiana-purchase/17876 | access-date = 2015-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Kansas Territory | work = Kansapedia | publisher = [[Kansas Historical Society]] | url = http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-territory/14701 | access-date = March 21, 2015}}</ref>

Rapid immigration resulted in a [[Speculation|speculative]] land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city. Fairmount College, which eventually grew into [[Wichita State University]], opened in 1886; Garfield University, which eventually became [[Friends University]], opened in 1887.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Wichita State University | publisher = [[Wichita State University]] | url = http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&p=/wsu_history_long/ | access-date = 2015-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = History | publisher = [[Friends University]] | url = http://www.friends.edu/history | access-date = 2015-03-26}}</ref> By 1890, Wichita had become the third-largest city in the state after [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] and [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] with a population of nearly 24,000.<ref name=Decennial>{{cite web | title = Census of Population and Housing | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]] | url = https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html | access-date = 2015-03-26}}</ref> After the boom, however, the city entered an economic recession, and many of the original settlers went bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview | work = Delano Neighborhood Plan | publisher = City of Wichita, Kansas | url = http://www.wichita.gov/Government/Departments/Planning/NR/Pages/Delano.aspx | access-date = 2015-03-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130806044846/http://www.wichita.gov/Government/Departments/Planning/NR/Pages/Delano.aspx | archive-date = August 6, 2013 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1914 and 1915, deposits of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] were discovered in nearby [[Butler County, Kansas|Butler County]].

The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent [[Aerospace manufacturer|airplane manufacturing]] industry. In 1917, [[Clyde Cessna]] built his [[Cessna Comet]] in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited [[Chicago]] aircraft builder [[Emil Matthew Laird|Emil "Matty" Laird]] to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the [[Swallow Airplane Company]]. Two early Swallow employees, [[Lloyd Stearman]] and [[Walter Beech]], went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, [[Stearman Aircraft]] in 1926 and [[Beechcraft]] in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started [[Cessna|his own company]] in Wichita in 1927.<ref name=Harris>{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Richard | title = The Air Capital Story: Early General Aviation & Its Manufacturers | publisher = In Flight USA | url = http://harris1.net/hold/av/avhist/wichita/aircap_x.htm | date = 2002}}</ref> The city became such a center of the industry that the [[Aerospace Industries Association|Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce]] dubbed it the "Air Capital of the World" in 1929.<ref>{{cite book | title = Aeronautical Yearbook, 1929 | publisher = Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Harrow | first = Christopher | title = How is Wichita, Kansas the "Air Capital of the World"? | publisher = International Aviation HQ | url = https://internationalaviationhq.com/2020/02/29/air-capital-of-the-world | date = February 29, 2020}}</ref>

The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the [[Little Arkansas River]], which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies [[Chisholm Creek]], which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks as well as, further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the [[Walnut River (Kansas)|Walnut River]], flows south through the far eastern part of the city.<ref name=CityMap>{{cite web | title = City of Wichita | publisher = [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] | date = June 2010 | url = http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/city-pdf/wichita.pdf | access-date = 2011-01-01}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
{{main|Neighborhoods of Wichita, Kansas}}
[[File:Wichita pan 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Downtown Wichita & Century II Convention Center along the [[Arkansas River]]]]
Wichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The [[Downtown Wichita|downtown area]] is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as Century II, the Garvey Center, and the [[Epic Center]]. [http://www.oldtownwichita.com/ Old Town] is also part of downtown; this 50-acre area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.

Two notable residential areas of Wichita are [[Riverside, Wichita, Kansas|Riverside]] and [[College Hill, Wichita, Kansas|College Hill]]. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} Riverside Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wichitagov.org/CityOffices/Park/Parks.htm|title=Wichita Nightlife and Food - WichitaGov|first=AitThemes.com|last=http://www.ait-themes.com|website=www.wichitagov.org}}</ref> upscale College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University.

Four other historic neighborhoods—developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near [[Boeing]], [[Cessna Aircraft|Cessna]] and [[Beech Aircraft|Beech]] aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary [[World War II]] housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st Century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.<ref name="miracle_city_by_julie_courtwright">Courtwright, Julie, Ph.D., ''[https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2000winter_courtwright.pdf Want to build a miracle city? : war housing in Wichita,"]'' winter 2000/2001, ''[[Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains]]'', State Library of Kansas catalog # SS 1.19:v.23 no.4, downloaded from [[Kansas Historical Society]], retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="hilltop_revitalization_may2000_wichita_gov">''[https://www.wichita.gov/Planning/NR%20Documents/Hilltop%20Neighborhood%20Plan.pdf A revitalization plan for the Hilltop Neighborhood: 60 years of community in southeast Wichita]'' May, 2000, City of Wichita, retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="community_health_spring2008_the_shocker">Geiszler-Jones, Amy, [http://wsu.wichita.edu/the-shocker/story.php?eid=1&id=228 "Community Health,"] ''The Shocker'', [[Wichita State University]], as posted at [[University of Kansas]] retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="google_extracts">[https%3A%2F%2Fdigital.lib.ku.edu%2Fislandora%2Fobject%2Fku-phog%253A63131%2Fdatastream%2FOCR%2Fdownload&usg=AOvVaw01MsIj-14nU5xoLoO7K4I9 OCR extracts from various publications,] Google, retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="planeview_tihen_notes_wichita_edu">Tihen, Edward, [http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/local_history/tihen/pdf/People&Places/Planeview.PDF "Plainview (sic), Planeview, Beechwood,"], in ''Tihen Notes,''  Special Collections, [[Wichita State University]], retrieved February 20, 2020</ref>

Wichita's principal [[Industrial sector|industrial]] sector is [[manufacturing]], which accounted for 21.6 percent of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/22/351204/hawker-beechcraft-secures-40-million-incentive-package-to-remain-in.html|access-date=2011-01-02|title=Hawker Beechcraft secures $40 million incentive package to remain in Wichita}}</ref>

[[Healthcare]] is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing approximately 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical care tower at [[Wesley Medical Center]].<ref name="wichitakansas.org"/> In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita.

Thanks to the early 20th-Century oil boom in neighboring [[Butler County, Kansas]], Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was [[Koch Industries]], today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former [[Derby Oil Company]], which was purchased by [[Coastal Corporation]] in 1988. Wichita is home to oil & natural gas organizations [https://kansasstrong.com Kansas Strong] and [https://www.kioga.org/ Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Association] (KIOGA)

Koch Industries and [[Cargill]], the two largest privately held companies in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/21/private-companies-10_rank.html|title=Forbes article|work=Forbes}}</ref> both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. [[Cargill Meat Solutions]] Div., at one time the nation's 3rd-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer [[Chance Morgan]], gourmet food retailer [[Dean & Deluca]], [[renewable energy]] company [[Alternative Energy Solutions]], and [[Coleman Company]], a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. [[Air Midwest]], the nation's first officially certificated "commuter" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's 8th largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.<ref>"[http://ows.doleta.gov/dmstree/uipl/uipl2k2/uipl_3002c2a3.html uipl_3002c2a3.html]."

As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was: 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).<ref name=Census2010/>

===Aircraft manufacturing===
[[File:Boeing Stearman N67193.jpg|thumb|right|Over 10,000 [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman (Boeing) Model 75]] trainer aircraft were built during the 1930s and 1940s]]
[[File:NASA-2000Starship.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beechcraft Starship]] were built from 1983 to 1995]]

From the early to late 20th century, [[aircraft]] pioneers such as [[Clyde Cessna]], [[Emil Matthew Laird|"Matty" Laird]], [[Lloyd Stearman]], [[Walter Beech]], [[Al Mooney]] and [[Bill Lear]] began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that would lead to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced. The aircraft corporations [[Swallow Airplane Company|E. M. Laird Aviation Company]] (the nation's first successful commercial airplane manufacturer), [[Travel Air]] (started by Beech, Stearman and Cessna), [[Stearman Aircraft|Stearman]], [[Cessna]], [[Beechcraft]] and [[Mooney Airplane Company|Mooney]] were all founded in Wichita between 1920 and early 1932.<ref name="wbj_2013_back_to_beechcraft" />  By 1931, [[Boeing]] (of [[Seattle]], Washington) had absorbed Stearman, creating "Boeing-Wichita", which would eventually grow to become Kansas' largest employer.<ref name="harris_air_capital_story">Harris, Richard, "[http://harris1.net/hold/av/avhist/wichita/aircap_x.htm  The Air Capital Story: Early General Aviation & Its Manufacturers]", reprinted from ''In Flight USA'' magazine on author's own website, 2002/2003</ref><ref name="the_wichita_four">Bissionette, Bruce, ''The Wichita 4: Cessna, Moellendick, Beech & Stearman'' (from interviews with Matty Laird, Lloyd Stearman, Olive Ann Beech, Dwayne Wallace, Rawdon, Burnham, and other principals), Aviation Heritage Books, Destin, FL, 1999.</ref>

Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita having merged into [[Textron Aviation]] in 2014, along with [[Learjet]] and Boeing's chief subassembly supplier, [[Spirit AeroSystems]]. [[Airbus]] maintains a workforce in Wichita, and [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well dozens of suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.<ref name="harris_air_capital_story" /><ref name="ks_av_cent_longstory" /><ref name="borne_south_wind" /><ref name="ks_sampler_air_capital" />

In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after effects of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] to depress the [[aviation]] sub-sector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest [[aircraft]] manufacturers, [[Boeing|Boeing Co.]], Cessna Aircraft Co., [[Learjet|Bombardier Learjet Inc.]], [[Hawker Beechcraft]] and [[Raytheon|Raytheon Aircraft Co.]]—to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users.<ref name="wichitakansas.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.wichitakansas.org/ |title=Wichita Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Wichitakansas.org |access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref> In 2007, Wichita built 977 aircraft, ranging from single-engine [[light aircraft]] to the world's fastest civilian jet; one-fifth of the civilian aircraft produced in United States that year, plus numerous small military aircraft.<ref name="ks_av_cent_longstory">Harris, Richard, (Chairman, Kansas Aviation Centennial; Kansas Aviation History Speaker, Kansas Humanities Council; Amer.

===Flood control===
Wichita suffered severe floods of the Arkansas river in 1877, 1904, 1916, 1923, 1944, 1951 and 1955. In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tanner|first1=Beccy|title=Ad Astra: Idea for Big Ditch grew after Wichita had sustained series of major floods|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/article1120671.html|website=kansas.com|publisher=The Wichita Eagle|access-date=March 24, 2015|date=August 11, 2013}}</ref>
As a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the [[Wichita-Valley Center Floodway]] (locally known as the "Big Ditch") was conceived. The project was completed in 1958. The Big Ditch diverts part of the Arkansas River's flow around west-central Wichita, running roughly parallel to the [[Interstate 235 (Kansas)|Interstate 235]] bypass.<ref name=CityMap/><ref>{{cite web | title = Storm Water Management | publisher = City of Wichita | url = http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/PublicWorks/StormWater/ | access-date = 2011-01-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219020914/http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/PublicWorks/StormWater/ | archive-date = February 19, 2011 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of [[Interstate 135]], running south through the central part of the city.

Flooding that year kept the Big Ditch full for more than a month and caused $6 million of damage to the flood control infrastructure.
