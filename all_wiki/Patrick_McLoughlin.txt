==Early life and career==
McLoughlin was born in [[Stafford]] on 30 November 1957, the son and grandson of [[coal mining|coal miners]]. He was educated at the [[Bernard Griffin|Cardinal Griffin]] Roman Catholic School in [[Cannock]], Staffordshire, and Staffordshire College of Agriculture at [[Rodbaston College]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Catherine|title=Journey from miner to major ministerial role|work=Express & Star|issue=41,641|date=6 September 2012|page=5|issn=0959-8588}}</ref> From 1974, he worked for five years as a farm worker and, after 1979, worked underground at the Littleton Colliery in Cannock. He was a member of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]],<ref name="LES_4Sep2012">{{cite news |title=Airport expansion 'back on table' as McLoughlin takes over Greening as Transport Secretary |first=Joe |last=Murphy |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/airport-expansion-back-on-table-as-mcloughlin-takes-over-greening-as-transport-secretary-8104352.html |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]]|location=London |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> and became an industrial representative for the [[National Coal Board]]'s Western Area Marketing Department.

As with the majority of the Staffordshire miners, McLoughlin did not observe the NUM's [[1984 miners' strike|strike in 1984–85]] and later came to national attention when he stood up at the 1984 Conservative Party Conference to announce that he was a working miner.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19871846 |title=Tory conference: Cash announced for regional road plans |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref> He moved from underground belt attendant to Area Marketing representative in September 1985, five months after the end of the strike.

McLoughlin was elected as a councillor on the [[Cannock Chase District Council]], serving for seven years from 1980, and was a councillor on [[Staffordshire County Council]] from 1981 to 1987.<ref name="LES_4Sep2012"/> In 1982, McLoughlin served as the Chairman of the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|National Young Conservatives]].

McLoughlin unsuccessfully contested [[Wolverhampton South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Wolverhampton South East]] at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], losing to the sitting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Robert Edwards (politician)|Robert Edwards]] by 5,000 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge83/i22.htm |title=UK General Election results 1983; Wokingham – York |work=Richard Kimber's political science resources |accessdate=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216160129/http://politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge83/i22.htm |archive-date=16 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==
[[Matthew Parris]], then Conservative MP for [[West Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]], had resigned from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to pursue a media career and McLoughlin was chosen to contest the [[1986 West Derbyshire by-election|1986 by-election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?296987-1/qa-matthew-parris |title=Matthew Parris|date=12 December 2010 |work=[[Q&A (U.S. talk show)|Q&A]] |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=Parliament_biography>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/patrick-mcloughlin/25481 |title=Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin; biography |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=4 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909094320/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/patrick-mcloughlin/25481 |archivedate=9 September 2012  }}</ref> He held the seat, albeit very narrowly, with a 100 majority.

In Parliament, McLoughlin served as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]], initially to [[Angela Rumbold]] ([[Minister of State]] at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]] (1987–88) and then to [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] (1988–89). McLoughlin was made a [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] by Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1989, and served in the [[Department for Transport]] until 1992, when he was moved by Prime Minister [[John Major]] to serve in the same position at the [[Secretary of State for Employment|Department of Employment]]. A year later, McLoughlin was moved to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].

He joined the government as [[Whips' Office|Assistant Whip]] in 1995, becoming a Lord Commissioner in 1996. After the Conservative Party's defeat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he remained in the whips' office in opposition, becoming the Deputy Chief Whip in 1998. He was then promoted to Chief Whip by [[David Cameron]] in 2005. McLoughlin has also served on many select committees. As Opposition Chief Whip, he was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in June 2005.

Following [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary changes]], the West Derbyshire constituency was abolished at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], and McLoughlin was elected to the successor seat of [[Derbyshire Dales (UK Parliament constituency)|Derbyshire Dales]], achieving exactly the same number of votes. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] appointed McLoughlin as the government's Chief Whip and [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury]] in the Conservative-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[coalition government]]. During his tenure as Chief Whip, he was reprimanded by the Speaker [[John Bercow]] for inappropriate behaviour within the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11937671 |work=BBC News| title=Speaker John Bercow reprimands Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin | date=7 December 2010|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>

===Transport Secretary===
In a government [[reshuffle]] in September 2012, McLoughlin was appointed [[Secretary of State for Transport]]. Soon after his appointment he had to cancel the award of the [[InterCity West Coast]] franchise due to major technical flaws in the bidding process.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Coast Main Line: scrapped bid reveals chaos at the heart of government|first=Alistair |last=Osborne |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9591525/West-Coast-Main-Line-scrapped-bid-reveals-chaos-at-the-heart-of-government.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=6 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>

As Transport Secretary, McLoughlin oversaw large-scale government investment in rail in the wake of [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|increasing passenger numbers in the years following rail privatisation]]. From 2014 to 2019, £38&nbsp;billion of improvement works are planned, including [[Crossrail]], the [[Thameslink Programme]], [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line|electrification of the Great Western Main Line]] and the [[Northern Powerhouse]] scheme to boost transport links in the North of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plans-for-38-billion-investment-in-railways-unveiled |title=Plans for £38&nbsp;billion investment in railways unveiled|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, construction began on [[HS2]], a high-speed link between major cities that will "triple the long-distance capacity to the North of England" as well as freeing up the West Coast Main Line for freight and commuter trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2015/11/05/hs2-the-story-so-far/ |title=HS2 – The story so far |date= 5 November 2015}}</ref> In 2015, McLoughlin said "So the argument has been won. HS2 will be built, the full ‘Y’ network, from London to Birmingham and Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. HS2 will change the transport architecture of the north. But it will also change the economic architecture."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transport-secretary-confirms-government-is-forging-ahead-on-high-speed-rail-and-a-northern-powerhouse |title=Transport Secretary confirms government is forging ahead on high-speed rail and a Northern Powerhouse – News stories |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>

In November 2013, he made a speech praising the [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail]], saying that "Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance. Since 1993, passenger journeys have doubled in the UK to a level not seen since the 1920s. On a network roughly the same size as 15 years ago, today our railway is running 4,000 more services a day. And rail freight has grown by 60%. Revenue is up more than £3&nbsp;billion since privatisation, almost all of it due to higher passenger numbers rather than fare rises. Safety levels are at an all time high. Punctuality is at near record levels. And passenger satisfaction is up by 10% over the past decade."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/rail-growth-through-competition-the-success-of-the-uk-model |title=Rail growth through competition: the success of the UK model|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref> However, a number of academics and journalists disputed this and subsequently argued that the evidence suggested the privatisation had largely failed, creating new inefficiencies, failing to create genuine competition and seeing steep rises in costs to passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url= |title=An illusion of success: The consequences of British rail privatisation|website=Accounting Forum}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/rail-privatisation-train-operators-profit|title=Rail privatisation: legalised larceny|website=The Guardian|date=4 November 2013|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>

In December 2015, he announced the winners of the [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] and [[TransPennine Express]] franchises which include new trains, services and free wifi, saying "Arriva Rail North and First TransPennine Express went far beyond our requirements with exciting, ambitious plans that will make a real difference to customers, and – coupled with our commitment to push ahead with electrifying the vital TransPennine route – will help the region realise its full economic potential, ensuring it has a modern 21st century transport system."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/massive-boost-to-rail-services-brings-northern-powerhouse-to-life |title=Massive boost to rail services brings Northern Powerhouse to life|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>

McLoughlin's efforts to meet and pacify Cumbrian residents of [[Pooley Bridge]] and [[Soulsby]] following the [[2015–16 Great Britain and Ireland floods#Storm Desmond (5 December)|2015 floods]] were ridiculed in ''[[The Independent]]'' when the ministerial party arrived on the wrong side of the collapsed bridge. The paper compared the event to a scene from the BBC comedy ''[[The Thick of It]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-ministers-meet-flooded-locals-20-minutes-late-and-on-the-wrong-side-of-a-collapsed-bridge-a6795301.html|title=Government ministers meet flooded locals 20 minutes late and on the wrong side of a collapsed bridge|first=John |last=Hall|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>

McLoughlin oversaw the beginning of the £15&nbsp;billion road upgrade package to improve routes and add lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/biggest-upgrade-to-roads-in-a-generation |title=Biggest upgrade to roads in a generation|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>

After the resignation of David Cameron as Prime Minister following the UK's [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|vote to leave the European Union]] on 23 June 2016, McLoughlin was made Conservative Party chairman by new Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] on 14 July 2016. He was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[2016 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours]], by his colleague in the Conservative Party, for political and public service.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=61678 |date=16 August 2016 |page=RH2 |supp=y}}</ref>

=== Chairman of the Conservative Party ===
In a 24 July 2016 interview on the ''[[Andrew Marr Show]]'', Patrick McLoughlin said "[[Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty will be triggered]] before the next general election. It's very clear that Brexit means Brexit. Brexit means that we're coming out of the European Union. We want to see our own borders under our own control."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-article-50-general-election-eu-referendum-leave-tory-chairman-patrick-mcloughlin-a7153141.html|first=Peter |last=Yeung|title=Brexit: Article 50 will be triggered before next general election, Tory chairman says|date=24 July 2016|accessdate=25 July 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

McLoughlin stepped down as [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] on 8 January 2018, saying that he had had "a very good run" and was replaced by [[Brandon Lewis]]. He also resigned as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with [[David Lidington]] being his successor. Prior to his resignation, McLoughlin had come under increasing pressure to resign from colleagues in the Conservative Party over the disappointing performance of the party in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] and various issues with the most recent party conference.<ref>{{cite news|title='Somebody has to take responsibility': Tories call for party chairman to quit after Theresa May speech shambles|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tories-call-for-party-chairman-to-quit-after-mays-speech-shambles-a3651276.html|work= London Evening Standard|accessdate=24 August 2018|date=5 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tories turn on party chairman Patrick McLoughlin over election losses|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/87553/tories-turn-party-chairman-patrick|work=Politics Home|accessdate=24 August 2018|date=15 July 2017}}</ref>
