'''Streaming media''' is [[multimedia]] that is constantly received by and presented to an [[End-user (computer science)|end-user]] while being delivered by a provider. The verb ''to stream'' refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner.{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} Streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to [[telecommunications network]]s, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television, streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, [[Videotape|video cassettes]], audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.

[[Live streaming]] is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as [[live television]] broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a [[content delivery network]] to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.

Streaming is an alternative to file [[downloading]], a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their [[media player (software)|media player]] to start playing [[digital video]] or [[digital audio]] content before the entire file has been transmitted. The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live [[closed captioning]], [[ticker tape]], and [[real-time text]], which are all considered "streaming text". 

[[Elevator music]] was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media; nowadays [[Internet television]] is a common form of streamed media. Some popular streaming services include [[Netflix]], [[Disney+]], [[Hulu]], [[Prime Video]], the [[video sharing website]] YouTube, and other sites which stream films and television shows; [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]], which stream music; and the [[video game live streaming]] site [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of online video}}

In the early 1920s, [[George O. Squier]] was granted patents for a system for the transmission and distribution of signals over electrical lines,<ref>{{cite patent | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=5pV5AAAAEBAJ&dq=1641608| title = Electrical signaling |country=US |number=1,641,608}}</ref> which was the technical basis for what later became ''[[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]'', a technology streaming continuous music to commercial customers without the use of radio. 

Attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of computing in the mid-20th&nbsp;century. However, little progress was made for several decades, primarily due to the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, consumer-grade personal computers became powerful enough to display various media. The primary technical issues related to streaming were having enough [[CPU]] and [[bus (computing)|bus]] [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to support the required data rates, achieving [[real-time computing]] performance required to prevent [[buffer underrun]] and enable smooth streaming of the content. However, computer networks were still limited in the mid-1990s, and audio and video media were usually delivered over non-streaming channels, such as playback from a local [[hard disk drive]] or [[CD-ROM]]s on the end user's computer.

In 1990 the first commercial [[Ethernet switch]] was introduced by [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]], which enabled the more powerful computer networks that led to the first streaming video solutions used by schools and corporations.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->

=== Multimedia compression  ===
{{See|Data compression}}
{{See also|Video coding format}}

Practical streaming media was only made possible with advances in [[data compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media. Raw [[digital audio]] encoded with [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) requires a bandwidth of 1.4{{nbsp}}[[Mbit/s]] for uncompressed [[CD audio]], while raw [[digital video]] requires a bandwidth of 168{{nbsp}}Mbit/s for [[SD video]] and over 1000{{nbsp}}Mbit/s for [[FHD]] video.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jack |title=Scalable Continuous Media Streaming Systems: Architecture, Design, Analysis and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780470857649 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fuvu52cyNEC&pg=PA25}}</ref>

The most important compression technique that enabled practical streaming media is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT),<ref name="Zhu">{{cite book |last1=Ce |first1=Zhu |title=Streaming Media Architectures, Techniques, and Applications: Recent Advances: Recent Advances |date=2010 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=9781616928339 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb4dWYVJ_8AC&pg=PA26}}</ref> a form of [[lossy compression]] first proposed in 1972 by [[N.

=== Late 1990s to early 2000s ===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, users had increased access to computer networks, especially the Internet. During the early 2000s, users had access to increased network [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], especially in the "[[last mile]]". 
These technological improvements facilitated the streaming of audio and video content to computer users in their homes and workplaces. There was also an increasing use of standard protocols and formats, such as [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]], [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[HyperText Markup Language|HTML]] as the Internet became increasingly commercialized, which led to an infusion of investment into the sector.

The band [[Severe Tire Damage (band)|Severe Tire Damage]] was the first group to perform live on the Internet. On June&nbsp;24, 1993, the band was playing a gig at [[PARC (company)|Xerox&nbsp;PARC]] while elsewhere in the building, scientists were discussing new technology (the [[Mbone]]) for broadcasting on the Internet using [[multicasting]]. As proof of PARC's technology, the band's performance was broadcast and could be seen live in Australia and elsewhere. In a March 2017 interview, band member Russ Haines stated that the band had used approximately "half of the total bandwidth of the internet" to stream the performance, which was a 152-by-76 pixel video, updated eight to twelve times per second, with audio quality that was "at best, a bad telephone connection".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRa2pE5-Ny0 "History of the Internet Pt. 1 – The First Live Stream"].

=== Etymology ===
The term "streaming" was first used for [[tape drive]]s manufactured by [[Data Electronics Inc.]] that were meant to slowly ramp up and run for the entire track; slower ramp times lowered drive costs. "Streaming" was applied in the early 1990s as a better description for [[video on demand]] and later live video on IP networks. It was first done by [[Starlight Networks]] for video streaming and [[Real Networks]] for audio streaming. Such video had previously been referred to by the misnomer "store and forward video."<ref>{{cite book| chapter = On buffer requirements for store-and-forward video on demand service circuits | publisher = [[IEEE]]| doi = 10.1109/GLOCOM.1991.188525 | title = IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM '91: Countdown to the New Millennium.

=== Business developments ===
The first commercial streaming product appeared in late 1992 and was named StarWorks.<ref name="StarWorks">{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/CMPCON.1993.289623|chapter = Star ''Works''-a video applications server|title = Digest of Papers.

Starworks was from [[Starlight Networks]], who also pioneered live video streaming on Ethernet and via [[Internet Protocol]] over satellites with [[Hughes Network Systems]].<ref name="Starlight Networks and Hughes Network Systems">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Starlight+Networks+and+Hughes+Network+Systems+Plan+Corporate...-a017588314 |title=Starlight Networks and Hughes Network Systems}}</ref> Other early companies who created streaming media technology include [[RealNetworks]] (then known as Progressive Networks) and Protocomm both prior to wide spread World Wide Web usage and once the web became popular in the late 90s, streaming video on the internet blossomed from startups such as VDOnet, acquired by [[RealNetworks]], and Precept, acquired by [[Cisco]].

[[Microsoft]] developed a media player known as [[ActiveMovie]] in 1995 that allowed streaming media and included a proprietary streaming format, which was the precursor to the streaming feature later in [[Windows Media Player]]&nbsp;6.4 in 1999. In June&nbsp;1999 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] also introduced a streaming media format in its [[QuickTime]]&nbsp;4 application. It was later also widely adopted on websites along with RealPlayer and Windows Media streaming formats. The competing formats on websites required each user to download the respective applications for streaming and resulted in many users having to have all three applications on their computer for general compatibility.

In 2000 Industryview.com launched its "world's largest streaming video archive" website to help businesses promote themselves.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hebert |first=Steve |date=November 2000 |title=Streaming Video Opens New Doors |magazine=Videography|page=164}}</ref> Webcasting became an emerging tool for business marketing and advertising that combined the immersive nature of television with the interactivity of the Web.

Around 2002, the interest in a single, unified, streaming format and the widespread adoption of [[Adobe Flash]] prompted the development of a video streaming format through Flash, which was the format used in Flash-based players on video hosting sites. The first popular video streaming site, YouTube, was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]] and [[Jawed Karim]] in 2005. It initially used a Flash-based player, which played [[MPEG-4 AVC]] video and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio, but now defaults to [[HTML5 video]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 <nowiki><video></nowiki>|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref> Increasing consumer demand for live streaming has prompted YouTube to implement a new live streaming service to users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9883062-2.html |author=Josh Lowensohn |year=2008 |title=YouTube to Offer Live Streaming This Year |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref> The company currently also offers a (secured) link returning the available connection speed of the user.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/my_speed# | title=YouTube Video Speed History |access-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426225550/http://www.youtube.com/my_speed |archive-date=26 April 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) revealed through its 2015 earnings report that streaming services were responsible for 34.3 percent of the year's total [[music industry]]'s revenue, growing 29 percent from the previous year and becoming the largest source of income, pulling in around $2.4&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=News and Notes on 2015 RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics|url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RIAA-2015-Year-End-shipments-memo.pdf|publisher=RIAA|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Streaming made more revenue for music industry in 2015 than digital downloads, physical sales|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/23/streaming-made-more-revenue-for-music-industry-in-/|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> US streaming revenue grew 57 percent to $1.6&nbsp;billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Lucas|title=The Music Industry Is Finally Making Money on Streaming|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/spotify-apple-drive-u-s-music-industry-s-8-first-half-growth|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=5 January 2017|date=20 September 2016}}</ref>

== Use of streaming media by the general public ==
[[File:羽村市動物公園 ニコ生 2017 (32782507624).jpg|thumb|Live streaming service at zoo by [[Niconico]]]]
These advances in computer networking, combined with powerful home computers and modern operating systems, made streaming media practical and affordable for ordinary citizens. Stand-alone [[Internet radio device]]s emerged to offer listeners a no-computer option for listening to audio streams. These audio streaming services have become increasingly popular over recent years, as streaming music hit a record of 118.1&nbsp;billion streams in 2013.<ref>"[https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sky-Is-Rising-2014.pdf The Sky is Rising]", Masnick, M., Ho, M., Hung, J., Beadon, L.. Retrieved 8 February 2015.</ref> In general, multimedia content has a large volume, so media storage and transmission costs are still significant. To offset this somewhat, media are generally [[data compression|compressed]] for both storage and streaming. Increasing consumer demand for streaming of [[High definition television|high definition]] (HD) content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies such as [[WirelessHD&nbsp;]] or [[ITU-T]]&nbsp;[[G.hn]], which are optimized for streaming HD content without forcing the user to install new [[networking cables]]. In 1996, digital pioneer [[Marc Scarpa]] produced the first large-scale, online, live broadcast in history, the [[Adam Yauch]]-led [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]], an event that would define the format of social change broadcasts. Scarpa continued to pioneer in the streaming media world with projects such as [[Woodstock '99]], Townhall with [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], and more recently Covered CA's campaign "Tell a Friend Get Covered" which was live streamed on YouTube.

A media stream can be streamed either "live" or "on demand". Live streams are generally provided by a means called "true streaming". True streaming sends the information straight to the computer or device without saving the file to a hard disk. On-demand streaming is provided by a means called ''progressive streaming'' or ''[[progressive download]]''. Progressive streaming saves the file to a hard disk and then is played from that location. On-demand streams are often saved to hard disks and servers for extended amounts of time; while the live streams are only available at one time only (e.g.,&nbsp;during the football game).<ref>Grant and Meadows. (2009). Communication Technology Update and Fundamentals 11th Edition. pp.114</ref> Streaming media is increasingly being coupled with use of social media. For example, sites such as YouTube encourage social interaction in webcasts through features such as [[live chat]], [[online survey]]s, user posting of comments online and more. Furthermore, streaming media is increasingly being used for [[social business]] and [[e-learning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/113793/The-Future-of-Webcasting|title=The Future of Webcasting|last=Kellner|first=Scott|date=28 February 2013|publisher=INXPO|access-date=15 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703142337/http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/113793/The-Future-of-Webcasting|archive-date=3 July 2013}}</ref> Due to the popularity of the streaming medias, many developers have introduced free HD movie streaming apps for the people who use smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones for everyday purposes.

The [[Horowitz Research]] State of Pay TV, OTT and SVOD 2017 report said that 70 percent of those viewing content did so through a streaming service, and that 40 percent of TV viewing was done this way, twice the number from five years earlier.

=== Transition from a DVD based to streaming based viewing culture ===
[[File:Sample Webcast Screenshot.png|thumb|A typical [[webcast]], streaming in an embedded media player]]
One of the movie streaming industry's largest impacts was on the DVD industry, which effectively met its demise with the mass popularization of online content. The rise of media streaming caused the downfall of many DVD rental companies such as [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]. In July 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article about [[Netflix]]'s DVD services. It stated that Netflix was continuing their DVD services with 5.3&nbsp;million subscribers, which was a significant drop from the previous year. On the other hand, their streaming services had 65&nbsp;million members.<ref>{{cite news|author=Steel, Emily|title=Netflix refines it's DVD business, even as streaming unit booms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/business/while-its-streaming-service-booms-netflix-streamlines-old-business.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621135707/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/business/while-its-streaming-service-booms-netflix-streamlines-old-business.html |archive-date=21 June 2017 |date= 26 July 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>

=== The roots of music streaming: Napster ===
[[Comparison of on-demand music streaming services|Music streaming]] is one of the most popular ways in which consumers interact with streaming media. In the age of digitization, the [[Private good|private consumption]] of music transformed into a [[Public good (economics)|public good]] largely due to one player in the market: Napster.

[[Napster]], a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file sharing network where users could upload and download [[MP3]] files freely, broke all music industry conventions when it launched in early 1999 out of Hull, Massachusetts. The platform was developed by Shawn and John Fanning as well as [[Sean Parker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/09/05/ashes-to-ashes-peer-to-peer-an-oral-history-of-napster/|title=Ashes to ashes, peer to peer: An oral history of Napster|website=Fortune|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> In an interview from 2009, Shawn Fanning explained that Napster "was something that came to me as a result of seeing a sort of an unmet need and the passion people had for being able to find all this music, particularly a lot of the obscure stuff which wouldn't be something you go to a record store and purchase, so it felt like a problem worth solving."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2009/05/31/an-interview-with-napsters-shawn-fanning/|title=An interview with Napster's Shawn Fanning|last1=31 May|first1=Benny Evangelista on|last2=PM|first2=2009 at 8:00|date=1 June 2009|website=The Technology Chronicles|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>

Not only did this development disrupt the music industry by making songs that previously required payment to acquire freely accessible to any Napster user, it demonstrated the power of P2P networks in turning any digital file into a public, shareable good. For the brief period of time that Napster existed, mp3 files fundamentally changed as a type of good. Songs were no longer financially excludable – barring access to a computer with internet access – and they were not rival, meaning if one person downloaded a song it did not diminish another user from doing the same. Napster, like most other providers of public goods, faced the problem of [[Free-rider problem|free riding]]. Every user benefits when an individual uploads an mp3 file, but there is no requirement or mechanism that forces all users to share their music. Thus, Napster users were incentivized to let others upload music without sharing any of their own files.

This structure revolutionized the consumer's perception of ownership over [[digital goods]] – it made music freely replicable. Napster quickly garnered millions of users, growing faster than any other business in history. At the peak of its existence, Napster boasted about 80&nbsp;million users globally. The site gained so much traffic that many college campuses had to block access to Napster because it created network congestion from so many students sharing music files.<ref name="expertise1">{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592|title=The History of Napster: Yes, It's Still Around|last1=expertise|first1=Mark Harris Brings music|last2=Producer|first2=Including a Background as a Music|website=Lifewire|access-date=11 March 2019|last3=composer|last4=Articles|first4=To Digital Music}}</ref>

The advent of Napster sparked the creation of numerous other P2P sites including [[LimeWire]] (2000), [[BitTorrent]] (2001), and the [[The Pirate Bay|Pirate Bay]] (2003). The reign of P2P networks was short lived. The first to fall was Napster in 2001. Numerous lawsuits were filed against Napster by various record labels, all of which were subsidiaries of [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music]] Entertainment, [[Warner Music Group]], or [[EMI]]. In addition to this, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) also filed a lawsuit against Napster on the grounds of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, which ultimately led Napster to shutting down in 2001.<ref name="expertise1"/> In an interview with Gary Stiffelman, who represents [[Eminem]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[TLC discography|TLC]], he explained why Napster was a problem for record labels: loss in revenue. In an interview with the ''New York Times'', Stiffelman said, "I’m not an opponent of artists’ music being included in these services, I'm just an opponent of their revenue not being shared."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/18/arts/record-labels-answer-to-napster-still-has-artists-feeling-bypassed.html|title=Record Labels' Answer to Napster Still Has Artists Feeling Bypassed|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=18 February 2002|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=11 March 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==== The fight for intellectual property rights: ''A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.'' ====
The lawsuit ''[[A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'' fundamentally changed the way consumers interact with music streaming. It was argued on 2 October 2000 and was decided on 12 February 2001. The [[Appellate court|Court of Appeals]] for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a P2P file sharing service could be held liable for contributory and vicarious infringement of copyright, serving as a landmark decision for Intellectual property law.<ref name="wustl1">{{cite web|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/case-study-am-records-inc-v-napster-inc/|title=Case Study: A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. – Blog {{!}} @WashULaw|date=1 August 2013|website=onlinelaw.wustl.edu|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>

The first issue that the Court addressed was "[[fair use]]," which says that otherwise infringing activities are permissible so long as it is for purposes "such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching [...] scholarship, or research."<ref name="cornell2001">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/239_F3d_1004.htm|title=A&M RECORDS, INC. v. NAPSTER, INC., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001)|website=law.cornell.edu|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> Judge Beezer, the Judge for this case, noted that Napster claimed that its services fit "three specific alleged fair uses: [[sampling (music)|sampling]], where users make temporary copies of a work before purchasing; space-shifting, where users access a sound recording through the Napster system that they already own in audio CD format; and permissive distribution of recordings by both new and established artists."<ref name="cornell2001"/> Judge Beezer found that Napster did not fit these criteria, instead enabling their users to repeatedly copy music, which would affect the market value of the copyrighted good.

The second claim by the plaintiffs was that Napster was actively contributing to [[copyright infringement]] since it had knowledge of widespread file sharing on their platform. Since Napster took no action to reduce infringement and financially benefited from repeated use, the Court ruled against the P2P site. The court found that "as much as eighty-seven percent of the files available on Napster may be copyrighted and more than seventy percent may be owned or administered by plaintiffs."<ref name="cornell2001"/>

The [[injunction]] ordered against Napster ended the brief period in which music streaming was a public good – non-rival and non-excludable in nature. Other P2P networks had some success at sharing MP3s, though they all met a similar fate in court. The ruling set the precedent that copyrighted digital content cannot be freely replicated and shared unless given consent by the owner, thereby strengthening the property rights of artists and record labels alike.<ref name="wustl1"/>
[[File:Music streaming platform use vs music piracy rates in U.S.png|thumb|As music streaming platforms have become more prevalent in the U.S., music piracy rates have fallen. Piracy rates are calculated as a function of U.S. total population. This data was sourced from the Digital Media Association's (DiMA) annual report from March 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dima.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DiMA-Streaming-Forward-Report.pdf|title=Digital Media Association Annual Report|date=March 2018}}</ref>]]

=== Music streaming platforms ===
Although music streaming is no longer a freely replicable public good, streaming platforms such as [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Apple Music]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[Amazon Music|Prime Music]] have shifted music streaming to a [[Club good|club-type good]]. While some platforms, most notably Spotify, give customers access to a [[freemium]] service that enables the use of limited features for exposure to advertisements, most companies operate under a premium subscription model.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle of the Streaming Services: Which Is the Best Premium Video Service? |url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/best-streaming-service-app-tv-movies-india-price-netflix-amazon-prime-disney-plus-hotstar-google-apple-2223556 |access-date=11 May 2020 |work=NDTV Gadgets 360 |language=en}}</ref> Under such circumstances, music streaming is financially excludable, requiring that customers pay a monthly fee for access to a music library, but non-rival, since one customer's use does not impair another's.

Music streaming platforms have grown rapidly in popularity in recent years. Spotify has over 207&nbsp;million users, as of 1 January 2019, in 78 different countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2018/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2018.pdf|title=Spotify 2018 Quarter 4 Letter to Shareholders|website=Spotify}}</ref> Apple Music has about 60&nbsp;million, and SoundCloud has 175&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/05/25/the-top-10-streaming-music-services-by-number-of-users/|title=The Top 10 Streaming Music Services By Number Of Users|last=McIntyre|first=Hugh|website=Forbes|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> All platforms provide varying degrees of accessibility. Apple Music and Prime Music only offer their services for paid subscribers, whereas Spotify and SoundCloud offer freemium and premium services. Napster, owned by Rhapsody since 2011, has resurfaced as a music streaming platform offering subscription based services to over 4.5&nbsp;million users as of January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/08/21/realnetworks-napster-profitable/|title=Napster Proves That Streaming Music Can Be Profitable|date=22 August 2018|website=Digital Music News|access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref> As music streaming providers have proliferated and competition has pushed the price of subscriptions down, music piracy rates have also fallen (see chart to the right).

The music industry's response to music streaming was initially negative. Along with music piracy, streaming services disrupted the market and contributed to the fall in revenue from $14.6&nbsp;billion in revenue in 1999 to $6.3&nbsp;billion in 2009 for the U.S. CD's and single-track downloads were not selling because content was freely available on the Internet. The result was that record labels invested more in artists that were "safe" – chart music became more appealing to producers than bands with unique sounds. In 2018, however, music streaming revenue exceeded that of traditional revenue streams (e.g. record sales, album sales, downloads).<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/GMR2018.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2018: Annual State of the Industry|year=2017|work=GMR}}</ref> 2017 alone saw a 41.1% increase in streaming revenue alone and an 8.1% increase in overall revenue.<ref name=":0" /> Streaming revenue is one of the largest driving forces behind the growth in the music industry. In an interview, Jonathan Dworkin, a senior vice president of strategy and business development at Universal, said that "we cannot be afraid of perpetual change, because that dynamism is driving growth."<ref name=":0" />

== Bandwidth and storage ==
[[File:Unicast streaming.svg|thumb|Unicast connections require multiple connections from the same streaming server even when it streams the same content.]]

A broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming [[standard definition]] video without experiencing buffering or skips, especially live video,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.broadbandchoices.co.uk/guides/internet/watching-tv-online | title=How to watch live TV online: The complete guide | work=broadbandchoices | date=20 May 2016 | access-date=1 October 2016 | author=Staples, Kim}}</ref> for example to a [[Roku]], [[Apple&nbsp;TV]], [[Google TV (smart TV platform)|Google&nbsp;TV]] or a Sony&nbsp;TV Blu-ray Disc Player. 5&nbsp;Mbit/s is recommended for High Definition content and 9&nbsp;Mbit/s for Ultra-High Definition content.<ref>Minimum requirements for Sony&nbsp;TV Blu-ray&nbsp;Disc Player, on advertisement attached to a NetFlix&nbsp;DVD{{Nonspecific|date=March 2011}}</ref> Streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula (for a single user and file): storage size in [[megabyte]]s is equal to length (in seconds) × [[bit rate]] (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024). For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 × 240 pixels window size) will be:
(3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8×1024×1024) requires around 128 [[Megabyte|MB]] of storage.

If the file is stored on a server for on-demand streaming and this stream is viewed by 1,000&nbsp;people at the same time using a [[Unicast]] protocol, the requirement is 300 kbit/s × 1,000 = 300,000 kbit/s = 300 Mbit/s of bandwidth. This is equivalent to around 135&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per hour. Using a [[multicast]] protocol the server sends out only a single stream that is common to all users. Therefore, such a stream would only use 300&nbsp;kbit/s of serving bandwidth. See below for more information on these protocols. The calculation for live streaming is similar. Assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbit/s and if the show lasts for 3 hours with 3,000 viewers, then the calculation is number of MBs transferred = encoder speed (in bit/s) × number of seconds × number of viewers / (8 × 1024 × 1024). The results of this calculation are as follows: number of MBs transferred = 500 x 1024 (bit/s) × 3 × 3,600 ( = 3 hours) × 3,000 (number of viewers) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) = 1,977,539 MB.{{dubious|date=December 2019}}

In 2018 video is more than 60% of data traffic worldwide and accounts for 80% of growth in data usage.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The myth of the green cloud|url=https://www.eib.org/en/stories/digital-footprint|access-date=2020-09-17|website=European Investment Bank|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cisco Annual Internet Report - Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018–2023) White Paper|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Cisco|language=en}}</ref>

== Protocols ==
The audio stream is compressed to make the file size smaller using an [[audio coding format]] such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]]. The video stream is compressed using a [[video coding format]] to make the file size smaller. Video coding formats include [[H.264]], [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]], [[VP8]] or [[VP9]]. Encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container "[[bitstream]]" such as [[MPEG-4|MP4]], [[Flash Video|FLV]], [[WebM]], [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]] or [[Internet Streaming Media Alliance|ISMA]]. The bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client (e.g., the computer user with their Internet-connected laptop) using a transport protocol, such as Adobe's [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]. In the 2010s, technologies such as Apple's [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]], Microsoft's Smooth Streaming, Adobe's HDS and non-proprietary formats such as [[MPEG-DASH]] have emerged to enable [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] as an alternative to using proprietary transport protocols. Often, a streaming transport protocol is used to send video from an event venue to a "[[Cloud computing|cloud]]" transcoding service and CDN, which then uses HTTP-based transport protocols to distribute the video to individual homes and users.<ref>{{cite web|title = Streaming the London Olympic Games with the 'Go Live Package' from iStreamPlanet and Haivision {{!}} iStreamPlanet|url = http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|website = www.istreamplanet.com|access-date = 11 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101140531/http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|archive-date = 1 January 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> The streaming client (the end user) may interact with the streaming server using a control protocol, such as [[Microsoft Media Server|MMS]] or [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]].

The quality of the interaction between servers and users is based on the workload of the streaming service; as more users attempt to access a service, the more quality is affected unless there is enough bandwidth or the host is using enough proxy networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sripanidkulchai|first1=Kunwadee|last2=Maggs|first2=Bruce|last3=Zhang|first3=Hui|year=2004|title=An Analysis of Live Streaming Workloads on the Internet|journal=Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement|series=IMC '04|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=41–54|doi=10.1145/1028788.1028795|isbn=9781581138214|s2cid=1742312}}</ref> Deploying clusters of streaming servers is one such method where there are regional servers spread across the network, managed by a singular, central server containing copies of all the media files as well as the [[IP address]]es of the regional servers. This central server then uses [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] algorithms to redirect users to nearby regional servers capable of accommodating them. This approach also allows the central server to provide streaming data to both users as well as regional servers using [[FFMpeg]] libraries if required, thus demanding the central server to have powerful data-processing and immense storage capabilities. In return, workloads on the streaming backbone network are balanced and alleviated, allowing for optimal streaming quality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Hong |last2=Chun-long |first2=Zhou |last3=Bao-zhao |first3=Jin |title=Design and Implementation of Streaming Media Server Cluster Based on FFMpeg |journal=The Scientific World Journal |date=3 February 2015 |volume=2015 |pages=963083 |doi=10.1155/2015/963083 |pmid=25734187 |pmc=4334929 }}</ref>

== Protocol challenges ==
Designing a network protocol to support streaming media raises many problems. [[Datagram]] protocols, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), send the media stream as a series of small packets. This is simple and efficient; however, there is no mechanism within the protocol to guarantee delivery. It is up to the receiving application to detect loss or corruption and recover data using [[error correction]] techniques. If data is lost, the stream may suffer a [[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]]. The [[Real-time Streaming Protocol]] (RTSP), [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) and the [[Real-time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP) were specifically designed to stream media over networks. RTSP runs over a variety of transport protocols, while the latter two are built on top of UDP.

Another approach that seems to incorporate both the advantages of using a standard web protocol and the ability to be used for streaming even live content is [[adaptive bitrate streaming]]. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming is based on HTTP [[progressive download]], but contrary to the previous approach, here the files are very small, so that they can be compared to the streaming of packets, much like the case of using RTSP and RTP.<ref>Ch. Z. Patrikakis, N. Papaoulakis, Ch. Stefanoudaki, M. S. Nunes, "Streaming content wars: Download and play strikes back" presented at the Personalization in Media Delivery Platforms Workshop, [218 – 226], Venice, Italy, 2009.</ref> Reliable protocols, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), guarantee correct delivery of each bit in the media stream. However, they accomplish this with a system of timeouts and retries, which makes them more complex to implement. It also means that when there is data loss on the network, the media stream stalls while the protocol handlers detect the loss and retransmit the missing data. Clients can minimize this effect by buffering data for display. While delay due to buffering is acceptable in video on demand scenarios, users of interactive applications such as video conferencing will experience a loss of fidelity if the delay caused by buffering exceeds 200&nbsp;ms.<ref>Krasic, C. and Li, K. and Walpole, J., ''The case for streaming multimedia with TCP'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 213–218, Springer, 2001</ref> 
[[File:Multicast stream.svg|thumb|Multicasting broadcasts the same copy of the multimedia over the entire network to a group of clients]]

[[Unicast]] protocols send a separate copy of the media stream from the server to each recipient. Unicast is the norm for most Internet connections, but does not scale well when many users want to view the same television program concurrently. [[Multicast]] protocols were developed to reduce the server/network loads resulting from duplicate data streams that occur when many recipients receive unicast content streams independently. These protocols send a single stream from the source to a group of recipients. Depending on the network infrastructure and type, multicast transmission may or may not be feasible. One potential disadvantage of multicasting is the loss of [[video on demand]] functionality. Continuous streaming of radio or television material usually precludes the recipient's ability to control playback. However, this problem can be mitigated by elements such as caching servers, digital [[set-top box]]es, and buffered [[Media player (application software)|media players]].

[[IP Multicast]] provides a means to send a single media stream to a group of recipients on a [[computer network]]. A multicast protocol, usually [[Internet Group Management Protocol]], is used to manage delivery of multicast streams to the groups of recipients on a LAN. One of the challenges in deploying IP multicast is that routers and firewalls between LANs must allow the passage of packets destined to multicast groups. If the organization that is serving the content has control over the network between server and recipients (i.e.,&nbsp;educational, government, and corporate [[intranet]]s), then routing protocols such as [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] can be used to deliver stream content to multiple [[Local Area Network]] segments. As in mass delivery of content, multicast protocols need much less energy and other resources, widespread introduction of reliable multicast (broadcast-like) protocols and their preferential use, wherever possible, is a significant ecological and economic challenge.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Peer-to-peer]] (P2P) protocols arrange for prerecorded streams to be sent between computers. This prevents the server and its network connections from becoming a bottleneck. However, it raises technical, performance, security, quality, and business issues.

== Applications and marketing ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
Useful – and typical – applications of the "streaming" concept are, for example, long [[video lesson|video lectures]] performed "online" on the Internet.<ref>A typical one-hour [[video lesson|video lecture]] is the following "live stream" from an international conference on [[financial crisis|financial crises]]: [http://videolectures.net/eccs08_stanley_aosptucs/ /videolectures.net]</ref> An advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long, although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places. There are also new marketing concepts. For example, the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] sells Internet live streams of whole concerts, instead of several CDs or similar fixed media, by their so-called "[[Digital Concert Hall]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalconcerthall.com/|title=The Berliner Philharmoniker's Digital Concert Hall|website=Digital Concert Hall}}</ref> using YouTube for "[[trailer (promotion)|trailing]]" purposes only. These "online concerts" are also spread over a lot of different places – cinemas – at various places on the globe. A similar concept is used by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York. There also is [[High Definition Earth Viewing cameras|a livestream]] from the [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{cite web|title=High Definition Earth-Viewing System (HDEV)|url=https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/ESRS/HDEV/|publisher=NASA|access-date=26 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ISS HD Earth Viewing Experiment|url=http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload|access-date=26 December 2016}}</ref> In video entertainment, video streaming platforms like [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], and [[Disney+]] are mainstream elements of the media industry.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Forrester|title=Q1 2020 Proves Streaming Is Essential To Consumers And To The Future Of Media Companies|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2020/04/27/q1-2020-proves-streaming-is-essential-to-consumers-and-to-the-future-of-media-companies/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

== Recording ==

Media that is live streamed can be recorded through certain media players such as [[VLC player]], or through the use of a [[screen recorder]]. Live-streaming platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] may also incorporate a [[video on demand]] system that allows automatic recording of live broadcasts so that they can be watched later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1575302-videos-on-demand|title=Videos On Demand}}</ref> The popular site, [[Youtube.com|YouTube]] also has recordings of live broadcasts, including television shows aired on major networks. These streams have the potential to be recorded by anyone who has access to them, whether legally or otherwise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Burroughs|first1=Benjamin|last2=Rugg|first2=Adam|date=3 July 2014|title=Extending the Broadcast: Streaming Culture and the Problems of Digital Geographies|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|volume=58|issue=3|pages=365–380|doi=10.1080/08838151.2014.935854|s2cid=144577408|issn=0883-8151}}</ref>

== Copyright ==
{{See also|Copyright aspects of downloading and streaming}}

Streaming copyrighted content can involve making infringing copies of the works in question. The recording and distribution of streamed content is also an issue for many companies that rely on revenue based on views or attendance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maeda|first=Mari|date=17 March 2001|title=The internet of the future|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=OFC-2001-TuK1|journal=Optical Fiber Communication Conference and International Conference on Quantum Information (2001), Paper TuK1|publisher=Optical Society of America|pages=TuK1|doi=10.1364/OFC.2001.TuK1|isbn=1-55752-654-0|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
The net [[greenhouse gas emissions]] from streaming music have been estimated at between 200 and 350&nbsp;million kilograms per year in the [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|United States]], according to a 2019 study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/environmental-impact-streaming-music-835220/|title=Is Streaming Music Dangerous to the Environment?
