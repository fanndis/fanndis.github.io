{{History of Czechoslovakia}}
The '''Czechoslovak Socialist Republic''' ([[Czech language|Czech]] and {{lang-sk|Československá socialistická republika}}, '''ČSSR''') was the name of [[Czechoslovakia]] from 1948 to 23 April 1990, when the country was under [[Marxist-Leninist state|Communist rule]]. It was a [[satellite state]] of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Rao, B. V. (2006), ''History of Modern Europe Ad 1789–2002: A.D. 1789–2002'', Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd.</ref>

Following the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état of February 1948]], when the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] seized power with the support of the [[Soviet Union]], the country was declared a [[socialist republic]] after the [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] became effective. The traditional name ''Československá republika'' (''Czechoslovak Republic'') was changed on 11 July 1960 following the implementation of the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] as a symbol of the "final victory of [[socialism]]" in the country, and remained so until the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|November 1989]]. Several other state symbols were changed in 1960. Shortly after the Velvet Revolution, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was renamed to the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]].

==Name==
The official name of the country was the ''Czechoslovak Socialist Republic''. Conventional wisdom suggested that it would be known as simply the "Czechoslovak Republic"—its official name from 1920 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1960. However, [[Slovakia|Slovak]] politicians felt this diminished Slovakia's equal stature, and demanded that the country's name be spelled with a [[hyphen]] (i.e. "Czecho-Slovak Republic"), as it was spelled from Czechoslovak independence in 1918 until 1920, and again in 1938 and 1939. President Havel then changed his proposal to "Republic of Czecho-Slovakia"—a proposal that did not sit well with Czech politicians who saw reminders of the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], in which Nazi{{nbsp}}Germany annexed a part of that territory. The name also means "Land of the [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]]" while [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] from the country's original name{{spaced ndash}}"the Czechoslovak Nation"<ref>[[Masaryk, Tomáš]]. [[s:Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence|Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence]]. 1918.</ref>{{spaced ndash}}upon independence in 1918, from the [[Czech language|Czech]] endonym ''Češi''{{spaced ndash}}via its [[Polish language|Polish]] orthography<ref name="Czech">[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech Czech]. CollinsDictionary.com. ''Collins English Dictionary'' – Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 6 December 2012.</ref>

The name "Czech" derives from the [[Czech language|Czech]] endonym ''Češi'' via [[Polish language|Polish]],<ref name="Czech"/> from the archaic Czech ''Čechové'', originally the name of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic tribe]] whose [[Přemyslid dynasty]] subdued its neighbors in [[Bohemia]] around AD 900. Its further etymology is disputed. The [[folk etymology|traditional etymology]] derives it from an eponymous leader [[Forefather Čech|Čech]] who led the tribe into [[Bohemia]]. Modern theories consider it an obscure derivative, e.g. from ''četa'', a medieval military unit.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary. "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/czech Czech]". Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref> Meanwhile, the name "Slovak" was taken from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] "Slavs" as the origin of the word ''[[Wiktionary:Slav|Slav]]'' itself remains uncertain.

During the state's existence, it was simply referred to "Czechoslovakia" or sometimes the "CSSR" and "CSR" in short.

== History ==
=== Background ===
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

Before the [[Prague Offensive]] in 1945, [[Edvard Beneš]], the Czechoslovak leader, agreed to Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]'s demands for unconditional agreement with [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union|Soviet foreign policy]] and the [[Beneš decrees]].<ref name="wettig45">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=45}}</ref> While Beneš was not a [[Moscow]] cadre and several domestic reforms of other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries were not part of Beneš' plan, Stalin did not object because the plan included property expropriation and he was satisfied with the relative strength of communists in Czechoslovakia compared to other Eastern Bloc countries.<ref name="wettig45"/>

In April 1945, the Third Republic was formed, led by a [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] of six parties. Because of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]]'s strength and Beneš's loyalty, unlike in other [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries, USSR did not require [[Eastern Bloc politics]] or "reliable" cadres in Czechoslovak power positions, and the executive and legislative branches retained their traditional structures.<ref name="wettig86">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=86}}</ref> The Communists were the big winners in the [[Czechoslovak parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], taking a total of 114 seats (they ran a separate list in Slovakia).

However, thereafter, the Soviet Union was disappointed that the government failed to eliminate "bourgeois" influence in the army, expropriate industrialists and large landowners and eliminate parties outside of the "National Front".<ref name="wettig152">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=152}}</ref> Hope in Moscow was waning for a Communist victory in the 1948 elections following a May 1947 Kremlin report concluding that "reactionary elements" praising Western democracy had strengthened.<ref name="wettig110">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=110}}</ref>

Following Czechoslovakia's brief consideration of taking [[Marshall Plan]] funds,<ref name="wettig138">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=138}}</ref> and the subsequent scolding of Communist parties by the [[Cominform]] at [[Szklarska Poręba]] in September 1947, [[Rudolf Slánský]] returned to [[Prague]] with a plan for the final seizure of power, including the [[StB]]'s elimination of party enemies and purging of dissidents.<ref name="Grogin, p. 134">{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|p=134}}</ref> Thereafter, Soviet Ambassador [[Valerian Zorin]] arranged a [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|communist coup d'état]], followed by the occupation of non-Communist ministers' ministries, while the army was confined to barracks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|p=371}}</ref>
[[File:Agitace-1947.jpg|thumb|Pro-Communist demonstrations before the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]] in 1948]]
On 25 February 1948, Beneš, fearful of [[civil war]] and Soviet intervention, capitulated and appointed a Communist-dominated government who was sworn in two days later.  Although members of the other National Front parties still nominally figured, this was, for all intents and purposes, the start of out-and-out Communist rule in the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp= 370–371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|pp= 134–135}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Saxonberg|2001|p=15}}</ref> Foreign Minister [[Jan Masaryk]], the only prominent Minister still left who wasn't either a Communist or [[fellow traveler]], was found dead two weeks later.<ref name="Grogin, p. 135">{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|p=135}}</ref> On 30 May, a single list of candidates from the National Front—now an organization dominated by the Communist Party—was elected to the National Assembly.

After passage of the [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] on 9 June 1948, the country became a [[People's Republic]] until 1960. Although it was not a completely Communist document, it was close enough to the Soviet model that Beneš refused to sign it.  He'd resigned a week before it was finally ratified, and died in September. The Ninth-of-May Constitution confirmed that the KSČ possessed absolute power, as other Communist parties had in the [[Eastern Bloc]].   On 11 July 1960, the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] was promulgated, changing the name of the country from the "''Czechoslovak Republic''" to the "''Czechoslovak Socialist Republic''".

=== 1960–1990 ===
{{main|History of Czechoslovakia|History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|History of Czechoslovakia (1989–1992)}}
[[File:Czechoslovakia.png|thumb|left|200px|Czechoslovakia in 1969]]

With the exception of the [[Prague Spring]] in the late-1960s, Czechoslovakia was characterized by the absence of democracy and competitiveness of its Western European counterparts as part of the [[Cold War]]. In 1969, the country became a federative republic comprising the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and [[Slovak Socialist Republic]].

Under the [[federation]], social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the country were largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as Education, were formally transferred to the two republics. However, the [[Centralization|centralized]] political control by the Communist Party severely limited the effects of [[Federalization of Czechoslovakia|federalization]].

The 1970s saw the rise of the [[:Category:Czechoslovak dissidents|dissident movement in Czechoslovakia]], represented (among others) by [[Václav Havel]]. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, making itself felt by limits on work activities (up to a ban on any professional employment and refusal of [[higher education]] to the dissident's children), police harassment and even prison time.

In late 1989, the country became a [[democracy]] again through the [[Velvet Revolution]]. In 1992, the [[Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia|Federal Assembly]] decided it would [[Breakup of Czechoslovakia|break up]] the country into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] on 1 January 1993.

== Geography ==

The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was bounded on the West by [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], on the North by [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], on the East by the [[Soviet Union]] (via the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]) and on the South by [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Austria]].

{{further|Eastern Bloc politics}}
<!--deleted image [[File:1er mai tchécoslovaquie tribune.jpg|thumb|182px|left|First secretary of KSČ [[Gustáv Husák]] and president [[Ludvík Svoboda]].]] -->

The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ) led initially by First Secretary [[Klement Gottwald]], held a monopoly on politics. Following the 1948 [[Tito-Stalin split]] and the [[Berlin Blockade]], increased party [[purges]] occurred throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], including a purge of 550,000 party members of the KSČ, 30% of its members.<ref name="crampton262">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=262}}</ref><ref name="bideleux476">{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=477}}</ref> Approximately 130,000 people were sent to [[List of prisons in the Czech Republic|prisons]], [[:Category:Communist labour camps in Czechoslovakia|labor camps]] and [[Mining|mines]].<ref name="bideleux476"/>

The evolution of the resulting harshness of purges in Czechoslovakia, like much of its history after 1948, was a function of the late takeover by the communists, with many of the purges focusing on the sizable numbers of party members with prior memberships in other parties.<ref name="crampton270">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=270}}</ref> The purges accompanied various [[show trials]], including those of [[Rudolf Slánský]], [[Vladimír Clementis]], Ladislav Novomeský and [[Gustáv Husák]] (Clementis was later executed).<ref name="crampton262"/> Slánský and eleven others were convicted together of being "Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors" in one series of [[show trials]], after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague.<ref name="crampton262"/>

[[Antonín Novotny]] served as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|First Secretary]] of the KSČ from 1953 to 1968. [[Gustáv Husák]] was elected first secretary of KSČ in 1969 (changed to [[General Secretary]] in 1971) and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to KSČ. All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under the umbrella of National Front of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.

In terms of political appointments, the KSČ maintained ''cadre'' and ''[[nomenklatura]]'' lists, with the latter containing every post that was important to the smooth application of party policy, including military posts, administrative positions, directors of local enterprises, social organization administrators, newspapers, etc.<ref name="crampton249">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=249}}</ref> The KSČ's ''nomenklatura'' lists were thought to contain 100,000 post listings.<ref name="crampton249"/> The names of those that the party considered to be trustworthy enough to secure a ''nomenklatura'' post were compiled on the ''cadre'' list.<ref name="crampton249"/>

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Communist Czechoslovakia}}
{{further|Eastern Bloc economies}}

The CSSR's economy was a [[Central planning|centrally planned]] [[command economy]] with links controlled by the communist party, similar to the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]]. It had a large [[metallurgical industry]], but was dependent on imports for [[iron]] and [[nonferrous ore]]s. Like the rest of the Eastern Bloc, [[producer goods]] were favored over [[consumer goods]], and as a result consumer goods were lacking in quantity and quality.  This resulted in a [[shortage economy]].<ref name="dale85">{{Harvnb|Dale|2005|p=85}}</ref><ref name="bideleux474">{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=474}}</ref> Economic growth rates lagged well behind Czechoslovakia's western European counterparts.<ref name="hardt17">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=17}}</ref> Investments made in industry did not yield the results expected, and consumption of energy and raw materials was excessive. Czechoslovak leaders themselves decried the economy's failure to modernize with sufficient speed.

*Industry: Extractive and manufacturing industries dominated this sector. Major branches included [[machinery]], [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], [[food processing]], [[metallurgy]], and [[Textile industry|textiles]]. Industry was wasteful of energy, materials, and labor and slow to upgrade technology, but was a source of high-quality machinery and [[Arms industry|arms]] for other [[communist countries]].
*[[Agriculture of Communist Czechoslovakia|Agriculture]]: Minor sector but supplied bulk of domestic food needs. Dependent on large imports of grains (mainly for livestock feed) in years of adverse weather. Meat production constrained by shortage of feed, but high per capita consumption of meat.
*Foreign Trade: Exports estimated at US$17.8&nbsp;billion in 1985, of which 55% was machinery, 14% fuels and materials, and 16% manufactured consumer goods. Imports at estimated US$17.9&nbsp;billion in 1985, of which 41% was fuels and materials, 33% machinery, and 12% agricultural and forestry products. In 1986, about 80% of foreign trade was with communist countries.
*Exchange Rate: The official, or commercial, rate was Kcs 5.4 per US$1 in 1987; whereas the tourist, or noncommercial, rate was Kcs 10.5 per US$1. Neither rate reflected purchasing power. The exchange rate on the [[black market]] was around Kcs 30 per US$1, and this rate would become official once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s.
*Fiscal Year: Calendar year.
*Fiscal Policy: State almost exclusive owner of means of production. Revenues from state enterprises primary source of revenues followed by [[turnover tax]]. Large budget expenditures on social programs, subsidies, and investments. Budget usually balanced or small surplus.

=== Resource base ===
{{main|Resource base of Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After World War II, the country was short on energy, relying on imported [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] from the Soviet Union, domestic [[Lignite|brown coal]], and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[hydroelectric energy]]. Energy constraints were a major factor in 1980s.

=== Emigration ===
{{further|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection}}

Historically, emigration has always been an option for [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] dissatisfied with the situation at home. Each wave of emigration had its own impetus. In the 19th century, the reasons were primarily economic. In the 20th century, emigration was largely prompted by political turmoil, though economic factors still played a role. The first major wave of emigration in the 20th century came after the communists came to power, and the next wave began after the [[Prague Spring]] was suppressed.

In the 1980s, the most popular way to emigrate to the West was to travel to [[Communist Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] by automobile and, once there, take a detour to [[Greece]], [[Austria]], or [[Italy]] (Yugoslav border restrictions were not as strict as those of the Warsaw Pact nations). Only a small percentage of those who applied to emigrate legally could do so. The exact details of the process have never been published, but a reasonably clear picture can be gleaned from those who succeeded. It was a lengthy and costly process. Those applicants allowed to even consider emigration were required to repay the state for their education, depending on their level of education and salary, at a rate ranging from 4,000 Kčs to 10,000 Kčs. (The average yearly wage was about Kčs33,600 in 1984.) The applicant was likely to lose his job and be socially [[ostracized]].

Technically, at least, such emigres would be allowed to return for visits. Those who had been politically active, such as Charter 77 signatories, found it somewhat easier to emigrate, but they were not allowed to return and reportedly had to pay the state exorbitant fees—Kčs23,000 to as much as Kčs80,000—if they had graduated from a university. Old-age pensioners had no problem visiting or emigrating to the West. The reasons for this were purely economic; if they decided to stay in the West, the state no longer had to pay their pension.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There is (and always was) a huge discrepancy between "official statistics" (i.e. numbers issued by the [[communist regime]]) on how many people emigrated from [[Czechoslovakia]] and "illegal [[refugee]]" statistics published by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). This discrepancy was not specific to Czechoslovakia only; a similar situation applied for all [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, as their [[authoritarian regime]]s preferred to downplay and suppress real numbers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Official statistics for the early 1980s show that, on the average, 3,500 people emigrated legally each year. From 1965 to 1983, a total of 33,000 people emigrated legally. This figure undoubtedly included a large number of ethnic Germans resettled in [[East Germany]]. The largest émigré communities are located in Austria, [[West Germany]], the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Unofficial figures are much larger. It is estimated that between 1948 and 1989 close to 1&nbsp;million people left communist-ruled Czechoslovakia. The largest exoduses occurred following the communist takeover in February 1948 and following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, with around 200,000 people leaving in each wave.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} A very similar 200,000-strong refugee wave left [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] in 1956 after their [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|failed anti-communist revolution]]. In the 1950s, when the regime was at its harshest and the "[[Iron Curtain]]" was close to impenetrable, emigration was very low. It increased between 1969 and 1989, when close to 40,000 people were leaving the country each year. All of them were sentenced to imprisonment ''in absentia'' by the communist regime for leaving the country illegally.

=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

Religion was oppressed and attacked in communist-era Czechoslovakia.<ref>[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/2017/05/19/catholics-in-communist-czechoslovakia-a-story-of-persecution-and-perseverance/ Catholics in Communist Czechoslovakia: A Story of Persecution and Perseverance]</ref> In 1991, 46.4% were Roman Catholics, Atheists made up 29.5%, 5.3% were Evangelical Lutherans, and 16.7% were n/a, but there were huge differences between the 2 constituent republics – see [[Religion in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Religion in Slovakia|Slovakia]].

=== Health, social welfare and housing ===
{{main|Health and Social Welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia}}

After World War II, free health care was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine; factory and local health-care centers supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. Substantial improvement in rural health care in 1960s and 1970s.

=== Mass media ===
{{main|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia}}
{{further|Eastern Bloc information dissemination}}

The mass media in Czechoslovakia was controlled by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ). Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this informational monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were [[Censorship|reviewed]] by the government's ''Office for Press and Information.''
