'''Smith College''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why is Smith a Women's College|url=https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/why-a-womens-college|access-date=2020-06-22|website=Smith College|language=en}}</ref> in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. It was chartered in 1871 by [[Sophia Smith]] and opened in 1875. It is the largest member of the historic [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges, a group of elite women's colleges in the Northeastern United States. Smith is also a member of the [[Five College Consortium]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu |title=Five Colleges, Incorporated: Home |publisher=Fivecolleges.edu |access-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913145340/https://www.fivecolleges.edu/ |archive-date=2016-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> along with four other nearby institutions in the Pioneer Valley: [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]];<ref>[http://www.fivecolleges.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216091104/https://www.fivecolleges.edu/ |date=2019-12-16 }} Five College Consortium website.

On campus are Smith's [[Smith College Museum of Art|Museum of Art]] and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Garden]], the latter designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].

Smith has 41 academic departments and programs and is structured around an open curriculum, lacking course requirements and scheduled final exams. It is known for its [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]], politically active student body and rigorous academics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Smith College - The Princeton Review College Rankings & Reviews|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/college/smith-college-1023999|access-date=2020-11-02|website=www.princetonreview.com}}</ref> Undergraduate admissions is exclusively restricted to women; Smith announced a trans inclusive admissions policy in 2015, however, after criticism from the college community. Smith offers several graduate degrees, all of which accept applicants regardless of gender, and co-administers programs leading to Ph.D.s alongside other Five College members. The college was the first historically women's college to offer an undergraduate engineering degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/newsoffice/releases/03-070.html|title=Blazing A Trail For Women, Smith College Prepares To Graduate The Country's First All-Female Class Of Engineers|website=www.smith.edu|date=April 20, 2004}}</ref> Admissions is considered highly selective. It was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], and its sports teams are known as the Pioneers.

Smith alumnae include notable authors, journalists, activists, feminists, politicians, philanthropists, actresses, filmmakers, academics, CEOs, two [[list of first ladies of the United States|first ladies of the United States]], and recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]], [[Academy Award]], [[Emmy Award]], [[MacArthur Grant]], [[Peabody Award]], and [[Tony Award]].

==History==
The college was chartered in 1871 by a bequest of [[Sophia Smith]] and opened its doors in 1875 with 14 students and 6 faculty.<ref>[https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/smith-history/sophia-smith "Sophia Smith"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211124848/https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/smith-history/sophia-smith |date=2016-12-11 }}, Smith College website.</ref> When she inherited a fortune from her father at age 65, Smith decided leaving her inheritance to found a women's college was the best way for her to fulfill the moral obligation she expressed in her will:

<blockquote>I hereby make the following provisions for the establishment and maintenance of an Institution for the higher education of young women, with the design to furnish for my own sex means and facilities for education equal to those which are afforded now in our colleges to young men.<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/about_smithtradition.php smith.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226230052/http://www.smith.edu/about_smithtradition.php |date=2009-02-26 }}, Smith College Web site</ref></blockquote>

By 1915–16, the student enrollment was 1,724, and the faculty numbered 163.

Smith has been led by 11 presidents and two acting presidents. ([[Elizabeth Cutter Morrow]] was the first acting president of Smith College and the first female head of the college, but she did not use the title of president.) For the 1975 centennial, the college inaugurated its first woman president, [[Jill Ker Conway]], who came to Smith from [[Australia]] by way of [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. Since President Conway's term, all Smith presidents have been women, with the exception of John M. Connolly's one-year term as acting president in the interim after President Simmons left to lead [[Brown University]].

==Academics==
Smith College has 285 professors in 41 academic departments and programs, for a faculty:student ratio of 1:9.<ref name="smith1"/> It was the first women's college in the United States to grant its own undergraduate degrees in [[engineering]]. The Picker Engineering Program offers a single [[ABET]] accredited [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering science, combining the fundamentals of multiple engineering disciplines.

Smith has joined the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT optional movement]] for undergraduate admission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1211786427249410.xml&coll=1|title=Smith drops SATs|last=Contrada|first=Fred|date=May 26, 2008|publisher=MassLive.com|access-date=October 10, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625004817/http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-14%2F1211786427249410.xml&coll=1|archive-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>

Smith runs its own junior year abroad (JYA) programs in four European cities: [[Paris]], [[Hamburg]], [[Florence]] and [[Geneva]].<ref>[http://www.smith.edu/studyabroad/jya.php Smith College: Study Abroad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719145941/http://www.smith.edu/studyabroad/jya.php |date=2012-07-19 }}.

Retrieved on 2013-09-07.</ref> These programs are notable for requiring all studies to be conducted in the language of the host country (with both Paris and Geneva programs conducted in French). In some cases students live in homestays with local families. Nearly half of Smith's juniors study overseas, either through Smith JYA programs or at more than 40 other locations around the world.

Junior math majors from other undergraduate institutions are invited to study at Smith College for one year through the [[Center for Women in Mathematics]]. Established in the fall of 2007 by Professors [[Ruth Haas]] and Jim Henle, the program aims to allow young women to improve their mathematical abilities through classwork, research and involvement in a department centered on women. The [[Center for Women in Mathematics|Center]] also offers a post-baccalaureate year of math study to women who either did not major in mathematics as undergraduates or whose mathematics major was not strong.<ref>[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/NAM/newsletter/NAM38.1.pdf "Smith College Women in Mathematics Program" National Association of Mathematicians, Spring 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910095330/http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/NAM/newsletter/NAM38.1.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}.

The Louise W. and Edmund J. Kahn Liberal Arts Institute supports collaborative research without regard to the traditional boundaries of academic departments and programs. Each year the Institute supports long-term and short-term projects proposed, planned and organized by members of the Smith College faculty. By becoming Kahn Fellows, students get involved in interdisciplinary research projects and work alongside faculty and visiting scholars for a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/kahninstitute/ |title=Smith College: Kahn Liberal Arts Institute |publisher=Smith.edu |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701234250/http://www.smith.edu/kahninstitute/ |archive-date=2010-07-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Students can develop leadership skills through Smith's two-year Phoebe Reese Lewis Leadership Program.

===Ada Comstock Scholars Program===
The Ada Comstock Scholars Program is an undergraduate degree program that serves Smith students of [[Non-traditional student|nontraditional college age]]. The program accommodates approximately 100 women ranging in age from mid-twenties to over sixty. Ada Comstock Scholars attend the same classes as traditional undergraduates, either full or part-time, and participate fully in a variety of extracurricular activities. They may live on or off campus. Financial aid is available to each Ada Comstock Scholar with demonstrated need.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/admission/ada.php|title=Smith College: For Nontraditional Students|publisher=Smith College|access-date=2015-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185939/http://www.smith.edu/admission/ada.php/|archive-date=2015-04-19|url-status=live}}</ref>

Beginning in 1968, with the approval of the Committee on Educational Policy, Smith College initiated a trial program loosely titled ''The Continuing Education Degree'' for several women of non-traditional age who were looking to complete their unfinished degrees. Their successes inspired President [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] and Dean Alice Dickinson to officially expand the program. In January 1975, the Ada Comstock Scholars Program was formally established under President [[Jill Ker Conway]] and in the fall of that year forty-five women were enrolled. The students range in ages, backgrounds, and geographical locations. The growth of the program peaked just over 400 students in 1988.

The program is named for [[Ada Comstock|Ada Louise Comstock Notestein]] (1876–1973), an 1897 Smith graduate, professor of English and dean of Smith from 1912–23, and president of [[Radcliffe College]] from 1923–43. Ada Comstock Notestein devoted much of her life to the academic excellence of women. Considering education and personal growth to be a lifelong process, she stayed actively involved in women's higher education until her death at the age of 97.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/classdeans/adas_history.php|title=Smith College: Class Deans|publisher=Smith College|access-date=2015-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419014932/http://www.smith.edu/classdeans/adas_history.php|archive-date=2015-04-19|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Graduate degrees and study options===
Smith offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching (elementary, middle or high school), master of fine arts, master of education of the deaf, master of science in biological sciences, master of science in exercise and sport studies and master and Ph.D. in social work. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies.

==Traditions==

===Residential culture and student life===
Smith requires most undergraduate students to live in on-campus houses unless they reside locally with their family. This policy is intended to add to the camaraderie and social cohesion of its students. Unlike most institutions of its type, Smith College does not have dorms, but rather 36 separate houses, ranging in architectural style from 18th-century to contemporary. It is rumored the architecture of Chapin House was the inspiration for the Tara Plantation House in ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. (Author [[Margaret Mitchell]] went to Smith for one year and lived in Chapin.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/reslife/houses_green_chapin.php|title=Smith College: Residence Life|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2017-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104143010/https://www.smith.edu/reslife/houses_green_chapin.php|archive-date=2018-01-04|url-status=live}}</ref> A novelty of Smith's homelike atmosphere is the continuing popularity of Sophia Smith's recipe<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clio.fivecolleges.edu/smith/sophia/fun/fun.htm |title=Sophia Through the Years |publisher=Smith.edu |access-date=2017-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309173039/http://clio.fivecolleges.edu/smith/sophia/fun/fun.htm |archive-date=2018-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> for molasses cookies. These are often served at the traditional Friday afternoon tea held in each house, where students, faculty and staff members and alumnae socialize.<ref name="justthefacts" />

Two cultural spaces on campus, used by students of color to build their community, include the Mwangi Cultural Center and Unity House. Mwangi originally opened as the Afro-American Cultural Center in 1968, but was later renamed in honor of the first female physician in Kenya, and Smith alum, Dr. Ng’endo Mwangi ('61). After loaning Mwangi to the other cultural organizations on campus for four years, the Black Students’ Alliance decided to reclaim Mwangi in April 1990.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Leaders, members and supporters of cultural organizations got together to form a group called UNITY, in October of the same year, to demand a space for other cultural organizations. Today, Unity House serves as a home to the 11 cultural organizations on campus.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Two recent additions to the campus, both of which enhance its sense of community, are the architecturally dramatic Campus Center <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/campuscenter/ |title=Smith College: Office of Student Engagement |publisher=Smith.edu |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724043800/http://www.smith.edu/campuscenter/ |archive-date=2010-07-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the state-of-the-art Olin Fitness Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/news/2003-04/OlinOpening.html |title=Smith College: News |publisher=Smith.edu |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045318/http://www.smith.edu/news/2003-04/OlinOpening.html |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2009, construction was also completed on Ford Hall, a new science and engineering facility. According to the Smith College website, Ford Hall is a "...facility that will intentionally blur the boundaries between traditional disciplines, creating an optimum environment for students and faculty to address key scientific and technological developments of our time." The building was officially dedicated on October 16, 2009.<ref>Ford Hall: http://www.smith.edu/fordhall/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305171516/http://www.smith.edu/fordhall/ |date=2010-03-05 }}</ref>

The campus also boasts a botanic garden that includes a variety of specialty gardens including a rock garden and historic glass greenhouses dating back to 1895. The botanic garden formerly featured a Japanese tea hut, which was removed in October 2015 following concerns over "issues of safety and vandalism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/news/announcement.php?id=26939|title=Smith College: Grecourt Gate Announcement|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2016-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012153347/https://www.smith.edu/news/announcement.php?id=26939|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=live}}</ref>

Until 2013, transgender women were not allowed to attend Smith unless all their legal documentation consistently stated they were female. This policy came to public attention in March 2013 when Smith rejected the application of a [[trans woman]] named Calliope Wong. In the rejection letter, Smith's Dean of Admission Debra Shaver wrote "Your [[FAFSA]] indicates your gender as male. Therefore, Smith cannot process your application." This policy was changed in 2013 to only require all non legal application materials to indicate a female identity, including references. Not satisfied with the change, students as well as various alumni formed the group Q&A ("Queers and Allies") to advocate for more trans-inclusive policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Drew|first=Sophie|title=Challenging Gender at a Women's Institution: Transgender Admission and Inclusion at Smith College|journal=Women Leading Change |volume=3|pages=25–36}}</ref> Q&A subsequently protested the policy on [[Facebook]] and other [[social media]] websites, as well as staging protests on campus that garnered significant media attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/students-at-smith-protest-the-colleges-refusal-to-admit-tran|title=Students At Smith Protest The College's Refusal To Admit Transgender Women|last=Yandoli|first=Krystie Lee|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In 2014, Smith formed an Admissions Policy Study Group, co-chaired by Daphne Lamothe and Audrey Smith, who at the time were associate professor of Afro-American studies and vice president for enrollment, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters/2014-15/admission-policy|title=President - Letters - Admission Policy Study Group|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group recommended that to be considered for admission to Smith, applicants live and/or identify as a woman, check the "female" box when applying, and that the President establish a working group to support all [[Transgender|trans]] and [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] students at Smith.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/studygroup/about.php|title=Smith College: Admission Policy Study Group|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> These recommendations went to the faculty<ref name=":1" /> and the Board of Trustees<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/04/living/smith-college-transgender-women-feat/index.html|title=Smith College to admit transgender women|first=Brandon |last=Griggs|website=CNN|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and in 2015, Smith announced a [[Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges|new policy]] that only required female identification on the common application.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jaschik |first1=Scott |title=Tipping Point for Trans Admissions? |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/04/smith-college-will-accept-transgender-applicants-who-identify-women |website=Inside Higher Ed |access-date=5 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706213758/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/05/04/smith-college-will-accept-transgender-applicants-who-identify-women |archive-date=6 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Under the policy, [[transgender men]] and non-binary or [[genderqueer]] applicants are not eligible for admission.<ref name=":04">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/studygroup/faq.php|title=Smith College: Admission Policy Study Group FAQ|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> This new policy also affirms that any student who, once admitted, transitions to another identity other than "female" and, who completes the college’s graduation requirements, will be awarded a Smith degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/equity-inclusion/gender-identity-expression|title=Offices - Diversity - Gender Identity & Expression|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129052732/https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/equity-inclusion/gender-identity-expression|archive-date=2019-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref> The Resource Center for Sexuality and Gender; The Office for Equity and Inclusion and its Trans/Non-binary Working Group; Transcending Gender, a student group focused on support and education; and the Transgender Support Group run by Counseling Services work to support trans and non-binary students at Smith across the [[gender identity]] spectrum.  

In the fall of 2018, students at Smith protested after a Smith employee called the police on a black student working at Smith over the summer, when the employee saw her in a common space. Organized by the Black Students’ Alliance and the Smith African & Caribbean Students Association, students protested and walked out of the annual Smith [[convocation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/05/protests-mark-start-new-semester-smith-college/RCtAtCTdwGV28AhdWxygcM/story.html|title=Protests mark start of new semester at Smith College - The Boston Globe|last=Fern|first=Deirdre|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14|date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> While the incident received national attention and news coverage, Smith conducted an independent investigation and investigators found that there was no [[bias]] in the incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/30/investigation-finds-no-policy-violations-when-police-were-called-black-student|title=Investigation finds no policy violations when police were called on a black student|website=www.insidehighered.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In response to the incident, Smith hosted an Inclusion and Diversity Conference on April 10th, 2019, featuring workshops and presenters run by various members of the Smith community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters/2018-19/inclusion-diversity-conference|title=President - Letters - Inclusion and Diversity Conference on April 10|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, during that time another controversy arose: the hiring of [[Mount Holyoke College]] and Smith's joint police chief, Daniel Hect.

Protests continued the next day when hundreds of students participated in a [[sit-in]] organized by the group Students for Social Justice and Institutional Change, or SSJIC, outside of John M. Greene Hall. The group was originally formed to advocate for undocumented students, but expanded to a broad coalition of marginalized students, including [[students of color]], [[Low income|low-income]] and trans students. The coalition presented a broad list of demands to the administration, proposing reform to many sectors of campus life, including curriculum, health and counseling services, accessibility, policing, admissions policies and affinity housing.<ref name=":32">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazettenet.com/Smith-College-students-protest-against-racism-new-police-chief-24764370|title=As students protest, Smith and Mount Holyoke colleges put new joint chief of police on leave|last=Christensen|first=Dusty|date=2019-04-11|website=Daily Hampshire Gazette|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In response to the demands, Smith launched a working group charged with identifying key themes in response to the day of inclusion and ensuing protests<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/equity-inclusion/inclusion-in-action/working-group-report|title=Offices - Diversity - Inclusion Conference - Working Group Report|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> and revamped the Office of Equity and Inclusion, adding programmatic changes, new or modified positions, training and development opportunities and new events to promote inclusion and equity.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/toward-equity-and-inclusion|title=About Smith - Toward Equity and Inclusion|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> 

====Houses====
{{See also|Smith College Housing}}
[[File:Ginkgo tree on Smith College campus, Northampton, MA - January 2015.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ginkgo tree near arboretum]]
Smith College has many different houses serving as dormitories. Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House.

Houses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location.

====Campus folklore====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Smith has numerous folk tales and ghost stories emerge from the histories of some of its historic buildings. It was named as the most haunted college in America by College Consensus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collegeconsensus.com/rankings/most-haunted-colleges/}}</ref> One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]]. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/traditions/ghost-stories/}}</ref>

====Clubs, sports, and organizations====
In addition to the 11 varsity sports,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://smithpioneers.com/ |website=Smith Pioneers}}</ref> there are currently more than 120 clubs and organizations<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smith.edu/student-life/clubs-and-organizations}}</ref> that cater to Smith students’ variety of interests. There are options that can be found based on academic, political, cultural, and athletic interests. If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own.

=====Athletics=====
Smith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|title=A Smith First: The New Game of Basketball|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807101716/https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|archive-date=2019-08-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|title=Flashback Photo: Smith College Basketball Team, 1904|date=2014-03-24|website=New England Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708054411/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|archive-date=2019-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref>

A new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams—and to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today.

Smith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.

Smith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then "follows" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.

=====Cultural organizations=====
There are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students’ Association (ASA), Black Students’ Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students’ Organization (ISO), Korean Students’ Association (KSA), the Latin American Students’ Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students’ Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students’ Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students’ Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created.

===Academic year events===
'''[[Convocation]]''' signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique "senior hats," to be worn for the first time at Convocation.

'''[[Mountain Day]]''' is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve [[New England]] road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together.

'''[[Otelia Cromwell]] Day''', named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year. In 2020, Otelia Cromwell Day was renamed "Cromwell Day" to simultaneously honor Otelia Cromwell's niece [[Adelaide Cromwell]], Smith College's first African-American faculty member.

'''Rally Day''' In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of [[George Washington]]'s birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social—though always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, "Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as '''Rally Day''' (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae.

===Reunions and commencement events===
The Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; "off-year" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the "Class of 1776."

Traditional reunion and [[Graduation|Commencement]] events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.

[[File:Smith College - Ivy Day Seniors.jpg|thumb|220px|Ivy Day]]

'''[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]''', the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college.

'''Illumination Night''', beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Gardens]]. The major official event of the night is the '''Senior Step Sing''': seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the '''Sophomore Push''' committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and "into the real world."

Until the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. "Significant" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.

There have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See [[Smith College commencement controversies]] to learn more.

==Environmental sustainability==
[[File:Paradise Pond.jpg|thumb|Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left)]]

Smith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts.<ref name="smith.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |title=Smith College: Green Smith |publisher=Smith.edu |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930235407/http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |archive-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of "to-go" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer "To-Go" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, [[biodegradable plastic]], and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed.

For Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of "A-" on the "College Sustainability Report Card 2010" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |title=Smith College – Green Report Card 2010 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2008-06-30 |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201946/http://greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |archive-date=2010-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>
