'''Luis Crisologo Singson''' (born June 21, 1941), better known as '''Chavit Singson''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[politician]] serving as mayor of [[Narvacan]], [[Ilocos Sur]] since 2019.  He was the [[Governor]] of the province of  [[Ilocos Sur]], starting from 1972 until 1986, again from 1992 until 2001, 2004 until 2007, and from 2010 until 2013. He is also as the Deputy National Security Adviser for the Philippine government (2008).

He also ran under [[TEAM Unity (Philippines)|Team Unity]] for the Senate in the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 Elections]] in the [[Philippines]] but lost.

==Early life==
Chavit Singson was born on June 21, 1941 in [[Vigan]], Ilocos Sur. He is second eldest among the seven children of José Singson and Caridad Crisólogo. He studied in [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] in Manila and finished his Commerce degree.

Both his paternal (Singson) and maternal (Crisologo) families have dominated the political environment of the Ilocos region for generations. Although many members of both families, such as Chavit are related to one another, the two families have shared a bitter feud which reached its apex in the 1960s and 1970s, when shootings and political intimidation were rampant in the Ilocos region. Chavit considered his uncle, Floro Crisologo as a mentor, but eventually had a severe falling out with his cousin and once-confidant  [[Vincent Crisologo]] who was Floro's son and there were many bloody encounters between the two. It is currently stated by both sides that tensions have eased.
