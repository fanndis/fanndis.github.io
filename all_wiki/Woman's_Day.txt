'''''Woman's Day''''' is an American [[women's magazine]] that covers such topics as [[homemaking]], food, [[nutrition]], [[physical fitness]], [[physical attractiveness]], and [[fashion]]. The print edition is one of the [[Seven Sisters (magazines)|Seven Sisters]] magazines. The magazine was first published in 1931<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|work=PSA Research Center|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref> by [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]]; the current publisher is [[Hearst Corporation]].

==History==
A&P began publishing the U.S. edition as a free in-store menu/recipe planner, calculated to make customers buy more by giving them meal ideas in an easy-to-read format available inside A&P [[grocery stores]].

Following the 1936 opening of A&P's first modern [[supermarket]] (in [[Braddock, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Braddock, Pennsylvania]]), A&P expanded ''Woman's Day'' in 1937 through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Stores Publishing Company. Selling for five cents a copy ({{Inflation|US|5|1937|fmt=c}}¢ today), the magazine featured articles on childcare, [[craft]]s, food preparation and [[cooking]], home decoration, needlework and [[health]], plus a revival of cartoonist [[Walter Hoban]]'s ''[[Jerry on the Job]]'' [[comic strip]] in a 1939 [[Grape-Nuts]] ad campaign.<ref>[http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?product=grape%25nuts Gallery]</ref>

Sold exclusively in A&P stores, ''Woman's Day'' had a circulation of 3,000,000 by 1944. This had reached 4,000,000 by the time A&P sold the magazine to [[Fawcett Publications]] in 1958. By 1965, ''Woman's Day'' had climbed to a circulation of 6,500,000.

In a mid-1960s appeal to [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]], an ad for ''Woman's Day'' showed a friendly [[pharmacist]] named I.A. Morse next to copy that claimed:
{{bquote|So ''Woman's Day'' doesn't tell a lot of funny stories, and it doesn't run pictures of fashions its readers could never afford. Like I.A. Morse, ''Woman's Day'' -- more than any other magazine -- is a trusted advisor in the day in day out work that's a housewife's chosen profession. That's our profession. And we're proud of it. Like Doc Morse ''Woman's Day'' talks man to man to women.}}

Fawcett was sold to [[CBS]] in 1977, and CBS, in turn, sold its magazine division to a group led by division head Peter Diamandis, who renamed the group Diamandis Communications. In 1988 ''Woman's Day'', along with the rest of Diamandis, was acquired by [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] which published the magazine from offices at 1633 Broadway in New York. [[Hearst Magazines]] bought the Hachette magazines in the US in 2011.
