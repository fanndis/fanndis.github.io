==History==
{{Main|History of the University of California, Los Angeles}}

[[File:UCLA-old-statenormal-campus.jpg|thumb|left|The Los Angeles branch of the [[California State Normal School]], 1881.]]

In March 1881, at the request of state senator [[Reginaldo Francisco del Valle]], the California State Legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the California State [[Normal School]] (now San José State University) in downtown Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of [[Southern California]]. The '''Los Angeles branch of the California State Normal School''' opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The facility included an [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary school]] where teachers-in-training could practice their technique with children. That elementary school is related to the present day [[UCLA Lab School]]. In 1887, the branch campus became independent and changed its name to Los Angeles State Normal School.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.library.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/PowellArchitecturecompressed_6.pdf|title=Bruin Timeline|publisher=UCLA GSE&IS|date=2018|accessdate=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412181150/https://www.library.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/PowellArchitecturecompressed_6.pdf|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="berkeley">{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/UCHistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/overview.html |title=(UC) Los Angeles: Historical Overview |accessdate=June 20, 2006 |author=Hamilton, Andrew |date=June 18, 2004 |work=University of California History, Digital Archives (from Berkeley) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430204632/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/overview.html |archive-date=April 30, 2006 }}</ref>

In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on [[Vermont Avenue]] (now the site of [[Los Angeles City College]]) in [[East Hollywood, Los Angeles|East Hollywood]]. In 1917, UC Regent [[Edward Augustus Dickson]], the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and [[Ernest Carroll Moore]], Director of the Normal School, began to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second [[University of California]] campus, after [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and [[Benjamin Ide Wheeler]], President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus. However, [[David Prescott Barrows]], the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections.

On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor [[William Stephens|William D. Stephens]] signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which acquired the land and buildings and transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the '''Southern Branch of the University of California'''. The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm |title=UCLA University Archives |accessdate=June 20, 2006 |date=January 20, 2007 |work=UCLA Library |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615035434/http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 15, 2006}}</ref> The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLr-4QteEYC&q=ucla%2520southern%2520branch%2520september%252015&pg=PA26|title=UCLA: The First Century|last=Dundjerski|first=Marina|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Third Millennium Publishing|isbn=978-1-906507-37-4|language=en}}</ref>

Under University of California President [[William Wallace Campbell]], enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25&nbsp;[[acre]] Vermont Avenue location. The Regents searched for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called "Beverly Site"—just west of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]—on March 21, 1925, edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]]. After the athletic teams entered the [[Pacific Coast Conference|Pacific Coast conference]] in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname "Bruins", a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |title=The Daily Bruin Is Born |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |author=Garrigues, George |year=2001 |work=Loud Bark and Curious Eyes, A History of the UCLA Daily Bruin, 1919–1955 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060528022042/http://ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |archive-date = May 28, 2006}}</ref> In 1927, the Regents renamed the [[History of the University of California, Los Angeles|Southern Branch]] the '''University of California at Los Angeles''' (the word "at" was officially replaced by a comma in 1958, in line with other UC campuses).<ref name="Dundjerski" /> In the same year, the state broke ground in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers [[Janss Investment Company|Edwin and Harold Janss]], for whom the Janss Steps are named.<ref name="berkeley" /> The campus in Westwood opened to students in 1929.

The original four buildings were the College Library (now [[Powell Library]]), [[Royce Hall]], the Physics-Biology Building (which became the Humanities Building and is now the Renee and David Kaplan Hall), and the Chemistry Building (now Haines Hall), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400&nbsp;acre (1.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. After lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the [[master's degree]] in 1933, and the [[doctorate]] in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.ucla.edu/alumni-association/history/default.aspx |title=History: The Beginning |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |author=UCLA Alumni |year=2012 |work=UCLA Alumni |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404100138/http://alumni.ucla.edu/alumni-association/history/default.aspx |archive-date=April 4, 2013 }}</ref>

===Maturity as a university===
{{Expand section|History after 1951|date=June 2016}}
During its first 32 years, UCLA was treated as an off-site department of UC. As such, its presiding officer was called a "provost", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:

<blockquote>
I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, "University of California." And I said, "Is this Berkeley?" She said, "No." I said, "Well, who have I gotten to?" "UCLA." I said, "Why didn't you say UCLA?" "Oh", she said, "we're instructed to say University of California." So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, "Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'"}} And they said, "You know they won't like it at Berkeley." And I said, "Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/1999/991109caught.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901112349/http://www.today.ucla.edu/1999/991109caught.html |archive-date=September 1, 2006 |title=Caught on Tape: Voices from UCLA's Past |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |author=Ko, Amy |year=1999 |work=UCLA Today }}</ref>

Not only does this represent a huge step backward and a betrayal of students’ trust, but it displays a startlingly low standard when it comes to treatment of sexual assault suspects."<ref>"[https://dailybruin.com/2016/02/15/editorial-ucla-failed-to-properly-punish-professor-involved-in-title-ix-lawsuit Editorial: UCLA failed to properly punish professor involved in Title IX lawsuit]," ''Daily Bruin'', 15 February 2016.</ref> The university settled with the plaintiffs and eventually, after simply suspending and fining Piterberg, did more after student protest and legal efforts, including "separation from employment, denial of emeritus status, [and] denial of future employment with the University of California."<ref>"[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/10/03/nyu-and-rutgers-students-ask-why-professors-found-have-behaved-inappropriately Critical Reception]," ''Inside HigherEd'', 3 October 2029.</ref>

In 2015, the U.S. Department of Education's [[Office for Civil Rights]] investigated UCLA and other universities for their compliance with [[Title IX]] and responses to sexual violence.<ref>"[https://dailybruin.com/2015/04/28/ucla-title-ix-compliance-investigation-seeks-student-participation UCLA Title IX compliance investigation seeks student participation]," ''Daily Bruin'', 28 April 2015.</ref>

In 2018, the university came into the national spotlight again when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that four UCLA employees had filed lawsuits against UCLA and the UC Board of Regents having accused their workplace supervisor of sexual harassment and the university of failing to properly handle abuse complaints.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lawsuit-ucla-harassment-20180616-story.html |title=Four UCLA employees sue school, alleging workplace sexual harassment |first1=Dakota |last1=Smith |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 17, 2018 |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702122135/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lawsuit-ucla-harassment-20180616-story.html |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The harassment allegedly started in early 2016, according to the lawsuits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dailybruin.com/2018/06/16/former-employees-file-lawsuit-against-ucla-allege-sexual-harassment/ |title=Four UCLA employees sue school, alleging workplace sexual harassment |first1=Sydney |last1=Coneeny |newspaper=[[Daily Bruin]] |date=June 16, 2018 |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702122042/https://dailybruin.com/2018/06/16/former-employees-file-lawsuit-against-ucla-allege-sexual-harassment/ |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The women faced retaliation from other supervisors after they filed complaints.

UCLA was one of several universities named in the largest college admissions scandal ever prosecuted by the [[United States Department of Justice]]. On Tuesday, March 12, 2019, UCLA men's soccer coach Jorge Salcedo was one of many coaches across the country charged with racketeering and conspiracy, and is alleged to have taken over $200,000 in bribes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/sports-college-admissions-scam.html|title=The Coaches Connected to the College Admissions Fraud Case|last1=Das|first1=Andrew|date=2019-03-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-20|last2=Tracy|first2=Marc|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Meyers|first3=Naila-Jean|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320090502/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/sports-college-admissions-scam.html|archive-date=March 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/ucla-mens-soccer-coach-jorge-salcedo-indicted-in-college-bribery-case-placed-on-leave|title=UCLA men's soccer coach Jorge Salcedo indicted in college bribery case, placed on leave|date=2019-03-12|website=Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:Royce Hall post rain.jpg|thumb|[[Royce Hall]], one of the original four buildings, inspired by [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]]]]

The new UCLA campus in 1929 had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now called Renee And David Kaplan Hall) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419&nbsp;acres (1.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in the western part of [[Los Angeles]], north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of [[Sunset Boulevard]]. In terms of acreage, it is the second-smallest of the ten UC campuses.<ref name="Campus Facts" /> The campus is approximately 1 mile east of the I-405 [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?latlongtype=internal&addtohistory=&latitude=%2fujp23Q4CoQyaX7fYDsWRA%3d%3d&longitude=8%2fGfpeQs3DIJqAXMypI90g%3d%3d&name=UNIVERSITY%20of%20California&country=US&address=405%20Hilgard%20Ave&city=Los%20Angeles&state=CA&zipcode=90095&phone=310%2d825%2d4321&spurl=0&&q=UCLA&qc=Colleges%20%26%20Universities |title=Map of University of California |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |work=Mapquest |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219155633/http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?latlongtype=internal&addtohistory=&latitude=%2Fujp23Q4CoQyaX7fYDsWRA%3D%3D&longitude=8%2FGfpeQs3DIJqAXMypI90g%3D%3D&name=UNIVERSITY%20of%20California&country=US&address=405%20Hilgard%20Ave&city=Los%20Angeles&state=CA&zipcode=90095&phone=310%2D825%2D4321&spurl=0&&q=UCLA&qc=Colleges%20%26%20Universities |archive-date=February 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The campus is in the residential area of Westwood and bordered by [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] to the north, Beverly Hills to the east, and [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] to the west. The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, history, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the "Sunken Garden". South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the [[UCLA Medical Center]]. The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.

Ackerman Union, the [[John Wooden Center]], the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and [[Pauley Pavilion]] stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Plaza is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.

During the [[2028 Summer Olympics]], wrestling and judo will be held at Pauley Pavilion. The campus will also be the location of the Olympic Village for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf |title=Assets |website=la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com |access-date=2019-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012093308/http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf |archive-date=October 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Royce Hall, vaulted arches, exterior, UCLA.jpg|left|thumb|Vaulted arches of Royce Hall]]
The first buildings were designed by the local firm [[Allison & Allison]]. The [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect [[Welton Becket]] was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Becket greatly streamlined its
general appearance, adding several rows of [[Minimalism|minimalist]], slab–shaped brick buildings to the southern half, the largest of these being the [[UCLA Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=weltonbecketandassociates-losangeles-ca-usa |title=Welton Becket and Associates |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |year=2007 |work=Emporis Buildings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314020937/http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=weltonbecketandassociates-losangeles-ca-usa |archive-date=March 14, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Architects such as [[A. Quincy Jones]], [[William Pereira]], and [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]] designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects [[I.M. Pei]], [[Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Cesar Pelli]], and [[Rafael Vinoly]]. To accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the nickname "Under Construction Like Always".<ref name="construction">{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |title=A 'sense of place' from the old and new |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |author=Lee, Cynthia |date=October 12, 2004 |work=UCLA Today |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128014442/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |archive-date = January 28, 2007}}</ref>

One notable building on campus is named after African-American alumnus [[Ralph Bunche]], who received the 1950 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. The entrance of [[Bunche Hall]] features a bust of him overlooking the [[Franklin D. Murphy]] Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.

The [[Hannah Carter Japanese Garden]] is located a mile north of campus, in the community of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]]. The garden was designed by landscape architect [[Nagao Sakurai]] of Tokyo and garden designer [[Kazuo Nakamura]] of Kyoto in 1959. The garden was donated to UCLA by former UC regent and UCLA alumnus [[Edward W. Carter]] and his wife Hannah Carter in 1964 with the stipulation that it remains open to the public.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://bhcourier.com/2016/06/03/ucla-accepts-12-5-million-offer-for-hannah-carter-japanese-garden/|title=UCLA Accepts $12.5 Million Offer For Hannah Carter Japanese Garden|last=Coleman|first=Laura|date=June 3, 2016|work=Beverly Hills Courier|access-date=December 14, 2019}}</ref> After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The property was sold in 2016 and public access is no longer required.<ref name=":0" />

===Filming===
[[File:Legally Blonde filming location at Kerckhoff Hall at UCLA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front lawn of UCLA's Kerckhoff Hall, as seen during the orientation scene in ''[[Legally Blonde]]''.]]
UCLA has attracted filmmakers for decades with its proximity to [[Hollywood]]. Much of the film ''[[Gotcha! (1985 film)|Gotcha!]]'' (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as [[John Singleton]]'s ''[[Higher Learning]]'' (1995). ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' (2001), ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' (2003), ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1995), ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' (2000), ''[[How High]]'' (2001), ''[[National Lampoon's Van Wilder]]'' (2002), ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie ''[[My Name is Khan]]'' (2010) was shot on campus. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' and ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and ABC Family original series ''[[Greek (TV series)|Greek]]'' were also filmed at UCLA. The site was also used to represent the fictional Windsor College which appears in ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997).<ref name="scream2dvdcommentary">{{cite video | people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = December 12, 1997 | title = Scream 2 - Commentary by Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier & Marianne Maddalena | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States | access-date = July 21, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180803162158/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082/ | archive-date = August 3, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |title=UCLA Policy 863: Filming and Photography on Campus |accessdate=May 21, 2007 |date=January 23, 2004 |author=Morabito, Sam |work=UCLA Administrative Policies & Procedures Manual |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901090414/http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |archive-date = September 1, 2006}}</ref>

The [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|David Geffen School of Medicine]], [[UCLA School of Nursing|School of Nursing]], [[UCLA School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]] and [[UCLA School of Public Health|Fielding School of Public Health]] constitute the professional schools of health science.

The UCLA Health System operates the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and twelve primary care clinics throughout [[Los Angeles County]]. In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals—[[Harbor–UCLA Medical Center]] and [[Olive View–UCLA Medical Center]]—as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. The Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center is also a major teaching and training site for the university. The UCLA Medical Center made history in 1981 when Assistant Professor Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed [[AIDS]]. UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain function. Professor of Pharmacology [[Louis Ignarro]] was one of the recipients of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovering the signaling cascade of [[nitric oxide]], one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology.

===Library system===
{{Main|University of California, Los Angeles Library}}
[[File:Powell Library, UCLA (10 December 2005).jpg|thumb|right|Powell Library, across the quad from Royce Hall]]
UCLA's library system has over nine million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers. It is the United States' 12th largest library in number of volumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm |title=The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held |accessdate=February 16, 2014 |year=2012 |work=American Library Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619081432/http://ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm |archive-date=June 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first library, University Library (presently [[Powell Library]]), was founded in 1884. In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian. [[Lawrence Clark Powell|Lawrence Powell]] became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, was named Dean of the School of Library Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |title=A Tribute to Lawrence Clark Powell |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |year=2006 |work=UCLA Library |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051217020308/http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |archive-date = December 17, 2005}}</ref> More libraries were added as previous ones filled.

Due to UCLA's academic and athletic prestige, as well as the name, being associated with popular images of Southern California lifestyle, apparel with UCLA logos and insignia sells not just in the United States, but as an overseas clothing and accessories brand. High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in [[South Korea]], and 49 are currently open in China.

===Commerce on campus===
[[File:UCLA hoodie.jpg|thumb|right|A hoodie from the UCLA Store]]
UCLA has various store locations around campus, with the main store in Ackerman Union. In addition, UCLA-themed products are sold at the gift shop of [[Fowler Museum at UCLA|Fowler Museum]] on campus.

Due to licensing and trademarks, products with UCLA logos and insignia are usually higher priced than their unlicensed counterparts. These products have popularity among visitors, who buy them as gifts and souvenirs. For certain products (such as notebooks and folders) the UCLA Store offers both licensed (logo) and unlicensed (without logo, thus cheaper) options, but for many other products the latter option is often unavailable.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Students who are part-time employed by ASUCLA at a UCLA Store or a UCLA Restaurant are offered certain discounts when they are shopping at UCLA Stores, in addition to their salary.

==Athletics==
{{Main|UCLA Bruins}}
[[File:UCLA Bruins script.svg|thumb|Official logo of UCLA Athletics]]
[[File:UCLA marching band 2010.jpg|thumb|The Solid Gold Sound of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band]]
The school's sports teams are called the [[UCLA Bruins|Bruins]], represented by the colors [[True Blue (color)|true blue]] and gold. The Bruins participate in [[NCAA Division I]] as part of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's [[American football|football]] team plays home games at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]; the team won a national title in 1954. The [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams, and the women's [[gymnastics]] team compete at [[Pauley Pavilion]] on campus. The school also sponsors [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[soccer]], women's [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[water polo]], [[track and field]], and women's [[softball]].

The mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the [[fight songs]] are ''[[Sons of Westwood]]'' and ''[[Mighty Bruins]]''. The alma mater is ''[[Hail to the Hills of Westwood]]''.

When [[Henry Russell Sanders|Henry "Red" Sanders]] came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders—the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the uniform "Powder Keg Blue", a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, whose official colors are blue and gold.

UCLA competes in all major Division I sports and has won 128 national championships, including 118 NCAA championships. Only Stanford University has more NCAA team championships, with 126.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://gostanford.com/sports/2017/5/22/home-of-champions.aspx |title=Stanford University Athletics |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212052921/https://gostanford.com/sports/2017/5/22/home-of-champions.aspx |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 21, 2018, UCLA's women's gymnastics team defeated Oklahoma Sooners to win its 7th NCAA National Championship as well as UCLA's 115th overall team title.

The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.

The men's water polo team won UCLA's 112th, 113th, and 114th national championships, defeating USC in the championship game three times: on December 7, 2014, on December 6, 2015, and on December 3, 2017. On October 9, 2016, the top-ranked men's water polo team broke the NCAA record for consecutive wins when they defeated UC Davis for their 52nd straight win. This toppled Stanford's previous record of 51 consecutive wins set in 1985–87. The men's water polo team has become a dominant sport on campus with a total of 11 national championships.

[[File:Pauley Pavilion 2013.JPG|thumb|left|Basketball at [[Pauley Pavilion]]]]

Among UCLA's 118 championship titles, some of the more notable victories are in [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|men's basketball]]. Under legendary coach [[John Wooden]], UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Champions, runners-up and locations|record seven consecutive]], in 1964, 1965, 1967–1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Champions, runners-up and locations|two]]).<ref name="NCAA" /> From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games.

The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football [[List of College Football Hall of Fame inductees (coaches)|Hall of Fame coach]] Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s.

UCLA's official charity is UniCamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the [[greater Los Angeles area]], with UCLA volunteer counselors. UniCamp runs for seven weeks throughout the summer at Camp River Glen in the San Bernardino National Forest. Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.<ref>{{cite web|title=UCLA Unicamp |url=http://www.unicamp.org/site/c.iiKQLaPOLrF/b.5052093/k.BE10/Home.htm |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127015722/http://www.unicamp.org/site/c.iiKQLaPOLrF/b.5052093/k.BE10/Home.htm |archive-date=November 27, 2012 }}</ref>

True Bruin Welcome begins the fall quarter to introduce new students to clubs and activities. The week includes the Day of Service for all freshmen, the Enormous Activities Fair, and the Sports Fair. At the end of move-in and the beginning of True Bruin Welcome, UCLA holds Bruin Bash, which includes a concert, dance and movie pre-release. Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities in North Westwood Village.

The Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes the annual Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]], Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance Marathon students raise $446,157 for pediatric AIDS|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/dance-marathon-students-raise-446-157-for-pediatric-aids|website=UCLA Newsroom|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621081522/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/dance-marathon-students-raise-446-157-for-pediatric-aids|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

During Finals Week, UCLA students participate in "Midnight Yell", where they yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes at midnight to release some stress from studying. The quarterly [[Underwear run|Undie Run]] takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. The run began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as "really short shorts" walked around singing and playing guitar to protest the police restrictions on the Midnight Yell.<ref name="tradition">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/6/13/undie-run-tradition-faces-grow/ |title=Undie Run Tradition Faces Growing Pains |author=Staines, Xandi |date=June 13, 2005 |work=Daily Bruin |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910135835/http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/6/13/undie-run-tradition-faces-grow/ |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which now culminates with students dancing in the fountain.<ref name="undie">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/12/12/undie-run-safety-at-issue/ |title=Undie Run Safety at Issue |author=Rushovich, Colin |date=December 12, 2005 |work=Daily Bruin |accessdate=May 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910135841/http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/12/12/undie-run-safety-at-issue/ |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2007, the route was changed again to begin at Strathmore Avenue instead of Landfair Avenue. The Undie Run has spread to other American universities, including the [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Syracuse University]].

The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor [[Los Angeles Tennis Center]]. The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Quincy Jones]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclalumni.net/CalendarEvents/springsing/Gershwin/winners.cfm |title=Gershwin Award Winners |accessdate=May 21, 2007 |year=2007 |work=Alumni Association |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817021611/http://www.uclalumni.net/calendarevents/springsing/Gershwin/winners.cfm |archive-date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref> [[Lionel Richie]], and in 2009, [[Julie Andrews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&id=E0C5478 |title=Lional Richie accepts the Gershwin Award |publisher=Newsroom.ucla.edu |date=May 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220036/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&id=E0C5478 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |title=Dinner with 12 strangers is a feast for friends |accessdate=May 21, 2007 |author=Valentine, Jane |date=January 21, 2004 |work=UCLA Today |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901103028/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |archive-date = September 1, 2006}}</ref> The "Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.{{wide image|JazzReggae Festival, panorama, Intramural Fields, UCLA (May 2010).jpg|220px|JazzReggae Festival 2010|5 = right}}

===Student government===
[[File:Kerckhoff Hall, UCLA (2007).jpg|thumb|upright|Kerckhoff Hall houses the student government and the ''[[Daily Bruin]]''.]]
The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) encompasses the student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and Services & Enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA refers to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises generate approximately $40 million in annual revenues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=95-1777979&name=associated-students-ucla# |title=Associated Students UCLA [95-1777979&#93; GuideStar Report |publisher=.guidestar.org |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006195002/http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=95-1777979&name=associated-students-ucla |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is to provide quality services and programs for students. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternative. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The "services and enterprises" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.

The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183026/http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.<ref name=usac>{{cite web |url=https://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073752/http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> {{as of|2015}}, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act. In the Spring 2016 election, the two competing parties were Bruins United and Waves of Change—a smaller faction that broke off of Lets Act.

USAC's fourteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its fourteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.

Along with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.

USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the [[UCLA Campus Events Commission|Campus Events Commission]], including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as [[AIDS Awareness]], Substance Abuse Awareness, [[Blood donation|Blood Drives]] and CPR/First Aid Training.

===Media publications===
UCLA Student Media is the home of UCLA's newspaper, magazines, and radio station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apply.uclastudentmedia.com/ |title=UCLA Student Media |website=Apply: UCLA Student Media |access-date=March 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710222128/http://apply.uclastudentmedia.com/ |archive-date=July 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Most student media publications are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board.

The ''[[Daily Bruin]]'' is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name ''Cub Californian'', it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won dozens of national awards, and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2016, the paper won two [[National Pacemaker Awards]] – one for the best college newspaper in the country, and another for the best college media website in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dailybruin.com/2016/10/22/daily-bruin-wins-awards-for-nations-best-online-daily-college-newspaper/ |title=Daily Bruin wins awards for nation's best online, daily college newspaper |accessdate=October 23, 2016 |year=2016 |work=Daily Bruin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024031954/http://dailybruin.com/2016/10/22/daily-bruin-wins-awards-for-nations-best-online-daily-college-newspaper/ |archive-date=October 24, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The newspaper has not been without scrutiny and controversy, and in 1954, the administration attempted to intervene with the previous policy of electing editors by a student council.

UCLA Student Media also publishes seven special-interest news magazines: ''Al-Talib'', ''Fem'', ''Ha'Am'', ''La Gente'', ''Nommo'', ''Pacific Ties'', and ''OutWrite'', a school yearbook, ''BruinLife'', and the student-run radio station, UCLA Radio.

Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries. There are also numerous graduate student-run journals at UCLA, such as ''Carte Italiane'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', and ''Mediascape''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://grad.ucla.edu/asis/library/gqspring11.pdf |title=Publication Revolution |author=Watkins, Mary |date=Spring 2011 |work=UCLA Graduate Quarterly |access-date=October 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050831/https://grad.ucla.edu/asis/library/gqspring11.pdf |archive-date=February 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of these publications are available through [[open access]].

Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.

===Hospitality===
Hospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration.

===Chabad House===
The UCLA [[Chabad House]] is a community center for [[Jews|Jewish]] students operated by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[Chabad]] movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university.<ref name="Chabad, Maya Balakirsky Katz 2010, page 152">The Visual Culture of Chabad, Maya Balakirsky Katz, Cambridge University Press, 2010, page 152.</ref><ref>The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch, Sue Fishkoff, Random House, 2009</ref> In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory.
