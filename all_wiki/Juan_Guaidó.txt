On 23 January 2019, Guaidó and the [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] declared he was acting [[President of Venezuela]] ({{Lang-es|Presidente encargado de Venezuela}}), starting the [[Venezuelan presidential crisis]] by challenging [[Nicolás Maduro]]'s presidency.

Guaidó's political career began when he emerged as a student leader in the [[2007 Venezuelan protests]]. He then helped found the Popular Will party with [[Leopoldo López]] in 2009,<ref name=":2" /> and was elected to be an alternate deputy in the National Assembly one year later in 2010.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /> In 2015, Guaidó was elected as a full-seat deputy.<ref name=":6" /> Following a protocol to annually rotate the position of President of the National Assembly among political parties, Popular Will nominated Guaidó for the position in 2019.<ref name=":2" />

Guaidó has been a key figure in the [[Venezuelan presidential crisis]], which began when the National Assembly, which considered the [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election]] illegitimate, refused to recognize the inauguration of Nicolas Maduro to a second presidential term on 10 January 2019. Just 18 days after he was chosen to lead the Assembly, Guaidó announced, on 23 January 2019, that he was formally assuming the role of interim president [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis#Background|under Article 233]] of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]], with the backing of the National Assembly, until free elections could be held.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/venezuelan-government-opposition-envoys-talks-deal-190530160246998.html|title=Venezuela's Guaido vows protests as Norway talks produce no deal|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="declare">{{bullet}} {{cite news |last1=Specia |first1=Megan |title=What Is Happening in Venezuela and Why It Matters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-crisis.html |access-date=4 June 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 April 2019 |quote=Just two weeks after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term in January, Mr. Guaidó declared himself the interim president, directly challenging the country’s leadership}}

====Strategic Committee====
{{Main|Operation Gideon (2020)}}
According to a report by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', in August 2019 Guaidó tasked [[JJ Rendón|J.J. Rendón]] with a Strategic Committee to investigate scenarios for achieving the removal of Maduro from office.<ref name="WaPoMiamicondo" /><ref name="independent7may2020" /> Members of the Strategic Committee argued that the Venezuelan Constitution, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], and other treaties justified action against Maduro.<ref name="WaPoMiamicondo" />

Rendón stated that the Strategic Committee had contacted numerous groups about forcibly removing Maduro from office, but they demanded US$500 million.<ref name="WaPoMiamicondo" /><ref name="independent7may2020" /> He then made contact with Jordan Goudreau, owner of Silvercorp, on 7 September 2019 at a condominium in Miami, where Silvercorp presented a sales pitch to Rendón that offered the capture or extraction of Maduro from Venezuela, all for US$212.9 million. Rendón signed a [[retainer agreement]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on behalf of the Guaidó government with Silvercorp on 16 October 2019. An amount of US$1.5 million was later insisted by Silvercorp in order to initiate "Operation Resolution," the plan to remove Maduro, install Guaidó as President of Venezuela. However, Guaidó representatives ultimately turned down Goudreau's proposal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ex-Green Beret led failed attempt to oust Venezuela's Maduro|url=https://apnews.com/79346b4e428676424c0e5669c80fc310|author=Joshua Goodman|date=1 May 2020|website=AP|quote=Guaidó’s envoys, including Toledo, ended contact with Goudreau after the Bogota meeting because they believed it was a suicide mission, according to three people close to the opposition leader.}}</ref><ref name="WaPoMiamicondo" /> Goudreau was later responsible for the foiled [[Macuto Bay raid]].<ref name="WaPoMiamicondo" />

On 9 April, the OAS voted 18 to 9, with six abstentions, to accept Guaidó's envoy, [[Gustavo Tarre|Gustavo Tarre Briceño]], as the ambassador from Venezuela until new elections can be held. The permanent council approved a text stating that "Nicolas Maduro's presidential authority lacks legitimacy and his designations for government posts, therefore, lack the necessary legitimacy." Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Dominica, Grenada, Mexico, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela voted against the change.<ref name="GuaidoEnvoy">{{cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190409-oas-recognizes-guaido-envoy-until-new-venezuela-polls|title=OAS recognizes Guaido envoy until new Venezuela polls|date=9 April 2019|work=France 24|access-date=10 April 2019|publisher=Agence France-Press}}</ref> Maduro's administration responded calling Tarre a "loud-mouth political usurper" and the decision a "criminal and rampant violation of international law and the OAS Charter," saying they do not intend to respect decisions made by Tarre.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/b9d4bf61043b4368b7b0f25ab2b45ca3|title=OAS recognizes opposition envoy as Venezuelan ambassador|author=Lugo, Luis Alonso|date=9 April 2019|access-date=10 April 2019|publisher=AP News}}</ref> The nomination was accepted 20 days before the deadline on Venezuela leaving the organization, after they triggered the process in 2017.

In January 2020, Guaidó announced that he would appoint diplomatic representatives to [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Uruguay]].<ref name="Run" />

=== Military involvement ===
In an interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]], Guaidó did not rule out accepting support from the US armed forces, but said that pressure was being applied in every other way possible to avoid armed conflict.<ref name="RuleOut">{{cite news |url= https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/americas/juan-guaido-christiane-amanpour-intl/index.html |title= Venezuela's Guaido refuses to rule out accepting US military support amid escalating political crisis |author = Mackintosh, Elize |work = CNN |date= 31 January 2019 |access-date= 31 January 2019}}</ref>

[of] a magical solution to the country's problems," according to Fiorella.<ref name="Fiorella" />

== Political views ==
Guaidó was a member of the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Popular Will]], now [[Independent politician|independent]], and although his peers characterize Guaidó as a [[Centrism|centrist]], Maduro places him on the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the political spectrum.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/article223970990.html|title=Quién es Juan Guaidó, el líder venezolano reconocido como presidente interino|date=5 January 2019|work=[[El Nuevo Herald]]|access-date=1 February 2019|language=en|quote=[Guaidó] es definido como de centro por sus colaboradores, pese a que milita en una agrupación que es miembro pleno de la Internacional Socialista y que voceros del Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro ubican, a manera de insulto, a la derecha del espectro político.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fundacionfaes.org/en/news/46835/quien-es-juan-guaido-y-por-que-su-juramento-es-constitucional|title=Quién es Juan Guaidó y por qué su juramento es constitucional|date=23 January 2019|website=[[FAES]]|access-date=1 February 2019|quote=Forma parte del partido Voluntad Popular, liderado por Leopoldo López, y que pertenece a la Internacional Socialista.}}</ref> Regarding politics in the United States, Guaidó stated that he was unfamiliar with the subject, but has commented "What they refer to as socialist in the United States is what we’d call a Social Democrat here."<ref name=":2" />
