'''Hollywood''' is a [[neighborhood]] in the [[Central Los Angeles|central region]] of [[Los Angeles, California]].  Its name has come to be a [[metonymy|shorthand reference]] for the [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. film industry]] and the people associated with it.  Many of its studios such as [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[Universal Pictures]] were founded there and Paramount still has its studios there.

Hollywood was incorporated as a [[municipality]] in 1903.<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Angeles Herald, Volume XXXI, Number 45|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19031115.2.91|publisher=By the [[California Digital Newspaper Collection]] (November 15, 1903)|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hollywood Was Once an Alcohol-Free Community|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/hollywood-was-once-alcohol-free-community-1-180949851/|publisher=By Rachel Nuwer of [[Smithsonian (magazine)|smithsonianmag.com]]|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref> It was [[Merger (politics)|consolidated]] with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent [[film industry]] emerged, eventually becoming the most recognizable in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Controller of the City of Los Angeles, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VbOAAAAMAAJ&q=Hollywood+merged+with+City+of+Los+Angeles+in+1910&pg=PA193|publisher=By[[Office controller|Office of Controller]] Los Angeles, CA (1914)|accessdate=February 22, 2014|year = 1914}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Report of the Auditor of the City of Los Angeles California of the Financial Affairs of the Corporation in Its Capacity as a City for the Fiscal Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPo2AQAAMAAJ&q=Hollywood+merged+with+City+of+Los+Angeles+in+1910&pg=PA173|publisher=By [[State auditor|Auditor's Office]] of Los Angeles, CA (1913)|accessdate=February 22, 2014|year = 1913}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history and development===

[[File:Hollywood Grand View Track Map2.tif|thumb|left|Original 480 acre map of H.&nbsp;J. Whitley property developed by his company, Los Angeles Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Highland Avenue runs through the center of the property. The square at the lower right hand corner is the Whitley Estate and was not part of the Grand View development.]]

[[H.J. Whitley]], a real estate developer, had previously started more than a hundred towns across the [[western United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefatherofhollywood.com/images/HJ%201886%20name%20Hollywood0002.JPG|title=Margaret Virginia Whitley Diary (1886)|publisher=Thefatherofhollywood.com}}</ref><ref name = "Rivers in the Desert">Margaret Leslie Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VNUqAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Rivers%20in%20the%20desert] (1993), p. 92.</ref> Whitley arranged to buy the {{convert|480|acre|adj=on}} E.C. Hurd ranch. They agreed on a price and shook hands on the deal. Whitley shared his plans for the new town with General [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]], publisher of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and Ivar Weid, a prominent businessman in the area.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

[[File:Glen-Holly-Hotel-1890.jpg|thumb|[[Glen-Holly Hotel]], first hotel in Hollywood, at the corner of what is now called Yucca Street. It was built in the 1890s.]]

[[Daeida Wilcox Beveridge|Daeida Wilcox]], who donated land to help in the development of Hollywood, learned of the name ''Hollywood'' from Ivar Weid, her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now Lake Hollywood) and a prominent investor and friend of Whitley's.<ref name = "TheFatherofHollywood">The Father of Hollywood by Gaelyn Whitley Keith [https://books.google.com/books?id=nAgAv3duwZEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=the%20father%20of%20hollywood The Father of Hollywood] (2010) pg. 127</ref><ref name = "Ivar Weid">[https://books.google.com/books?id=WCMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA4-PA93&lpg=RA4-PA93#v=onepage&q=hj%20whitley The Quarterly], pg 93â€“94</ref> She recommended the same name to her husband, [[Harvey Henderson Wilcox|Harvey H. Wilcox]], who had purchased 120 acres on February 1, 1887. It wasn't until August 1887 Wilcox decided to use that name and filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office on a deed and parcel map of the property.

By 1900, the region had a post office, newspaper, hotel, and two markets. Los Angeles, with a population of 102,479 lay {{convert|10|mi|km}} east through the [[vineyard]]s, barley fields, and [[citrus]] groves. A single-track [[Tram|streetcar line]] ran down the middle of Prospect Avenue from it, but service was infrequent and the trip took two hours. The old citrus fruit-packing house was converted into a livery [[stable]], improving transportation for the inhabitants of Hollywood.[[File:Hollywood&Highland-1907.jpg|thumb|The intersection of [[Hollywood and Highland Center|''Hollywood and Highland'']], 1907]]

[[File:HJWhitley Hollywood Hotel ca 1904.jpg|thumb|H.J. Whitley is the man standing on the left wearing a bowler hat. The building at the left is the Hollywood Hotel on the corner of Highland Ave. and Hollywood Blvd.]]

The [[Hollywood Hotel]] was opened in 1902 by Whitley, who was a president of the Los Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Having finally acquired the Hurd ranch and subdivided it, Whitley built the hotel to attract land buyers. Flanking the west side of [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]], the structure fronted on [[Hollywood Boulevard|Prospect Avenue]], which, still a dusty, unpaved road, was regularly graded and graveled. The hotel was to become internationally known and was the center of the civic and social life and home of the stars for many years.<ref name="Hollywood Citizen">[http://thefatherofhollywood.com/images/TheFatherofHollywoodDiesHollywoodDailyCitizen2_copy.jpg Father of Hollywood Dies] ''Hollywood Daily Citizen'' (1931)</ref>

Whitley's company developed and sold one of the early residential areas, the Ocean View Tract.<ref name = "Los Angeles">[https://archive.org/details/losangelesfrommo03mcgr/page/816 <!-- quote=whitley hollywood. --> Los Angeles from the mountains to the sea: with selected biography ...], Volume 3 By John Steven McGroarty 1921 pg. 815</ref> Whitley did much to promote the area. He paid thousands of dollars for electric lighting, including bringing electricity and building a bank, as well as a road into the [[Cahuenga Pass]]. The lighting ran for several blocks down Prospect Avenue. Whitley's land was centered on [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]].<ref name="A Dream Picture">Cahuenga Valley Sentinel (May 7, 1904).</ref><ref name="Why I live in Hollywood by H. J. Whitley">Hollywood Citizen (Spring Addition March 4, 1914).</ref> His 1918 development, [[Whitley Heights, Los Angeles|Whitley Heights]], was named for him.

===Incorporation and merger===
Hollywood was incorporated as a [[municipality]] on November 14, 1903, by a vote of 88 for and 77 against. On January 30, 1904, the voters in Hollywood decided, by a vote of 113 to&nbsp;96, to banish the sale of liquor within the city, except for medicinal purposes. Neither hotels nor restaurants were allowed to serve wine or liquor before or after meals.<ref>[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/164260860/ED12571D9ABE42B5PQ/3] "Hollywood Becomes a Prohibition Town," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 29, 1903, page A-3</ref>

In 1910, the city voted for a merger with Los Angeles in order to secure an adequate water supply and to gain access to the L.A. sewer system. With annexation, the name of Prospect Avenue was changed to Hollywood [[Boulevard]] and all the street numbers were also changed.<ref>[http://www.abouthollywood.com/hollywood-neighborhoods/hollywood-california-history-and-information/ Hollywood California | Hollywood History and Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215214425/http://www.abouthollywood.com/hollywood-neighborhoods/hollywood-california-history-and-information/ |date=2011-02-15 }}.

By 1912, major motion-picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles.<ref>Jacobs, Lewis. ''The Rise of the American Film'' Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85</ref> In the early 1900s, most motion picture [[patent]]s were held by [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions.

The first studio in Hollywood, the Nestor Company, was established by the New Jerseyâ€“based Centaur Company in a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] at 6121 [[Sunset Boulevard]] (the corner of [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower]]), in October 1911.<ref>Robertson (2001), p. 21.

[[File:Capitol Records Building LA.jpg|thumb|upright|Capitol Records Tower, 1991]]

[[Hollywood sign|A large sign]] reading ''HOLLYWOODLAND'' was built in the [[Hollywood Hills]] in 1923 to advertise a housing development. In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce entered a contract with the City of Los Angeles to repair and rebuild the sign. The agreement stipulated that ''LAND'' be removed to spell ''HOLLYWOOD'' so the sign would now refer to the district, rather than the housing development.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnzsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA94|title=The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry|last=Slide|first=Anthony|date=February 25, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135925543|location=|page=94|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>

During the early 1950s, the [[Hollywood Freeway]] was constructed through the northeast corner of Hollywood.

The [[Capitol Records Building]] on [[Vine Street]], just north of Hollywood Boulevard, was built in 1956, and the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] was created in 1958 as a tribute to artists and other significant contributors to the entertainment industry. The official opening was on February 8, 1960.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/index.php?page=10 History of WOF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612050102/http://hollywoodchamber.net/index.php?page=10 |date=2010-06-12 }} ''hollywoodchamber.net''; Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

The [[Hollywood Boulevard|Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District]] was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.

In June 1999, the Hollywood extension of the [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail]] [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] opened from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to the [[San Fernando Valley]], with stops along Hollywood Boulevard at [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] ([[Hollywood/Western (Los Angeles Metro station)|Hollywood/Western Metro station]]), [[Vine Street]] ([[Hollywood/Vine (Los Angeles Metro station)|Hollywood/Vine Metro station]]), and [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] ([[Hollywood/Highland (Los Angeles Metro station)|Hollywood/Highland Metro station]]).

The [[Dolby Theatre]], which opened in 2001 as the Kodak Theatre at the [[Hollywood & Highland Center]] mall, is the home of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. The mall is located where the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]] once stood.

===Secession movement===

In 2002, some Hollywood voters began a campaign for the area to secede from Los Angeles and become a separate municipality. In June of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed secession referendums for both Hollywood and the [[San Fernando Valley]] on the ballot. To pass, they required the approval of a majority of voters in the proposed new municipality as well as a majority of voters in all of Los Angeles. In the November election, both measures failed by wide margins in the citywide vote.<ref name=DailyBruin2002>{{cite web|last=Grand|first=Noah|title=Valley, Hollywood secession measures fail|url=http://dailybruin.com/2002/11/05/valley-hollywood-secession-mea/|work=Daily Bruin|accessdate=December 29, 2013|date=November 5, 2002}}</ref>

==Other Hollywoods==
In 1994, [[Hollywood, Alabama]], and 10 other towns named Hollywood successfully fought an attempt by the Hollywood [[Chamber of Commerce]] to trademark the name and force same-named communities to pay royalties to it.<ref>[http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2012/11/more_than_2_decades_ago_the_re.html]</ref> A key point was that Alabama's Hollywood was the first incorporated Hollywood in the nation, whereas the one in California did not incorporate until 1903, six years after Alabama's. In addition, it merged with [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1910 and was no longer identified as a separate city.

==Demographics==
[[File:Gateway to Hollywood 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|Four Ladies of Hollywood, 2018]]

The [[2000 United States Census|2000 U.S. census]] counted 77,818 residents in the {{convert|3.51|mi2|km2|adj=on}} Hollywood neighborhoodâ€”an average of 22,193 people per square mile (8,569 per km<sup>2</sup>), the seventh-[[population density|densest]] neighborhood in all of [[Los Angeles County]]. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 85,489. The median age for residents was 31, about the city's average.<ref name=MappingLAHollywood/>

Hollywood was said to be "highly diverse" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was 42.2% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino or Hispanic]], 41% [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White]], 7.1% [[Asian American|Asian]], 5.2% [[African American|black]], and 4.5% other.<ref name=MappingLAHollywood/> Mexico (21.3%) and Guatemala (13%) were the most common places of birth for the 53.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high for the city as a whole.<ref name=MappingLAHollywood/>

The median household income in 2008 dollars was $33,694, considered low for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.1 people was also lower than the city norm. Renters occupied 92.4% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.<ref name=MappingLAHollywood/>

==Radio and television==

[[KNX (AM)|KNX]] was the last radio station to broadcast from Hollywood before it left [[CBS Columbia Square]] for a studio in the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] in 2005.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/11/local/me-hollywood11 Bob Pool, "Hollywood, Radio Finally Part Waves," ''Los Angeles Times,'' August 11, 2005]</ref>

On January 22, 1947, the first commercial television station west of the [[Mississippi River]], [[KTLA]], began operating in Hollywood. In December of that year, ''The Public Prosecutor'' became the first network television series to be filmed in Hollywood. Television stations [[KTLA]] and [[KCET]], both on Sunset Boulevard, are the last broadcasters (television or radio) with Hollywood addresses, but KCET has since sold its studios on Sunset and plans to move to another location. [[KNBC]] moved in 1962 from the former [[NBC Radio City Studios]] at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street to [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in Burbank. [[KTTV]] moved in 1996 from its former home at [[Metromedia Square]] on Sunset Boulevard to West Los Angeles, and [[KCOP]] left its home on La Brea Avenue to join KTTV on the Fox lot. [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] moved from their longtime home at [[CBS Columbia Square]] on Sunset Boulevard to a new facility at [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]].
