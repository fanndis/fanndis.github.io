The '''Pirate Party Germany''' ({{lang-de|Piratenpartei Deutschland}}), commonly known as '''Pirates''' (German: ''Piraten''), is a [[list of political parties in Germany|political party in Germany]] founded in September 2006 at [[c-base]]. It states general agreement with the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Piratpartiet]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.fr-online.de/top_news/?em_cnt=1648147|title=Wahlleiter lässt kleine Parteien zu: Freie Fahrt für die Piraten |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Rundschau]] |date=19 December 2008 |first=Peter |last=Steinke |language=de}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/computer/557/310486/text |title=Razzia wegen Bundestrojaner: Bedingt abhörbereit |newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=17 September 2009 |first=Mirjam |last=Hauck |language=de}}.</ref> as a party of the [[information society]]; it is part of the international movement of pirate parties and a member of the [[Pirate Parties International]]. In 2011-12, the party succeeded in attaining a high enough vote share to enter four [[Composition of the German Regional Parliaments|state parliaments]] ([[Berlin]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Saarland]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]])<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/the-pirate-party-continues-to-hijack-votes-in-germany.html |title=Upstarts Continue to Hijack Votes in Germany |date=8 May 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times|last=Eddy|first=Melissa}}</ref> and the [[European Parliament]]. However, their popularity rapidly declined and by 2017 they had no representation in any of the German state parliaments. Their one European MEP, [[Patrick Breyer]], has joined the Greens/EFA group. Together with [[Marcel Kolaja]], [[Markéta Gregorová]] and [[Mikuláš Peksa]] from the [[Czech Pirate Party]] they build up the [[European Pirate Party]] team for the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]].

According to political theorist Oskar Niedermayer,<ref name=Niedermayer/> the party sees itself as part of an international movement to shape with their term of "[[digital revolution]]" which is a circumscription for the transition into [[information society]]. With their focus on freedom in the net and their fight against government regulations of this sphere, they caught the attention especially of the younger generation. Even if the network policy is the core identity of the party, it is now more than just an advocacy party of "[[digital natives]]" and characterises itself as a social-liberal-progressive.<ref name=Niedermayer>{{Citation |url=http://www.bpb.de/methodik/7YLTAF,0,0,PIRATEN.html |title=Partei-Profil: Piratenpartei Deutschland |newspaper= on the page of [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] |date=21 September 2011 |first=Oskar |last=Niedermayer|language=de}}.</ref>

Former federal chairman [[Sebastian Nerz]] sees the party as [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] party of fundamental rights which among other things wants to advocate for [[political transparency]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.focus.de/politik/weitere-meldungen/piratenpartei-piraten-sehen-sich-als-sozial-liberale-grundrechtspartei_aid_671852.html |title=Piraten sehen sich als "sozial-liberale Grundrechtspartei" |newspaper=Focus Online |date=5 October 2011|language=de}}.</ref>

== Party platform ==
The party supports the preservation of current [[civil rights]] in [[telephony]] and on the Internet; in particular, it opposes the European [[Telecommunications data retention|data retention]] policies.

The party favors the civil right to [[information privacy]] and reforms of [[copyright]], education, [[genetic patent]]s and [[drug policy]].

In particular, it promotes an enhanced [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] of government by implementing [[open source governance]] and providing for [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to allow for electronic inspection and monitoring of government operations by the citizen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Parteiprogramm |title=Program of the Piratenpartei (German) |language=de |publisher=Wiki.piratenpartei.de |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref>

== Election results ==

=== 2009 federal election ===
On 27 September 2009, the Pirates received 2.0% (845,904 votes) in the [[2009 German federal election]], thus not securing any seats in the Bundestag. However, this was still the best result among parties that did not meet the 5% threshold. Among first-time male voters, the party received 13%.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20090928-22209.html |title=Pirate Party fires broadside at German political establishment |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=28 September 2009 |first=Kristen |last=Allen }}</ref>

On account of the election results in 2009, the party fulfils the conditions for receiving [[Campaign finance|public allowances]]. For 2009, it received €31,504.68 (the same amount as it received from private contributions) which was exclusively due to the Pirates state associations Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. The calculation was made based on the total receipts of the party in 2008.  The possible upper limit of the public allowance matching for the party is a rate of €840,554.51.<ref name="public allowances 2009">[http://andipopp.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/parteienfinanzierung_2009.pdf Gesamtübersicht Festsetzung der staatlichen Teilfinanzierung für das Jahr 2009 gemäß §§ 18 ff.

[[File:Piraten de ew 2009.svg|thumb|Election results in the 2009 European Parliament election]]
It received 229,117 votes in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament election]], which was 0.9%, but not enough (at least 5%) for a seat.<ref>[http://www.wiwo.de/technologie/digitale-welt/topraks-technik-talk-acht-gruende-fuer-die-piratenpartei/5154542.html Acht Gründe für die Piratenpartei] Wirtschaftswoche; 13 June 2006. in German</ref>

=== State and regional elections ===
On 30 August 2009, the Pirates received 1.9% in the [[2009 Saxony state election]]. On the same day, the party also received one seat in each council in the local elections of [[Münster]] and [[Aachen]], although candidates of the party ran for office only in some constituencies of both cities.<ref>[http://www.gulli.com/news/wahlen-piraten-ziehen-in-2009-08-30 ''Piraten ziehen in Stadträte ein''] (German), gulli.com, 30 August 2009</ref>

Support for The Pirates differs somewhat between States. The party received 1.8% in the [[2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election]] and 1.5% in the [[2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] (though without securing seats),<ref name="Thoma 2012">{{cite web | last=Thoma | first=Jörg | title=Schleswig-Holstein: Piratenpartei zieht in den Landtag ein | website=Golem.de | date=6 May 2012  | url=http://www.golem.de/news/schleswig-holstein-piratenpartei-zieht-in-den-landtag-ein-1205-91595.html | language=de | accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung 2014">{{cite web | title=Wer warum die Piratenpartei wählt, Publikationen, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung | website=Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung | date=19 December 2014  | url=http://www.kas.de/wf/de/33.31029/ | language=de | accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> but only 0.5% in the [[2009 Hesse state election]] and did not participate in the [[2009 Brandenburg state election|2009 Brandenburg]] and [[2009 Saarland state election|Saarland state elections]].

The party received 2.1% in the [[2011 Hamburg state election]]s, though it was not yet enough to gain seats in the State parliament. In the [[2011 Baden-Württemberg state election]] the Pirate Party was able to repeat this result. In the [[2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] they received 1.4% or 13,828 votes; in the [[2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]] they achieved 1.6% of the votes.

In March 2012, the Pirates received 7.4% of the vote<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.statistikextern.saarland.de/wahlen/wahlen/2012/internet_saar/LT_SL_12/landesergebnisse/ |title=preliminary official election result (percent) |date=26 March 2012 |language=de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506134156/http://www.statistikextern.saarland.de/wahlen/wahlen/2012/internet_saar/LT_SL_12/landesergebnisse/ |archivedate=6 May 2016}}</ref> and thus won 4 seats<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.statistikextern.saarland.de/wahlen/wahlen/2012/internet_saar/LT_SL_12/landesergebnisse/grafik_sitze_10.html |title=preliminary official election result (seats) |date=26 March 2012|language=de}}</ref> in the [[Landtag of Saarland]].

===2013 federal election===
After those successful state elections, the party was able to score up to 13% in nationwide polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/forsa.htm |title=Sonntagsfrage – Forsa (Wahlumfragen zur Bundestagswahl) |publisher=Wahlrecht.de |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> However, after a string of scandals<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-voters-grow-disillusioned-with-pirate-party-a-863234.html</ref><ref>https://newrepublic.com/article/137305/rise-fall-pirate-party</ref> and internal disputes which were handled unprofessionally and picked up by the media, the party lost the trust of voters and entered a steady decline in polls.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/pirate-party-fails-to-capitalize-on-nsa-scandal-a-923303.html | newspaper=Spiegel Online| title=Sinking Ship: Germany's Struggling Pirate Party }}</ref>

As a result, in the [[2013 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony state election in January 2013]], the Pirate Party was only able to gain about 2.1% of the votes, missing the 5% threshold needed to gain actual seats in the state parliament. Six months later during the [[2013 Bavaria state election|Bavaria state election of 2013]] the Pirates fared similarly, receiving again only 2% of the votes. At the [[2013 German federal election]]s the following weekend, the party suffered another major defeat where it was again only able to achieve 2.2% of the votes, leading to the resignation of party leader {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernd Schlömer|de}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/piraten-chef-schloemer-tritt-ab-a-924194.html | newspaper=Spiegel Online| title=  Wahldebakel: Piraten-Chef Schlömer gibt Amt auf | language=German}}</ref>

In the [[2014 European Parliament election in Germany|2014 European parliament elections]], the Pirate Party received 1.45% of the national vote (424,510 votes in total) and returned a single [[Member of the European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |title=Übersicht |publisher=Bundeswahlleiter.de |accessdate=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072802/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |archivedate=5 July 2015}}</ref> The elected MEP, [[Julia Reda]], joined the [[Greens–European Free Alliance]] as an independent.<ref name="Pogliani">{{cite web | last=Pogliani | first=Silvia | title=Up-to-date list of the MEPs for the new legislative period | website=The Greens | url=http://www.greens-efa.eu/up-to-date-list-of-the-meps-for-the-new-legislative-period-12490.html | accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>

=== 2016 Berlin state election ===

The Berlin state election on September witnessed the collapse of support for the Pirate Party in their previous stronghold of Berlin.  Their previous vote of 8.9% achieved in 2011 fell to 1.7% and the Pirate Party lost all representation in the Berlin State assembly. The poor result was compounded by the murder suicide of former Pirate Party assembly member [[Gerwald Claus-Brunner]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/gerwald-claus-brunner-german-pirate-party-politician-confessed-before-suicide</ref>

=== 2017 dropout from state parliaments ===

Together with the satirical party [[Die PARTEI]] the Pirate Party nominated [[:de:Engelbert Sonneborn|Engelbert Sonneborn]] as candidate for the [[2017 German presidential election|German presidential election]] in February 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/bundespraesidentenwahl-2017-sonneborn-sucht-gegenkandidaten-14834365-p2.html|title=Mein Vater könnte das|author=Martin Sonneborn|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017|newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|language=German}}</ref>

The Pirate Party continued to decline in 2017, dropping out from state parliaments. In the [[2017 Saarland state election|Saarland state election]] in March 2017, the Pirate Party received only 0.7% of the voter share and therefore lost all its seats in the [[Landtag of the Saarland]].<ref name="Saarland">{{cite web | publisher=Statistisches Amt Saarland | author=Landeswahlleiterin Saarland | title=Election results for the 2017 Saarland state parliament elections | website=statistikextern.saarland.de | url=http://www.statistikextern.saarland.de/wahl/internet_saar/LT_SL/landesergebnisse/ | language=German | accessdate=30 March 2017 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326214946/http://www.statistikextern.saarland.de/wahl/internet_saar/LT_SL/landesergebnisse/ | archivedate=26 March 2017}}</ref> With the [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] in which it lost every seat, the Pirate Party is no longer represented in any state parliament.

=== 2019 European Parliament election ===

In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European Parliament election]], the Pirate Party retained their MEP seat, with their lead candidate [[Patrick Breyer]] being elected.
