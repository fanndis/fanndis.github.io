==Plot==
Based on a true story, the plot revolves around the efforts of debate coach [[Melvin B. Tolson]] ([[Denzel Washington]]) at [[Wiley College]], a historically black college related to the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South ]] (now [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]]), to place his team on equal footing with whites in the American South during the 1930s, when [[Jim Crow laws]] were common and lynch mobs were a fear for blacks. The fictional Wiley team eventually succeeds to the point where they are able to debate [[Harvard University]].

The movie explores social constructs in Texas during the [[Great Depression]], from day-to-day insults African Americans endured to [[lynching]]. Also depicted is [[James Farmer|James L. Farmer, Jr.]] ([[Denzel Whitaker]]), who, at 14 years old, was on Wiley's debate team after completing high school (and who later went on to co-found the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]). Another character on the team, Samantha Booke, is based on the real individual [[Henrietta Bell Wells]], acclaimed poet and the only female member of the 1930 Wiley team who participated in the first collegiate interracial debate in the US.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/us/12wells.html|title=Henrietta Bell Wells, a Pioneering Debater, Dies at 96|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2008-03-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The key line of dialogue, used several times, is a famous paraphrase of theologian St.  [[Augustine of Hippo]]: "An unjust law is no law at all." Another major line, repeated in slightly different versions according to context, concerns doing what you "have to do" in order that we "can do" what we "want to do." In all instances, these vital lines are spoken by the James L. Farmer Sr. and James L. Farmer, Jr. characters.

== Historical notes ==
The film depicts the Wiley Debate team beating Harvard College in the 1930s. The real Wiley team instead defeated the [[University of Southern California]], who at the time were the reigning debating champions.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-great-debaters-2007|title=The Great Debater's|date=2007-12-24|publisher=[[Roger Ebert]]|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>  Though they beat the reigning champions, Wiley was not allowed to officially call themselves victors, because they were not full members of the debate society; [[African Americans|blacks]] were not admitted until after [[World War II]].<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/education/05wiley.html For Struggling Black College, Hopes of a Revival]."
