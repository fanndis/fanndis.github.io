He portrayed himself as an [[anti-establishment|outsider]] and a supporter of [[family values]]. He came in first place in the first round of the [[2018 Brazilian general election|general election on 7{{nbsp}}October 2018]], with [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] candidate [[Fernando Haddad]] coming in second place. The two candidates faced a [[Two-round system|run-off]] on 28 October 2018, and Bolsonaro was elected with 55.1% of the popular vote.

Bolsonaro placed many army officers in key positions in his cabinet. Prior to his inauguration, Bolsonaro stated that he would fill positions in his government based only on technical qualifications and skills rather than ideological sympathy. Despite this, during his presidency, many appointees saw themselves clashing ideologically with the government. His minister of [[Sérgio Moro|Justice]], [[:pt:Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez|Education]], the [[Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz|Secretary of Government]], and the Postmaster General, among others, ended up falling out of favor with the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/pt-br/as-principais-baixas-do-governo-bolsonaro/g-49368323|title=As principais baixas do governo Bolsonaro|work=DW.com.br|access-date=8 July 2020|language=pt|archive-date=9 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709094432/https://www.dw.com/pt-br/as-principais-baixas-do-governo-bolsonaro/g-49368323|url-status=live}}</ref> Bolsonaro focused on domestic affairs in his first months in office, dealing primarily with the fallout of [[2014 Brazilian economic crisis]].

In his final years in high school, Bolsonaro was admitted to the [[Escola Preparatória de Cadetes do Exército]] (the prep school of the [[Brazilian Army]]), where he entered in 1973. In 1974, he went to the [[Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras]] (Brazil's main [[military academy]]), graduating in 1977, as an [[Artillery]] officer. He served in the 9th Field Artillery Group, in [[Nioaque]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. Later he studied at the Army Physical Training School in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and served in the 21st Field Artillery Group and the 8th Paratrooper Field Artillery Group, from the [[Paratroopers Brigade (Brazil)|Paratrooper Brigade]], both in the same city. His superior officers described him as "aggressive" and having an "excessive ambition to get financial and economical gain".<ref name="nyt" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/05/1884332-bolsonaro-era-agressivo-e-tinha-excessiva-ambicao-diz-ficha-militar.shtml#_=_|title=Bolsonaro era agressivo e tinha 'excessiva ambição', diz ficha militar|website=1.folha.com.br|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-date=25 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225071507/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/05/1884332-bolsonaro-era-agressivo-e-tinha-excessiva-ambicao-diz-ficha-militar.shtml#_=_|url-status=live}}</ref> The assessment referred to Bolsonaro's attempt to mine gold in [[Bahia]] state; according to him, the activity was only a "hobby and mental hygiene". In 1987, he studied in the [[:pt:Escola de Aperfeiçoamento de Oficiais|Officers Improvement School]], where he made the Artillery Advanced Course.

Bolsonaro's first rise to publicity came in 1986 when he gave an interview to the news magazine ''Veja''. He complained about low salaries in the military and claimed that the High Command was firing officers due to budgetary cuts and not because they were displaying 'deviations of conduct', as the command was telling the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqanalagoa.ufscar.br/pdf/recortes/R03088.pdf|title=''O salário está baixo''|website=Arqanalagoa.ufsacr.br|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-date=25 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125181956/http://www.arqanalagoa.ufscar.br/pdf/recortes/R03088.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite being reprimanded by his superiors, Bolsonaro received praise from fellow officers and wives of military men, becoming a household name for a lot of hardliners and right-wingers who were growing disenchanted with Brazil's new civilian democratic government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/jornal-de-debates/capitao-bolsonaro-a-historia-esquecida/|title=Capitão Bolsonaro, a história esquecida – Observatório da Imprensa – Você nunca mais vai ler jornal do mesmo jeito|date=6 April 2011|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-date=25 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225071456/http://observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/jornal-de-debates/capitao-bolsonaro-a-historia-esquecida/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 1987, Bolsonaro faced a new accusation. The same ''Veja'' magazine reported that, with an Army colleague, he had plans to plant bombs in military units in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After Bolsonaro called the allegation "a fantasy", the magazine published, in its subsequent edition, sketches in which the plan was detailed. The drawings had been allegedly produced by Bolsonaro himself. Official records unearthed by the newspaper ''[[O Estado de S.Paulo]]'' in 2018 detailed the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,o-julgamento-que-tirou-bolsonaro-do-anonimato,70002249929 |title=O julgamento que tirou Bolsonaro do anonimato - Política |website=Estadão |access-date=8 October 2018 |archive-date=8 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008061308/https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,o-julgamento-que-tirou-bolsonaro-do-anonimato,70002249929 |url-status=live }}</ref> After an investigation by an administrative military bureau named Justification Board, Bolsonaro was unanimously considered guilty. According to this board, Bolsonaro had a "serious personality deviation and a professional deformation", "lack of moral courage to leave the Army" and "lied throughout the process" when denying frequent contacts with the ''Veja'' magazine. The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court. The [[General]] in charge of reporting the case voted for his acquittal, arguing that Bolsonaro had already been penalized for the initial article in ''Veja'', that there was no testimonial evidence of his plans to plant bombs and that there were "deep contradictions in the four graphological exams", two of which failed to conclude that Bolsonaro was indeed the author of the sketches. He ended up acquitted by the majority of the court (9{{nbsp}}x 4{{nbsp}}votes). In December 1988, just after this ruling, Bolsonaro left the Army to begin his political career. In total, he served in the military for fifteen years, reaching the rank of Captain.

=== Councilor of Rio de Janeiro (1989–1991) ===
[[File:Bolsonaro em março de 1990 (Acervo Globo).jpg|thumb|upright|Bolsonaro as Rio de Janeiro city councilor in March 1990. In October of the same year, he was elected Federal Deputy for Rio.]]
Bolsonaro entered politics in 1988, getting elected as [[city councilor]] in Rio de Janeiro, representing the [[Christian Democratic Party (Brazil)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC). According to his biography written by his son Flávio, Bolsonaro "was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors. His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career".<ref name="book" />

He spent only two years in the [[Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro]]. He was described as a quiet, discreet and conservative councilor, and showed little participation.<ref name="vereador">{{cite journal |date=26 November 2017 |title=Como vereador, projeto de transporte gratuito para tropas - Política - Estadão |url=https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,como-vereador-projeto-de-transporte-gratuito-para-tropas,70002097328 |journal=Estadão |language=pt |archive-date=25 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925084303/https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,como-vereador-projeto-de-transporte-gratuito-para-tropas,70002097328 |url-status=live }}</ref> His term as councilor was used mainly to give visibility to military causes, such as retirement benefits for former officers.<ref name="book">{{cite book |title=Jair Messias Bolsonaro - Mito ou Verdade |last=Bolsonaro |first=Flávio |publisher=Altadena Editora |year=2017 |location=Rio de Janeiro |isbn=9788594307002|language=pt-br|pages=77–79}}</ref>

=== Federal Deputy for Rio de Janeiro (1991–2018) ===
In the 1990 elections, he was elected as a [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|federal deputy]] for the Christian Democratic Party. Bolsonaro served seven consecutive terms, from 1991 to 2018. He has been affiliated with several other Brazilian political parties over the years.

[[File:Protesto pró-Bolsonaro em Londres.jpg|thumb|left|Bolsonaro supporters in London, 7{{nbsp}}October 2018]]
According to political pundits, early in the campaign, Bolsonaro moderated his tone, taking a less aggressive and confrontational style. Economically, he started to support the idea of less government intervention in the economy (in contrast to what he had stated in the past, when he defended [[Developmentalism|developmentalists]] policies). On the other hand, he maintained his tough stance on crime and his defense of "traditional family values".<ref>{{cite news|title= Bolsonaro modera discurso econômico em aceno ao mercado|url= https://istoe.com.br/bolsonaro-modera-discurso-economico-em-aceno-ao-mercado/|work= Isto É magazine|access-date= 7 September 2018|language= pt|archive-date= 7 September 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180907183206/https://istoe.com.br/bolsonaro-modera-discurso-economico-em-aceno-ao-mercado/|url-status= dead}}</ref> Bolsonaro also said he planned to cut [[Taxation in Brazil|taxes]] across the board, particularly on inheritances and businesses, in order to generate growth and tackle unemployment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bolsonaro quer menos fiscal em empresas e nenhum imposto sobre herança|url=https://www.valor.com.br/politica/5574761/bolsonaro-quer-menos-fiscal-em-empresas-e-nenhum-imposto-sobre-heranca|work=Valor Econômico|access-date=7 September 2018|language=pt|archive-date=9 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909073835/https://www.valor.com.br/politica/5574761/bolsonaro-quer-menos-fiscal-em-empresas-e-nenhum-imposto-sobre-heranca|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also promised more [[austerity]] measures and cuts in government spending, but had difficulty naming the areas where he would make these cuts.

The first round of the election occurred on 7{{nbsp}}October 2018. Bolsonaro finished in first place with 46% of the popular vote (or 49.2 million people).

After the first round, when his victory looked certain, Bolsonaro gave a speech by videolink to thousands of supporters who gathered at Paulista Avenue, in São Paulo. In the speech, he threatened to arrest, purge or kill "reds" and "petralhas" (a derogatory term for Worker's Party's members), and promised that members of the social movements [[Landless Workers' Movement|MST]] and [[Homeless Workers' Movement|MTST]] would be treated as "terrorists". He said: "This time, the clean-up will be even greater. This group ["reds"], if they want to stay, will have to abide by our laws{{nbsp}}... These red outlaws will be banned from our homeland.

During the campaign, academics repeatedly raised concerns on the consequences of Bolsonaro's rise for the Brazilian democracy. Writing for the news magazine ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', [[Federico Finchelstein]], a historian at the [[New School for Social Research]] who specializes in fascism, said: "Bolsonaro's vocabulary recalls the rhetoric behind Nazi policies of persecution and victimization. But does sounding like a Nazi make him a Nazi? Insomuch as he believes in holding elections, he is not there yet. However, things could change quickly if he gains power."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/05/bolsonaros-model-its-goebbels-fascism-nazism-brazil-latin-america-populism-argentina-venezuela/|title=Jair Bolsonaro's Model Isn't Berlusconi.

Another highly controversial aspect of the campaign was the alleged use of illegal digital communication strategies by some of Bolsonaro's most important financial supporters.

Bolsonaro is an open admirer of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]. During Bolsonaro's campaign, some observers saw similarities between the Brazilian president-elect and the U.S. president's ideals, hardline attacks and a reputation for incendiary rhetoric, as well as social media presence. Because of this, Bolsonaro has been called the Brazilian equivalent of Trump or the "Trump of the Tropics".<ref name="Foreign Staff">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/29/brazils-president-elect-jair-bolsonaro-really-trump-tropics/|author=Foreign Staff|date=2018-10-29|title=Why Brazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro really is the 'Trump of the Tropics'|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=18 December 2018|archive-date=18 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218102259/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/29/brazils-president-elect-jair-bolsonaro-really-trump-tropics/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Views on the Brazilian military dictatorship ===

Throughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made several admiring comments about the U.S.–supported [[Brazilian military regime|Brazilian military dictatorship]] which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. He said in 1993, eight years after the return of democracy, that the military regime had "led to a more sustainable and prosperous Brazil".<ref name="nyt" /> Bolsonaro has publicly referred to the military dictatorship as a "glorious" period in Brazil's history,<ref name="R7.com">{{Cite news|url=https://noticias.r7.com/brasil/bolsonaro-chama-ditadura-militar-brasileira-de-intervencao-democratica-31032015|title=Bolsonaro chama ditadura militar brasileira de "intervenção democrática"|date=2015-03-31|work=R7.com|access-date=2018-09-13|language=pt-BR|archive-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005123054/https://noticias.r7.com/brasil/bolsonaro-chama-ditadura-militar-brasileira-de-intervencao-democratica-31032015|url-status=live}}</ref> and that under the military dictatorship, Brazil enjoyed "20 years of order and progress".<ref name="R7.com"/> In December 2008, Bolsonaro said that "the error of the dictatorship was that it tortured, but did not kill".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jovempanfm.uol.com.br/panico/defensor-da-ditadura-jair-bolsonaro-reforca-frase-polemica-o-erro-foi-torturar-e-nao-matar.html|title=Defensor da Ditadura, Jair Bolsonaro reforça frase polêmica: "o erro foi torturar e não matar" - Pânico - Jovem Pan FM São Paulo 100.9|website=Jovem Pan FM|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-09-13|date=2016-07-08|archive-date=4 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904101345/http://jovempanfm.uol.com.br/panico/defensor-da-ditadura-jair-bolsonaro-reforca-frase-polemica-o-erro-foi-torturar-e-nao-matar.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bolsonaro has also repeatedly made admiring comments about a number of other Latin American dictatorships. He praised Peruvian president [[Alberto Fujimori]] as a role model for his use of military intervention via [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|self-coup]] against the judiciary and legislature.<ref name="nyt" /> In a 1998 interview with ''Veja'' magazine, Bolsonaro praised the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chilean dictatorship]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]], and said the Pinochet regime, which killed over 3,000 Chilean citizens, "should have killed more people".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/especial/noticias/as-frases-polemicas-de-jair-bolsonaro/|title=As frases polêmicas de Jair Bolsonaro|date=2017-08-05|work=Congresso em Foco|access-date=2018-09-13|language=pt-BR|archive-date=10 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910170238/https://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/especial/noticias/as-frases-polemicas-de-jair-bolsonaro/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, Bolsonaro said that [[Hugo Chávez]] represented "hope for Latin America", comments that became a matter of controversy during the 2018 campaign, when Bolsonaro presented himself as a harsh critic of ''[[Chavismo]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,entrevista-de-bolsonaro-ao-estado-com-elogios-a-chavez-mobiliza-militancia,70002117151|title=Entrevista de Bolsonaro ao 'Estado' com elogios a Chávez mobiliza militância - Política|website=Estadão|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-date=27 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085902/https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,entrevista-de-bolsonaro-ao-estado-com-elogios-a-chavez-mobiliza-militancia,70002117151|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, already in power, Bolsonaro commended Paraguayan dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]] as a "visionary" and "statesman", drawing immediate criticism, particularly due to multiple allegations of [[pedophilia]] against Stroessner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/02/26/internacional/1551213499_127441.html|title=Bolsonaro elogia ditador paraguaio Alfredo Stroessner em público|first=Santi|last=Carneri|date=27 February 2019|website=Brasil.elpais.com|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-date=27 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227144247/https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/02/26/internacional/1551213499_127441.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://epoca.globo.com/7-fatos-sobre-ditador-e-pedofilo-reiterado-elogiado-por-bolsonaro-23486277|title=7 fatos sobre o ditador — e pedófilo reiterado — elogiado por Bolsonaro|date=27 February 2019|website=Epoca.globo.com|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-date=9 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309000559/https://epoca.globo.com/7-fatos-sobre-ditador-e-pedofilo-reiterado-elogiado-por-bolsonaro-23486277|url-status=live}}</ref>

Ustra had headed the [[DOI-CODI]] torture unit where Rousseff was allegedly tortured during the military dictatorship.

In a TV interview with ''Câmera Aberta'' in the 1990s, Bolsonaro said that if he ever became President, he would use this as an opportunity to shut down the National Congress and instigate a military coup himself. {{as of|2018}}, he appeared to have changed his mind, and said that if someone becomes the head of the country, it would be through voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/06/1970871-congressman-bolsonaro-defended-new-military-coup-in-the-1990s.shtml|title=Folha de S.Paulo – Internacional – En – Brazil – Congressman Bolsonaro Defended New Military Coup in the 1990s – 04/06/2018|website=1.folha.uol.com.br|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612165428/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/06/1970871-congressman-bolsonaro-defended-new-military-coup-in-the-1990s.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

During a conversation with journalists in July 2019, Bolsonaro lashed out at European leaders, saying that the Amazon belongs to Brazil and European countries can mind their own business because they have already "destroyed their environment". He also said: "We preserve more [rainforest] than anyone.

During the [[2019 Brazil wildfires]], Bolsonaro in August 2019 accused (without providing any evidence) that non-governmental organizations had started the forest fires, due to a reduction of government funding to the NGOs. Environmental and climate experts described Bolsonaro's accusation as a "smokescreen" to hide his own government's rolling back of protections for the Amazon. They instead attributed the fires to farmers clearing land.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simões |first1=Eduardo |last2=Boadle |first2=Anthony |last3=Mano |first3=Ana |last4=Stargardter |first4=Gabriel |last5=Brown |first5=Tom |last6=O'Brien |first6=Rosalba |title=Igniting global outrage, Brazil's Bolsonaro baselessly blames NGOs for Amazon fires |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-idUSKCN1VB1BY |website=[[Reuters]] |access-date=August 23, 2019 |date=August 21, 2019 |archive-date=23 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823071421/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-idUSKCN1VB1BY |url-status=live }}</ref>

During a Congressional debate, Bolsonaro said that minors should be treated as adults if they commit heinous crimes such as murder or rape, to which Maria do Rosário responded by calling him a "rapist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/reinaldo/geral/e-chegada-a-hora-de-dar-um-basta-as-bocalidades-de-bolsonaro-hoje-o-mais-importante-aliado-da-esquerda-bocal-ambos-se-alimentam-e-se-merecem/|title=É chegada a hora de dar um "Basta!" às boçalidades de Bolsonaro, hoje o mais importante aliado da esquerda boçal: ambos se alimentam e se merecem!|website=Reinaldo Azevedo – VEJA.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1559815-para-rebater-deputada-bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-a-estupraria.shtml|title=Para rebater deputada, Bolsonaro diz que não a 'estupraria'|website=Márcio Falcão e Gabriela Guerreiro – Folha de São Paulo|access-date=1 August 2018|archive-date=16 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616180508/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/12/1559815-para-rebater-deputada-bolsonaro-diz-que-nao-a-estupraria.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/brasil/politica/bolsonaro-sobre-ataque-a-deputada-me-acusou-de-estuprador,36ba9a143643a410VgnVCM5000009ccceb0aRCRD.html|title=Bolsonaro sobre ataque a deputada: "me acusou de estuprador" |website=André Naddeo – Terra}}</ref> Bolsonaro then stated that Congresswoman Rosário was "not worth raping; she is very ugly".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/18/brazilian-congressman-rape-remark-compensation|title=Brazilian congressman ordered to pay compensation over rape remark|last=Paulo|first=AP in São|date=2015-09-18|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16|archive-date=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916130946/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/18/brazilian-congressman-rape-remark-compensation|url-status=live}}</ref> The remarks drew considerable condemnation throughout Brazil.

=== Views on homosexuality ===
[[File:Parada gay 2011 - bonecos dilma e bolsonaro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gay Pride]] parade in São Paulo, June 2011]]

In a June 2011 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Bolsonaro said that "I would be incapable of loving a gay son", and added that he would prefer any gay son of his "to die in an accident".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/bolsonaro-quotprefiro-filho-morto-em-acidente-a-um-homossexualquot,cf89cc00a90ea310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|title=Bolsonaro: "prefiro filho morto em acidente a um homossexual"|work=Terra|access-date=2 June 2018|language=pt-BR|archive-date=25 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925084333/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/bolsonaro-quotprefiro-filho-morto-em-acidente-a-um-homossexualquot,cf89cc00a90ea310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In the same interview, Bolsonaro said that if a gay couple moved in next door to him, it would lower the market value of his house. In a July 2011 interview with the magazine ''Época,'' Bolsonaro said that he would "fight to prevent the distribution of the 'gay kit'" [a set of guidelines proposed by [[UNESCO]] to promote the rights of the LGBT community in primary schools] because "their intention is to promote homosexuality, which is an affront to the family structure, and if that makes me prejudiced, then I'm prejudiced and very proud of it".<ref name="epoca2"/> In the 2013 BBC documentary ''Out There'', by British actor [[Stephen Fry]], Bolsonaro said that "no father is ever proud of having a gay son," and that "we Brazilians do not like homosexuals."<ref>{{cite AV media|last=novoiluminismo|title=Entrevista – Jair Bolsonaro e Angélica Ivo [ORIGINAL]|date=17 October 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TiqyO5JQZs|access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>

In a 2011 interview with ''Jornal de Notícias'', Bolsonaro linked homosexuality to [[pedophilia]], claiming that "many of the children who are adopted by gay couples will be abused by these couples". He further argued that Brazil does not need legislation specifically targeting homophobia, because "most homosexuals are murdered by their respective pimps at hours when good citizens are already asleep".<ref>{{cite web|first=Pedro Henrique|last=Fonseca|url=https://www.jn.pt/brasil/interior/deputado-bolsonaro-diz-que-governo-transforma-gays-numa-classe-privilegiada-1879387.html|title=Deputado Bolsonaro diz que Governo transforma gays numa classe privilegiada|website=Jornal de Notícias|date=21 June 2011|access-date=7 September 2018|archive-date=12 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812114615/https://www.jn.pt/brasil/interior/deputado-bolsonaro-diz-que-governo-transforma-gays-numa-classe-privilegiada-1879387.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In a May 2002 interview with the ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', Bolsonaro told the newspaper, "If I see two men kissing in the street, I will beat them." He then publicly defended beating gay children by saying: "If your child starts to become like that, a little gay, you take a whip and you change their behavior."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/cotidian/ff2611201025.htm|title=Folha de S.Paulo – Câmara: Palmada muda filho "gayzinho", declara deputado federal – 26/11/2010|website=1.folha.uol.com.br|access-date=3 June 2018|archive-date=25 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925084342/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/cotidian/ff2611201025.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a video interview for ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' with [[Elliot Page]], an openly [[lesbian]] actress at the time, Page asked Bolsonaro if he thinks he should have been beaten as a child, in response to his public statements that gay children should be beaten. In response, Bolsonaro said to Page, "You are very nice. If I were a cadet in the military academy and saw you on the street, I would whistle at you. All right? You are very pretty."<ref name="advocate.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.advocate.com/world/2016/3/12/watch-ellen-page-confronts-brazils-biggest-homophobe-gaycation|title=WATCH: Ellen Page Confronts Brazil's Biggest Homophobe on 'Gaycation'|date=12 March 2016|access-date=10 June 2018|language=en|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143655/https://www.advocate.com/world/2016/3/12/watch-ellen-page-confronts-brazils-biggest-homophobe-gaycation|url-status=live}}</ref> Bolsonaro added, "Over time, due to liberal habits, drugs, with women also working, the number of homosexuals has really increased."<ref name="advocate.com" />

On 9 November 2017, the Court of Justice for the State of Rio de Janeiro sentenced Bolsonaro to pay a fine of R$150,000 for [[hate speech]] because of televised comments he made in 2011 to the [[Custe o Que Custar|''CQC'' TV program]], when Bolsonaro stated that "there is no risk" of his family producing a homosexual child because his children had a "good education". Judge Luciana Teixeira said that the deputy had abused his right of free expression to commit a wrongful act. "You cannot deliberately attack and humiliate, ignoring the principles of equality, just because you invoke freedom of expression," said the judge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/11/1934062-bolsonaro-e-condenado-a-pagar-r-150-mil-por-declaracoes-contra-gays.shtml|title=Bolsonaro é condenado a pagar R$ 150 mil por declarações contra gays|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-09-11|archive-date=2 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002122427/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/11/1934062-bolsonaro-e-condenado-a-pagar-r-150-mil-por-declaracoes-contra-gays.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, on 11 January 2016, when he began to present himself as a pre-candidate to the [[Presidency of Brazil]], Bolsonaro began to moderate his discourse on gay people by publishing a video on his official YouTube channel:

<blockquote>I have nothing to do with anyone's behavior. If the man and the woman later decide to live with their partner, to form a couple, to live with a same-sex person, go and be happy. But we cannot admit that, by our omission in the Parliament, children become homosexuals in the future, or have such homosexual behavior in the future, by the influence of school. That is inadmissible.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbiNDU3ztyw |publisher = Jair Bolsonaro |type = canal oficial |title = Homofobia? |access-date = 1 November 2018 |archive-date = 7 October 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181007200813/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbiNDU3ztyw&gl=US&hl=en |url-status = live }}</ref>

Since then, Bolsonaro claims he has nothing against gays and that he fights only the "gay kit" in schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/07/bolsonaro-se-diz-vitima-de-noticias-falsas-mas-recorre-a-fakes-sobre-seu-proprio-passado.shtml |title=Bolsonaro se diz vítima de notícias falsas, mas recorre a 'fakes' sobre seu próprio passado |publisher=Folha de S.

<blockquote>Each person, after a certain age, owner of their acts, will take care of their life. For six-year-old children, it cannot be.

That same month, shortly before the first round of the Brazilian presidential elections, he said: "We are going to make a government for everybody. For gays, and some gays are fathers, who are mothers. It is a work for everyone".<ref name="noticias.uol.com.br"/> After being elected president, when asked by [[William Bonner (newscaster)|William Bonner]] in the ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' about what he would say to those who are more prejudiced and aggressive against gays, Bolsonaro replied: "The aggression against a fellow man has to be punished in the way of law.

=== Views on political violence ===
[[File:Plenário do Senado (24998818073).jpg|thumb|upright|Bolsonaro visits the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]], March 2016.]]

On multiple occasions, Bolsonaro has publicly endorsed physical violence as a legitimate and necessary form of political action. In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of "changing" Brazil was by "killing thirty thousand people, beginning with [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]" (then President of Brazil).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/o-dia-que-bolsonaro-quis-matar-fhc-sonegar-impostos-e-declarar-guerra-civil-8mtm0u0so6pk88kqnqo0n1l69|title=Bolsonaro sincero quis matar FHC e sonegar impostos|website=Gazeta do Povo|access-date=9 March 2019|archive-date=4 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404184459/https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/o-dia-que-bolsonaro-quis-matar-fhc-sonegar-impostos-e-declarar-guerra-civil-8mtm0u0so6pk88kqnqo0n1l69/|url-status=live}}</ref> During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in [[Acre (state)|Acre]] that the local "petralhas" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be "shot"; according to his aides, the statement was a "joke".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/campanha-confirma-video-em-que-bolsonaro-fala-em-fuzilar-petralhada-do-acre-foi-brincadeira-23033857|title=Campanha confirma vídeo em que Bolsonaro fala em 'fuzilar petralhada do Acre': 'Foi brincadeira'|date=3 September 2018|website=O Globo|access-date=9 March 2019|archive-date=20 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320122344/https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/campanha-confirma-video-em-que-bolsonaro-fala-em-fuzilar-petralhada-do-acre-foi-brincadeira-23033857|url-status=live}}</ref> One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration "petralhas" and "reds" (i.e. leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the "corner of the beach", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] were murdered.<ref name="uol.com.br"/>

In 1999, talking about [[Chico Lopes]], a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank who invoked his right to remain silent during a Congress hearing, Bolsonaro declared himself in favour of torture in this sort of situation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2018/07/31/bolsonaro-roda-viva/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228185717/https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2018/07/31/bolsonaro-roda-viva/ |archive-date=28 December 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Asked about this phrase years later, Bolsonaro said: "Ask the father of a kidnapped child what he would like him to do to discover [where the kid is].

=== Birth control for the poor ===
Bolsonaro provoked considerable controversy for public remarks made in July 2008, where he proposed to provide poor people with birth control methods, who he suggested might be too uneducated to understand family planning education. Bolsonaro said:

<blockquote>I wish Brazil had a family planning program. It's not even worthy to talk about education when most of these [poor] people are not prepared to receive education, therefore they won't educate themselves. Only rigid birth control can save us from chaos. An educated man and woman will hardly desire an extra child with the sole purpose of engaging in a social welfare assistance program [as it is nowadays]. We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies|Chamber]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Família]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring. Because we [as upper-middle class] can control ours. Poor people don't control [theirs].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opovo.com.br/noticias/politica/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-como-forma-de-combater-miseria-e-crim.html|title=Bolsonaro defendeu esterilização de pobres como forma de combater miséria e criminalidade|last=Online|first=O POVO|website=Opovo.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111031/https://www.opovo.com.br/noticias/politica/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-como-forma-de-combater-miseria-e-crim.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-stabbing-video-president-candidate-juiz-de-fora-minas-gerais-a8526726.html|title='Brazil's Donald Trump' critically injured in presidential campaign rally stabbing|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB|archive-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916101510/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-stabbing-video-president-candidate-juiz-de-fora-minas-gerais-a8526726.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2018-06-14-forced-sterilisation-of-brazilian-woman-sparks-uproar/|title='Forced' sterilisation of Brazilian woman sparks uproar|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US|archive-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916093516/https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2018-06-14-forced-sterilisation-of-brazilian-woman-sparks-uproar/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-de-pobres-para-combater-miseria-e-crime.shtml|title=Bolsonaro defendeu esterilização de pobres para combater miséria e crime|date=2018-06-11|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-10-18|language=pt-BR|archive-date=18 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018201612/https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-de-pobres-para-combater-miseria-e-crime.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>
