==Murder of Stephen Lawrence==
{{main|Murder of Stephen Lawrence}}

Following the murder of their son Stephen in 1993, Doreen and Neville Lawrence claimed that the [[Metropolitan Police]] investigation was not being conducted in a professional manner, citing incompetence and racism as prime flaws.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/110842.stm|title=Lawrence mother calls police 'racist'|work=BBC News|date= 11 June 1998|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> In 1999, after years of campaigning, and with the support of many in the community, the media<ref>Hoge, Warren (18 February 1997), [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/18/world/racial-killing-bursts-a-british-press-taboo.html "Racial Killing Bursts a British Press Taboo"], ''The New York Times'',</ref> and politics, a wide-ranging judicial inquiry was established by [[Jack Straw]], the [[Home Secretary]]. Chaired by [[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William MacPherson]], the inquiry was to investigate the circumstances of Stephen Lawrence's death. The public inquiry was the subject of intense media interest which became international when it concluded that the Metropolitan Police was "[[Institutional Racism|institutionally racist]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm|title=The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry|publisher=Archive.official-documents.co.uk|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> and that this was one of the primary causes of their failure to solve the case.

==Public life==
In the aftermath of the inquiry, Lawrence continued to campaign for justice for her son as well as for other victims of [[racism|racist]] crime.
