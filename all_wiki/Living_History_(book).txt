'''''Living History''''' is a 2003 [[memoir]] by [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]. It was written when she was a sitting [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Background and writing==
In December 2000, [[Simon & Schuster]] agreed to pay Clinton a reported $8 million advance for what became ''Living History''â€”a near-record figure to an author for an advance at that time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE2DD1739F935A25751C1A9669C8B63 | title= Hillary Clinton Book Advance, $8 Million, Is Near Record | author=David D. Kirkpatrick | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2000-12-16 | accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>   Critics charged that the book deal, coming soon after her election to the U.S. Senate, but before being sworn into office, was not in adherence to the ethical standards required for members of the U.S. Senate.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/12/19/clinton/index.html | title=Hillary's book deal blues | author=Anthony York | work=[[Salon.com]] | date=2000-12-19 | accessdate=2007-07-13 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223214333/http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/12/19/clinton/index.html | archivedate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> However, in February 2001, the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Senate Ethics Committee]] gave Clinton approval for the deal.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/15/politics/main272221.shtml | title=Hillary Deal Clears Ethics Panel | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher= [[CBS News]] | date=2001-02-15 | accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Clinton reportedly used three ghostwriters for ''Living History'': veteran ghostwriter [[Maryanne Vollers]], speechwriter [[Alison Muscatine]], and researcher [[Ruby Shamir]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reason.com/links/links061703.shtml | title=Living Hillary | author=Charles Paul Freund | magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | date=2003-06-17 | accessdate=2007-07-13 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024213408/http://www.reason.com/links/links061703.shtml | archivedate=2006-10-24 }}</ref>  Muscatine later related how the three would meet at Clinton's house early in the morning before she left for the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]], do a day's worth of writing, and then meet again after midnight at Clinton's for the senator to edit the work until three o'clock in the morning.<ref name="elle-2012">{{cite news | url=http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Society-Career-Power/At-the-Pinnacle-of-Hillary-Clinton-s-Career | title=At the Pinnacle of Hillary Clinton's Career | author=Rachael Combe | magazine=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] | date=2012-04-05 | accessdate=2012-06-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522024829/http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Society-Career-Power/At-the-Pinnacle-of-Hillary-Clinton-s-Career | archivedate=2012-05-22 }}</ref>  Clinton's acknowledgment section stated: "This book may not have taken a village to write, but it certainly took a superb team ... The smartest decision I made was to ask Lissa Muscatine, Maryanne Vollers and Ruby Shamir to spend two years of their lives working with me. Lissa [was] responsible for many of the words in my speeches as First Lady and in this book ... Maryanne [has] the rare gift of understanding how to help another's voice emerge ... Ruby [had the job of] amassing, reviewing and synthesizing millions of words written about me."<ref>''Living History'', p. 529.</ref>
However, the three women did not receive co-writing credit on the book's cover.  This is not unusual for political autobiographies, but in the same period some other political figures were given co-writing credit, as for instance fellow Senator [[John Edwards]] gave to writer [[John Auchard]] on his book ''Four Trials'' and fellow Senator [[John McCain]] gave to administrative assistant [[Mark Salter]] on his books ''[[Faith of My Fathers]]'', ''[[Worth the Fighting For]]'', ''[[Why Courage Matters]]'', and ''[[Character Is Destiny]]''.

==Critical and commercial reception==
Reviews of ''Living History'' were mixed,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/09/tucker.shoe/ | title=Hillary Clinton has sweet revenge | author=Sean Loughlin | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=2003-07-09 | accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> with a typical evaluation commending the chapters describing her early life, decrying the overly lengthy later treatments of relatively mundane events as First Lady, and criticizing the lack of candor in the sections covering controversial episodes, including those surrounding her husband and the [[Lewinsky scandal]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.yalereviewofbooks.com/archive/summer03/review14.shtml.htm | title=Hillary's Turn | author=Hilary Hammell | periodical=[[Yale Review of Books]] | date=Spring 2004 | accessdate=2008-01-11 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128004352/http://www.yalereviewofbooks.com/archive/summer03/review14.shtml.htm | archivedate=2008-01-28 }}</ref>  Observers later noted the difference in how Clinton portrayed her upbringing with [[Carl Bernstein]]'s profile of Clinton's father [[Hugh Rodham (born 1911)|Hugh Rodham]] in his 2007 book ''[[A Woman in Charge]]''.<ref name="elle-2012"/> Bernstein also wrote in ''A Woman in Charge'', "It is an understatement by now that [Clinton] has been known to apprehend truths about herself and the events of her life that others do not exactly share. ''Living History'' is an example of that."<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernstein, Carl|title=A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton|url=https://archive.org/details/womaninchargelif00bern|url-access=registration|place=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

The book sold more than one million copies in the first month following publication;<ref name="nyt071003">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D8133DF933A25754C0A9659C8B63 | title= Senator Clinton Offers a Cure For Foot-in-Mouth Disease | author=Michael Wilson | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2003-07-10 | accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> its sales during its first week of availability set a record for a non-fiction book.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2003-06-17-hillary-list_x.htm | title=Clinton memoir tops Best-Selling Books list | author=Deirdre Donahue | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=2003-06-17 | accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>  The success of the book surprised many in the publishing industry, who thought Simon & Schuster had overpaid for the work.<ref name="nyt072603">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E6D8103FF935A15754C0A9659C8B63 | title= Author Clinton Shakes Many Hands and Sells Many Books | author=David D. Kirkpatrick | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2003-07-26 | accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> It also surprised pundits who had doubted her selling power, including [[CNN]]'s [[Tucker Carlson]], who had said, "If they sell a million copies of this book, I'll eat my shoes and my tie. I will."<ref name="nyt071003"/>  (Once past the million mark, Clinton appeared on Carlson's show to present him with a shoe-shaped [[chocolate cake]].<ref name="nyt071003"/>)  Clinton's energetic promotion of the book, which included signing an estimated 20,000 copies (causing her to require ice and wrist support treatments), was credited for part of the success.<ref name="nyt072603"/>  By 2007, she had earned over $10 million from the book.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7331834.stm | title=Clintons' earnings exceed $100m | work=[[BBC News]] | date=2008-04-05 | accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

==Audio recording==
Clinton's audio recording of ''Living History'' earned her a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Album]] category in 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3472495.stm | title=Gorbachev and Clinton win Grammy | work=[[BBC News]] | date=2004-02-09 | accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>

==Paperback edition==
A paperback edition was released in April 2004 with an additional short afterword in which Clinton described her experiences in doing book signing events.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-04-06-living-history-addition_x.htm | title=Hillary Clinton writes new afterword for paperback of 'Living History' | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper= [[USA Today]] | date=2004-04-06 | accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>
