{{British Royal Family}}{{PoliticsUK}}

The '''British royal family''' comprises [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and her close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.

Those who at the time are entitled to the [[style (manner of address)|style]] [[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness (HRH)]], and any styled [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty (HM)]], are normally considered members, including those so styled before the beginning of the current monarch's reign. By this criterion, a list of the current royal family will usually include the monarch, the children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, the children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]], and all of their current or widowed spouses.

Some members of the royal family have official residences named as the places from which announcements are made in the [[Court Circular]] about official engagements they have carried out. The state duties and staff of some members of the royal family are funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which is fully refunded by the Queen to the Treasury.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm Sovereign Grant Act: main provisions]</ref>

Since 1917, when [[King George V]] changed the name of the royal house from [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], members of the royal family have belonged, either by birth or by marriage, to the [[House of Windsor]]. Senior titled members of the royal family do not usually use a [[surname]], although since 1960 [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], incorporating [[Prince Philip]]'s adopted surname of [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]], has been prescribed as a surname for Elizabeth II's direct descendants who do not have royal styles and titles, and it has sometimes been used when required for those who do have such titles. The royal family are regarded as British [[cultural icon]]s, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people who they most associated with [[British culture]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Culture, attraction and soft power|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/as-others-see-us-report.pdf|publisher=British Council|date=12 December 2016}}</ref>

==Status==
On 30 November 1917, King George V issued [[letters patent]] defining the styles and titles of members of the royal family; the text of the notice from the ''[[The London Gazette|London Gazette]]'' is:<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30428 |date=14 December 1917 |page=13086 }}</ref>

{{quote|''Whitehall'', 11''th December'', 1917.<br />
:The KING has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], bearing date the 30th ultimo, to define the styles and titles to be borne henceforth by members of the royal family.  It is declared by the Letters Patent that the children of any Sovereign of the United Kingdom and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour; that save as aforesaid the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked; and that the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes.}}

In 1996, Queen Elizabeth II modified these letters patent, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54510 |date=30 August 1996 |page=11603 |nolink=yes }}</ref>

{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm dated 21st August 1996, to declare that a former wife (other than a widow until she shall remarry) of a son of a Sovereign of these Realms, of a son of a son of a Sovereign and of the eldest living son of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales shall not be entitled to hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness.}}

On 31 December 2012, letters patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the royal family to additional persons to be born, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |date=8 January 2013 |page=213 |nolink=yes }}</ref>

{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] dated 31 December 2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.}}

Members and relatives of the British royal family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the [[British Empire]], sometimes for extended periods as [[viceroy]]s, or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a [[Counsellor of State]], two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) if the monarch is indisposed or abroad. In the other countries of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State, although they may perform ceremonial and social duties on behalf of individual states or the organisation.

The Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren, hold places in the first sections of the official [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|orders of precedence in England and Wales]], [[Order of precedence in Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Order of precedence in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the royal family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Davies|first = Caroline|date =  24 December 2005|title = First royal Sandringham Christmas for Camilla|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506237/First-royal-Sandringham-Christmas-for-Camilla.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last = Eden|first = Richard|date =  24 June 2012|title = The Queen tells the Duchess of Cambridge to curtsy to the 'blood princesses'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9351571/The-Queen-tells-the-Duchess-of-Cambridge-to-curtsy-to-the-blood-princesses.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses, such as the daughters of her younger sons.

== Public role ==
The British royal family support [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her state and national duties. Each year the family "carries out over 2,000 official engagements throughout the UK and worldwide".<ref name=role/> Engagements include state funerals, national festivities, garden parties, receptions, and visits to the Armed Forces.<ref name=role>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/role-royal-family|title=The role of the Royal Family|date=2016-03-23|website=The Royal Family|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref>

Given the British royal family's public role and activities, it is sometimes referred to by courtiers as "The Firm",<ref name="msn2020">{{cite news |title=Harry and Meghan crisis: Royal showdown looms |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/harry-and-meghan-crisis-royal-showdown-looms/ar-BBYSlKf |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=MSN |date=12 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="ogara">{{cite news |last1=O'Gara |first1=Eilish |title=Financing the firm: how the royal family make their money |url=https://www.newsweek.com/financing-firm-how-royal-family-make-their-money-328393 |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=Newsweek |date=12 June 2015 |language=en}}</ref> a term attributed to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Junor |first1=Penny |title=The Firm: The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor |date=2014 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=9780007393336 |edition=Newition}}</ref><ref name="shirmsley">{{cite news |last1=Shirmsley |first1=Robert |title=Royals to royalties: the Firm is in business |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e31c28ac-a341-11e0-8d6d-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=Financial Times |date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

==In other Commonwealth realms==
As the royal family is shared by other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, its members will often also conduct official and non-official duties outside the United Kingdom, on behalf of the relevant state.
