'''South Shore''' is one of 77 defined [[community areas of Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. A predominantly [[African-American neighborhood]] on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], the area is named for its location along the city's southern [[Lake Michigan|lakefront]]. Although South Shore has seen a greater than 40% decrease in residents since Chicago's population peaked in the 1950s, the area remains one of the most densely populated neighborhoods on the South Side.<ref>http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Chicagos-Most-Depopulated-Neighborhoods--205968891.html</ref> The community benefits from its location along the waterfront, its accessibility to [[Lake Shore Drive]], and its proximity to major institutions and attractions such as the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]], and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]].

==History==
Like all of what is now the City of Chicago, what is now the South Shore community area was inhabited by a number of [[Algonquian peoples]], including the [[Mascouten]] and [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Quaife|first=Milo M.|title=Checagou: From Indian Wigwam to Modern City, 1673–1835|year=1933|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill|oclc=1865758}}</ref> After the expulsion of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] by white settlers in the nineteenth century, became characterized by small settlements; Essex, Bryn Mawr, Parkside, Cheltenham Beach, and Windsor Park.<ref name="Bungalow District">{{cite web|last=Ramsey|first=Emily|others=for the Historic Chicago Bungalow Association|title=NRHP Registration Form: South Shore Bungalow Historic District|date=March 19, 2008|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=November 29, 2019|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223477.pdf}}</ref> The area, bounded by 67th and 79th streets to the north and south and by Stony Island Avenue and Lake Michigan to the west and east, was mostly swampland in the 1850s when Ferdinand Rohn, a German [[market garden|truck farmer]], utilized trails along the area's high ground to transport his goods to Chicago.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 1861, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] incorporated [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]], which included South Shore.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/531.html|accessdate=July 19, 2007|year=2005|encyclopedia=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Orum, Anthony|title=Governing the Metropolis}}</ref> The area's population grew as workers in the nearby steel industry settled in the area.<ref name="Bungalow District"/> Following the June 29, 1889 elections, the South Shore community area was annexed into the City of Chicago with the entirety of Hyde Park Township.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/53.html|title=Annexation|encyclopedia=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=September 8, 2008|year=2005|author=Cain, Louis P.}}</ref> The location of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in nearby Jackson Park prompted the sale of land and building lots. As in other parts of Chicago, the desire for affordable housing at the start of the twentieth century led to the large scale construction of [[bungalows]]. Unlike other areas in which bungalows were built en masse, South Shore's bungalow residents were largely affluent. Additionally, Shore Shore was the destination for [[white flight]] from [[Washington Park (community area), Chicago|Washington Park]] as immigrants and African Americans moved there.<ref name="Bungalow District"/>

After racially restrictive covenants were declared unconstitutional by ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', African American families began to move out of the overcrowded black neighborhoods into South Shore.<ref name="Bungalow District"/> The South Shore Commission initiated a program they called "managed integration", designed to check the physical decline of the community and to achieve racial balance. The initiative was largely unsuccessful on both counts. Per the 1950 census, South Shore had 79,000 residents and was 96% white with a large Jewish population. In 1960, the population had fallen to 73,000 people and was 90% White and 10% black.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other white residents chose to resist this change through violence against African Americans who chose to move to the neighborhood.<ref name="Bungalow District"/> By 1970, the population had risen to 81,000 and was 69% black and 28% white. By 1980, the population had fallen slightly to 78,000, but was 94% black.<ref name="Bungalow District"/>

By the late 1990s South Shore had developed into a middle-class African American community. Although the commercial strips on 71st and 75th still struggled, developers built a shopping plaza at 71st and Jeffery which is relatively successful.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The cultural life of the area has been enhanced since the Park District purchased the waning South Shore Country Club in 1972, converting it into a cultural center.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} South Shore remains a destination for some who desire a congenial middle-class community on Chicago's South Side.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The South Shore Current Magazine was launched with a mission to share the "Good News from Chicago's Cultural Soul Coast." The masthead reads: "Thriving as a catalyst for economic development, reflecting a truthful image, and a virtual meeting place for the South Shore Community."{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

On July 14, 2018, the community clashed with the [[Chicago Police Department]] after a local barber, Harith Augustus, was shot multiple times by a police officer at 71st Street and Chappel Avenue. Body camera footage without audio was released immediately contrary to past practices of months-long waits for video in other police shootings. Footage taken by body cameras of other officers has not been released.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/15/us/chicago-officer-involved-shooting-protests/</ref><ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/harith-augustus-vigil-south-shorter-police-shooting/</ref><ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-fatal-police-shooting-videos-augustus-20180717-story.html</ref>

===Jackson Park Highlands===
{{main|Jackson Park Highlands District}}
The Jackson Park Highlands District is a sixteen block area bounded by East 67th Street on the north. East 71st Street on the south, South Cregier Avenue on the west, and South Jeffrey Boulevard on the east.<ref name="JPH Landmark Designation">{{cite web|last=McLenahan|first=William|title=Designation of Jackson Park Highlands District as Chicago Landmark|date=October 25, 1989|accessdate=November 29, 2019|work=Chicago City Council Journal of Proceedings|pages=5929–5934|url=https://chicityclerk.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/document_uploads/journals-proceedings/1989/102589_optimize.pdf}}</ref>

The Jackson Park Highlands District is a historic district in the South Shore community area of Chicago. The district was built in 1905 by various architects. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on October 25, 1989.<ref name="JPH Landmark Designation"/> It is regarded as one of the South Side's upper-middle to affluent neighborhoods; others being Hyde Park, Kenwood, Bridgeport, Beverly, Mount Greenwood, and the western section of Morgan Park, and parts of Chatham.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Jackson Park Highlands has homes that feature large front yard setbacks and lots {{convert|50|ft}} wide.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The area takes its name from a ridge that formerly overlooked Jackson Park.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Architectural styles represented in this district include American Foursquare, [[neoclassical architecture|Classical Revival]], [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]], [[Colonial architecture#Dutch colonial architecture|Dutch Colonial]], Colonial Revival, [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]], and Prairie School.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The neighborhood has numerous cul-de-sacs with limited vehicular access.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Directly north of the neighborhood lies the 18-hole Jackson Park Golf Course, a part of the Chicago Park District's [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], the third largest park in the city and home of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Columbian World Exposition]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The neighborhood was commissioned in the early 20th century. Its initial purpose was as a collection of model homes that would overlook the prized Jackson Park, which had hosted the World's Fair less than a decade prior. The neighborhood featured some of the most innovative concepts of the time, including large front yard setbacks, {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} lot widths, underground utilities, and no alleys. When Chicago annexed Hyde Park just in time for the [[1890 United States Census|1890 census]] (to beat out [[Philadelphia]] as the second largest metro area in the nation), the Highlands were left under governorship of the South Shore area.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Jeffery–Cyril Historic District===
{{main|Jeffery–Cyril Historic District}}
The Jeffery–Cyril Historic District is a national historic district in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district comprises a cluster of six apartment buildings on Jeffery Boulevard, 71st Place, and Cyril Avenue. All six buildings were built between 1927 and 1929.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rathbun |first1=Peter |last2=Kirchner |first2=Charles |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form: Jeffery-Cyril Historic District |url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201388.pdf |publisher=[[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]] |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |date=December 9, 1985}}</ref> The district was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 5, 1986.<ref name="NRISref|version=2013a">{{NRISref|version=2013a}}</ref>

The South Shore Bungalow Historic District is a residential historic district in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The district contains 229 Chicago bungalows and twenty other residential buildings built between 1911 and 1930. The district was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 10, 2008.<ref name="NRISref|version=2013a"/>

==Architecture==
[[File:20070602 South Shore Cultural Center.JPG|thumb|left|South Shore Cultural Center]]
The [[South Shore Cultural Center]], previously the South Shore Country Club, began as a lakefront retreat for the wealthiest of Chicago's movers and shakers.  The firm of [[Marshall and Fox]], architects of the Drake, Blackstone, and Edgewater Beach hotels, were hired to design an opulent, Mediterranean-style clubhouse for a membership that included some of Chicago's most prominent families. The grounds provided private stables and members-only beach, and golf course. Tennis, horseback riding, and [[skeet shooting]] were enjoyed by guests the likes of [[Jean Harlow]], [[Will Rogers]], and [[Amelia Earhart]]. Between the first and second World Wars, a housing boom brought a development of luxury cooperative apartments and mansions to the neighborhood surrounding the club. In 1974 the club held its last members-only event. Today, the Chicago Park District owns the property. It has been restored to its original design and is now open to the public. A major drawback to the South Shore and surrounding [[South Chicago]] neighborhoods is that they are one of the few remaining Chicago lakefront neighborhoods that lack a fully publicly [[Chicago beaches#South Shore Beaches|accessible neighborhood shoreline]]. There are lakefront gaps between the existing South Shore Cultural Center and Rainbow Beach to its south. Even larger masses of lakefront land along the South Chicago neighborhood (at the abandoned USX steel mill) with their beautiful vistas of the city's lakefront and Chicago skyline are undergoing development as parks and not completely available for recreational enjoyment by the adjacent neighborhood residents. Presently, [[Chicago Lakeside Development]] has proposed plans that call for the completion of this southern portion of lakefront with the development of new parklands, beaches, and a continuous waterfront bicycle and jogging path that will link [[Calumet Park]] and Beach in the [[East Side, Chicago|East Side]] neighborhood to the South Shore Cultural Center in South Shore. Completion of such a project would result in improved access to Chicago's southern lakefront and connect it to neighborhoods such as [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] and [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] to the north.

At the northern end of South Shore is the historic district Jackson Park Highlands, one of Chicago's greatest examples of structural history and 19th-century architecture, with an abundance of homes in the style of [[American Foursquare]], [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]], and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] on suburban-sized lots.

Located in the Bryn Mawr section of South Shore is the [[Allan Miller House]] at 7121 South Paxton Avenue. Commissioned by advertising executive Allan Miller, this home is an excellent example of [[Prairie School|Prairie-style architecture]]. Built in 1915, it is Chicago's only surviving building designed by John Van Bergen, a former member of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s architecture firm.
