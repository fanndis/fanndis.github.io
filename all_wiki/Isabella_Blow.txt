As the [[muse]] of hat designer [[Philip Treacy]], she is credited with discovering the models [[Stella Tennant]] and [[Sophie Dahl]] as well as propelling and continually advocating the career of fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]], beginning when she bought the entirety of his explosive premier show inspired by [[Jack the Ripper]]. She committed suicide using the herbicide [[paraquat]] in 2007.

==Early life==
Born '''Isabella Delves Broughton''' in [[Marylebone|Marylebone, London]], she was the eldest child of Major [[Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton, 12th Bt|Sir Evelyn Delves Broughton]], a military officer, and his second wife, Helen Mary Shore, a [[barrister]]. Sir Evelyn was the only son of [[Jock Delves Broughton]]; his sister, Rosamond, married [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat]] in 1938.

Blow had two sisters, Julia and Lavinia; her brother, John, drowned in the family's swimming pool at the age of 2. This had a profound effect on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1571650/Isabella-Blow-feared-her-fading-public-status.html|title=Isabella Blow 'feared her fading public status'|author=Richard Savill|date=6 December 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In 1972, when she was 14, her parents separated and her mother left the household, bidding each daughter farewell with a handshake. Her parents divorced two years later. Isabella did not get along with her father, who bequeathed her only £5,000 from his estate, which was worth more than one million pounds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20070513/ai_n19116271|title=A tortured life, a lonely death, a private funeral|last=Moreton|first=Cole|date=13 May 2007|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 April 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 



Blow studied for her [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at [[Heathfield School, Ascot|Heathfield School]], after which she enrolled at a secretarial college and then took odd jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/isabella-blow-448022.html|title=Isabella Blow: Obituary|date=9 May 2007|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> As she told [[Tamsin Blanchard]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2002: <blockquote>I've done the most peculiar jobs. I was working in a scone shop for years, selling apricot-studded scones. I was a cleaner in London for two years. I wore a handkerchief with knots on the side, and my cousin saw me in the post office and said, What are you doing? I said, What do you think I look like I'm doing? I'm a cleaner!<ref name=tasmin>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,742157,00.html|title=Blow by Blow|last=Blanchard|first=Tasmin|date=23 June 2002|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

==Career==
Blow moved to New York City in 1979 to study [[Ancient Chinese Art]] at [[Columbia University]] and shared a [[Apartment|flat]] with the actress [[Catherine Oxenberg]]. A year later, she left the Art History programme at Columbia, moved to [[Texas]], and worked for [[Guy Laroche]]. In 1981 she married her first husband, Nicholas Taylor (whom she divorced in 1983), and was introduced to the fashion director of the US edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', [[Anna Wintour]]. Blow was hired initially as Wintour's assistant, but it was not long before she was assisting [[André Leon Talley]], as of 2008 US ''Vogue''{{'}}s editor-at-large. While working in New York, she befriended [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2007/05/08/db0802.xml|title=Isabella Blow|date=10 May 2007|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|location=London|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref>

She returned to London in 1986 and worked for [[Michael Roberts (fashion journalist)|Michael Roberts]], then the fashion director of ''[[Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' ''Style'' magazine.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|author= Guy Trebay|date=8 May 2007|title=Isabella Blow, Flamboyant Discoverer of Fashion Talent, Dies at 48|work= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref> During this period she was romantically linked to editor Tim Willis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/dec/19/how-to-dress-your-way-out-of-a-breakup|title=How to dress your way out of a breakup|work=[[The Guardian]]|date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 5 April 2015}}{{Better source|reason=[[WP:NEWSBLOG]] The Guardian is a good source, however if your going to use a Guardian news blog as a source.

Lawrence Goldman, Oxford University Press, pg 113</ref> a grandson (and namesake) of the early 20th-century society architect [[Detmar Blow]], in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. [[Philip Treacy]] designed the bride's wedding headdress and a now-famous fashion relationship was forged. Realizing Treacy's talent, Blow established Treacy in her London flat, where he worked on his collections. She soon began wearing Treacy's hats, making them a signature part of her flamboyant style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/marie-claire/3218/life-stories-isabella-blow|title=Life stories: Isabella Blow|date=14 November 2007|publisher=Marie Claire (Australia)|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref> In a 2002 interview with Tamsin Blanchard, Blow declared that she wore extravagant hats for a practical reason: <blockquote>[...] to keep everyone away from me. They say, Oh, can I kiss you? I say, No, thank you very much. That's why I've worn the hat. Goodbye. I don't want to be kissed by all and sundry. I want to be kissed by the people I love.<ref name=tasmin /></blockquote>

In 1993 she worked with the photographer [[Steven Meisel]] producing the ''Babes in London'' shoot, which featured [[Plum Sykes]], [[Bella Freud]] and [[Honor Fraser]]. Blow had a natural sense of style and a good feeling for future fashion directions. She discovered [[Alexander McQueen]] and purchased his entire graduate collection for £5,000, paying it off in weekly £100 installments. Spotting [[Sophie Dahl]], Blow described her as "a blow up doll with brains", and launched the model's career.<ref name=nytobit/>

Blow supported both the fashion world and the art world. Artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster created a shadow portrait of her which was displayed in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/20101/isabella-blow-by-noble-and-webster.php|title=National Portrait Gallery – Isabella Blow by Noble and Webster|work=npg.org.uk}}</ref>

Blow was the fashion director of ''Tatler'' and consulted for [[DuPont]] [[Lycra]], [[Lacoste]], and [[Swarovski]]. She became the subject of an exhibition in 2002 entitled ''When Philip met Isabella'', which featured sketches and photographs of her wearing Treacy's hat designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designmuseum.org/design/philip-treacy |title=Philip Treacy: When Philip Met Isabella Design Museum Touring Exhibition |publisher=designmuseum.org |accessdate=29 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418040851/http://www.designmuseum.org/design/philip-treacy |archivedate=18 April 2008 }}</ref>

In 2004 she had a brief acting cameo playing a character called Antonia Cook in the film ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''.<ref name="IB IMDB profile">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1783203|title=Isabella Blow - IMDb|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=29 Jul 2018}}{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2019}}</ref>

Blow starred in 2005 in a project by artist [[Matthieu Laurette]], commissioned and produced by Frieze Projects 2005 and entitled "What Do They Wear at Frieze Art Fair?" It consisted of daily guided tours of [[Frieze Art Fair]] led by Blow and fellow international fashion experts [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], Kira Joliffe, and Bay Garnett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friezefoundation.org/commissions/detail/matthieu_laurette|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907183804/http://www.friezefoundation.org/commissions/detail/matthieu_laurette/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 September 2008|title=Matthieu Laurette presents "What Do They Wear at Frieze Art Fair?"|publisher=friezefoundation.org|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref>

Shortly before her death, Blow was the creative director and stylist of a series of books for an Arabic beauty magazine, ''Alef''; the books were being produced by Kuwaiti fashion entrepreneur [[Sheikh Majed al-Sabah]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Illness==
Toward the end of her life, Blow became seriously depressed and was reportedly anguished over her inability to "find a home in a world she influenced". [[Daphne Guinness]], a friend of Blow's, stated: "She was upset that Alexander McQueen didn't take her along when he sold his brand to [[Gucci]]. Once the deals started happening, she fell by the wayside. Everybody else got contracts, and she got a free dress".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/fashion/10BLOW.html?ref=fashion|title=The Woman No Hat Could Tame|last=Horyn|first=Cathy|date=10 May 2007|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> According to a 2002 interview with Tamsin Blanchard, it was Blow who brokered the deal in which Gucci purchased McQueen's label.<ref name=tasmin /> Other pressures on her included financial problems (Blow was disinherited by her father in 1994)<ref name=tasmin /> and infertility.

Isabella and Detmar Blow separated in 2004. Detmar Blow went on to have an affair with [[Stephanie Theobald]], the society editor of British ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Final Blow |last=Helmore |date=September 2007 |work=Vanity Fair|page=394}}</ref> while his estranged wife entered into a liaison with a [[gondolier]] she met in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]]. During the couple's separation, Blow was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] and began undergoing [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]]. For a time, the treatments appeared to be helpful. During this period she also had an affair with [[Matthew Mellon]]; however, after an eighteen-month separation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/2007/12/matthew_mellon/|title=Matthew Mellon|work=W Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article2224237.ece|title=Fashion Victim|date=12 August 2007|publisher=women.timesonline.co.uk/|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Isabella and Detmar Blow were reconciled. Soon afterward, she was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]].

Depressed over her waning celebrity status<ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article3006770.ece|title=Isabella Blow 'was depressed by fading fame'|last=Hines|first=Nico |date=5 December 2007 |publisher=women.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> and her cancer diagnosis, Blow began telling friends that she was suicidal.<ref name=NYMagNuttyAunt/> In 2006, Blow attempted suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills. Later that year, Blow again attempted suicide by jumping from the [[Hammersmith Flyover]], which resulted in her breaking both ankles.<ref name=daily>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/12/13/ArtsLiving/A.Fabulous.Fashionable.Year.In.Review-3143517-page2.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090211055909/http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/12/13/ArtsLiving/A.Fabulous.Fashionable.Year.In.Review-3143517-page2.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 February 2009 |title=A fabulous, fashionable year in review: Death of Isabella Blow |last=Lifvergren |first=Emma |date=13 December 2007 |publisher=dailycollegian.com |accessdate=29 April 2008 }}</ref>

Blow made several more suicide attempts in 2007, by driving her car into the rear of a lorry, attempting to obtain horse tranquilizers, trying to drown herself in a lake and by overdosing while on a beach in India.<ref name=daily />

==Death==
On 6 May 2007, during a weekend house party at Hilles, where the guests included Treacy and his partner, Stefan Bartlett, Blow announced that she was going shopping. Instead, she was later discovered collapsed on a bathroom floor by her sister Lavinia and was taken to [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]], where Blow told the doctor she had drunk the weedkiller [[Paraquat]].<ref name=telegraph/><ref name=NYBadHatter>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/34732/|title=The Sad Hatter|last=Larocca |first=Amy|date=16 July 2007|newspaper=New York Magazine}}</ref> She died at the hospital the following day.<ref name=NYMagNuttyAunt/>

Blow's death was initially reported as being caused by [[ovarian cancer]];<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/08/nblow08.xml|title=Isabella Blow Loses Her Battle With Cancer|last=Bunyan|first=Nigel|author2=Davies, Caroline|date=10 May 2007|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/12/uknews4.mainsection|title=Isabella Blow told doctors she had drunk weedkiller|last=McVeigh|first=Karen|date=12 May 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=29 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> however, a coroner later ruled the death a [[suicide]]. At the inquest, Blow's sister, Lavinia Verney, stated that after she discovered her sister had ingested the poison, Blow had told her, "I'm worried that I haven't taken enough."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/05/1|title=Fashion guru killed herself, coroner rules|last=Truscott|first=Claire|date=5 December 2007|work=guardian.co.uk | location=London}}</ref>

Her funeral was held at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 15 May 2007. Her casket, made of willow, was surmounted by one of her Philip Treacy hats as well as a floral tribute, and her pallbearers included her godson Otis Ferry, a son of the rock star [[Bryan Ferry]]. (In 2010, Bryan Ferry dedicated his ''[[Olympia (Bryan Ferry album)|Olympia]]'' album ''in memoriam Isabella Blow and [[David Williams (guitarist)|David Williams]]''.)
