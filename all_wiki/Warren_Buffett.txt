Buffett was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] at 19. He went on to graduate from [[Columbia Business School]], where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of [[value investing]] pioneered by [[Benjamin Graham]]. He attended [[New York Institute of Finance]] to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called [[Berkshire Hathaway]], assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/us/charlie-munger-fast-facts/index.html|title=Charlie Munger|website=Cnn.com|access-date=March 11, 2019|archive-date=February 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202042637/https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/us/charlie-munger-fast-facts/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/berkshire-hathaways-warren-buffett-remembers-meeting-charlie-munger.html|title=Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett remembers meeting Charlie Munger|last=Clifford|first=Catherine|date=February 26, 2018|website=Cnbc.com|access-date=March 11, 2019|archive-date=June 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626220023/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/berkshire-hathaways-warren-buffett-remembers-meeting-charlie-munger.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, ''[[One Thousand Ways to Make $1000]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levere|first1=Jane|title=New HBO Documentary On Warren Buffett Uses Family Photos, Home Movies To Reveal His Life Story|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2017/01/30/new-hbo-documentary-on-warren-buffett-uses-family-photos-home-movies-to-reveal-his-life-story/|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Forbes|date=January 30, 2017|quote=A voracious reader his entire life, at age seven he read a book he borrowed from the library, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000, and, inspired by its lessons, began selling Coca-Cola, gum and newspapers.|archive-date=September 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908184330/https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2017/01/30/new-hbo-documentary-on-warren-buffett-uses-family-photos-home-movies-to-reveal-his-life-story/|url-status=live}}</ref> Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, and weekly magazines [[door to door]]. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]] in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7280569.stm|title=Buffett 'becomes world's richest'|accessdate=May 20, 2008|publisher=BBC|date=March 6, 2008|archive-date=March 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309202609/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7280569.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used [[pinball]] machine, which they placed in the local [[barber|barber shop]].

Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage]] near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==Investment career==
{{Details|topic=Warren Buffett's time at Berkshire Hathaway|List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway||}}

===Early business career===
Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner; and from 1970 as [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] and CEO of [[Berkshire Hathaway|Berkshire Hathaway Inc]].

Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,<ref>{{cite book|author=Lowenstein, Roger|title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist|year=1996|page=43|isbn=0-385-48491-7}}</ref> and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on [[Wall Street]] but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to.

He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where he still lives, for $31,500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mmk45fgld/warren-buffett-house-omaha-nebraska/|title=Billionaire Houses|access-date=October 20, 2016|archive-date=October 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161110/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mmk45fgld/warren-buffett-house-omaha-nebraska/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/3843188/this-is-how-much-it-costs-to-live-next-to-warren-buffett/|title=This Is How Much It Costs to Live Next Door to Warren Buffett|last=Poppick|first=Susie|date=May 1, 2016|work=Time|access-date=October 1, 2016|archive-date=September 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922064856/http://time.com/money/3843188/this-is-how-much-it-costs-to-live-next-to-warren-buffett/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, [[Peter Andrew Buffett|Peter Andrew]], was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner [[Charlie Munger]]. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually, eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own.

In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the [[Sanborn Map Company]]. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at "minus $20." Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an [[activist investor]], obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a [[proxy fight]], the Board offered to [[Share repurchase|repurchase shares]] at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in.<ref name="buffett1960">{{cite document|last1=Buffett|first1=Warren|title=Letter from Warren Buffett to Partners, 1960}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Buffett Partnership Letter Series - 1960 (Part 2)|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/buffett-partnership-letter-series-1960-part-2-cm187712|website=NASDAQ|language=en-us|date=November 6, 2012|access-date=November 5, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107002721/http://www.nasdaq.com/article/buffett-partnership-letter-series-1960-part-2-cm187712|url-status=live}}</ref> Buffett had obtained a 50% return on investment in just two years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Roger|title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist|date=1995|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=9780804150606|pages=65–66|edition=2008 Trade Paperback}}</ref>

===Assuming Berkshire===
In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, [[Berkshire Hathaway]]. He began buying shares in Berkshire from [[Seabury Stanton]], the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had [[working capital]] of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Buffett's Worst Trade | date=October 18, 2010 |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884 |publisher=CNBC }}</ref> He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.

In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business&nbsp;— Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.<ref name="Kenny2009">{{cite book|author=Graham Kenny|title=Diversification Strategy: How to Grow a Business by Diversifying Successfully|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PRrbeA_e0egC|page=160}}|date=August 3, 2009|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5833-1|pages=160}}</ref> In 1969, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income.

In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the [[Graham Holdings Company|Washington Post Company]]. Buffett became close friends with [[Katharine Graham]], who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of [[Wesco Financial]], due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire [[List of Berkshire Hathaway publications|indirectly purchased]] the ''[[Buffalo Evening News]]'' for $32.5&nbsp;million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]''. Both papers lost money until the ''Courier-Express'' folded in 1982.

In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] announced a $3.5&nbsp;billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.<ref>Kleinfield, N.R.

In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving [[John Gutfreund]] (former CEO of [[Salomon Brothers]]) surfaced. A [[rogue trader]], Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu/ldi/press_johngutfreund.html |title=''Inaction Can be as Dangerous as Bad Action'', Aly Gonenne, Class of 2004, Duke Leadership Development Initiative |website=Mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618163023/http://mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu/ldi/press_johngutfreund.html |archive-date=June 18, 2010 }}</ref> Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Securities Trading Investigation |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?21029-1/securities-trading-investigation |website=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=June 23, 2020 |date=September 4, 1991 |archive-date=June 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200623082539/https://www.c-span.org/video/?21029-1%2Fsecurities-trading-investigation |url-status=live }}</ref>

===As a billionaire===
Buffett became a billionaire when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29, 1990, with the market closing at $7,175 a share.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |url=https://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=4376&startdate=May+29%2C+1990&enddate=Jun+29%2C+1990 |title=Berkshire Hathaway Inc. historical prices |publisher=Google Finance |archive-date=August 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830090334/http://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=4376&startdate=May+29%2C+1990&enddate=Jun+29%2C+1990 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1998 he acquired [[General Re]] (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties—according to the ''Rational Walk'' investment website, "underwriting standards proved to be inadequate," while a "problematic derivatives book" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss.<ref name="Walk">{{cite web|title=General Re Settlement in AIG Case Closes Difficult Chapter|url=http://www.rationalwalk.com/?p=4444|website=The Rational Walk|publisher=The Rational Walk|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=January 21, 2010|archive-date=July 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723062100/http://www.rationalwalk.com/?p=4444|url-status=live}}</ref> Gen Re later provided [[reinsurance]] after Buffett became involved with [[Maurice R.

During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Diane Brady, Marcia Vickers, Mike McNamee|title=AIG: What Went Wrong|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-04-10/aig-what-went-wrong|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|publisher=Bloomberg LP|accessdate=August 16, 2014|date=April 10, 2005|archive-date=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916093151/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-04-10/aig-what-went-wrong|url-status=live}}</ref> On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6&nbsp;billion fine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-19.htm |title=AIG to Pay $800&nbsp;Million to Settle Securities Fraud Charges by SEC; Over $1.6&nbsp;billion to be Paid to Resolve Federal and New York State Actions |date=February 9, 2006 |publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date=September 18, 2017 |archive-date=June 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610024001/https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-19.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92&nbsp;million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case.

In 2002, Buffett entered in $11&nbsp;billion worth of [[forward contract]]s to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2&nbsp;billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006—the largest contribution would go to the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Carol J.|last=Loomis|title=Warren Buffett gives away his fortune|journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=June 25, 2006}}</ref>

===2007–08 financial crisis===

In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/berkshire-sells-johnson-&-johnson-procter-&-gamble/425035/|title=Berkshire Hathaway unloads J&J and P&G|date=February 17, 2009|work=The Financial Express|accessdate=February 23, 2009|archive-date=October 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015073021/http://www.financialexpress.com/news/berkshire-sells-johnson-%26-johnson-procter-%26-gamble/425035|url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report:

<blockquote>That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.<ref>Schroeder, Alice ''The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life'' {{ISBN|0-553-80509-6}} Bantam Sept 2008</ref></blockquote>

In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had "fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s—which led to years of painful [[stagflation]]—might re-emerge.<ref>Josh Funk, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008830635_apbuffetteconomy.html "Buffett says nation will face higher unemployment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622091745/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008830635_apbuffetteconomy.html |date=June 22, 2011 }}, [[Associated Press|AP]] on [[Seattle Times]], March 9, 2009.

===A capitalized Berkshire===

On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328&nbsp;billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2&nbsp;billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013, purchase of shares in [[USG Corporation]] as required.<ref>Stempel, Jonathan (August 20, 2014) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/berkshirehathaway-settlement-idUSL2N0QQ1LR20140820 UPDATE 3-U.S. fines Berkshire over stock deal, Buffett admits mistake] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084318/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/berkshirehathaway-settlement-idUSL2N0QQ1LR20140820 |date=October 17, 2015 }}.

In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,

<blockquote>I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong.

The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ([[BNSF]]) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010.

In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming:

In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64&nbsp;million shares of [[International Business Machine]] Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11&nbsp;billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of [[State Street Global Advisors]]. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, "I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/14/us-buffett-ibm-idUSTRE7AD0V720111114 |title=Buffett sheds tech aversion with big IBM investment |date=November 14, 2011 |work=Reuters |access-date=July 3, 2017 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084318/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/14/us-buffett-ibm-idUSTRE7AD0V720111114 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Interim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013, that the ''[[Press of Atlantic City]]'' would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in [[Pittsburgh]], U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to "move the needle" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The ''Press of Atlantic City'' became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' ''Roanoke Times'' and ''The Tulsa World'' in Oklahoma, U.S.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bets on Atlantic City |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100896864 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |work=CNBC News |date=July 18, 2013 |first=Alex |last=Crippen |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055845/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100896864 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During a presentation to [[Georgetown University]] students in [[Washington, D.C.]] in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating "$80&nbsp;billion or $90&nbsp;billion a year probably" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society:

<blockquote>We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.<ref>{{cite news |title=Buffett Calls Federal Reserve History's Greatest Hedge Fund |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-20/buffett-says-federal-reserve-is-greatest-hedge-fund-in-history.html |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |work=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2013 |first=Noah |last=Buhayar |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921013250/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-20/buffett-says-federal-reserve-is-greatest-hedge-fund-in-history.html |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

After the difficulties of the [[Great Recession|economic crisis]], Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4&nbsp;billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://qz.com/244132/warren-buffetts-firm-just-made-the-most-money-ever-in-a-single-quarter/ |title=Warren Buffett's firm just made the most money ever in a single quarter |date=August 2, 2014 |access-date=August 21, 2014 |archive-date=August 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817221540/http://qz.com/244132/warren-buffetts-firm-just-made-the-most-money-ever-in-a-single-quarter/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Investment philosophy==
Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators<ref>Lou Hoffman, [[The Hoffman Agency]].

April 13, 2010. Retrieved, April 16, 2010.</ref> as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:<ref>''How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor'', Warren Buffett, ''Fortune'', May 1977</ref>

{{quote|The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation.|Buffett|Fortune (1977)}}

In his article, "[[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville]]", Buffett rebutted the academic [[efficient-market hypothesis]], that beating the [[S&P 500]] was "pure chance", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd [[value investing]] school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named [[Walter J. Schloss]], Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson ([[Tweedy, Browne|Tweedy, Browne LLC]]), [[William J. Ruane]] ([[Sequoia Fund]]), [[Charlie Munger]] (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/official-buffett-biography-to-hit-shelves/|title=Official Buffett Biography to Hit Shelves|date=August 12, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 15, 2008|archive-date=July 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719160643/http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/official-buffett-biography-to-hit-shelves/|url-status=live}}</ref> In his November 1999 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:<ref name="Mr. Buffett on the stock market">{{cite journal|date=November 22, 1999|title=Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm|journal=Fortune |author=Warren Buffett |author2=[[Carol Loomis]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991127120937/http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/1999/11/22/buf.html|archive-date=November 27, 1999|volume=140|issue=10|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Index funds vis-à-vis active management===
Buffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or don't have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that "when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients."<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|title=Warren Buffett, 'Oracle of Omaha', criticizes Wall Street and praises immigrants|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/25/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-wall-street-apple-annual-letter|work=Reuters via the Guardian|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=March 1, 2017|archive-date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301071713/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/25/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-wall-street-apple-annual-letter|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple [[S&P 500]] index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees.

In 1949, Buffett was infatuated with a young woman whose boyfriend had a [[ukulele]]. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the diminutive instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, his music interest was a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yates|first1=Chelsea|title=The Billionaire and the Ukulele|url=http://hearnebraska.org/feature/the-billionaire-and-the-ukulele-warren-buffetts-lifetime-investment-feature-story/|website=Hear Nebraska|access-date=November 28, 2015|archive-date=November 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130232304/http://hearnebraska.org/feature/the-billionaire-and-the-ukulele-warren-buffetts-lifetime-investment-feature-story/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Buffett married [[Susan Buffett]] (born Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, [[Susan Alice Buffett|Susie]], [[Howard Graham Buffett|Howard]] and [[Peter Buffett|Peter]].

===Curbing population growth===
Buffet has been reported to have concerns about unchecked population growth. In 2009, he met with several other billionaires to discuss healthcare, education and slowing population growth. Called "The Good Club" by an insider, the billionaires had given away of $45 billion to [[Philanthropy|philanthropic causes]] and included well known names such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[David Rockefeller, Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/billionaire-club-in-bid-to-curb-overpopulation-d2fl22qhl02 |title=Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation |access-date=August 14, 2020 |archive-date=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922070406/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/billionaire-club-in-bid-to-curb-overpopulation-d2fl22qhl02 |url-status=live }}</ref>.

===Taxes===
{{See also|Buffett Rule}}
[[File:President Obama Speaks on the Buffett Rule.webm|thumb|President Obama announcing the "[[Buffett Rule]]"]]
Buffett stated that he only paid 19 percent of his income for 2006 ($48.1&nbsp;million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains), while his employees paid 33 percent of theirs, despite making much less money.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Forbes]]|date=November 26, 2007|pages=24, 42–3|title=Warren Buffett}}</ref> "How can this be fair?"

(Though, being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year.) I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward,” Buffett said in a statement.}}</ref>

===Dollar and gold===
The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained [[Bear market|bearish]] on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of [[gold as an investment]], with his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said:

<blockquote>It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</blockquote>

In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:

<blockquote>Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Buffett | first=Warren | title=How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor | journal=Fortune | date=May 1977 }}</ref></blockquote>

===China===
Buffett invested in [[PetroChina]] Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sudan.pdf|title=Shareholder Proposal Regarding Berkshire's Investment In PetroChina|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|archive-date=May 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528073557/http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sudan.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese civil war]] that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.

In October 2008, Buffett invested $230&nbsp;million for 10% of battery maker [[BYD Company]] ({{Hong Kong Stock Exchange|1211}}), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer [[BYD Auto]]. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.chinastakes.com/2009/9/warren-buffets-500-return-from-byd-the-show-just-begun.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906140143/http://www.chinastakes.com/2009/9/warren-buffets-500-return-from-byd-the-show-just-begun.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 6, 2009|title=Warren Buffett's 500% Return from BYD: The Show Just Begun?|publisher=ChinaStakes}}</ref>

===Coal===
In 2007, Buffett's [[PacifiCorp]], a subsidiary of his [[MidAmerican Energy Company]], canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's [[Intermountain Power Project]] Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan.

Native American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the [[Klamath River]] owned by [[PacifiCorp]] which is a [[Berkshire Hathaway]] company.

===Expensing of stock options===
He has been a strong proponent of [[stock option expensing]] on corporate [[income statement]]s. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] to [[Indiana Pi Bill|change the value of Pi]] from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html |title=Warren Buffett, ''Fuzzy Math And Stock Options '' |page=A19 |work=The Washington Post |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-date=September 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906142850/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Technology===
In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new [[social media]] companies such as Facebook and Google because it is hard to estimate future value. He also stated that [[initial public offering]] (IPO) of stock are almost always bad investments. Investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten years.<ref>{{cite news | title = Buffett on Facebook and Google: hard to estimate future value | date = May 7, 2012 | url = http://www.suntimes.com/business/12373627-420/buffett-on-facebook-and-google-hard-to-estimate-future-value.html | work = Chicago Sun-Times | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = May 7, 2012 | archive-date = February 1, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130201200527/http://www.suntimes.com/business/12373627-420/buffett-on-facebook-and-google-hard-to-estimate-future-value.html | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies===
In an interview with [[CNBC]] in January 2018, Buffett said that the recent craze over [[Bitcoin]] and other [[cryptocurrencies]] won't end well, adding that "when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know."
