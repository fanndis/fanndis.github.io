The '''National Eligibility Entrance Test (Undergraduate)''' (or '''NEET (UG)'''), formerly the [[All India Pre Medical Test|All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT)]], is a [[entrance examination|national entrance examination]] in India for students who wish to pursue undergraduate medical courses ([[MBBS]]), dental courses ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]) and equivalent courses in [[Ministry of AYUSH|AYUSH]] ([[Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery|BAMS]], [[BUMS]], [[Central Council of Homeopathy|BHMS]], etc.) in government or private institutions in India.

The undergraduate NEET (UG), for MBBS and BDS courses, is currently conducted by the [[National Testing Agency]] (NTA), which provides the results to the Directorate General of Health Services under [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] and State Counselling Authorities for seat allocation.<ref name="nta">{{Cite web|url=https://ntaneet.nic.in/Ntaneet/ShowPdf.aspx?Type=50C9E8D5FC98727B4BBC93CF5D64A68DB647F04F&ID=77DE68DAECD823BABBB58EDB1C8E14D7106E83BB|title=NEET-FAQ|website=[[National Testing Agency|National Testing Agency (NTA)]]}}</ref> 

NEET-UG replaced the [[All India Pre Medical Test]] (AIPMT) and all individual MBBS exams conducted by states or colleges themselves in 2013. However, lawsuits were filed and the exam couldn't be conducted in 2014 and 2015.

NEET-UG is a single entrance test for admissions to more than 66,000 MBBS and BDS seats across India.<ref name="bdsneedt">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/one-from-tamil-nadu-in-top-50-in-neet/articleshow/64457692.cms|title=One from Tamil Nadu in top 50 in NEET|access-date=6 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606141635/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/one-from-tamil-nadu-in-top-50-in-neet/articleshow/64457692.cms|archive-date=6 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In 2018,

NEET was declared illegal and unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in 2013. However, it was restored on 11 April 2016, after a five-judge Constitution bench recalled the earlier verdict and allowed the Central Government and the Medical Council of India (MCI) to implement the common entrance test until the court decides afresh on its validity.

== Colleges ==
As per the orders of Honourable Supreme Court, there will be a single medical entrance exam all over India for admission into medical and dental colleges. The colleges will not be able to conduct their own medical entrance exam and thus all will accept students based on NEET Score. All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT), is now known as NEET. After the declaration of the results, an All India Rank (AIR) is alloted to each candidate and a merit list is released. The Medical Council of India conducts counselling (allotment of seats according to merit and candidate choice) for 15% state seats, central institutes and deemed universities. The counselling for remaining 85% state quota seats and private colleges is done by the medical boards of respective states. States prepare their separate merit list on basis of NEET-UG results. The total number of seats offered under NEET are 66,000 which is distributed accordingly.<ref name="bdsneedt"/>
