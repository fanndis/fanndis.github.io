While there, he was a member of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]]. In 1972, he received a [[Master of Arts]] in [[International Relations]] from the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Johns Hopkins SAIS|School of Advanced International Studies]]. While at Johns Hopkins, he studied abroad at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>''New York Magazine''. February 11, 1991, p. 36.</ref>

Blitzer has said he has frequently been asked about his name, which has been characterized as seemingly [[Stage name|made for TV]]. He explained that his surname goes back for generations, and his first name, 'Wolf', is the same first name as that of his maternal grandfather.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheridan|first=Patricia|date=October 3, 2005|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/05276/581641.stm|title=Breakfast with...Wolf Blitzer|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092821/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05276/581641.stm|archive-date=June 16, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 3, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
===Washington and Jerusalem===
Blitzer began his career in journalism in the early 1970s, in the [[Tel Aviv]] bureau of the [[Reuters]] news agency. In 1973, he caught the eye of ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' editor [[Ari Rath]], who hired Blitzer as a Washington correspondent for the [[English language]] [[Israel]]i newspaper. Blitzer remained with the ''Jerusalem Post'' until 1990, covering both American politics and developments in the Middle East.<ref name=jpost>{{cite news|title = Wolf Blitzer, 'Symbol of Integrity', Leaves Post For Cable Network Job|last = Makovsky|first = David|newspaper = The Jerusalem Post|date = 1990-04-29}}</ref>

Fluent in [[Hebrew]], Blitzer also published articles in several Hebrew-language newspapers. Under the name Ze'ev Blitzer, he wrote for ''[[Al HaMishmar]]''. Using the name Ze'ev Barak, he had work published in ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]''.<ref name= bwj>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Between Washington and Jerusalem''. 1985, page ix.</ref> Ze'ev (זאב) is the [[Hebrew]] word for "wolf" and Barak (ברק) is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "lightning" (which in German/Yiddish is ''Blitz''/''blits'').

In the mid-1970s, Blitzer also worked for the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC) as the editor of their monthly publication, the ''Near East Report''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Himmelfarb|first=Joel|url=https://spectator.org/46064_jimmy-carters-jewish-problem/|title= Jimmy Carter's 'Jewish Problem'|work=The American Spectator|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185831/http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=10753|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ross officially joins Israeli lobby|url=http://www.middleeast.org/read.cgi?category=Magazine&num=27&standalone=&month=1&year=2001&function=text|work=Mid-East Realities|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430104239/http://www.middleeast.org/read.cgi?category=Magazine&num=27&standalone=&month=1&year=2001&function=text|date=January 19, 2005|archive-date=April 30, 2005}}</ref> While at AIPAC, Blitzer's writing focused on Middle East affairs as they relate to [[United States foreign policy]].<ref name="JVL">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wolf-blitzer|title=Wolf Blitzer|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=September 3, 2020}}</ref>

At an April 1977 [[White House]] press conference, Blitzer asked [[Egypt]]ian leader [[Anwar Sadat]] why Egyptian scholars, athletes and journalists were not permitted to visit Israel. Sadat responded that such visits would be possible after an end to the state of belligerence between the two nations. In November of that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel, and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries from the first joint Israeli-Egyptian press conference in 1977, to the final negotiations that would lead to the signing of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] two years later.<ref name=jpost/>

In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, ''Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1985). The text outlined his personal development as a reporter, and the relations between the United States and Israel.

===Jonathan Pollard===
In 1986, he became known for his coverage of the arrest and trial of [[Jonathan Pollard]], an American Jew who was charged with spying for Israel.<ref name=jpost/> Blitzer was the first journalist to interview Pollard, and he later wrote a book about the Pollard Affair titled ''Territory of Lies''.<ref name=pollard>{{cite news|newspaper = Washington Post|title = The American Who Loved Israel Too Much: Book Review|last = Luxenberg|first = Steven|date = 1989-05-21}}</ref> In the book, Blitzer writes that Pollard contacted him because he had been reading Blitzer's byline for years, and because Blitzer "had apparently impressed him as someone who was sympathetic".<ref>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Territory of Lies''. 1989, page xv.</ref> Pollard also hoped that Blitzer would help him "reach the people of Israel, as well as the American Jewish community."<ref>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Territory of Lies''. 1989, page xix.</ref>

Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial in the context of the legal action against him, as it was construed by some media voices as a possible violation of the terms of Pollard's plea deal, which forbade media contact. Blitzer's subsequent book about the affair was included in ''[[The New York Times]]'' list of "Notable Books of the Year" for 1989.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1989-12-13|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDF163BF930A35751C1A96F948260|title = Notable Books of the Year|accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> In its review, the ''Times'' praised the book as "lucid and highly readable" and called Blitzer's judgment of Israeli officials "harsh but fair".<ref>{{cite news|title = The Spy from South Bend|last = Pear|first = Robert|date = 1989-05-07|newspaper = The New York Times|format = Book Review|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DA1F3DF934A35756C0A96F948260}}</ref>

A review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' was more critical, prompting a letter from Blitzer accusing the reviewer of making several inaccurate statements. Reviewer [[Robert I. Friedman]] responded to Blitzer's criticism by characterizing ''Territory of Lies'' as "a slick piece of damage control that would make [Blitzer's] former employers at AIPAC (not to mention Israel's Defense Ministry) proud."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine = New York Review of Books|last = Friedman|first = Robert|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3751|title = Territory of Lies|format = letter by Blitzer, response by Friedman|date = 1990-02-01|accessdate=February 16, 2007}}</ref>

Pollard was released on November 20, 2015, in accordance with federal guidelines in place at the time of his sentencing.<ref name="WSJ Parole">[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.687303 "After 30 Years, Jonathan Pollard Released From American Prison."] Haaretz. November 20, 2015.</ref>
