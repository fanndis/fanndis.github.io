'''''A Girl like Me''''' is the second [[studio album]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was released on April 10, 2006, by [[Def Jam Recordings]].<ref name="Australia" /> For the production of the album, Rihanna worked with [[Evan Rogers]], [[Carl Sturken]], [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]], [[J. R. Rotem]] and label-mate [[Ne-Yo]], who wrote [[Unfaithful (song)|the album's second single]]. ''A Girl like Me'' is a [[pop music|pop]], [[reggae]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album influenced by Rihanna's [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] roots. The album also incorporates elements of [[dancehall]] and [[rock music|rock]], as well as ballads, which music critics were ambivalent towards.

Some critics gave the album positive reviews, stating that Rihanna gracefully avoided the sophomore disappointment while others compared the album to her [[Music of the Sun|previous effort]]. ''A Girl like Me'' was released less than eight months after Rihanna's debut album. It peaked at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album was successful in other countries as well, entering the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and Japan, while topping the [[Canadian Albums Chart]].

''A Girl like Me'' spawned four singles: "[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]", which became Rihanna's first single to reach number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]" and "[[Break It Off]]", both reaching the top ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. However, the album's third single, "[[We Ride]]", failed to reprise the success of the album's other singles. The album was re-released as an expanded two-disc deluxe package in Germany, which includes remixes to both Rihanna's debut single, "[[Pon de Replay]]", and "[[If It's Lovin' that You Want]]". The album has been certified 2x Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=RIHANNA&ti=A+GIRL+LIKE+ME|title=2x Platinum 'A Girl Like Me'|publisher=[[RIAA]]|access-date= March 26, 2018}}</ref> To promote both ''A Girl Like Me'' and her [[Music of the Sun|debut record]], Rihanna embarked on her debut headlining concert tour, entitled [[Rihanna: Live in Concert]] in 2006.

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, ''A Girl like Me'' reveals new types of musical genres compared to Rihanna's light and [[uptempo]] debut effort, ''[[Music of the Sun]]''.<ref name=artistdirect/> Her goal on the album was to find songs that express the many things young women want to say, but might not know how.<ref name="RihBioArtist"/> In an interview, Rihanna said: "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression."<ref name="Tecson"/> [[Reggae music]], present in her debut album, subsequently continues into ''A Girl like Me''. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different [[genres|music genres]], including [[rock music]], while keeping the reggae and [[dancehall music|dancehall]] roots of her previous album.<ref name=mckeen1>McKeen, p. 233</ref> The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some [[Ballad (music)|balladic]] elements.<ref name="Tecson"/> Although the album mostly follows the [[Disco|disco-ish]] mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] "Kisses Don't Lie",<ref name="Tecson"/> though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence.<ref name="MP3.com">"MP3.com: Exclusive Interview with Rihanna", {{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/features/stories/4525.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310184801/http://www.mp3.com/features/stories/4525.html |archivedate=March 10, 2009 }}, cited February 12, 2007</ref> In an interview, Rihanna commented: "Growing up in [[Barbados]], I wasn't exposed to a lot of rock music. We really love reggae and [[soca music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. But when I moved to the [[United States]] last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music."<ref name="Tecson"/> Celia SanMiguel of ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''  magazine wrote that ''A Girl like Me'' is "a [[Pop music|pop]] album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's [[Caribbean]] roots", and that it "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] ambassador."<ref name="SanMiguel"/> Sal Cinquemani from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called the album "a record that almost identically" veered between "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and "[[Adult contemporary music|adult-oriented]] ballads".<ref name="slanttime"/>

''A Girl like Me'' received generally mixed to positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]]. Dan Charnas of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' observed a "much broader musical palette than the wanna[[Beyoncé|be-yoncés]]" and stated: "Sophomore slump avoided, Rihanna actually digs into some ambitious pop [[Ballad (music)|ballads]]".<ref name="Charnas">{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/25/AR2006042501896.html | accessdate = November 27, 2009 | work=The Washington Post | title=Quick Spin | date=April 26, 2006}}</ref> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] commented: "Versatile [[Urban music|urban]] [[dance-pop]] singer Rihanna gracefully avoids the sophomore slump with ''A Girl like Me'', a less [[Tropical music|tropical]]-flavored, more urban effort than her sun-and-fun debut." Jeffries compared the track "[[Kisses Don't Lie]]" to [[Damian Marley]]'s "[[Welcome to Jamrock (song)|Welcome to Jamrock]]" and commented that "the album gets bolder and seamlessly bounces from genre to genre ... Rihanna goes from a [[film noir]] song that elegantly uses murder as a metaphor for cheating ("[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]") to an easy-flowing weekend cruiser ("[[We Ride]]")."<ref name="allmusic"/> Ruth Jamieson of ''[[The Observer]]'' noted: "Chuck in a bit of [[Sugababes]]-esque harmony, some [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]]-style [[electro (music)|electro]] and a dollop of [[reggae]], and you're even closer to getting Rihanna. If you liked last year's ridiculously catchy "[[Pon de Replay]]", there's more of the same here."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Ruth |title=Rihanna, A Girl like Me |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/reviews/story/0,,1756923,00.html |work=The Observer |date=April 23, 2006 |accessdate=February 4, 2008 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212011546/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/reviews/story/0%2C%2C1756923%2C00.html |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In a negative review, Kelefa Sanneh of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that apart from "[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]", "Unfaithful" and "[[Break It Off]]", "this scattershot album is full of duds".<ref name="Sanneh">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/24/arts/critics-choice-new-cds-642568.html | accessdate = November 28, 2009 | work=The New York Times | first=Kelefa | last=Sanneh | title=Critic's Choice: New CD's | date=April 24, 2006}}</ref> Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt that the album "doesn't deliver anything else as ingenious as its lead single: Lightweight [[dancehall]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] jams lack the single's ear-bending boldness. But the burning [[rock guitar]] of "Kisses Don't Lie" and haunted strings of "Unfaithful" help make ''A Girl like Me'' much more likable."<ref name="Walters"/> Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' felt that the album's ballads are "at least a decade too mature for the teenage singer's minor vocal talents." He added that, despite the clever sampling on "SOS", "comparatively gooey and spineless slow numbers like "Final Goodbye" and "A Million Miles Away" kill whatever momentum the album has."<ref name="slanttime"/> [[Robert Christgau]] of [[MSN Music]] graded the album a "dud",<ref name="Christgau">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=February–March 2007|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg2007-02.php|title=Consumer Guide|publisher=[[MSN Music]]|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought."<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=2000|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php|title=Key to Icons|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref>
