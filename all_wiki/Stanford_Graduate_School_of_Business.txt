Stanford GSB offers a general management [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree, the [[Sloan Fellows|MSx Program]] ([[Master of Science|MS]] in Management for mid-career executives) and a [[PhD]] program, along with joint degrees with other schools at Stanford including [[Stanford University School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences|Earth Sciences]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Education|Education]], [[Stanford University School of Engineering|Engineering]], [[Stanford Law School|Law]] and [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Medicine]]. The GSB also offers Stanford LEAD, an online professional certificate program.

==History==
The school was founded in 1925 when trustee [[Herbert Hoover]] formed a committee consisting of Wallace Alexander, George Rolph, [[Paul Shoup]], Thomas Gregory, and Milton Esberg to secure the needed funds for the school's founding.<ref>''Stanford University 1916–1941'', pg 79–80. J. Pearce Mitchell, 1958</ref> Willard Hotchkiss became the first dean of Stanford GSB.

The library was formally inaugurated on April 3, 1933. The collection was established with 1,000 volumes and assorted reports.<ref>[https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/library/archive/history Stanford GSB History of the library] gsb.stanford.edu</ref> The school moved from Jordan Hall to new quarters in the History Corner of the [[Main Quad (Stanford University)|Main Quad]] in 1937.<ref>[https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/news-history/history Stanford GSB Our History] gsb.stanford.edu</ref>

[[Jonathan Levin (economist)|Jonathan Levin]] was appointed as the 10th dean of the school in September 2016.<ref>SGSB Press Release. May 23, 2016 [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/newsroom/school-news/jonathan-levin-named-dean-stanford-graduate-school-business Jonathan Levin Named Dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business]</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:Knight Management Center.jpg|thumb|Stanford Knight Management Center, seen from Serra Street.]]
The Knight Management Center is situated within the greater Stanford [[campus]]. There are ten buildings at the Knight Management Center: the Gunn Building, Zambrano Hall, North Building, Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, Bass Center, the Faculty Buildings (comprising East and West buildings), the Patterson Building, the MBA Class of 1968 Building, and the McClelland Building.

The Schwab Residential Center was designed by Mexican architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]]. The 158,000 square-foot facility consists of 280 guest rooms.

There are three main art installations on campus, including Monument to Change as it Changes, Monument to the Unknown Variables, and Ways to Change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus/stanford-gsb-artwork |title=Stanford GSB Artwork &#124; Stanford Graduate School of Business |publisher=Gsb.stanford.edu |access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref>

===Full-time MBA program===
The school has approximately 400 students per year in its full-time two-year MBA program, which is considered among the best in the world. In June 2006, the School announced a dramatic change to its [[curriculum]] model ("The Personalized MBA Education"). It aims to offer each student a highly customized experience by offering broader menus of course topics. The graduating class of 2009 was the first class having gone through the new curriculum.

Current and past students include [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholars]], [[Marshall Scholars]], Coro, Gardner, Soros, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], Rotary, and [[Truman Scholarship|Truman fellows]]. Approximately 15% of the class entered the MBA program with other graduate or professional degrees; including medical doctors, lawyers, and PhDs. Stanford GSB also offers a [[PhD in Management]] degree for those looking to pursue a career in academia.

The students at the school have traditionally maintained a policy of grade non-disclosure whereby they do not release grades. Some annual academic distinctions do exist. Students graduating in the top ten percent of the class are designated "Arjay Miller Scholars", named after the former dean, Arjay Miller (1969–79). The top student receives the Henry Ford II award at graduation. At the end of the first year, five students are also designated Siebel Scholars based on a combination of academics and extracurriculars.

===Full-time MSx program===

The Stanford MSx Program<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford MSx Program|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/msx/|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=August 9, 2012}}</ref> is a full-time, one-year master's degree program for managers in mid-career. Fellows who successfully complete the academic program are awarded the degree of Master of Science in Management. The program's principal objective is to help participants strengthen their capacity for organizational leadership. The ideal MSx candidate is a senior manager who has had or will soon be appointed to his or her first general management position.

The Stanford MSx was previously called the Stanford Sloan Master's Program, because students in the program are known as Stanford Sloan Fellows. The Stanford MSx is one of the three [[Sloan Fellows]] programs, sharing a similar format with the others at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[London Business School]]. These programs were initially supported by Alfred P. Sloan, Chairman of [[General Motors]] from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship in his alma mater of [[MIT]] in 1931.

The degree distinguishes itself from the MBA by acknowledging the life experiences of fellows. Like the MBA program, the MSx program requires a set of core courses along with electives (normally mixed with MBAs), however, the MSx program has separate core courses, more tailored for the experience level of fellows.

===Academic partnerships===
Stanford GSB has a number of relationships with other leading business schools.  It offers a number of Executive Education programs jointly with [[Harvard Business School]].  It also offers one of the three Sloan Fellows programs, coordinating with the others at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[London Business School]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bradshaw |first=Della |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2d0cc00a-6c3e-11e1-b00f-00144feab49a.html#axzz1qjYo5sXe |title=A degree of choice for the older and wiser student |publisher=FT.com |date=2012-03-19 |access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref>

==Certificate programs==

===Stanford LEAD Professional Certificate===

The Stanford LEAD program (“LEAD” stands for learn, engage, accelerate, and disrupt)<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford LEAD Program|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exec-ed/programs/stanford-lead|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> is a one-year online business program in the Graduate School of Business offering access to curricular materials and students specialize personal leadership. The teaching components are coordinated 100% online although there are periodic meet-ups hosted at Stanford each year through the me2we program.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford LEAD me2we|url=https://leadme2we.org/|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> The annual me2we conferences have grown to become quite large, and the program's 1,800 LEAD alumni can join remotely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=In a Quick Pivot, Stanford LEAD’s Annual Event Moved from On-Campus to Online|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/news-history/quick-pivot-stanford-leads-annual-event-moved-campus-online|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>

Stanford LEAD offers a professional certificate from the GSB’s executive education division. Admission does not require any particular educational background and is based on the candidate's work experience, recorded video statements, and a letter of recommendation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford LEAD admissions|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exec-ed/admission|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> The GMAT is not required.

To deliver content, LEAD uses multiple online platforms: a "virtual campus" for online collaboration with a virtual campus and video game vibe (similar to [[SecondLife]]); lessons and interactions are combined with videos, quizzes, gamification and distance collaboration tools with best-of-class products provided by Facebook, Zoom, Google, Microsoft, Virbela and NovoEd. In March 2020, Stanford GSB needed to take all on-campus graduate courses online for Coronavirus and to do so, it adopted the LEAD experience and converted 125 GSB classes to online within 72 hours.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poets & Quants|title=HomeBusiness School NewsStanford’s Pandemic Playbook: How The Scramble Online Is Working For MBAs Stanford’s Pandemic Playbook: How The Scramble Online Is Working For MBAs|url=https://poetsandquants.com/2020/03/18/stanfords-pandemic-playbook-how-the-scramble-online-is-working-for-mbas/|access-date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>

The business school comprises the Knight Management Center, the Schwab Residential Center (named after alumnus [[Charles R. Schwab]], founder and chairman of the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]]), and Highland Hall.

==Donations==
[[File:Schwab gsb.jpg|thumb|Schwab Residential Center]]
In August 2006, the school announced what was then the largest gift ever to a business school—$105 million from Stanford alumnus [[Phil Knight]], MBA '62, co-founder and chairman of [[Nike, Inc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/headlines/knight_gift.shtml|title=Nike Founder Phil Knight to Give $105 Million to Stanford GSB}}</ref> The gift went toward construction of a $375 million campus, called the Knight Management Center, for the business school. Construction was completed in 2011. 

In 2011, alumnus Robert King and his wife Dorothy made a $150 million gift to the school -- making history as the largest donation to Stanford GSB-- to found the Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies (also known as SEED) to focus on poverty relief in [[Emerging market|emerging markets]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-11-04|title=Stanford business school receives $150m gift|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2fc2ec8a-0644-11e1-a079-00144feabdc0|access-date=2020-09-21|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB}}</ref> A portion of their gift is used as a matching incentive to encourage other donors to give to SEED.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stanford|first=© Stanford University|last2=California 94305|date=2012-08-13|title=Stanford Institute to Alleviate Poverty with $150 Million Gift|url=https://giving.stanford.edu/stanford-benefactor/stories/stanford-launches-institute-alleviate-poverty-150-million-gift|access-date=2020-09-21|website=Giving to Stanford|language=en}}</ref>
