Santander Bank, N.A., was founded in 1902 as "Sovereign Bank", a [[savings and loan]] in [[Wyomissing, Pennsylvania]]. The company's earliest customers were largely textile workers. Sovereign expanded rapidly during the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s and 1990s, acquiring numerous other banks.<ref name=Sidel>{{cite news|last1=Sidel|first1=Robin|title=Smaller Banks Begin to Pay Price For Their Boomtime|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB120873974430930109|accessdate=27 September 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=21 April 2008}}</ref> In 2000, Sovereign bought 278 New England branches from the newly merged [[FleetBoston Financial]], becoming the third-largest retail bank in the [[Boston]] area at one stroke.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 March 2000 |title=Sovereign Bank Seals Deal With Fleetboston |url= http://articles.philly.com/2000-03-01/business/25604450_1_jay-s-sidhu-sovereign-bank-branch-network|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |access-date=9 January 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Sovereign Bank New England Announces Acquisition of Fleet/BankBoston Branches |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sovereign-bank-new-england-announces-acquisition-of-fleetbankboston-branches-74266987.html |location=[[Philadelphia]] and [[Boston]] |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |date=7 September 1999|access-date=3 January 2017}}</ref>  This transaction was driven by a requirement from bank regulators that [[Fleet Bank]] and [[BankBoston]] divest 306 branches as a condition for merger.<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES FLEET FINANCIAL AND BANKBOSTON TO DIVEST 306 BRANCHES IN FOUR NEW ENGLAND STATES  |url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/atr/public/press_releases/1999/3027.htm |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]|date=2 September 1999|access-date=3 January 2017}}</ref>

Forty-five years before the founding of Sovereign Bank, its future parent was founded as Banco Santander on 15 May 1857, with the approval of Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=More than a century of history|url=http://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite/CFWCSancomQP01/en_GB/Santander/More-than-a-century-of-history.html|website=corporate website|publisher=Banco Santander S.A.|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> The bank grew and in the 1920s started to build a network of branches. In 1942 it opened in Madrid. In 1934 Emilio Botín Sanz de Sautuola y López became director, and in 1950 chairman. He expanded the bank throughout Spain, so in 1957 it was Spain's seventh-largest bank. In 1976 it acquired First National Bank of Puerto Rico, and in 1982 Banco Español-Chile. In 1986, Emilio senior's son, [[Emilio Botín]] Sanz de Sautuola y García de los Ríos, succeeded him. In the late 1980s he acquired CC-Bank in Germany and a stake was in Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. In 1989, the "Supercuenta Santander" was launched.<ref>{{cite web|title=1985-1990|url=http://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite/CFWCSancomQP01/en_GB/Corporate/1985-1990.html|website=corporate website|publisher=Banco Santander|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>

Sovereign bought the naming rights to [[Sovereign Bank Arena|Mercer County's new arena]] in 1999 in support of newly acquired Trenton Savings Bank (formerly TSFS) and other New Jersey branches for a ten-year term. In following years, the bank also named the [[Sovereign Center]] arena and Sovereign Performing Arts Center in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and [[Santander Stadium|Sovereign Bank Stadium]] in [[York, Pennsylvania]].

In June 2006, Banco Santander purchased almost 20% of Sovereign Bank for US$2.4 billion. As Banco Santander owned 25% of Sovereign, it had the right to buy the bank for $40 per share for one year beginning in the middle of 2008.<ref>[http://www.ydr.com/yorkbaseball ydr.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918002536/http://www.ydr.com/yorkbaseball |date=September 18, 2006 }}</ref> On June 1, 2006, Sovereign Bank purchased Independence Community Bank Corp. of [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], for [[USD|US$]]3.6 billion in cash.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Independence Community Bank Corp. to be Acquired by Sovereign Bancorp in Cash Transaction at $42 per Share|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/independence-community-bank-corp-to-be-acquired-by-sovereign-bancorp-in-cash-transaction-at-42-per-share-55542432.html|location=[[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], and [[Philadelphia]] |agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=2005-10-24|access-date=3 January 2017}}</ref> Sovereign completed the transition process of Independence and [[S.I.
