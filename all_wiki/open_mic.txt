An '''open mic''' (or '''open mike''') (derived from the expression "open microphone") is a live show at a [[coffeehouse]], [[nightclub]], [[comedy club]], [[strip club]], institution or [[pub]] at which audience members who are amateur or professional may perform on stage, often for the first time, or to promote an upcoming performance.<ref>{{cite news

| quote= ''Mike'' came first, documented from the early days of radio. In the June 1923 issue of 'The Wireless Age,' a photo caption of Samuel L. Rothafel…reads, ‘When you hear Roxy [Rothafel] talk about 'Mike' he means the microphone.’ This suggests the abbreviation arose as a kind of nickname, playfully anthropomorphizing the microphone as ''Mike''. But by 1926, when the pioneering broadcaster [[Graham McNamee]] published his book ‘You're on the Air,’ mike appeared in lowercase, not as a name…''Mic'' didn't begin appearing in written works for another few decades, first recorded by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in Al Berkman's 1961 ‘Singers' Glossary of Show Business Jargon.’ Berkman offered both ''mike'' and ''mic'' as possible clippings of ''microphone''. Since then, ''mic'' has grown in popularity among those who work with recording equipment.}}</ref> Typically, as the name suggests, the performer is provided with a [[microphone]] which is plugged into a [[PA system]], to make the individual's performance loud enough for the audience to hear. Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or [[master of ceremonies]], typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like poetry and [[spoken word]], music (often singer-songwriters who [[accompaniment|accompany]] themselves on guitar), and comedy. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small rock band duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and [[soundcheck]]ing such a group. In strip club terms, '''amateur night''' is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by [[Striptease|taking their clothes off]] just like professional [[strippers]].

Open mic nights may have no [[cover charge]], or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a [[gratuity jar]], "pass the hat" for donations or hold a raffle with various prizes. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling alcoholic beverages and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for their services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for their slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to [[jam session]]s, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a [[house band]] or [[rhythm section]] and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end [[jazz club]].

These shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Open mics provide an outlet for singer-songwriters. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were [[folk clubs]], which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by [[acoustic music]]ians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title "acoustic night" or "acoustic club" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Open mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a UK open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Mic Finder Statistics|url=http://openmicfinder.co.uk/Statistics|work=Open Mic Finder Statistics|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is [[Open Mic UK]], which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to £30,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage.<ref name="tenwinners">{{cite news

[[File:Open_mic_blues_night.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Open mic blue jam, 2015]]
A popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the "Blues Night".  In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being "open mic blues night".  The establishment may supply a [[house band]], typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a keyboard. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner.

Since the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used.  Songs might be announced as a "12-bar fast shuffle in C" or "slow 12-bar blues in F", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rayrayblues.com/bluesjams/|title=Phoenix Blues Jams|first=|last=rayray|website=www.rayrayblues.com}}</ref>

 |quote=The presence of audience greeting, like audience applause, is a remarkably stable feature of opening sequences. Almost invariably the first thing a performer does is greet the audience. Although this greeting may take a variety of forms, it is an introduction. Usually the performer's entrance has been preceded by a short sequence from a [[Master of ceremonies|compere]] who will have introduced the comedian and instigated a round of applause. [An] informal, at times quasi-conversational approach is used in which the performer gives the impression that they are opening up a dialogue with the audience.}}</ref> Performing first on an open mic roster puts the comic at a disadvantage, due to the audience being "cold," and is considered the most challenging spot to perform.<ref>{{cite journal

| quote=The first comic on stage carries the burden of 'building the energy in the room'. The comedians who follow in the line-up have to sustain it. Should someone fail at doing this and leave the audience 'cold', the next comic has to 'bring the energy back up'...Ideally [the comedians] arrive at a venue when the show starts in order to 'read' the audience. Reading the audience is a visual practice (What are the demographics?[)]…and an affective practice (How are they responding to the comic on stage?[)]…At the very least, comics will show up a few acts ahead of their own for that purpose. They have to know the energy of the room in order to work the crowd right.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===Other types of comedy open mics===
Other types include '''booked shows''' and '''bringer shows'''. Booked shows have a normal format, but performers reserve spots (one week to month) in advance. Bringer shows are presented in a showcase format, with each performer mandatorily bringing 5–15 people (with a cover charge and a two-drink minimum, per person) and is seen as exploitative.<ref>{{cite web

==Poetry, rapping, and spoken word==
{{See also|Rapping}}
Poetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a poet or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. Sometimes open mic nights have featured readers, or are part of a writing workshop, but generally a sign-up sheet is available for anyone interested in participating. Each participant is then called to come to the microphone and read a selection or two.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|title=Read a poem at an open mic {{!}} Academy of American Poets|url=https://poets.org/text/read-poem-open-mic|access-date=2020-06-28|website=poets.org}}</ref> Writers may attend an open mic to try out a new piece for an audience or to find out more about the local writing community. Others attend poetry open mics just to listen.<ref name=":0" /> Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, [[coffee house]]s, cafes, bookstores and bars.

Each poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a "gatekeeper", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer.

==Strip club==
{{See also|Stripper}}
In most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts.<ref>[http://www.scorestampa.com/blog/2015/02/01/want-to-be-a-stripper]</ref><ref>[http://www.stripclubs-of-las-vegas.com/deja-vu-showgirls-strip-club-review.html]</ref>

==Rarer niche variations==
{{See also|Disc jockey}}
The terms "open deck" (where ''deck'' refers to the kind of [[Phonograph|turntable]] used by a DJ) and "open reel" (where ''reel'' refers to a [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and [[critique]] their skills/artform. A decrease in the cost of consumer video technology combined with the powerful editing capabilities of modern PCs has caused an increase in the popularity of DJing and amateur filmmaking, but these types of events are still very rare.
