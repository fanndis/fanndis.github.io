The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/katy-perry/news/drake-soft-rapper/|title=Katy Perry Calls Drake A "Soft" Rapper|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> or boastful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/136540/20-drake-songs-that-show-he-s-actually-a-talented-rapper|title=20 Drake Songs That Show He's Actually a Talented Rapper|last=Mic|website=Mic|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> However, Drake is often revered for incorporating "degrading" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery.

===Legal issues===
On May 31, 2009, Drake was robbed at gunpoint in [[Toronto]]'s [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]] district and was forced to forfeit a gold and diamond necklace, an [[Audemars Piguet]] watch, and $2,000. Two men, Soccerties Cotterell and Paul Lelutiu, were initially charged with armed robbery, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, three counts of pointing a firearm and possession of stolen property; these charges were later dropped. The men pleaded guilty only to conspiracy to commit robbery, and spent six months in jail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/what-happened-after-two-men-robbed-drake-at-gunpoint/article1373361/ |title=What happened after two men robbed Drake at gunpoint |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2020}}</ref>

In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on "[[Marvins Room]]".

He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year.<ref name="pitchfork.com2">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/55924-drake-pays-100000-to-rappin-4-tay-for-ripping-off-playaz-club-lyrics-on-ygs-who-do-you-love/|title=Drake Pays $100,000 to Rappin' 4-Tay for Ripping Off "Playaz Club" Lyrics on YG's "Who Do You Love"|work=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in [[Oklahoma City]] to close down, due to his usage of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/drakes-party-gives-oklahoma-city-nightclub-trouble-20120326|title=Drake's Party Gives Oklahoma City Nightclub Trouble|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]] (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel "Chubbs" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also said the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theblast.com/drake-detail-assault-trial/|title=Drake Wants to Ban Social Media Posts From Being Used in Upcoming Assault Trial|work=TheBlast.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference.

===Feuds===
Drake and [[Chris Brown]] were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012 when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a [[SoHo]] nightclub in [[Manhattan]], New York City.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for "0 to 100 / The Catch Up", allegedly produced by [[Boi-1da]] for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drakevseverybody.com/diddy|title=Diddy vs. Drake|work=drakevseverybody.com|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Drake was also involved in a feud with [[Tyga]], stemming from Tyga's negative comments about him during an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drakevseverybody.com/tyga|title=Tyga vs. Drake|work=drakevseverybody.com|accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> Drake would later respond on "6 God" and "6PM in New York", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from [[Young Money Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/41010/drake-rap-beefs/|title=On His Worst Behavior: A List Of All The Rappers Who Have Beefed With Drake|publisher=VH1|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>

Further controversy arose in July 2015 when it was alleged by [[Meek Mill]] that Drake had used [[ghostwriter]]s during recording sessions for "[[R.I.C.O. (song)|RICO]]", one of the lead singles off Mill's [[Dreams Worth More Than Money|second studio album]]. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be [[Quentin Miller]].<ref name="BallerStatus.com2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/22/meek-mill-calls-out-drake-he-dont-write-his-own-raps/|title=Meek Mill Calls Out Drake: "He Don't Write His Own Raps"|date=July 22, 2015|publisher=BallerStatus.com}}</ref> Despite Miller [[If You're Reading This It's Too Late#Track listing|collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits]], Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for "R.I.C.O." Soon after, [[Funkmaster Flex]] aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for "R.I.C.O.", "10 Bands", and "Know Yourself". This prompted Drake to respond with two [[diss track]]s, titled "[[Charged Up]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/26/drake-responds-to-meek-mill-on-new-track-charged-up/|title=Drake Responds To Meek Mill on New Track 'Charged Up'|date=July 26, 2015|publisher=BallerStatus.com}}</ref> and "[[Back to Back (Drake song)|Back to Back]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/07/29/drake-disses-meek-mill-again-in-back-to-back-freestyle/|title=Drake Disses Meek Mill Again In 'Back To Back Freestyle'|date=July 29, 2015|publisher=BallerStatus.com}}</ref> in the space of four days.

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with [[Joe Budden]], stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing ''Views''. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through "4PM in Calabasas", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on "[[No Shopping]]" alongside [[French Montana]], directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7430884/joe-budden-meek-mill-drake-internet-beef|title=Everything We Know About Joe Budden, Meek Mill & Drake's Internet Beef|work=Billboard|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}</ref> he has yet to officially respond to Budden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/a-complete-timeline-of-drake-and-joe-buddens-beef-news.23120.html|title=A Complete Timeline of Drake and Joe Budden's beef|last=Lilah|first=Rose|date=July 28, 2016 |access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> In the same year, Drake mocked [[Kid Cudi]] for his mental health, [[drug user|drug use]] and [[suicide|suicidal urges]] on "Two Birds, One Stone" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/kid-cudi-responds-to-drake-diss-1796528|title=Kid Cudi responds to Drake diss: "I wanna see you say it to my face"|work=NME|date=October 28, 2016}}</ref> Cudi later checked into a [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation facility]] following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/amp/entertainment/music/kid-cudi-thanks-fans-disses-drake-rehab-article-1.2849319|title=Kid Cudi thanks his fans and disses Drake from rehab|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=October 28, 2016}}</ref>
