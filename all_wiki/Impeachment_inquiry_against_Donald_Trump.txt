==== Special Counsel Mueller's Report ====

The [[Mueller Report|report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller]], released on April 18, 2019, found that soon after the firing of James Comey and the appointment of the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]], Trump "engaged in conduct{{nbsp}}... involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public acts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mueller Report |date=2019 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-9821-2973-6 |pages=269}}</ref> The Mueller Report found "multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigation."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |pages=419–420}}</ref> For example, the Mueller Report found "substantial evidence" or "evidence" that:
* "The President's attempts to remove the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the President's conduct";<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=351}}</ref>
* "The President's effort to have (Attorney General) Sessions limit the scope of the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel's investigation]] to future election interference was intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President's and his campaign's conduct";<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=359}}</ref>
* "In repeatedly urging (White House counsel Donald) McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President's conduct towards the investigation."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=382}}</ref>
* "... at least one purpose of the President's conduct towards (Attorney General) Jeff Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope{{nbsp}}... A reasonable inference{{nbsp}}... is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=375}}</ref>
* "... could support the inference that the President intended to discourage (attorney Michael) Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=417}}</ref>
* "... the President's actions had the potential to influence (campaign adviser Paul) Manafort's decision on whether to cooperate with the government{{nbsp}}... The President's public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury deliberations also had the potential to influence the trial jury."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=393}}</ref>

[[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel Robert Mueller]] concluded that "The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."<ref>{{cite book |title=Mueller Report |page=420}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Mueller Report made no definitive conclusion as to whether Trump had committed criminal obstruction of justice.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller/mueller-says-he-did-not-exonerate-trump-us-policy-precluded-charges-idUSKCN1UJ0DF |title=Mueller says Trump was not exonerated; Trump declares victory |last=Morgan |first=David |date=July 24, 2019 |work=Reuters |last2=Wolfe |first2=Jan |access-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727133528/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller/mueller-says-he-did-not-exonerate-trump-us-policy-precluded-charges-idUSKCN1UJ0DF|archive-date=July 27, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Instead, the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel]] strongly hinted that it was up to Congress to make such a determination based on the evidence presented in the report.

From at least May 2019 to August 2019, Trump and Giuliani pressed the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation that would have negatively affected Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]].

The proposed investigation of Biden was based on a 2015 push by the U.S. to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor [[Viktor Shokin]] because he had been ignoring corruption in Ukraine and protecting political elites.

In a January 2020 letter to Judiciary Committee chairman [[Jerry Nadler]], Schiff referred to a partially redacted text message in which Parnas told Giuliani "trying to get us mr Z," which Schiff asserted showed that Parnas "continued to try to arrange a meeting with President Zelensky.” A subsequently unredacted version of the message showed that days later Parnas sent Giuiliani a document that appeared to contain notes from an interview with [[Mykola Zlochevsky]], the owner of [[Burisma Holdings]], casting doubt on Schiff's interpretation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/21/schiff-parnas-trump-evidence-101832|title=Schiff may have mischaracterized Parnas evidence, documents show|first=Melanie|last=Zanona|work=[[Politico]]|date=January 21, 2020|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

Maguire, who had delayed the whistleblower complaint from reaching Congress, testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on September 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/joseph-maguire-intelligence-senate-1509552 |title=Whistleblower wants to appear before Congress, Dems say |last=Bertr |first=Natasha |last2=Matishak |first2=Martin |website=Politico |date=September 24, 2019 |last3=Everett |first3=Burgess |accessdate=September 25, 2019}}</ref> Maguire defended his decision not to immediately forward the whistleblower complaint to Congress and explained that he had consulted the [[White House Counsel]] and the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] (DOJ), but was unable to determine whether the document was protected by [[executive privilege]]. Democrats on the committee questioned his actions, arguing that the law demands the forwarding of such complaints to the committee. Maguire countered that the situation was unique since the complaint involves communications of the president. Members of the House Intelligence Committee also asked Maguire why he chose to consult with White House lawyers when he was not required to do so by law, to which he responded that he believed "it would be prudent to have another opinion."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/intelligence-chief-maguire-will-testify-to-congress-about-whistleblower-complaint/2019/09/25/ee98ae7c-dfb4-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html |title=Acting intelligence chief Maguire defends his handling of whistleblower complaint in testimony before Congress |last=Harris |first=Shane |date=September 26, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |last2=Demirjian |first2=Karoun |last3=Nakashima |first3=Ellen |author3-link=Ellen Nakashima |issn=0190-8286|accessdate=September 27, 2019}}</ref>

In a private conference call with Democratic lawmakers on September 29, Pelosi laid out how three of these House committees would begin investigating the President's alleged abuse of power. The House Intelligence Committee would focus on the contents of the whistleblower complaint and whether the complaint may have been wrongfully hidden from Congress, while the Foreign Affairs Committee would focus on interactions the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] may have had with the president's personal attorney Giuliani, and the Oversight and Reform Committee would investigate whether White House classification systems were used to secure potentially damaging records of phone calls between the president and other world leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/29/democrats-impeachment-messaging-donald-trump-010934 |title=Dem leaders plot impeachment messaging war with Trump |last=Ferris |first=Sarah |date=September 29, 2019 |website=Politico|accessdate=September 30, 2019 }}</ref>

On September 27, 2019, a subpoena was issued by the House to obtain documents Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] had refused to release earlier. Said documents include several interactions between Trump, Giuliani, and Ukrainian government officials. The documents were requested to be filed with the involved committees probing the issue; the failure to do so "shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry", as stated in a letter written to Pompeo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/09/27/democrats-subpoena-pompeo-as-part-of-impeachment-inquiry-000159 |title=Democrats subpoena Pompeo as part of impeachment inquiry |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=September 27, 2019 |website=Politico |accessdate=September 28, 2019}}</ref> The subpoena came after several requests by the House to receive the documents from the Secretary which he did not fulfill.

On October 8, 2019, in a letter from White House Counsel [[Pat Cipollone]] to House Speaker Pelosi and the three committee chairmen conducting the impeachment investigation, the White House announced that it would not cooperate with the investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-letter-to-nancy-pelosi-white-house-wont-cooperate-with-house-impeachment-inquiry-testimony-documents/ |title=White House won't cooperate with House impeachment inquiry, counsel says |last=Segers |first=Grace |date=October 9, 2019 |work=CBS News |access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In the letter, Cipollone said the investigation "violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/09/768540896/who-sets-the-rules-when-is-it-real-and-other-big-questions-on-impeachment |title=Fact Check: White House Legal Argument Against Impeachment Inquiry |last=Naylor |first=Brian |date=October 9, 2019 |work=NPR |access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> and that "The President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch."<ref name=unhinged>{{cite news |title=It's tempting to ignore Trump's unhinged letter to Congress.

In past impeachment probes, Congress has treated an obstruction of DOJ and Congressional investigations as an article of impeachment, either along with other alleged offenses (Johnson, Nixon) or even as its sole basis for articles of impeachment (Clinton).

Giuliani's attorney, Jim A. Sale, sent a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on October 15, 2019, stating that Giuliani would not provide documents subpoenaed by the committee. Citing [[Attorney–client privilege|attorney–client]] and [[executive privilege]], the letter characterized the subpoena as "beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/giuliani-subpoena-ukraine.html |title=Giuliani Defies Subpoena for Ukraine Documents |last=Shear |first=Michael D. |date=October 15, 2019 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 16, 2019 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Opening statement of Ambassador William B. Taylor (searchable).pdf|thumb|upright|Ambassador [[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]]'s opening statement to his testimony before three House committees, October 22, 2019]]

On October 22, 2019, [[William B. Taylor Jr.|Bill Taylor]], the senior U.S. diplomatic official in Ukraine, testified to Congressional investigators. Taylor testified that he had learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky "was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections", and that he later was told, in September 2019, that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was also dependent on such investigations—including into the Bidens.<ref name="bade">{{cite news |last1=Bade |first1=Rachael |last2=Gearan |first2=Anne |last3=Demirjan |first3=Karoun |last4=DeBonis |first4=Mike |title=Trump made Ukraine aid contingent on public pledge to investigate Bidens and 2016 election, U.S. envoy says he was told |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/diplomat-who-raised-alarm-about-withholding-aid-to-ukraine-testifies-in-impeachment-probe/2019/10/22/086fb850-f436-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html |date=October 22, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wu |first1=Nicholas |last2=Jansen |first2=Bart |title=Key takeaways from Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor's 'explosive' opening statement |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/impeachment-takeaways-ukraine-diplomat-bill-taylors-testimony/2450332001/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |title=Top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine tells Congress investigating Bidens and election interference tied to aid money |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-us-diplomat-ukraine-tells-congress-investigating-bidens/story?id=66451155 |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=October 22, 2019}}</ref>

Taylor testified that, alongside the "regular, formal diplomatic processes" with Ukraine led by himself, there was a "highly irregular", "informal channel of U.S. policy-making" concerning Ukraine. The informal channel began in May 2019, being "guided" by Giuliani, and also involving Volker, Sondland and Perry. Taylor said that by August 2019 he had realized the informal channel "was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy", while the formal channel wanted "a strong U.S.–Ukraine partnership". According to Taylor, the informal channel had "driven" the idea of a White House meeting between the presidents being conditional on the investigations.<ref name=":3b" /><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Jaffe |first1=Greg |last2=Miller |first2=Greg |title='Alarming circumstances': A distressed diplomat tells a tale of venal intrigue |date=October 23, 2019 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/alarming-circumstances-a-distressed-diplomat-tells-a-tale-of-venal-intrigue/2019/10/22/935b23c6-f500-11e9-ad8b-85e2aa00b5ce_story.html |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Taylor noted that, during a June 2019 call between himself, Zelensky, Sondland, Volker and Perry; Sondland had said "he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants" and that "he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring." As for Trump's July 2019 call with Zelensky, Taylor said he did not receive any report regarding the call from the White House even though he was scheduled to meet Zelensky a day later.<ref name=":3b" />

Taylor said he heard from NSC aide [[Tim Morrison (arms control expert)|Tim Morrison]] that, on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky aide {{ill|Andrey Yermak|WD=Q65200615|vertical-align=sup}} that the military aid to Ukraine was dependent on Zelensky's pursuit of the Burisma investigation. Taylor cited Sondland's telling him in a call that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce he would order the two investigations, thus placing Zelensky "in a public box". Taylor quoted Sondland as saying "everything" including military aid and a Trump–Zelensky meeting was contingent upon that announcement.<ref name=":3b">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/politics/william-taylor-testimony.html |title=6 Key Revelations of Taylor's Opening Statement to Impeachment Investigators |last=LaFraniere |first=Sharon |author-link=Sharon LaFraniere |date=October 22, 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=October 23, 2019|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=5 takeaways from William Taylor's huge opening statement |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/22/takeaways-bill-taylors-crucial-opening-statement/ |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 23, 2019}}</ref>

According to Taylor, he wrote a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo on advice from Bolton: "I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29, describing the 'folly' I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian government. I told the secretary that I could not and would not defend such a policy." Taylor reported that Pompeo gave no reply to his cable.<ref name=":3b" />

The first event occurred at a July 10 meeting between Ukraine's then [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|Secretary of National Security and Defense Council]] [[Oleksandr Danylyuk|Oleksandr Danlylyuk]], and then U.S. National Security Advisor Bolton, at which Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, and Secretary Perry were in attendance. At the meeting, Sondland asked Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens to get a meeting with President Trump. Vindman states that Bolton cut the meeting short, and that both he and Fiona Hill told Ambassador Sondland his comments were inappropriate, and that he reported the concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 29, 2019 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/read-national-security-official-alexander-s-vindman-s-prepared-remarks-n1073156 |title=Read national security official Alexander S. Vindman's prepared remarks to Congress |website=NBC News |language=en|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>

The second event occurred on a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Zelensky. Vindman states, "I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security." Vindman also reported this event to Eisenberg, the NSC's lead counsel.<ref name="npr vindman" /> Vindman also testified that the "rough transcript" of the call released by the White House omitted crucial words and phrases, including Trump asserting recordings of Joe Biden discussing Ukraine corruption exist, which Trump stated in the third set of [[ellipsis|ellipses]] in the released transcript. Vindman said he had tried but failed to restore the full transcript.<ref name="corrected"/> A senior White House official had asserted when the transcript was released that the ellipses "do not indicate missing words or phrases", but rather "a trailing off of a voice or pause".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-09-25-2019/h_08149725b4b299fa4849b4fd8afb3ecb |title=Here's why there are ellipses in the White House transcript |date=September 25, 2019 |website=[[CNN]] |first=Pamela |last=Brown}}</ref> Trump had previously characterized the released transcript as "an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/03/odd-markings-ellipses-fuel-doubts-about-rough-transcript-trumps-ukraine-call/ |date=October 2, 2019 |title=Odd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the rough transcript of Trump's Ukraine call |first1=Carol D. |last1=Leonnig |first2=Craig |last2=Timberg |first3=Drew |last3=Harwell |website=Washington Post}}</ref>

On October 30, 2019, [[Catherine Croft]], a State Department Ukraine expert and NSC staff member testified. She noted in her opening statement that she was aware of Giuliani's communication with Volker, though she was not involved with those discussions, that former Republican lawmaker [[Bob Livingston]] repeatedly called her to promote the removal of Ambassador [[Marie Yovanovitch|Yovanovitch]]. She added: "On July 18, I participated in a sub-Policy Coordination Committee video conference where an [<nowiki/>[[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB)] representative reported that the White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to Ukraine.

Tim Morrison, an official on the NSC, testified in a closed-door session on October 31. Morrison corroborated previous testimony by [[William B.

Regarding the second difference, Morrison testified that in his September{{nbsp}}1 conversation with Sondland, he learned that Sondland had proposed to Ukrainian presidential advisor Andriy Yermak that military aid to Ukraine was "conditioned on a public statement" by the new Ukrainian prosecutor general's reopening an investigation into Burisma.

On November 15, David Holmes, a U.S. Department of State foreign service officer who works at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, and serves as an aide to Bill Taylor, testified in a closed-door session before three House committees that he and two unnamed aides overheard a phone conversation between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump, while at a restaurant in [[Kyiv]], and immediately following a private meeting between President Zelensky and Sondland, where Trump asked Sondland about whether or not the Ukrainian President had agreed to investigate the Bidens.<ref name=holmesdeposition>{{cite news |first=Alayna |date=November 14, 2019 |last=Treene |url=https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-impeachment-david-holmes-mark-sandy-67051991-a73a-4bd1-aa45-e02566ff35c6.html|title=House committees request new closed-door impeachment testimony from U.S. official in Ukraine|website=Axios}}</ref> Holmes' statement provided the first testimony under oath that Trump directly and contemporaneously requested investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden and Burisma, with Trump allegedly asking "so he's gonna do the investigation?", refuting the potential defense that Trump had not been involved, and that Sondland might have been acting without the president's knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/david-holmes-confirms-trump-asked-about-ukraine-investigation.html|title=Aide Confirms Trump Asked About Ukraine Investigation, Delivering Blow to GOP Defense|last=Politi|first=Daniel|date=November 16, 2019|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> Further, Holmes' deposition raised questions about the credibility, accuracy, and truthfulness of Ambassador Sondland's previous sworn deposition, furthering the possibility that Sondland either perjured himself or needed to clarify his original sworn statement.<ref>{{cite news |first=Fadel |last=Allassan |date=November 16, 2019 |url=https://www.axios.com/david-holmes-confirms-trump-asked-sondland-ukraine-investigation-4c20f887-d79d-4bc4-8c73-d4fdc0dc91ce.html|title=State Department official confirms Trump asked Sondland about Ukraine investigation|website=Axios|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> Third, Holmes' statement provided the first characterization of the actual language and degree of Trump's interest in having Ukraine investigate the Bidens, with Sondland saying to Trump about Zelensky that "he loves your ass" and "will do anything you ask him to", and Sondland later telling Holmes that President Trump "doesn't give a shit about Ukraine" and "only cares about the big stuff"—namely, investigations into the Bidens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-holmes-statement-impeachment-inquiry-full-opening-statement/ |date=November 12, 2019 |title=Read David Holmes' full opening statement in impeachment inquiry|website=CBS News|language=en-US|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/-it-s-a-bombshell-shakedown-witness-confirms-damning-impeachment-call-73563205693|title='It's a bombshell': Shakedown witness confirms damning impeachment call|website=MSNBC|language=en|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref>

McKinley, a former ambassador and later senior adviser to Secretary Pompeo, testified that he had three times advised the Secretary of State to defend Yovanovitch after the July 25 call in which Trump disparaged her became public knowledge. McKinley also said Kent was being pressured by State Department lawyers to remain silent and that Kent feared the State Department was relaying inaccurate information to Congress.<ref name="excerpts and analysis nov. 4" /> McKinley told the committees: "To see the emerging information on the engagement of our missions to procure negative political information for domestic purposes, combined with the failure I saw in the [State Department] to provide support for our professional cadre in a particularly trying time, I think the combination was a pretty good reason to decide enough, that I had no longer a useful role to play."<ref name="first transcripts" />

As public hearings approached, a staff memo to Republican members of the three relevant committees outlined the major themes they should pursue in Trump's defense. This includes focusing on the July 25 call summary which they allege "shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure" and that both Presidents Trump and Zelensky have said there was no pressure. The memo contended that any concerns Zelensky may have had about negative consequences of publicly acknowledging he felt pressure from Trump were unwarranted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/12/20961073/trump-impeachment-hearings-republican-testimony-strategy|title=A Republican memo details the party's impeachment inquiry defenses.

Taylor testified that the day after the Trump–Zelensky phone call, one of his aides, David Holmes, overheard Sondland speaking to Trump via cellphone in a Kyiv restaurant, hearing the president refer to "the investigations".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-begin-with-revelation-of-phone-call-implicating-trump-in-ukraine-scandal/2019/11/13/de8d21b8-063b-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html |date=November 13, 2019 |title=Impeachment hearings begin with new evidence of phone call implicating Trump in Ukraine controversy|first1=Karoun|last1=Demirjian|website=The Washington Post}}</ref> Another diplomat, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the call. Holmes testified behind closed doors on November 15 that he heard Trump ask, "so, he's gonna do the investigation?" to which Sondland replied, "he's gonna do it", adding that Zelensky would do "anything you ask him to". Holmes also testified that Sondland later told him that Trump "did not give a shit about Ukraine" and "only cared about the big stuff{{nbsp}}... that benefits the president like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing."<ref>{{cite news |first=Veronica |last=Rocha |first2=Meg |last2=Wagner |url=https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-15-19/index.html|title=Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine testifies: Live updates|date=November 15, 2019|website=CNN|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>

The report's preface states:<blockquote>[T]he impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.

The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.

At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for "a favor though": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name="Intel-Report" />{{Rp|8–9}}</blockquote>

The Republicans of the House Committees had released a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence does not support accusations. "The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor," said the draft report.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/02/house-gop-draft-report-defends-president-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2590245001/ |newspaper=USA Today |first=Bart |last=Jansen |first2=Christal |last2=Hayes |title=House GOP report on impeachment inquiry defends Trump's dealings with Ukraine |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/02/784183484/read-republican-report-on-the-impeachment-inquiry |title=READ: Republican Report On The Impeachment Inquiry |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref> This report also painted the push to impeachment as solely politically motivated.

On September 30, CNN, citing an analysis by Laura Edelson at [[New York University]]'s [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Tandon School of Engineering]], reported that Trump and his reelection campaign had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook advertisements to push for his defense. More than 1,800 ads on Trump's Facebook page that mentioned "impeachment" had run the week prior and had been viewed between 16 and 18 million times on Facebook. The analysis indicates the campaign spent between $600,000 and $2&nbsp;million on the ads, which reportedly attempted to rally and enlist people for the "Official Impeachment Defense Task Force". A further $700,000 is believed to have been spent for ads on Pence's Facebook page, which mirrored the content on Trump's.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/facebook-trump-impeachment/index.html |title=Trump is using Facebook to run thousands of ads about impeachment |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Donie |last2=Wright |first2=David |date=September 30, 2019 |website=CNN |access-date=October 1, 2019}}</ref>

The White House officially responded to the impeachment proceedings in a letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to House Speaker Pelosi that it would cease all cooperation with the investigation due to a litany of concerns, including that there had been no vote of the full House, and the secrecy of the proceedings. In the October{{nbsp}}8 letter, the White House officially declined to cooperate with what they claimed was an illegitimate effort "to overturn the results of the 2016 election". The eight-page letter said the investigation "violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent". Pelosi responded to the letter: "The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction."<ref name="bbc Oct 9" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-10-08/read-white-house-letter-declares-impeachment-inquiry-unconstitutional |title=READ: White House Letter Declares Impeachment Inquiry Unconstitutional |last1=Hagen |first1=Lisa |date=October 8, 2019 |work=US News and World Report |accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name="borger" /><ref name="blake-aaron" /><ref name="NYT Oct 8 2019" />

During an October 17 press conference, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he "was involved with the process" of the freezing of military aid. Mulvaney gave his account of why Trump decided to hold back military aid to Ukraine. One, Trump felt the other European countries were not doing enough. Two, Trump felt Ukraine was a "corrupt place" which included having "corruption related to the DNC server" concerning "what happened in 2016". As a result, reporter [[Jonathan Karl]] told Mulvaney "what you just described is a ''quid pro quo''. It is: 'Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.'" Mulvaney replied to Karl: "We do that all the time with foreign policy{{nbsp}}... Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." Later in the press conference, Mulvaney quoted a third reason on why military aid was frozen: they had yet to cooperate with a U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged Ukrainian interference in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]].<ref name="becket" /><ref name="getoverit">{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256 |title=Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up Ukraine aid for political reasons: 'Get over it' |last=Smith |first=Allan |date=October 17, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20191024095917/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256 |archive-date=October 24, 2019 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=November 5, 2019}}</ref>

=== Whistleblowers and their lawyers ===

[[Andrew P. Bakaj]], the lead attorney representing the whistleblowers, sent a joint letter to Maguire on September 28, made public on September 29, in which they raised concerns about the language used by Trump, amongst other things. In the letter, the lawyers state "The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way." The letter also mentioned the $50,000 "bounty" that two conservative Trump supporters have offered as a reward for information about the whistleblower.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49881847 |title=Trump is endangering whistleblower, lawyers warn |date=September 30, 2019 |work=BBC News|access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref>

[[Mark Zaid]], co-counsel for the whistleblower, said in a statement in September 2019 that whistleblowers' identities are protected by law and cited testimony by Maguire which drew upon the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]]. The statement was released after Trump questioned on Twitter the validity of the whistleblower's statements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/463687-trump-white-house-trying-to-find-out-whistleblowers-identity |title=Trump: White House 'trying to find out' whistleblower's identity |last=Lejeune |first=Tristan |date=September 30, 2019 |website=The Hill|access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref> Bakaj took to Twitter to issue a warning on September 30 that the whistleblower is entitled to anonymity, is protected by laws and policies, and is not to be retaliated against; to do so would violate federal law.<ref name="the Hill retaliation" /> Bakaj argued in an October 25 ''[[Washington Post]]'' op-ed that the identity of his client is no longer pertinent after further events corroborated his client's account of the matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/we-represent-the-whistleblower-their-identity-is-no-longer-relevant/2019/10/25/d2ff25a2-f6a1-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html |date=October 25, 2019 |title=We represent the whistleblower.

On November 7, Bakaj sent a letter to the White House warning Trump to "cease and desist" calling for the public disclosure of the whistleblower's identity and "engaging in rhetoric and activity that places [the whistleblower] and their family in physical danger". The lawyer said the president would be legally and morally liable if anyone were to be "physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates', behavior".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/ukraine-whistleblower-trump-cease-and-desist/index.html|title=Lawyer for Ukraine whistleblower sends White House cease and desist letter to stop Trump's attacks|last=LeBlanc|first=Paul|date=November 7, 2019|work=CNN|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

Some historians and diplomats have called the severity of the allegations "unprecedented" in American history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-behavior-with-ukraine-stupid-and-unprecedented-historian-2019-9 |title=Trump's actions with Ukraine were 'profoundly stupid' and beyond anything any president has ever done, historians and veteran diplomats say |last=Haltiwanger |first=John |website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=September 29, 2019 |date=September 28, 2019}}</ref> Elaine Kamarck of the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] has described how this inquiry is different from Nixon's Watergate: "the president himself is directly involved in all four of the likely articles of impeachment": obstruction of justice, violation of federal election law (a possible constitutional abuse of power), obstruction of Congress, and violation of the emoluments clause.<ref name="Kamarck_10/18/2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/10/18/all-roads-lead-to-putin-this-week-in-impeachment/|title=All roads lead to Putin: This week in impeachment|last=Kamarck|first=Elaine|date=October 18, 2019|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|access-date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>

Some academics responded to tweets by Trump in which he quoted [[Robert Jeffress]], a prominent [[Southern Baptist]] pastor who warned of a "Civil War-like fracture" if Democrats continued the inquiry. On Twitter, [[Harvard Law School]] professor John Coates cautioned that the tweet was an independent basis for impeachment as the sitting president was threatening civil war if Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power.<ref name="civil war quote">{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-civil-war-tweet-grounds-impeachment-1462044 |title=Trump's 'Civil War' Quote Tweet Is Actually Grounds for Impeachment, Says Harvard Law Professor |last=Hutzler |first=Alexandra |date=September 30, 2019 |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=October 1, 2019}}</ref> A fellow faculty member of Harvard Law, [[Laurence Tribe]], agreed but cautioned that, due to the typical tone of Trump's tweets, the statement could be interpreted as "typical Trumpian [[bloviating]]" that would not be taken seriously or literally.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-coates-donald-trump-civil-war-tweet-impeachment_n_5d926a6ae4b0019647ad2dc7 |title=Trump's 'Civil War' Tweet May Be Grounds For Impeachment: Harvard Law Professor |last=Moye |first=David |date=September 30, 2019 |website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=October 1, 2019}}</ref>

''USA Today''{{'}}s Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolf published an overview of the opinions of various legal experts, including law professors. The University of Texas's [[Sanford Levinson]] says "nobody really knows" how to define the "[[High crimes and misdemeanors#United States|high crimes and misdemeanors]]" of the Constitution's impeachment clause. According to Georgetown University's [[Randy Barnett]], "The Constitution gets violated all the time. That doesn't make the violation of the Constitution a high crime or misdemeanor." Barnett further states that Trump's accusers "have been alleging impeachable offenses since before [he] took the oath of office". The University of Southern California's [[Orin Kerr]] says, "It's about abusing the office, not about violating a technical provision of a particular clause," and {{nowrap|"[Trump}} is] taking care of himself, not taking care of the country."<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Wolf |first1=Richard |title=Article II of the Constitution: Trump's 'right to do whatever I want?'
