The '''National Order of Mali''' is the highest of honorific orders of [[Mali]].

As such, the order was granted to deserving personalities to the state and could also be granted to foreign heads of state as a sign of friendship.

== Insignia ==
The ''medal'' of the Order is composed on the model of French [[Legion of Honor]] with a ten-pointed yellow outer cross, each point ending in a gold pearl and a ten-pointed smaller inner red cross, edged in gold. At the center of the crosses is a [[medallion]] of red enamel with the letters "RM" ("RÃ©publique du Mali"), surrounded by a golden ring, bearing the phrase "ORDRE NATIONAL" ("National Order") in red letters above and two crossed laurel branches under.

The ''plaque '' has the same design as the medal, on an eight-pointed "silver rays" star.

The ''ribbon'' is yellow with a green border on one side and a red one on the other, which remember the colours of the national flag of Mali.
