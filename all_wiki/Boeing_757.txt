The '''Boeing 757''' is an American [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] that was designed and built by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]].
<!--development-->
The then-named 7N7, a [[twinjet]] successor for the [[Boeing 727|727]] (a [[trijet]]), received its first orders in August 1978.
The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982 and it was [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] certified on December 21, 1982.
[[Eastern Air Lines]] placed the original {{nowrap|757-200}} in commercial service on January 1, 1983.
A package [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a [[Combi aircraft|combi]] model in September 1988.
The stretched {{nowrap|757-300}} was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. 
After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest [[Boeing 737 NG|737 NG]] variants as a successor.

<!--design-->
The jetliner is powered by 36,600–43,500&nbsp;lbf (163–193&nbsp;kN) [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] or [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000]] underwing [[turbofan]] engines for a {{cvt|255,000-273,000|lb|t}} [[MTOW]].
The 757 has a 2,000 sq ft (185 m²) [[supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]] for reduced [[aerodynamic drag]] and a [[Stabilizer (aeronautics)#Conventional tailplane|conventional tail]].
It keeps the [[Boeing 707|707]] cross-section and its two-crew [[glass cockpit]] has a common [[type rating]] with the concurrently designed [[Boeing 767|767]] (a [[wide-body aircraft]]).
<!--variants-->
It was produced in two [[fuselage]] lengths: the {{cvt|47.3|m|order=flip}} long 757-200 (the most popular with 913 built) typically seats 200 passengers in two classes over 3,915 nmi / 7,250&nbsp;km; while the {{cvt|54.4|m|order=flip}} long 757-300 typically seats 243 over 3,400 nmi (6,295&nbsp;km).
The 757-200F can haul a 72,210&nbsp;lb (32,755&nbsp;kg) payload over 2,935 nmi (5,435&nbsp;km).
Passenger {{nowrap|757-200s}} have been modified for cargo use as the special freighter (SF).

<!--Operators-->
Major customers for the 757 included U.S. [[Mainline (flight)|mainline]] carriers, European [[charter airline]]s, and cargo companies.
It was commonly used for short and mid-range [[Domestic flight|domestic routes]], [[Air shuttle|shuttle services]], and [[Transcontinental flight across the United States|transcontinental U.S. flights]].
[[ETOPS]] extended flights were approved in 1986 to fly intercontinental routes.
Private and government operators have customized the 757 as VIP carriers like the US [[Boeing C-32|C-32]].
In July 2017, 666 were in airline service; [[Delta Air Lines]] was the largest operator with 127 aircraft.<ref name=FlightCensus>{{Cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/download?ac=67051 |title=World Airline Census 2018|work=Flightglobal|language=en-GB|date=August 21, 2018}}</ref>
<!--accidents-->
The airliner has recorded eleven [[Hull loss|hull-loss]] accidents, including eight fatal crashes, {{as of|2019|06|lc=y}}.<ref name=ASN/>

==Development==

===Background===
In the early 1970s, following the launch of the wide-body [[Boeing 747|747]], [[Boeing]] began considering further developments of its narrow-body [[Boeing 727|727]] [[trijet]].<ref name=norris143>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=143–45.}}</ref> Designed for short and medium length routes,<ref>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=72.}}</ref> the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market.<ref name=norris143/><ref name=norris12>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=12.}}</ref> Studies focused on improving the 189-seat {{nowrap|727-200}}, the most successful 727 variant.<ref name=norris144/> Two approaches were considered: a stretched 727 (to be designated 727-300), and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7.<ref name=norris144>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=144.}}</ref> The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration,<ref name=norris144/> while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.<ref name=norris20/>

[[File:Boeing 757-200 Farnborough 1982 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|The 7N7 made its [[Farnborough Airshow]] debut in 1982 as the 757-200.|alt=Side view of silver twin-engine jet taxiing on runway, with deployed flaps and "757" markings on tail.]]
[[United Airlines]] provided input for the proposed 727-300, which Boeing was poised to launch in late 1975,<ref name=norris144/> but lost interest after examining development studies for the 7N7.<ref name=norris144/> Although the {{nowrap|727-300}} was offered to [[Braniff International Airways]] and other carriers, customer interest remained insufficient for further development.<ref name=norris143/> Instead, airlines were drawn to the [[High-bypass turbofan|high-bypass-ratio turbofan]] engines, new flight deck technologies, lower weight, improved [[aerodynamics]], and reduced operating cost promised by the 7N7.<ref name=norris144/><ref name=norris20/> These features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size wide-body airliner, code-named 7X7, which became the 767.<ref name=norris18>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=18–19.}}</ref> Work on both proposals accelerated as a result of the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.<ref name=norris143/><ref name=davies103>{{harvnb|Davies|2000|p=103.}}</ref>

By 1978, development studies focused on two variants: a {{nowrap|7N7-100}} with seating for 160, and a {{nowrap|7N7-200}} with room for over 180 seats.<ref name=norris20>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=19–20.}}</ref> New features included a redesigned wing, under-wing engines, and lighter materials, while the forward fuselage, cockpit layout, and [[T-tail]] configuration were retained from the 727.<ref name=norris147>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=145–47.}}</ref> Boeing planned for the aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passenger-kilometer of any narrow-body airliner.<ref name=eden98>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=98.}}</ref> On August 31, 1978, Eastern Air Lines and British Airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7N7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the {{nowrap|7N7-200}} version.<ref name=norris20/><ref name=eden98/> These orders were signed in March 1979, when Boeing officially designated the aircraft as the 757.<ref name=norris20/> The shorter {{nowrap|757-100}} did not receive any orders and was dropped; 737s later fulfilled its envisioned role.<ref name=norris95>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=95–96.}}</ref>

===Design effort===
The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727.<ref name=b12>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|p=12.}}</ref> The focus on [[fuel efficiency]] reflected airline concerns over [[operating cost]]s, which had grown amid rising oil prices during the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973.<ref name=norris20/><ref name=norris145>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=145.}}</ref> Design targets included a 20&nbsp;percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines, plus 10&nbsp;percent from aerodynamic improvements, versus preceding aircraft.<ref name=norris145/> Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency.<ref name=norris20/> The [[maximum take-off weight]] (MTOW) was set at {{convert|220000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}},<ref name=b16/> which was {{convert|10000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} more than the 727.<ref name=727tech/> The 757's higher [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in [[hot and high]] conditions with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air, offering better [[takeoff]] performance than that offered by competing aircraft. Competitors needed longer takeoff runs for these hot and high conditions. Boeing also offered options for higher [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload capability]].<ref name=b16>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=16–17.}}</ref><ref name=ostrowerwall>Ostrower, Jon, and Wall, Robert, "Boeing weighs options to reprise aging 757s", ''Wall Street Journal'', February 11, 2015, pp. B1–2.</ref>

The twin-engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four-engine designs.<ref name=intro12>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200014.html|title=Boeing 757: introducing the big-fan narrowbody|date=January 2, 1982|last=Velupillai|first=David|work=Flight International|accessdate=February 2, 2011|pages=12, 15|ref={{harvid|Velupillai|1982}}}}</ref> Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the {{nowrap|RB211-535C}} turbofan built by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], which was capable of {{convert|37400|lbf|kN|}} of [[Jet engine#Thrust|thrust]].<ref name=intro19>{{harvnb|Velupillai|1982|p=19.}}</ref> This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S.<ref name=norris20/> Domestic manufacturer [[Pratt & Whitney]] subsequently offered the {{convert|38200|lbf|kN|}} thrust PW2037,<ref name=intro19/> which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980.<ref name=norris20/><ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1990|p=102.}}</ref> [[General Electric Aviation|General Electric]] also offered its {{nowrap|CF6-32}} engine early in the program, but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand.<ref name=eden98-9>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=98–99.}}</ref>

As development progressed, the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767,<ref name=norris20/> which was several months ahead in development.<ref>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=12–13.}}</ref> To reduce risk and cost, Boeing combined design work on both twinjets,<ref name=norris143/><ref name=intro12/> resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics.<ref name=norris23/> [[Computer-aided design]], first applied on the 767, was used for over one-third of the 757's design drawings.<ref name=intro15>{{harvnb|Velupillai|1982|p=15.}}</ref> In early 1979, a common two-crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft, including shared instrumentation, [[avionics]], and [[flight management system]]s.<ref name=norris23>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=23.}}</ref> In October 1979 the nose was widened and dropped to reduce aerodynamic noise by six dB, to improve the flight deck view and to give more working area for the crew for greater commonality with the 767.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%203639.html |title= Boeing refine 757 flight deck |magazine= Flight International |date= October 6, 1979 |page= 1098}}</ref> [[Cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) color displays replaced conventional [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] instruments,<ref name=norris23/> with increased automation eliminating the [[flight engineer]] position common to three-person cockpits.<ref name=norris23/> After completing a short conversion course, pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa, owing to their design similarities.<ref name=norris23/>

A new [[Supercritical airfoil|aft-loaded]] shape which produced [[Lift (force)|lift]] across most of the upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous [[airfoil]] designs, was used for the 757's wings.<ref name=norris20/> The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity,<ref name=norris20/> and were similar in configuration to those on the 767.<ref name=intro15/> A wider [[wingspan]] than the 727's produced less [[lift-induced drag]], while larger [[wing root]]s increased [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.<ref name=intro15/>

One of the last 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 in favor of a conventional tail.<ref name=norris20/> This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a [[Deep stall#Deep stall|deep stall]], and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage.<ref name=norris151>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=151–53.}}</ref> At {{convert|155.3|ft|sigfig=3}} in length,<ref name=757tech/> the {{nowrap|757-200}} was {{convert|2.1|ft|sigfig=3}} longer than the {{nowrap|727-200}}, and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space, seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor.<ref name=727tech>{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/727family/product.page |title=Boeing 727 Specifications |publisher=Boeing |accessdate= October 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=757plan/> The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the [[Boeing 707|707]] and 737,<ref>{{harvnb|Sharpe|Shaw|2001|pp=9, 17.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2003|p=96.}}</ref> was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727.<ref>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|p=15.}}</ref> This was mainly to reduce drag,<ref name=norris145/> and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing's market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.<ref name=norris147/><ref name=intro12/>

===Production and testing===
Boeing built a final assembly line in Washington at its [[Boeing Renton Factory|Renton factory]],<ref>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|p=32.}}</ref> home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757.<ref name=intro13>{{harvnb|Velupillai|1982|pp=13, 20.}}</ref> Early in the development program, Boeing, [[British Airways]], and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings.<ref name=eden98/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%200723.html|title=Europe's Jet v.

The prototype 757 rolled out of the Renton factory on January 13, 1982.<ref name=eden99/> The aircraft, equipped with {{nowrap|RB211-535C}} engines,<ref name=eden99>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=99.}}</ref> completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on February 19, 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=22–23.}}</ref> The first flight was affected by an [[Stall (engine)|engine stall]], following indications of low [[oil pressure]].<ref name=norris161/> After checking system diagnostics, company test pilot John Armstrong and co-pilot Lew Wallick were able to restart the affected engine, and the flight proceeded normally thereafter.<ref name=norris161>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=161–62.}}</ref> Subsequently, the 757 embarked on a seven-day weekly flight test schedule.<ref name=testing>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200710.html |title=Boeing tests the twins |last=Sweetman |first=Bill|date=March 20, 1982 |work= Flight International |accessdate=July 15, 2011|pages=676, 685–86}}</ref> By this time, the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers, namely [[Air Florida]], [[American Airlines]], British Airways, Delta Air Lines, [[Eastern Air Lines]], [[Monarch Airlines]], and [[Transbrasil]].<ref name=intro19/>

The seven-month 757 flight test program used the first five aircraft built.<ref name=b14>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|p=14.}}</ref> Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests, hot and cold weather trials, and route-proving flights.<ref name=b22>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=22–26.}}</ref> Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process.<ref name=testing/> After design issues were identified, the 757's exit doors received dual-spring mechanisms for easier operation, and the fuselage was strengthened for greater [[bird strike]] resistance.<ref name=making/> The production aircraft was {{convert|3600|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} lighter than originally specified, and recorded a three percent better-than-expected rate of fuel burn.<ref name=b22/> This resulted in a range increase of {{convert|200|nmi|km|sigfig=3}}, and prompted Boeing to tout the aircraft's fuel efficiency characteristics.<ref name=b22/> After 1,380 flight test hours,<ref name=752b/> the RB211-powered 757 received U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) certification on December 21, 1982, followed by UK [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) certification on January 14, 1983.<ref name=norris161/><ref name=b14/> The first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22, 1982, about four months after the first 767 deliveries.<ref name=norris161/><ref name=757_O_D_summ/> The first 757 with PW2037 engines rolled out about one year later, and was delivered to Delta Air Lines on November 5, 1984.<ref name=norris161/>

===Service entry and operations===

Eastern Air Lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route.<ref name=norris161/> On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B]] trijets.<ref name=b49>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|p=49.}}</ref> Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and [[Air Europe]] also began 757 operations later that year.<ref name=757entry>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201307.html |title=Boeing 757: six months in service |date=July 28, 1983 |work=Flight International |accessdate=February 2, 2011|pages=195–201}}</ref> Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners.<ref name=757entry/> Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose.<ref name=757entry/> Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a two-crew member flight deck.<ref name=757entry/> Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40&nbsp;percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.<ref name=norris147/>

Despite the successful debut, 757 sales remained stagnant for most of the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-[[Airline Deregulation Act|deregulation]] U.S. market.<ref name=norris161/> Although no direct competitor existed,<ref name=intro12/> 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] were less expensive and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s.<ref name=b16/><ref name=norris161/> A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when [[Northwest Airlines]] placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease.<ref name=b50>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=50–51.}}</ref> In December 1985, a freighter model, the {{nowrap|757-200PF}}, was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from [[UPS Airlines]],<ref name=norris161/> and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the {{nowrap|757-200M}}, was launched with an order for one aircraft from [[Nepal Airlines|Royal Nepal Airlines]].<ref name=b28>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=28–29.}}</ref> The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987.<ref name=eden100/> The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.<ref name=b28/>

Each wing features a supercritical cross-section and is equipped with five-panel [[leading edge slats]], single- and double-slotted [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]], an outboard [[aileron]], and six [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Velupillai|1982|pp=15–18.}}</ref> The wings are largely identical across all 757 variants, swept at 25 degrees, and optimized for a cruising speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.8 ({{convert|533|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref name=intro15/><ref name=757plan/> The reduced wing sweep eliminates the need for inboard ailerons, yet incurs little drag penalty on short and medium length routes, during which most of the flight is spent climbing or descending.<ref>{{harvnb|Birtles|2001|pp=18–19.}}</ref> The [[airframe]] further incorporates [[carbon-fiber reinforced plastic]] wing surfaces, [[Kevlar]] [[Aircraft fairing|fairings]] and access panels, plus improved [[aluminium alloy|aluminum alloys]], which together reduce overall weight by {{convert|2100|lb}}.<ref name=intro19/><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=153.}}</ref>

To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 757 has a retractable [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]] with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear.<ref name=b47/> The landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the company's previous narrow-body aircraft to provide ground clearance for stretched models.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=150.}}</ref> In 1982, the {{nowrap|757-200}} became the first [[subsonic aircraft|subsonic]] jetliner to offer longer lasting [[Ceramic composite|carbon brakes]] as a factory option, supplied by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201872.html|title=Carbon brakes for 757 |date=July 17, 1982 |work=Flight International|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> The stretched {{nowrap|757-300}} features a retractable [[tailstrike|tailskid]] on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff.<ref name=no99>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=99.}}</ref>

The 757 is powered by either Rolls-Royce (RR) RB-211 series or Pratt & Whitney (PW) 2000 series engines in the 37,000 to 40,100 pound (164 to 178 kilonewton) thrust range. While General Electric initial offered its {{nowrap|CF6-32}} engine for consideration, it subsequently dropped out of competition due to insufficient demand. The initial 757-200 aircraft were powered by either the RR RB211-235C (37,400 lbf/166 kN) or PW 2037 (38,200 lbf/170kN). Later -200 aircraft adopted the RR RB211-235E4 version rated at 40,100 lbf (178 kN), and eventually the RR RB-211E4B (43,100 lbf/192 kN) was introduced. The 757-300 variant is powered by the RR RB-211EB4 or the PW 2043 (40,000 lbf/178 kN).--->

Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group [[TUI AG]] and conducted jointly with [[NASA]] as part of the agency's Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will open the door to the application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.<ref>Norris, Guy, Bug smasher, Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 30 – April 12, 2015, p.37</ref>
* '''Active Flow Control System''' – Boeing has mounted 31 active flow jets mounted ahead of the rudder's leading edge. They receive air from the [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU). Their purpose is to recover air flow that has separated from the rudder and redirect it to the rudder so that the rudder regains effectiveness, even at high deflection angles. The air exiting the APU is very hot, at {{convert|380|F|C}}, and is cooled by a heat exchanger mounted under the aft fuselage, which is connected to the ducts running along the front and back of the stabilizer's spars. This ensures an even air supply at all times.<ref>Norris, Guy, Bug Smasher, Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 30 – April 12, 2015, p.37</ref>
