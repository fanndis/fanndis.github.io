The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] moderates, dubbed the '[[Gang of Four (SDP)|Gang of Four]]':<ref>This name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Maoist [[Gang of Four]]</ref> [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]], who issued the [[Limehouse Declaration]].<ref name="CookStevenson2000">{{cite book|author1=Chris Cook|author2=John Stevenson|title=The Longman Companion to Britain Since 1945|url=https://archive.org/details/longmancompanion0000cook|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-35674-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/longmancompanion0000cook/page/95 95]}}</ref> Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as [[President of the European Commission]], while Williams had lost her seat in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] and withdrawal from the [[European Economic Community]].  They also believed that Labour had become too [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and had been [[entryism|infiltrated]] at [[Constituency Labour Party|constituency party]] level by [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] and Labour voters.

For the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 General Elections]], the SDP formed a [[Political coalition|political and electoral alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]]. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the [[Social and Liberal Democrats]], now the Liberal Democrats,<ref name="BarberisMcHugh2000">{{cite book|author1=Peter Barberis|author2=John McHugh|author3=Mike Tyldesley|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA360|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-5814-8|page=360}}</ref> although a minority left to form a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]] led by David Owen.

==Origins==
The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the [[Campaign for Democratic Socialism]] established to support the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]]), but publicly lies in the 1979 [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture|Dimbleby Lecture]] given by [[Roy Jenkins]] as he neared the end of his [[President of the European Commission|presidency]] of the [[European Commission]]. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], or from a new group driven by European principles of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

There were long-running claims of corruption and administrative decay within Labour at local level (the North East of England was to become a cause célèbre),{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  and concerns that experienced and able Labour MPs could be deselected (i.e., lose the Labour Party nomination) by those wanting to put into a safe seat their friends, family or members of their own Labour faction. In some areas, the [[Militant tendency]] were held to be systematically targeting weak local party branches in safe seat areas in order to have their own candidates selected, and thus become MPs.

[[Eddie Milne]] at [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth]] (Northumberland) and [[Dick Taverne]] in [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] were both victims of such intrigues during the 1970s, but in both cases there was enough of a local outcry by party members – and the electorate – for them to fight and win their seats as independent candidates against the official Labour candidates.

===March 1973 Lincoln by-election===
{{main|1973 Lincoln by-election}}

In Taverne's case, he had been fighting efforts by the Lincoln [[Constituency Labour Party]] to deselect him largely over his support for British membership of the [[European Union|European Communities]]. In October 1972 he resigned his seat to force a [[1973 Lincoln by-election|by-election]] in which he fought as a [[Democratic Labour Party (UK, 1972)|Democratic Labour]] candidate against the official party candidate. Taverne won by an unexpectedly large margin.<ref name="Lincoln by-election">John Ramsden and Richard Jay, "Lincoln: Background to Taverne's Triumph" in "By-elections in British Politics", Macmillan, 1973, pp. 264-315.</ref> He founded the short lived [[Campaign for Social Democracy]] (CFSD) thereafter, and wrote a book about events surrounding the by-election called ''The Future of the Left – Lincoln and After'' (1972). But the CFSD failed to gain nationwide support, and Taverne lost the seat at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]]. Some independent Social Democrats contested the October 1974 and [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]s, but none were elected.

Taverne's Lincoln by-election campaign was also helped to a lesser degree by problems with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]] candidate, [[Conservative Monday Club]] chairman [[Jonathan Guinness]]. His suggestion during the by-election that murderers should have razor blades left in their cells so they could decently commit suicide resulted in him being nicknamed "Old Razor Blades" during the campaign. This, combined with considerable Conservative grassroots disquiet over the Monday Club's links to the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], persuaded some Conservative voters to switch to Taverne in protest as much as tactically to ensure Labour suffered an embarrassing loss. (Guinness had been elected as Chairman specifically to eradicate such links.)

==Creation of the SDP==
On 25 January 1981, leading figures from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] ([[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], known collectively as the "[[Gang of Four (SDP)|Gang of Four]]") launched the Council for Social Democracy, after outlining their policies in what became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]]. In March it was renamed the Social Democratic Party. The "Gang of Four" were [[centrists]], who defected from the Labour Party due to what they perceived to be the influence of the [[Militant tendency]] and the "[[hard left]]" within the party.<ref name="ChildsStorry2013">{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75555-4|page=485}}</ref><ref name="Sassoon2010">{{cite book|author=Donald Sassoon|title=One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUkBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA698|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-530-2|page=698}}</ref>

Thirteen Labour MPs initially declared support for the Council for Social Democracy. On 20 February 1981, three of these [[Tom Ellis (politician)|Tom Ellis]], [[Richard Crawshaw]] and [[Ian Wrigglesworth]] resigned the Labour whip and another, [[Tom Bradley (British politician)|Tom Bradley]], announced he would not contest his seat again as a Labour candidate. These moves were reported to be a clear move towards formally creating a new centre party.<ref name="GH21Feb1981">{{cite news |title=Labour's largest move yet to Centre - Three rebel MPs intend to resign |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19810221&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|work=The Glasgow Herald |date=21 February 1981 |page=1}}</ref>

"Democratic", "Democratic Labour", and "Radical" were all mentioned as possible names for the new party, as well as "New Labour" (which future [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] and eventual [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] would use to successfully promote the Labour Party more than a decade later)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 | work=BBC News | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}</ref> but eventually "Social Democratic" was settled on because the "Gang of Four" consciously wanted to mould the philosophy and ideology of the new party on the social democracy practised on mainland Europe.

The opening statement of principles contained in the preamble of the party's constitution stated that: "The SDP exists to create and defend an open, classless and more equal society which rejects prejudices based upon sex, race, colour or religion". The constitution set out the establishment of a "Council for Social Democracy" (CSD) which was, in effect, the party's standing conference. Each area party was entitled to elect delegates to the CSD. A number of internal groups flourished within the new party, the most notable of which was the [[Tawney Society]] (mirroring the function of the Fabian Society within the Labour Party).

Twenty-eight Labour MPs eventually joined the new party, along with one member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], [[Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler]], MP for [[North West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Norfolk]], who joined on 16 March 1981, a fortnight after the party's launch. Williams and Jenkins were not at the time Members of Parliament, but were elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at by-elections in [[1981 Crosby by-election|Crosby]] and [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|Glasgow Hillhead]] respectively.

{{div col end}}

Much of the party's initial public membership came from the [[Social Democratic Alliance (UK)|Social Democratic Alliance]]. The party also received a boost with the recruitment of former student leaders from outside the Labour Party. These included former Communist Party of Great Britain member [[Sue Slipman]] as well as Conservative Party members including: [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Adair Turner]] and [[Tom Hayhoe]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Although the SDP was seen as being largely a breakaway from the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] of the Labour Party, an internal party survey found that 60% of its members had not belonged to a political party before, with 25% being drawn from Labour, 10% from the Conservatives and 5% from the Liberals.

The party enjoyed a considerable honeymoon period with the press, who made much mileage out of their quirk for proffering [[Bordeaux wine|claret]] at their functions. Claret is an "agreeable" wine, and a metaphor for the party's harmonious internal relations compared to those of the strife-torn Labour Party of the period.

The policies of the SDP emphasised a middle position between perceived extremes of [[Thatcherism]] and the Labour Party. Its constitution argued for "the fostering of a strong public sector and a strong private sector without frequent frontier changes". The SDP favoured some [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Thatcherite reforms during the 1980s, such as legislation aimed at reforming the trade unions (although the parliamentary SDP actually split three ways on Norman Tebbit's 1982 Industrial Relations Bill, most voting for, some against, and others abstaining), but took a more welfarist position than the Conservative Party, being more sceptical of Conservative welfare reforms (particularly regarding the National Health Service).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

At the party's first electoral contest, Jenkins narrowly failed to win a [[1981 Warrington by-election|by-election at Warrington]] in July 1981, describing it as his "first defeat, but by far my greatest victory". At the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|Glasgow Hillhead by-election]] in March 1982, another candidate called Douglas Parkin, nominated by a party called the Social Democratic Party which had been formed in [[Manchester]] in 1979, changed his name to Roy Harold Jenkins to contest the seat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Craig |first=F. W. S. |authorlink=F. W. S. Craig |title=British Parliamentary Election Results 1974–1983 |url=https://archive.org/details/britishparliamen0000crai_z8o5 |url-access=registration |publisher=Parliamentary Research Services |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/britishparliamen0000crai_z8o5/page/311 311]}}</ref> SDP polling agents were given special dispensation by the Returning Officer to have placards outside of polling stations to state which one on the ballot papers was the real Roy. Ultimately, the SDP's Jenkins was elected.

A [[1982 Social Democratic Party leadership election|leadership election]] was held later in the year, Jenkins beating Owen in the ballot to become the first leader of the new party. Later in the year, Shirley Williams defeated Bill Rodgers in the ballot to become SDP president.

==The Alliance==
The SDP formed the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in June 1981, under the joint leadership of Roy Jenkins (SDP) and Liberal leader [[David Steel]]. The Liberal Party, and in particular its leader, [[David Steel]], had applauded the formation of the SDP from the sidelines from the very start. Senior Liberal MP for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] [[Cyril Smith]] caused some embarrassment, however, by publicly stating that the SDP "should be strangled at birth".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/03/sir-cyril-smith-obituary|title=Sir Cyril Smith obituary |work=The Guardian|date=3 September 2010}}</ref> During an era of public disillusionment with the two main parties  – Labour and the Conservatives – and widescale unemployment, the Alliance achieved considerable success at parliamentary by-elections. At one point in late-1981, the party had an opinion poll rating of over 50%.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}</ref>

Also in 1981, David Steel was able to address the Liberal Party conference with the phrase "Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm | work=BBC News | title=Conference season's greatest hits | date=10 September 2003| first=Ollie | last=Stone-Lee}}</ref>

In early-1982, after public disagreements over who could fight which seats in the forthcoming election, the poll rating dipped, but the party remained ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives. However, following the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]] on 2 April 1982, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] soared from third to first place in the public opinion polls. The standing of the SDP–Liberal Alliance and Labour Party declined. By this stage, however, the SDP–Liberal Alliance already had 30 MPs in parliament, virtually all of them defectors from Labour, joined by one Conservative MP.

Labour lost [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey]], one of their ten safest seats, at a [[1983 Bermondsey by-election|by-election in February 1983]] to Liberal candidate [[Simon Hughes]]: the sitting Labour MP [[Bob Mellish, Baron Mellish|Robert Mellish]] resigned to work for the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] but, being opposed to the selection by his left-wing [[Constituency Labour Party]] of [[Peter Tatchell]], supported the former leader of [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark council]] John O'Grady as "[[Real Bermondsey Labour]]" giving an impression of Labour division and in-fighting.

At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], the SDP–Liberal Alliance won more than 25% of the national vote, close behind Labour's 28%, but well behind the 44% secured by the Conservatives. However, because of the characteristics of the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post electoral system]] used in the United Kingdom, only 23 Alliance MPs were elected, just six of whom were members of the SDP. The party's leader, Roy Jenkins, managed to retain his seat at [[Glasgow Hillhead]], but SDP President Shirley Williams was defeated at Crosby (which she had won at a by-election in November 1981) as a result of unfavourable boundary changes. Labour Party leader [[Michael Foot]], who resigned within days of the election, was critical of the SDP–Liberal Alliance for siphoning support away from Labour, allowing the Conservatives to win more seats and secure a triple-digit majority, while Labour was left with 209 seats in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/9/newsid_2500000/2500847.stm |title=1983: Thatcher wins landslide victory |publisher=BBC News |date=1970-06-09 |accessdate=2016-07-25}}</ref>

The MP for [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]], Dr. David Owen (who had been a Labour Government Minister under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] between 1974 and 1979), took over as SDP leader after the 1983 general election. He was more sceptical about close relations with the Liberals than his predecessor Roy Jenkins, and favoured retaining the party's distinct identity. Owen's influence ensured that proposals for a merger between the two parties were shelved after a lengthy debate at the 1983 SDP conference.

During the 1983–87 parliament, some SDP members started to become unsettled at what appeared to be the increasingly right-wing course taken by SDP leader David Owen. This resulted in some members launching the Limehouse Group in an attempt to keep the party on the centre-left course that was first propounded in the [[Limehouse Declaration]].

Two more SDP MPs were elected at [[by-election]]s during the 1983–87 parliament, but at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], the Alliance's share of the vote fell to 23%, and the SDP's parliamentary party was reduced from eight members to five. Roy Jenkins was among those who lost their seats. [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]] had won a [[1984 Portsmouth South by-election|by-election at Portsmouth South in 1984]] from the Conservatives which was lost in 1987, but [[Rosie Barnes]], who had won the bitterly contested [[1987 Greenwich by-election|Greenwich by-election]] in February 1987 from Labour; managed to hold on at the general election in June that year.

From the outset, the formation of the Alliance had raised questions as to whether it would lead to a merged party, or the two parties were destined to compete with each other. This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully. Such cross-party feuding was part of the reason for Jenkins losing his Glasgow Hillhead seat to [[George Galloway]] of the Labour Party in 1987.

Liberal pride was further damaged by the sustained lampooning of the Alliance by ITV's popular ''[[Spitting Image]]'' satirical puppet comedy programme, which portrayed Steel as the craven lickspittle of Owen; One sketch had Owen proposing to a simpering Steel that the parties merged under a new name: "and for our side we'll take 'Social Democratic', and from your side, we'll take 'Party'"; and indeed a new leader "from your side we will take 'David' and from ours 'Owen'", to which a hesitant Steel agreed.

==Merger, disestablishment and splits==
After the disappointment of 1987, Steel proposed a formal merger of the two parties.  Jenkins and Steel had believed this to be eventually inevitable after the party failed to break through at the 1983 election.  The proposal, also supported by Williams and Rodgers, was fiercely opposed by Owen, who argued that such a merger would not be accepted by the electorate, and would not reverse their declining share of the vote.  Jenkins denied that a merger had been his original intent.<ref name=royjenkins-autobio>{{cite book |page=535 |title=A Life at the Centre |first=Roy |last=Jenkins |isbn=978-1-84275-177-0 |publisher=Politico's |quote=The case for merger arose only once the partnership had been tried on the ground ...

But the majority of the SDP's membership (along with those of the Liberals) voted in favour of the union. Owen resigned as leader and was replaced by [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]]. Steel and Maclennan headed the new "Social and Liberal Democrats" party from 3 March 1988. An interim working name for the party, the "Democrats", was adopted by conference on 26 September 1988. This proved to be unpopular, and the party was renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989, as had been originally proposed at the September 1988 conference by the party's [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] branch.<ref>{{Cite news|last=White|first=Michael|date=2010-09-17|title=Liberal Democrat conferences past: how times – and people – change|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/17/liberal-democrat-conferences-past|access-date=2020-06-30|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Most SDP members, including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]], joined Maclennan in the merged party, but Owen created a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]], along with two other MPs, [[John Cartwright (UK politician)|John Cartwright]] and [[Rosie Barnes]]. This party performed poorly at the [[May 1990 Bootle by-election|May 1990 by-election]] in [[Bootle]], behind the [[Monster Raving Loony Party]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lib Dem meltdown: Five other humiliating by-election defeats|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-meltdown-five-other-humiliating-byelection-defeats-9500624.html|work=The Independent|date=6 June 2014}}</ref> It subsequently disbanded, although a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1990–present)|third SDP]] was formed, which currently operates on a much less influential scale.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philpot|first=Robert|title=The SDP lives on - in Bridlington|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/195459|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=16 January 2006}}</ref> There was also a continuing [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]], led by [[Michael Meadowcroft]] and David Morrish, mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool elected mayor candidates: Steve Radford, Liberal|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-elected-mayor-candidates-steve-3348321|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=8 May 2013}}</ref> It too continues in the present day, as one of the smallest political parties with elected representatives.

Following the dissolution of the SDP, a number of members endorsed [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] for the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page4356.html|title=Social Democrats Press Release - Supporting John Major|publisher=John Major official|date=17 February 1992}}</ref>
