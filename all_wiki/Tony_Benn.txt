'''Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn''' (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014) was a British politician, writer and diarist who served as a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet minister]] in the 1960s and 1970s. A member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Bristol South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South East]] and [[Chesterfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterfield]] respectively between [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]] and [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. He later served as President of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2001 to 2014.

The son of a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and later [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, Benn was born in [[Westminster]] and privately educated at [[Westminster School]]. He was elected for [[Bristol South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South East]] at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] but inherited [[Viscount Stansgate|his father's peerage]] on his death, which prevented him from continuing to serve as an MP. He fought to remain in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and campaigned for the ability to renounce the title, a campaign which succeeded with the [[Peerage Act 1963]]. He was an active member of the [[Fabian Society]] and served as Chairman from 1964 to 1965. In the [[Labour government, 1964–1970|Labour government]] of [[Harold Wilson]] from 1964 to 1970, he served first as [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], where he oversaw the opening of the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]] and later as [[Minister of Technology]].

Benn served as [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|Chairman of the National Executive Committee]] from 1971 to 1972 while in [[Loyal Opposition|opposition]]. In the [[Labour government, 1974–1979|Labour government of 1974–1979]], he returned to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Industry]] and subsequently [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State for Energy]]. He retained that post when [[James Callaghan]] succeeded Wilson as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. When the Labour Party was in opposition through the 1980s, he emerged as a prominent figure on the left wing of the party and unsuccessfully [[1988 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|challenged Neil Kinnock]] for the Labour leadership in 1988. After leaving Parliament at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Benn was President of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] until his death in 2014.

Benn was widely seen as a key proponent of [[democratic socialism]] and [[Christian socialism]]. Originally considered a moderate within the party, he was identified as belonging to its left wing after leaving ministerial office. The term "Bennite" came into usage as someone associated with [[left-wing politics]]. He was an influence on the politics of [[Jeremy Corbyn]], who was elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] a year after Benn's death, and [[John McDonnell]], who was Corbyn's [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

Benn's mother, [[Margaret Wedgwood Benn]] (''née'' Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, feminist and the founder President of the [[Congregational Federation]]. She was a member of the [[League of the Church Militant]], which was the predecessor of the [[Movement for the Ordination of Women]]; in 1925, she was rebuked by [[Randall Davidson]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], for advocating the [[ordination of women]]. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught [[righteousness]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsYKitlTrdYC&q=tony+benn+free+radical|title=Free Radical|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|page=226|isbn=978-0-8264-6596-2}}</ref>

Benn was for over 30 years a committed Christian.<ref>[https://www.historytoday.com/archive/forgotten-world-christian-socialism]</ref> He asserted that the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] had a "radical political importance" on his life, and made a distinction between the [[historical Jesus]] as "a carpenter of Nazareth" who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus.<ref name=TBJesus>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qC8KKdkeU|title=Tony Benn on Jesus|format=YouTube video|work=YouTube|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|access-date=29 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923124906/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qC8KKdkeU|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He believed that it was a "great mistake" to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain,<ref name=TBJesus /> and Higgins wrote in ''The Benn Inheritance'' that Benn was "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx".<ref name="Higgins1984">{{cite book|author=Sydney Higgins|title=The Benn Inheritance: The Story of a Radical Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aRhQgAACAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-78524-8|access-date=8 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320151423/https://books.google.com/books?id=1aRhQgAACAAJ|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}} Quoted in {{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Rob|title=Vital key to the real Tony Benn|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMtAAAAAIBAJ&pg=4768%2C5509048|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=27 September 1984|page=8}}</ref> (Indeed, he did not read ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' until he was in his 50s.<ref name="theguardian.com">[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries]</ref>) "The driving force of his life was [[Christian socialism]]," according to [[Peter Wilby]], linking Benn to the "high-minded" founding roots of Labour.<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]]. On ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' he said that he had been powerfully influenced by "what I would call the Dissenting tradition" (that is, the [[English Dissenters]] who left or [[Great Ejection|were ejected]] from the [[established church]], one of whom was his ancestor [[William Benn (divine)|Rev. William Benn]]).<ref>[https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/14-march/news/uk/tony-benn-leaves-life-to-spend-less-time-on-politics]</ref> "I've never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church", Benn said to the ''[[Catholic Herald]]''. "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now—well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why [[Margaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher|Mrs Thatcher]] pulled Britain out of [[UNESCO]]: she was not prepared, any more than [[Ronald Reagan]] was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a [[New World Information and Communication Order|New World Information Order]], people speaking to each other without the help of [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]] or [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell]]."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kenny|first1=Mary|title=Tony Benn 1925–2014: a politician shaped by Christianity|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2014/03/14/tony-benn-1925-2014-a-politician-shaped-by-christianity/|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=The Catholic Herald|date=14 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105546/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2014/03/14/tony-benn-1925-2014-a-politician-shaped-by-christianity/|archive-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Wilby in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Benn "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilby|first1=Peter|title=Tony Benn's banana diet, lapsed Christians and ignoring no smoking signs|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/tony-benn%E2%80%99s-banana-diet-lapsed-christians-and-ignoring-no-smoking-signs|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=New Statesman|date=27 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202082432/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/03/tony-benn%E2%80%99s-banana-diet-lapsed-christians-and-ignoring-no-smoking-signs|archive-date=2 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism.<ref name="Benn2015">{{cite book|author=Tony Benn|title=The Best of Benn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGkUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118|date=2 July 2015|publisher=Cornerstone|isbn=978-1-78475-032-9|page=118|access-date=5 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224112829/https://books.google.com/books?id=JGkUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA118|archive-date=24 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Wilby also wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that although former Chancellor [[Stafford Cripps]] described Benn as "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was "a Christian agnostic" who believed "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of "[[humanism|humanist]]".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilby|first1=Peter|title=Tony Benn: Peter Wilby reads the diaries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403101126/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/22/tony-benn-peter-wilby-reads-diaries|archive-date=3 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Benn joined and trained with the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] from the age of 16, later recalling in a speech made in 2009: "I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

Benn met [[Caroline Benn|Caroline Middleton DeCamp]] (born 13 October 1926, [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, United States) over tea at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], in 1949; just nine days after meeting her, he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from [[Oxford City Council]] and installed it in the garden of their home in [[Holland Park]]. Tony and Caroline had four children—[[Stephen Benn, 3rd Viscount Stansgate|Stephen]], [[Hilary Benn|Hilary]], [[Melissa Benn|Melissa]], a feminist writer, and Joshua—and 10 grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1375544/Caroline-Benn.html|title=Caroline Benn|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=24 November 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010|location=London, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120130139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1375544/Caroline-Benn.html|archive-date=20 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Two of Benn's children have been active in Labour Party politics. His eldest son Stephen was an elected Member of the [[Inner London Education Authority]] from 1986 to 1990.

==Early parliamentary career==
===Member of Parliament, 1950–1960===
Following the Second World War, Benn worked briefly as a [[BBC Radio]] producer. On 1 November 1950, he was selected to succeed [[Stafford Cripps]] as the Labour candidate for [[Bristol South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South East]], after Cripps stood down because of ill-health. He won the seat in [[1950 Bristol South East by-election|a by-election on 30 November 1950]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/366619.stm|title=The Benn dynasty|date=11 June 1999|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014000622/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/366619.stm|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Anthony Crosland]] helped him get the seat as he was the MP for nearby [[South Gloucestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Gloucestershire]] at the time.

In the 1950s, Benn held middle-of-the-road or soft left views, and was not associated with the young left wing group around [[Aneurin Bevan]].<ref name=BBCBRistolprofile>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/04/03/tony_benn_profile_feature.shtml|title=Profile: Tony Benn|work=BBC Bristol|date=4 April 2008|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69nZoBfIk?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/04/03/tony_benn_profile_feature.shtml|archive-date=9 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

As MP for Bristol South East, Benn helped organise the 1963 [[Bristol Bus Boycott]]<ref>{{cite news|title=How we organised to break racism on Bristol buses|url=https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/34583/|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=[[Socialist Worker]]|issue=2374|publisher=[[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]|date=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220071333/https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/34583/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> against the [[Racial segregation|colour bar]] of the [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] against employing [[Black British]] and [[British Asian]] drivers. Benn said that he would "stay off the buses, even if I have to find a bike", and Labour leader [[Harold Wilson]] also told an anti-apartheid rally in London he was "glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [boycott] campaign", adding that he "wish[ed] them every success".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Jon|title=What was behind the Bristol bus boycott?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23795655|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|date=27 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911105036/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23795655|archive-date=11 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Peerage reform===
Benn's father was created [[Viscount Stansgate]] in 1942 when [[Winston Churchill]] increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael, then serving in the RAF, was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a [[peerage]]. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir-apparent to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.<ref name=BBCBRistolprofile/>

In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn automatically became a peer, preventing him from sitting in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir [[Harry Hylton-Foster]], did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called.<ref>Tony Benn and Peter Kellner [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-kellner/tony-benns-finest-speech_b_4962794.html "Tony Benn's Finest Speech"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314160455/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-kellner/tony-benns-finest-speech_b_4962794.html |date=14 March 2014 }}, ''The Huffington Post'', 14 March 2014.</ref> Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to [[1961 Bristol South East by-election|retain his seat in a by-election]] caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An [[election court]] found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and [[Re Bristol South-East Parliamentary Election|declared the seat won]] by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] runner-up, [[Malcolm St Clair (politician)|Malcolm St Clair]], who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.<ref name="Election petition">''Re Parliamentary Election for Bristol South East'' [1964] 2 Q.B. 257, [1961] 3 W.L.R. 577.</ref>

Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament. Within two years, though, the [[Conservative Government 1957–64|Conservative Government]] of the time, which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., who were going to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/48 |title=Peerage Act 1963 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121223210742/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/48 |archive-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Jad Adams, ''Tony Benn: A Biography'' (MacMillan 1992) {{ISBN|978-1849540964}} pp. 203–204, e.g., Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and Lords Hogg and Douglas-Home.</ref> The [[Peerage Act 1963]], allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6&nbsp;pm on 31 July 1963.

==In government, 1964–1970==
In the [[First Wilson ministry|1964 Government]] led by [[Harold Wilson]], Benn was [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], where he oversaw the opening of the [[BT Tower|Post Office Tower]], then [[List of tallest buildings in the United Kingdom|the UK's tallest building]], and the creations of the Post Bus service and [[Girobank]].

In the [[Labour Government 1974–79|Labour Government of 1974]], Benn was [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Industry]] and as such increased [[nationalization|nationalised industry]] pay, provided better terms and conditions for workers such as the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974|Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] and was involved in setting up [[worker cooperative]]s in firms which were struggling,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hird|first=Christopher|url=http://www.newint.org/issue106/giants.htm|title=The Crippled Giants|work=New Internationalist|date=December 1981|accessdate=18 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125103953/http://www.newint.org/issue106/giants.htm|archive-date=25 November 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> the best known being at [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]], outside [[Coventry]], producing Triumph Motorcycles.

Later in his diary, (25 October 1977) Benn wrote that he "loathed" the EEC; he claimed it was "bureaucratic and centralised" and "of course it is really dominated by [[West Germany|Germany]]. All the Common Market countries except the UK have been occupied by Germany, and they have this mixed feeling of hatred and subservience towards the Germans".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|title=The Benn Diaries|publisher=Arrow|year=1995|page=432|isbn= 978-0-09-963411-9}}</ref>

Upon the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976, Benn described Mao as "one of the greatest—if not the greatest—figures of the twentieth century: a schoolteacher who transformed China, released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there" in his diaries, adding that "he certainly towers above any twentieth-century figure I can think of in his philosophical contribution and military genius".<ref name="Benn2013 p.367">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Benn|title=The Benn Diaries: 1940–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdCp8S5XK9wC&pg=PA367|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4464-9373-1|page=367}}</ref> On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao's death, Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was "a great admirer of Mao", while also admitting that "he made mistakes, because everybody does".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hoggart|first1=Simon|title=Simon Hoggart's week: the honour of being loathed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/18/honour-loathed-tony-benn-political-writer|accessdate=8 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418015751/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/18/honour-loathed-tony-benn-political-writer|archive-date=18 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Harold Wilson]] resigned as [[Labour Party (UK)#Leaders of the Labour Party since 1906|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in March 1976.

Benn withdrew from the second ballot and endorsed [[Michael Foot]]; [[James Callaghan]] eventually won. Despite not receiving his support in the second and third rounds of the vote, Callaghan kept Benn on as Energy Secretary. In 1976, there was a [[Pound sterling|sterling]] crisis, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] sought a loan from the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger [[welfare state]], Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers. As he highlighted, these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald and [[National Labour Organisation|his allies]] formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with Conservatives and Liberals. Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]], which consisted of a [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] economy less dependent on low-rate fresh borrowing, but the AES, which according to opponents would have led to a "siege economy", was rejected by the Cabinet.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Powell|first=David|title=Tony Benn: a political life|publisher=Continuum|location=London & New York|year=2003|edition=2nd|pages=82, 84|isbn=978-0-8264-7074-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYeVIfy0by8C&q=alternative%20economic%20strategy%20tony%20benn&pg=PA82}}</ref> In response, Benn later recalled that: "I retorted that their policy was a siege economy, only they had the bankers inside the castle with all our supporters left outside, whereas my policy would have our supporters in the castle with the bankers outside."<ref name="Bagely" /> Benn blamed the [[Winter of Discontent]] on these cuts to socialist policies.<ref name="Bagely" />

During Benn's time as energy minister from 1975–1979 he supported the [[nuclear power in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's use of nuclear power]]. However, later in his life he became an [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom|opponent of nuclear power]], attributing his time as running it as a minister to persuading him it was not cheap, safe or peaceful.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/11/anything-believe-life-ashamed |title= Tony Benn (1925-2014): "I would be ashamed if I ever said anything I didn't believe in" |work= New Statesman |author= Emily Mann |date= 29 October 2009 |accessdate= 16 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151228100619/http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/11/anything-believe-life-ashamed |archive-date= 28 December 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.channel4.com/news/by/michael-crick/blogs/ten-tony-benn |title= Ten things you may not have known about Tony Benn |work= Channel 4 News |author= Michael Crick |date= 14 March 2014 |accessdate= 16 March 2019}}</ref> When asked in an interview in January 2009 on what he had changed his mind on over the course of his life he expanded on this issue by saying:

Having been brought up on the Bible I liked the idea of swords into ploughshares. I advocated nuclear power as Minister of Technology.

Having been in charge of nuclear power I discovered it wasn’t cheap, wasn’t safe and when I left office I was told that during my period as Secretary of State for Energy, plutonium from our nuclear power stations went to the Pentagon to make nuclear weapons.

===Move to the left===

By the end of the 1970s, Benn's views had shifted to the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] of the Labour Party. He attributed this political shift to his experience as a Cabinet Minister in the [[First Wilson ministry|1964–1970 Labour Government]]. Benn ascribed his move to the left to four lessons:

# How "the Civil Service can frustrate the policies and decisions of popularly elected governments"
# The centralised nature of the Labour Party which allowed the Leader to run "the Party almost as if it were his personal kingdom"
# "The power of industrialists and bankers to get their way by use of the crudest form of economic pressure, even blackmail, against a Labour Government"
# The power of the media, which "like the power of the medieval Church, ensures that events of the day are always presented from the point of the view of those who enjoy economic privilege"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Benn |first=Tony |title=Out of the Wilderness: Diaries 1963–67 |publisher=Arrow |year=1988 |pages=xi–xiii |isbn=978-0-09-958670-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/outofwildernessd0000benn }}</ref>

As regards the power of industrialists and bankers, Benn remarked:

{{quote|Compared to this, the pressure brought to bear in industrial disputes by the unions is minuscule. This power was revealed even more clearly in 1976 when the [[International Monetary Fund]] secured cuts in our public expenditure. ... These [four] lessons led me to the conclusion that the UK is only superficially governed by MPs and the voters who elect them. [[Parliamentary system|Parliamentary democracy]] is, in truth, little more than a means of securing a periodical change in the management team, which is then allowed to preside over a system that remains in essence intact. If the British people were ever to ask themselves what power they truly enjoyed under our political system they would be amazed to discover how little it is, and some new [[Chartism|Chartist]] agitation might be born and might quickly gather momentum.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Benn |first=Tony |title=Out of the Wilderness: Diaries 1963–67 |url=https://archive.org/details/outofwildernessd0000benn |url-access=registration | year=1988 |page=xiii }}</ref>}}

==In opposition, 1979–1997==
In a keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference of 1980, shortly before the resignation of party leader [[James Callaghan]] and election of [[Michael Foot]] as successor, Benn outlined what he envisaged the next Labour Government would do. "Within days", a Labour Government would gain powers to nationalise industries, control capital and implement industrial democracy; "within weeks", all powers from Brussels would be returned to Westminster, and the [[House of Lords]] would be abolished by creating one thousand new peers and then abolishing the peerage.

Benn stood against [[Denis Healey]], the party's incumbent [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|deputy leader]], triggering the [[1981 Labour Party deputy leadership election|1981 deputy leadership election]], disregarding an appeal from [[Michael Foot]] to either stand for the leadership or abstain from inflaming the party's divisions. Benn defended his decision insisting that it was "not about personalities, but about policies". The result was announced on 27 September 1981; Healey retained his position by a margin of barely one per cent. The decision of several [[soft left]] MPs, including [[Neil Kinnock]], to abstain triggered the split of the [[Socialist Campaign Group]] from the left of the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune Group]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Seyd |first=Patrick |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Left |publisher=Macmillan Education |year=1987 |page=165 |isbn=978-0-333-44748-2}}</ref>
After [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentina invaded]] the [[Falkland Islands]] in April 1982, Benn argued that the dispute should be settled by the United Nations and that the British Government should not send a [[task force]] to recapture the islands. The task force was sent, and following the [[Falklands War]], they were back in British control by mid-June. In a debate in the Commons just after the Falklands were recaptured, Benn's demand for "a full analysis of the costs in life, equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war" was rejected by [[Margaret Thatcher]], who stated that "he would not enjoy the freedom of speech that he put to such excellent use unless people had been prepared to fight for it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104969|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|title=House of Commons Statement: Falkland Islands|date=15 June 1982|accessdate=4 October 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/697DYH6Yy?url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104969|archive-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

For the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 election]] Benn's Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes, and he lost to [[Michael Cocks]] in the selection of a candidate to stand in the new winnable seat of [[Bristol South (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South]].

However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a "regional matter" in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/chapter-06-1974-strikea-conversation-minerslabour-government-benn-helps-divide-miners|title=Chapter 06; ...1974 strike...a conversation with miners...Labour government...

In June 1985, three months after the miners admitted defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike. This would have included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) for the [[killing of David Wilkie]], a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1985/jun/28/miners-amnesty-general-pardon|title=Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon)|work=Hansard|date=28 June 1985|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/697DZTrd6?url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1985/jun/28/miners-amnesty-general-pardon|archive-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a list compiled by the magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' in 2006, he was voted twelfth in the list of "Heroes of our Time". In September 2006, Benn joined the "Time to Go" demonstration in [[Manchester]] the day before the final Labour Party Conference with [[Tony Blair]] as Leader of the Labour Party, with the aim of persuading the Government to withdraw troops from [[Iraq]], to refrain from attacking [[Iran]] and to reject replacing the [[Trident (missile)|Trident missile]] and [[Vanguard-class submarine|submarines]] with a new system.

For the [[2007 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2007 Labour Party leadership election]], Benn backed the left-wing MP [[John McDonnell]] in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn called for the government to hold a referendum on the [[Treaty of Lisbon|EU Reform Treaty]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7011231.stm|title=Give us EU referendum, says Benn|work=BBC News|date=24 September 2007|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203170159/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7011231.stm|archive-date=3 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> In October 2007, aged 82, and when it appeared that a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local [[Constituency Labour Party]] offering himself as a prospective candidate for the newly drawn [[Kensington (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington]] seat.

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]<!-- All were Conservatives at the time --> [[Daniel Hannan]], [[Douglas Carswell]] and [[David Cameron]] praised Benn in 2008. In their book ''The Plan'', Carswell and Hannan write that "Historically, it was the left that sought to disperse power among the people. ... It was the cause of the Levellers and the Chartists and the Suffragettes, the cause of religious toleration and meritocracy, of the secret ballot and universal education",<ref name="Sparrow2009">{{cite news|last1=Sparrow|first1=Andrew|title=Cameron joins Daniel Hannan in Tony Benn fan club|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/sep/18/cameron-hannan-tony-benn|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=18 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416180627/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/sep/18/cameron-hannan-tony-benn|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> adding: <blockquote>These days, though, the radical cause should have different targets. The elites have altered in character and composition. The citizen is far less likely to be impacted by the decisions of dukes or bishops than by those of Nice or his local education authority. The employees of these and similar agencies are, today, the unaccountable crown office-holders against whom earlier generations of radicals would have railed. Yet, with some exceptions—among whom, in a special place of honour, stands Tony Benn—few contemporary British leftists show any interest in dispersing power when doing so would mean challenging public sector monopolies.<ref name="Sparrow2009" /></blockquote>

Cameron also said in 2008 that, alongside [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', Benn's ''Arguments for Democracy'' was "a very powerful book which makes the important point that we vest power in people who are elected, and that we can get rid of, rather than those we can't".<ref name="Sparrow2009" />

At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he described the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as "Imperialist war(s)" and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Dad's Army]], saying: "If you are invaded you have a right to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?"<ref name="Stop the War Coalition"/>

In an interview published in Dartford Living in September 2009, Benn was critical of the Government's decision to delay the findings of the Iraq War Inquiry until after the general election, stating that "people can take into account what the inquiry has reported on but they’ve deliberately pushed it beyond the election. Government is responsible for explaining what it has done and I don't think we were told the truth."<ref name=dartford>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordadvertising.co.uk/uploaded_files/Dartford%20Living%20September%202009.pdf|title= Big Benn Chimes in to Dartford|date=September 2009|page=10 |work=Dartford Living|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008203657/http://www.dartfordadvertising.co.uk/uploaded_files/Dartford%20Living%20September%202009.pdf|archive-date=8 October 2011}}</ref> He also stated that local government was strangled by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and had not been liberated by [[New Labour]].<ref name=dartford/>

Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the [[multinational corporations]] have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...

==Illness and death==

Benn told the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' in 2007 that:<blockquote>I'd like to have on my gravestone: "He encouraged us." I'm proud to have been in the parliament that introduced the health service, the welfare state and voted against means testing. I did my maiden speech on nationalising the steel industry, put down the first motion for the boycott of South African goods, and resigned from the shadow cabinet in 1958 because of their support for nuclear weapons.

I think you do plant a few acorns, and I have lived to see one or two trees growing: gay rights, freedom of information, CND. I'm not claiming them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing.

I'm not ashamed of making mistakes. I've made a million mistakes and they're all in the diary. When we edit the diary—which is cut to around 10 per cent—every mistake has to be printed because people look to see if you do. I would be ashamed if I thought I'd ever said anything I didn't believe to get on, but making mistakes is part of life, isn't it?<ref>{{cite news|last1=Benn|first1=Tony|last2=German|first2=Lindsey|last3=Orr|first3=Judith|title=Interview|url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/317/tony-benn-life-outside|accessdate=6 February 2016|issue=317|date=September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206235150/http://socialistreview.org.uk/317/tony-benn-life-outside|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>
