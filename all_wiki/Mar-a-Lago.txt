'''Mar-a-Lago''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɑr|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|g|oʊ}}) is a resort and [[National Historic Landmark|national historic landmark]] in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], built from 1924 to 1927 by cereal-company heiress and socialite [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]]. The 126-room, {{Convert|62500|ft2||abbr=|adj=on}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-hurricane-irma-mar-a-lago-20170908-story.html|title=For Irma vs. Mar-a-Lago, the smart money is on Trump's house|first=Terry|last=Spencer|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> mansion contains the '''Mar-a-Lago Club''', a members-only club with guest rooms, a spa, and other hotel-style amenities. It is located in [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] on the Palm Beach [[barrier island]], with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east and Florida's Intracoastal Waterway to the west.

At the time of her death in 1973, Post bequeathed the property to the [[National Park Service]], hoping it could be used for [[state visit]]s or as a [[List of residences of Presidents of the United States#Winter White House|Winter White House]], but because the costs of maintaining the property exceeded the funds provided by Post, and it was difficult to secure the facility (as it is located in the flight path of Palm Beach Airport), the property was returned to the Post Foundation by an Act of Congress in 1981.<ref name="nytimes19810716">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/16/garden/post-home-for-sale-for-20.html|title=Post Home For Sale For $20|last = Gruson|first = Kerry |date = July 16, 1981 |newspaper = The New York Times | access-date= April 24, 2017}}</ref>

In September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump, who previously held primary residence in New York City.<ref name="nytresidency" /><ref name="cbsnewsresidence" /> 

It is the second largest mansion in the state of Florida and the [[List of largest houses in the United States|22nd largest mansion]] in the United States. In 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated the value of the estate at around [[United States dollar|$]]160 million, having appreciated greatly throughout the past decades since Trump's purchase due to several factors such as the extensive renovation, lavish features and furniture, the exclusivity of the location, as well as its historic meaning and significance.<ref name="Forbes" />

==Origin of the name==

The company identifies the name ''Mar-a-Lago'' as Spanish for "Sea-to-Lake",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-mar-a-lago-180965214/ |title=The Ironic History of Mar-a-Lago|author = Michael Luongo |website=SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE |date=November 2017|publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=October 12, 2020 }}</ref> referring to the fact that the resort extends the entire width of Palm Beach, from the Atlantic Ocean to what is now the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], but previously was known as [[Lake Worth Lagoon|Lake Worth]].

In the early 1990s, Trump faced financial difficulties.

The primary business occupying the estate is the Mar-a-Lago Club, which operates as resort and hotel for dues-paying members, and rents out estate venues for private events. Membership at the Mar-a-Lago Club required a $200,000 initiation fee up until 2012 when it was lowered to $100,000.

On October 3, 2006, Trump raised a {{convert|20|by|30|ft|adj=on}} [[American flag]] on an {{convert|80|ft|adj=on}} flagpole at Mar-a-Lago. Town [[zoning]] officials asked Trump to adhere to town zoning codes that limit flagpoles to a height of {{convert|42|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/31/s1b_trumpflag_1031.html|title=Town cites Trump, but big banner still waves|website=Palm Beach Post|date=31 October 2006|author1=O'Meilia, Tim  |accessdate=February 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111108/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/31/s1b_trumpflag_1031.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This dispute led the town council of Palm Beach to charge Trump $1,250 for every day the flag stayed up.

===Claim of discrimination===

In December 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit against the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Town of Palm Beach]] in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] alleging the town was discriminating against Mar-a-Lago for allowing black and Jewish members, groups not typically welcome in the area's other clubs.<ref name="seal201702" /> 

According to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', "Trump and his attorney had already implied that he and his club had been discriminated against because many of its members were Jewish, and, worse, that the council members who had placed the conditions on him had not placed those restrictions on their own clubs."<ref name="seal201702" /> The lawsuit was later settled.

===Aviation litigation===

Trump has repeatedly filed lawsuits against [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] over aircraft going to and from [[Palm Beach International Airport]] (PBI) allegedly affecting Mar-a-Lago.<ref name="Reid">{{cite news |first = Andy |last = Reid |url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-trump-airport-fight-palm-20151211-story.html |title = Trump's Airport Lawsuit Lingers as Presidential Bid Heats Up |work = South Florida Sun-Sentinel |date = December 11, 2015 }}</ref>

Trump first filed such a lawsuit in 1995; that action was settled in 1996, with the county agreeing to collaborate with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and to change flight patterns so the noisiest [[jet aircraft]] flew over a wider area.<ref name="Reid"/> As part of the settlement, Trump leased 215 acres from the county, on which he built the 18-hole [[Trump International Golf Club (West Palm Beach)|Trump International Golf Club]].{{r|seal201702}} In July 2010, Trump filed another lawsuit aiming to stop the airport from constructing a second [[Airliner|commercial]] [[runway]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Adam |last = Playford |url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/trump-sues-to-prevent-runway-expansion/nL8bb/ |title = Trump Sues to Prevent Runway Expansion |work = Palm Beach Post |date = July 20, 2010 }}</ref> That suit was dismissed.<ref name="Reid"/>

Trump filed a third suit against the county in January 2015, seeking $100 million in damages for "creating an unreasonable amount of noise, emissions and pollutants at Mar-a-Lago".<ref name="Reid"/> Trump claims that officials pressured the FAA to direct air traffic to PBI over Mar-a-Lago in a "deliberate and malicious" act.<ref name=usa.2015>{{cite news |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/01/12/trump-air-traffic-suit/21673979/ |first = Matt |last = Sedensky |title = Trump Sues for $100M, Says Air Traffic Targets Him |newspaper = [[USA Today]] |date = January 13, 2015 |access-date = February 23, 2015 }}</ref>

In November 2015, a [[Florida circuit courts|Florida Circuit Court]] judge ruled against most of Trump's arguments, dismissing four of the six claims and allowing the others to proceed.<ref name="Reid"/> Trump dropped the lawsuit after winning the presidency, as the estate will likely have a [[no-fly zone]] imposed by the FAA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20161116/NEWS06/912310533/Mar-a-Lago-no-fly-zone-renders-Trump-lawsuit-moot|title=Mar-a-Lago no-fly zone renders Trump lawsuit moot|website=Business Insurance|date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>{{r|seal201702}} In January 2017, Palm Beach exempted Mar-a-Lago from a ban on landing helicopters on residential properties while Trump is president, including his own fleet and [[Marine One]].<ref name="heliweb201701">{{Cite magazine |date=January 2017 |title=President Elect Trump Given Permission to Land Helicopter at Mar-A-Lago Estate |url=http://www.collectivemag.com/president-trump-landing-exemption/ |magazine=Collective Magazine}}</ref>

Trump received a $17 million insurance payment for hurricane damage to Mar-a-Lago after the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], for damage to the "landscaping, roofing, walls, painting, leaks, artwork in the tapestries, tiles, Spanish tiles, the beach, the erosion", as he described. [[Anthony Senecal]], Trump's former butler at the resort and later its "in-house historian", said some trees behind the resort had been flattened and some roof tiles were lost, but "That house has never been seriously damaged.
