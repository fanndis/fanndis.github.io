The '''New Left''' was a broad political movement mainly in the 1960s and 1970s consisting of activists in the [[Western world]] who campaigned for a broad range of social issues such as [[civil and political rights]], [[feminism]], [[Gay rights movement|gay rights]], [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]], [[gender role]]s and [[drug policy reform]]s.<ref name="Carmines and Layman">Carmines, Edward G., and Geoffrey C.

Some who self-identified as "New Left"<ref name="New Left">''The Left in History: Revolution and Reform in Twentieth-Century Politics''. 1996</ref> rejected involvement with the [[labor movement]] and Marxism's historical theory of [[class struggle]],<ref>Jeffrey W. Coker. ''Confronting American Labor: The New Left Dilemma''. Univ of Missouri Press, 2002</ref> although others gravitated to their own takes on established forms of Marxism, such as the [[New Communist movement]] (which drew from [[Maoism]]) in the United States or the [[K-Gruppe]]n (<small>[[:de:K-Gruppe|de]]</small>) in the [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German Sprachraum]]. In the United States, the movement was associated with the anti-war college-campus protest movements, including the [[Free Speech Movement]].

==Origins==
[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], is celebrated as the "Father of the New Left"<ref name=kellner12>{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm|author=Douglas Kellner|title=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=University of Texas}}</ref>]]
The origins of the New Left have been traced to several factors. Prominently, the confused response of the [[Communist Party of the USA]] and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] led some [[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectuals to develop a more democratic approach to politics, opposed to what they saw as the centralised and authoritarian politics of the pre-war leftist parties. Those Communists who became disillusioned with the Communist Parties due to their authoritarian character eventually formed the "new left", first among dissenting Communist Party intellectuals and campus groups in the United Kingdom, and later alongside campus radicalism in the United States and in the [[Western Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Kenny | first = Michael | title = The First New Left: British Intellectuals After Stalin | publisher = Lawrence & Wishart | location = London }}</ref> The term "nouvelle gauche" was already current in France in the 1950s, associated with ''[[France Observateur]]'', and its editor [[Claude Bourdet]], who attempted to form a third position, between the dominant [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] tendencies of the left, and the two Cold War blocs. It was from this French "new left" that the "First New Left" of Britain borrowed the term.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hall | first = Stuart | author-link = Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) | title = Life and times of the first New Left | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 61 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 2010 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/61/stuart-hall-life-and-times-of-the-first-new-left | ref = harv }}</ref>

The German-Jewish critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]] is referred to as the "Father of the New Left". He rejected the theory of class struggle and the Marxist concern with labor. According to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], Marcuse argued that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant". He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature, or [[Eros (concept)|Eros]], as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|page=[https://archive.org/details/goldenagemaincur00lesz/page/416 416]|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenagemaincur00lesz/page/416}}</ref> However, Marcuse also believed the concept of [[Logos]], which involves one's reason, would absorb [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] over time as well.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KMIkcicAowC&q=eros+and+civilization+logos&pg=PA125 |title=Eros and Civilization|author=Herbert Marcuse|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=125–126 |date=1955 |isbn=9781135863715|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>  Another prominent New Left thinker, [[Ernst Bloch]], believed that socialism would prove the means for all human beings to become immortal and eventually create God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldenagemaincur00lesz/page/436 436–440]|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenagemaincur00lesz/page/436}}, quoting ''Dans Prinzip Hoffnung'' pp. 1380–1628.</ref>

The writings of sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]], who popularized the term New Left in a 1960 open letter,<ref>{{cite web | last = Wright | first = C. Wright | author-link = C. Wright Mills | title = Letter to the New Left | url =http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/letter-new-left.htm | website = marxists.org | date = 1960 }}</ref> would also give great inspiration to the movement. Mills' biographer, Daniel Geary, writes that his writings had a "particularly significant impact on New Left social movements of the 1960s."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4yNnGJLHU8C&dq=c+wright+mills+%22university+of+maryland%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Radical Ambition: C. Wright Mills, the Left, and American Social Thought''] By Daniel Geary, p. 1.</ref>

== Latin America ==
The New Left in Latin America can be loosely defined as the collection of political parties, radical grassroots social movements (such as indigenous movements, student movements, mobilizations of landless rural workers, afro-descendent organizations and feminist movements), guerilla organizations (such as the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions) and other organizations (such as trade unions, ''campesino'' leagues and human rights organizations) that comprised the left between 1959 (with the beginning of the Cuban Revolution) and 1990 (with the fall of the Berlin Wall).<ref name="auto">{{Cite book |title=The New Latin American Left: Utopia Reborn |author=Patrick Barrett |author2=Daniel Chavez |author3=César Rodríguez-Garavito |publisher=Pluto Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Influential Latin American thinkers such as Francisco de Oliveira argued that the United States used Latin American countries as "peripheral economies" at the expense of Latin American society and economic development, which many saw as an extension of [[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|neo-imperialism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dependency and development in Latin America|author=Cardoso, F.H. |author2=Faletto, E. |publisher=University of California Press.|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> This shift in thinking led to a surge of dialogue related to how Latin America could assert its social and economic independence from the United States. Many scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} argued that a shift to socialism could help liberate Latin America from this conflict.

The New Left emerged in Latin America, a group which sought to go beyond existing [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] efforts at achieving economic equality and democracy to include social reform and address issues unique to Latin America such as racial and ethnic equality, indigenous rights, the rights of the environment, demands for radical democracy, international solidarity, anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism and other aims.<ref name="auto"/>

==United Kingdom==
As a result of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]] many abandoned the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and began to rethink its [[orthodox Marxism]]. Some joined various [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] groupings or the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Dennis L. Dworkin (1997). ''Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain: history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies''. p. 46.</ref>

The Marxist historians [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[John Saville]] of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] published a dissenting journal within the CPGB called ''Reasoner''. Refusing to discontinue the publication at the behest of the CPGB, the two were suspended from party membership and relaunched the journal as ''[[New Reasoner|The New Reasoner]]'' in the summer of 1957.

Thompson was especially important in bringing the concept of a "New Left" to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1959 with a ''New Reasoner'' lead essay, in which he described

<blockquote>
"...[A] generation which never looked upon the [[Soviet Union]] as a weak but heroic Workers' State; but rather as the nation of the [[Great Purges]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Stalin's cult of personality|Byzantine Birthday]] and of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]; as the vast military and industrial power which repressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian rising]] and threw the first [[Sputnik 1|sputniks]] into space. ... <br><br>

"A generation nourished on ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]],'' which enters politics at the extreme point of disillusion where the middle-aged begin to get out. The young people ... are enthusiastic enough. But their enthusiasm is not for the Party, or the Movement, or the established Political Leaders. They do not mean to give their enthusiasm cheaply away to any routine machine. They expect the politicians to do their best to trick or betray them. ... They prefer the amateur organisation and amateurish platforms of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|Nuclear Disarmament Campaign]] to the method and manner of the left wing professional. ... They judge with the critical eyes of the first generation of the Nuclear Age."<ref>E.P, Thompson, "The New Left," ''The New Reasoner,'' whole no. 9 (Summer 1959), pp. 1-2.</ref></blockquote>

Later that year, Saville published a piece in the same journal which identified the emergence of the British New Left as a response to the increasing political irrelevance of socialists inside and outside the Labour Party during the 1950s, which he saw as being the result of a failure by the established left to come to grips with the political changes that had come to pass internationally after World War II and with the [[post–World War II economic expansion]] and the socio-economic legacy of the [[Attlee ministry]]:

<blockquote>
"The most important single reason for the miserable performance of the Left in this past decade is the simple fact of its intellectual collapse in the face of full employment and the welfare state at home, and of a new world situation abroad. The Left in domestic matters has produced nothing of substance to offset the most important book of the decade - Crosland's "The Future of Socialism " - a brilliant restatement of [[Fabian society|Fabian]] ideas in contemporary terms. We have made no sustained critique of the economics of capitalism in the 1950s, and our vision of a socialist society has changed hardly at all since the days of [[Keir Hardie]]. Certainly a minority has begun to recognise our deficiencies in the most recent years, and there is no doubt that the seeds which have already been sown will bring an increasing harvest as we move along the sixties. But we still have a long way to go, and there are far too many timeless militants for whom the mixture is the same as before."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Saville |first1=John |author-link1=John Saville|date=Autumn 1959|title=A Note on West Fife |url=http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/nr/10_09.pdf |access-date=20 November 2016  |journal=[[New Reasoner]] |issue=10 |pages=9–13}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1960, ''The New Reasoner'' merged with the ''[[Universities and Left Review]]'' to form the ''[[New Left Review]]''. These journals attempted to synthesise a theoretical position of a [[Marxist revisionism]], [[humanism|humanist]], [[socialist]] Marxism, departing from [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theory. This publishing effort made the ideas of culturally oriented theorists available to an undergraduate reading audience.

In this early period, many on the New Left were involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), formed in 1957. According to [[Robin Blackburn]], "The decline of CND by late 1961, however, deprived the New Left of much of its momentum as a movement, and uncertainties and divisions within the Board of the journal led to the transfer of the Review to a younger and less experienced group in 1962."<ref>{{Cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = A brief history of New Left Review | url = http://newleftreview.org/history | website = newleftreview.org | publisher = [[New Left Review]] }}</ref>

Under the long-standing editorial leadership of [[Perry Anderson]], the ''New Left Review'' popularised the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]] and other forms of Marxism.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = A brief history of New Left Review | url = http://newleftreview.org/history | website = newleftreview.org | publisher = [[New Left Review]] | quote = Anderson took over as editor in 1962.}}</ref> Other periodicals like ''[[Socialist Register]]'', started in 1964, and ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', started in 1972, have also been associated with the New Left, and published a range of important writings in this field.

As the campus orientation of the American New Left became clear in the mid to late 1960s, the student sections of the British New Left began taking action. The [[London School of Economics]] became a key site of British student militancy.<ref>Hoch and Schoenbach, 1969</ref> The influence of protests against the [[Vietnam War]] and of the [[May 1968 events]] in France were also felt strongly throughout the British New Left. Some within the British New Left joined the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]], which later became [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] while others became involved with groups such as the [[International Marxist Group]].<ref>Ian Adams, ''Ideology and politics in Britain today'' (1998) p. 191</ref> The politics of the British New Left can be contrasted with [[Solidarity, UK|Solidarity]], which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.<ref>[[Tariq Ali]] ''Street-Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties'' (2005)</ref>

Another significant figure in the British New Left was [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], a black cultural theorist in Britain. He was the founding editor of the ''[[New Left Review]]'' in 1960.

The New Left Review, in an obituary following Hall's death in February 2014, wrote "His exemplary investigations came close to inventing a new field of study, 'cultural studies'; in his vision, the new discipline was profoundly political in inspiration and radically interdisciplinary in character."<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Blackburn | first = Robin | author-link = Robin Blackburn | title = Stuart Hall: 1932-2014 | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 86 | publisher = New Left Review | date = March–April 2014 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/86/robin-blackburn-stuart-hall-1932-2014 | ref = harv }}</ref>

Numerous Black British scholars attributed their interest in cultural studies to Hall, including [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Isaac Julien]], and [[John Akomfrah]]. In the words of Indian literary theorist [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]], "Academics worldwide could not think 'Black Britain' before Stuart Hall. And in Britain the impact of Cultural Studies went beyond the confines of the academy."<ref>Chakravorty Spivak, Gayatri.

Among Hall's New Left works were the ''May Day Manifesto'', which reflected a "growing disillusionment on the left with what the authors argued to be the surrendering of socialist principles by the Labour Party"<ref>[http://senatehouseoccupation.wordpress.com/reflections-and-recollections/the-may-day-manifesto/ "The May Day Manifesto"]. An Emotional Involvement. Retrieved 5 December 2014.</ref> and ''Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order'', which contemporary book reviewer John Horton described as "nothing less than an analysis of how the British state is managing the current 'crisis of hegemony'".<ref>Horton, John.

==United States==
In the United States, the "New Left" was the name loosely associated with liberal, radical, Marxist political movements that took place during the 1960s, primarily among college students. At the core of this was the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS).<ref>David Burner, ''Making Peace with the 60s'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), 151.</ref> Noting the perversion of "the older Left" by "Stalinism", in their 1962 Port Huron Statement the SDS eschewed "formulas" and "closed theories." Instead they called for a "new left . . . committed to deliberativeness, honesty [and] reflection."<ref>The Port Huron Statement. http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/SDS_Port_Huron.html</ref> The New Left that developed in the years that followed was "a loosely organized, mostly white student movement that advocated for democracy, civil rights, and various types of university reforms, and protested against the Vietnam war".<ref>Edited by John McMillian & Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 5.</ref>

The term "New Left" was popularised in the United States in an open letter written in 1960 by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]] (1916–62) entitled ''Letter to the New Left''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Letter to the New Left |author=C. Wright Mills|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/letter-new-left.htm|journal=New Left Review|number=5|year=1960}}</ref> Mills argued for a new [[left-wing politics|leftist]] ideology, moving away from the traditional ("[[Old Left]]") focus on labor issues, into a broader focus towards issues such as opposing [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[anomie]], and [[authoritarianism]]. Mills argued for a shift from traditional leftism, toward the values of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and emphasized an international perspective on the movement.<ref>Daniel Geary, "'Becoming International Again': C. Wright Mills and the Emergence of a Global New Left, 1956–1962," ''Journal of American History,'' Dec 2008, Vol. 95 Issue 3, pp. 710–736</ref> According to David Burner, C. Wright Mills claimed that the proletariat (collectively the working-class referencing Marxism) were no longer the revolutionary force; the new agents of revolutionary change were young intellectuals around the world.<ref>David Burner, ''Making Peace with the 60s'', (Princeton University Press, 1996), 155</ref>

A [[student protest]] called the [[Free Speech Movement]] took place during the 1964–1965 academic year on the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under the informal leadership of students [[Mario Savio]], Brian Turner, [[Bettina Aptheker]], Steve Weissman, Art Goldberg, [[Jackie Goldberg]], and others. In protests unprecedented in this scope at the time, students insisted that the university administration lift the ban of on-campus political activities and acknowledge the students' right to [[free speech]] and [[academic freedom]]. In particular, on 2 December 1964 on the steps of [[Sproul Hall]], [[Mario Savio]] gave a famous speech: "But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be—have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean—Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings! ... There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious—makes you so sick at heart—that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mariosaviosproulhallsitin.htm|title=American Rhetoric: Mario Savio - Sproul Hall Sit-In Address|first=Michael E.|last=Eidenmuller|website=www.americanrhetoric.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>

The New Left opposed what it saw as the prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "[[The Establishment]]", and those who rejected this authority became known as "[[Anti-establishment|anti-Establishment]]". The New Left focused on [[social activist]]s and their approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]].

The New Left in the United States also included anarchist, [[countercultural]], and [[hippie]]-related radical groups such as the [[Yippies]] (who were led by [[Abbie Hoffman]]), [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]],<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}</ref> [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]], and the [[White Panther Party]]. By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.<ref name="Lytle_2006_213215">{{Citation

Many New Left thinkers in the United States were influenced by the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]]. Some in the U.S. New Left argued that since the Soviet Union could no longer be considered the world center for proletarian revolution, new revolutionary Communist thinkers had to be substituted in its place, such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Fidel Castro]].<ref>Edward J. Bacciocco, ''The New Left in America: reform to revolution, 1956 to 1970'' (1974) p. 21</ref> [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Whole World Is Watching'' in describing the movement's influences stated, "The New Left, again, refused the self-discipline of explicit programmatic statement until too late—until, that is, the Marxist–Leninist sects filled the vacuum with dogmas, with clarity on the cheap."<ref>[[Todd Gitlin]], ''The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making & Unmaking of the New Left'', University of California Press, 2003, p. 179</ref>

Isserman (2001) reports that the New Left "came to use the word 'liberal' as a political epithet".<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''The other American: the life of Michael Harrington'' (2001) p. 276</ref> Historian Richard Ellis (1998) says that the SDS's search for their own identity "increasingly meant rejecting, even demonizing, liberalism."<ref>Richard J. Ellis, ''The dark side of the Left: illiberal Egalitarianism in America'' (1998) p. 129</ref> As Wolfe (2010) notes, "no one hated liberals more than leftists".<ref>Alan Wolfe, "Jeremiah, American-style," ''New Republic'', May 13, 2010, p. 31</ref>

Other elements of the U.S. New Left were anarchist and looked to [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] traditions of American [[Far left|radicalism]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and union militancy.  This group coalesced around the historical journal ''Radical America''. American [[Autonomist Marxism]] was also a child of this stream, for instance in the thought of [[Harry Cleaver]]. [[Murray Bookchin]] was also part of the anarchist stream of the New Left, as were the Yippies.<ref>Paul Avrich, ''Anarchist voices: an oral history of anarchism in America'' (2005) p. 527</ref>

The U.S. New Left drew inspiration from black radicalism, particularly the [[Black Power]] movement and the more explicitly [[Maoist]] and militant [[Black Panther Party]]. The Panthers in turn influenced other similar militant groups, like the [[Young Lords]], the [[Brown Berets]] and the [[American Indian Movement]]. The New Left was also inspired by [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Students immersed themselves into poor communities building up support with the locals.<ref name="autogenerated2000">Maurice Isserman & Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 169.</ref> The New Left sought to be a broad based, grass roots movement.<ref>Edited by John McMillian & Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 4</ref>

The [[Vietnam War]] conducted by liberal President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was a special target across the worldwide New Left. Johnson and his top officials became unwelcome on American campuses.  The [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-war movement]] escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]].

Environmentalism also gave rise to various other social justice movements such as the environmental justice movement, which aims to prevent the toxification of the environment of minority and disadvantaged communities.<ref name=Kaufman/>

By 1968, however, the New Left coalition began to split. The anti-war Democratic [[presidential nomination]] campaign of Kennedy and McCarthy brought the central issue of the New Left into the mainstream liberal establishment. The 1972 nomination of [[George McGovern]] further highlighted the new influence of Liberal protest movements within the Democratic establishment. Increasingly, feminist and gay rights groups became important parts of the Democratic coalition, thus satisfying many of the same constituencies that were previously unserved by the mainstream parties.<ref name="Carmines and Layman"/> This institutionalization took away all but the most radical members of the New Left. The remaining radical core of the SDS, dissatisfied with the pace of change, incorporated violent tendencies towards social transformation. After 1969, the Weathermen, a surviving faction of SDS, attempted to launch a guerrilla war in an incident known as the "Days of Rage". Finally, in 1970 three members of the Weathermen blew themselves up in a Greenwich Village brownstone trying to make a bomb out of a stick of dynamite and an alarm clock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=376 |title=America in Ferment: The Tumultuous 1960s |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116170600/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=376 |archive-date=2011-11-16 |website=Digital History |publisher=University of Houston}}</ref> Port Huron Statement participant [[Jack Newfield]] wrote in 1971 that "in its Weathermen, Panther and Yippee incarnations, [the New Left] seems anti-democratic, terroristic, dogmatic, stoned on rhetoric and badly disconnected from everyday reality".<ref name="newfield19710719">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39 | title=A Populist Manifesto: The Making of a New Majority | work=New York | date=1971-07-19 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Newfield, Jack | pages=39–46}}</ref> In contrast, the more moderate groups associated with the New Left increasingly became central players in the Democratic Party and thus in mainstream American politics.

===Hippies and Yippies===
{{Main|Hippies|Yippies}}
[[File:Abbie Hoffman visiting the University of Oklahoma circa 1969.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Abbie Hoffman]], leader of the countercultural protest group the Yippies]]
The hippie [[subculture]] was originally a [[youth movement]] that arose in the [[United States]] during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The [[Hippie (etymology)|word 'hippie']] came from ''[[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]'', and was initially used to describe [[beatnik]]s who had moved into New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] and San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. The origins of the terms ''[[Hip (slang)|hip]]'' and ''hep'' are uncertain, though by the 1940s both had become part of [[African American culture|African American]] [[African American Vernacular English|jive]] slang and meant "currently fashionable; fully up-to-date".<ref>To say "I'm hip to the situation" means "I am aware of the situation. See: {{Citation| last = Sheidlower| first = Jesse | author-link = Jesse Sheidlower| date = 2004-12-08| title = Crying Wolof: Does the word hip really hail from a West African language?| publisher = [[Slate Magazine]]| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2110811/ | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hep|title=Hep|work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hep|title=Hep|work=Merriam-Webster}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/dictionary?query=hep|title=Hep|encyclopedia=Britannica}}</ref> The Beats adopted the term ''hip'', and early hippies inherited the language and [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural values]] of the [[Beat Generation]] and mimicked some of the current values of the British [[Mod (subculture)|Mod scene]].  Hippies created their own communities, listened to [[psychedelic rock]], embraced the [[sexual revolution]], and some used drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s to explore [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].

The [[Yippies]], who were seen as an offshoot of the hippie movements parodying as a political party, came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]], when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York, resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as "Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!" Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, "[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]" (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html "The Politics of Yip"]. ''TIME Magazine''. April 5, 1968.</ref> In Cambridge, hippies congregated each Sunday for a large "be-in" at Cambridge Park with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement. In the United States the hippie movement started to be seen as part of the "New Left" which was associated with anti-war college campus protest movements.<ref name="Carmines and Layman"/>

===Students for a Democratic Society===
{{Main|Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)}}
The organization that really came to symbolize the core of the New Left was the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). By 1962, the SDS had emerged as the most important of the new campus radical groups; soon it would be regarded as virtually synonymous with the "New Left".<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''If I Had a Hammer: The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left'' (New York: Basic Books Inc Publishers, 1987) 174.</ref> In 1962, [[Tom Hayden]] wrote its founding document, the [[Port Huron Statement]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html |title=Port Huron Statement of the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 |publisher=Coursesa.matrix.msu.edu |accessdate=2012-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705062937/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/huron.html |archivedate=2009-07-05 }}</ref> which issued a call for "participatory democracy" based on non-violent civil disobedience. This was the idea that individual citizens could help make 'those social decisions determining the quality and direction' of their lives.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> The SDS marshaled antiwar, pro-civil rights and [[Free Speech Movement|free speech]] concerns on campuses, and brought together liberals and more revolutionary leftists.
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]], 21 October 1967]]
The SDS became the leading organization of the anti-war movement on college campuses during the [[Vietnam War]]. As the war escalated the membership of the SDS also increased greatly as more people were willing to scrutinise political decisions in moral terms.<ref name=Isserman>Maurice Isserman & Michael Kazin, ''America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).</ref>{{rp|170}} During the course of the war, the people became increasingly [[Militant (word)|militant]]. As opposition to the war grew stronger, the SDS became a nationally prominent political organization, with opposing the war an overriding concern that overshadowed many of the original issues that had inspired SDS. In 1967, the old statement in Port Huron was abandoned for a new call for action,<ref name=Isserman/>{{rp|172}} which would inevitably lead to the destruction of the SDS.

In 1968 and 1969, as its radicalism reached a fever pitch, the SDS began to split under the strain of internal dissension and increasing turn towards [[Maoism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Politics of the Self : Feminism and the Postmodern in West German Literature and Film|last=McCormick|first=Richard|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781400861644|location=|pages=34|quote=In 1969, the American organization ruptured into two factions, one Maoist and one proterrorist.}}</ref> Along with adherents known as the [[New Communist Movement]], some extremist illegal factions also emerged, such as the [[Weather Underground]] organization.

The SDS suffered the difficulty of wanting to change the world while 'freeing life in the here and now.' This caused confusion between short-term and long-term goals. The sudden growth due to the successful rallies against the Vietnam War meant there were more people wanting action to end the Vietnam war, whereas the original New Left had wanted to focus on critical reflection.<ref>Edited by John McMillian & Paul Buhle, ''The New Left Revisited'', (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003), 3.</ref> In the end, it was the anti-war sentiment that dominated the SDS.<ref name=Isserman/>{{rp|183}}

===The New Storefront Left===
Stung by the criticism that they were "high on analysis, low on action," and in "the year of the 'discovery of poverty" (in 1963 [[Michael Harrington]]'s book, ''The Other America''<ref>Michael Harrington, ''The Other America'',  Macmillan, 1962</ref> "was the rage"), the SDS launched the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP).<ref>Richard Rothstein, ''A Short History of ERAP'' http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt4k4003k7</ref> Conceived by [[Tom Hayden]] as forestalling "white backlash", community-organizing initiatives would unite Black, Brown, and White workers around a common program for economic change. The leadership commitment was sustained barely two years. With no early sign in the neighborhoods of an interracial movement that would "collectivize economic decision making and democratize and decentralize every economic, political, and social institution in America," many SDS organizers were readily induced by the escalating U.S. commitment in Vietnam to abandon their storefront offices, and heed the anti-war call to return to campus.<ref>Manfred McDowell (2013), "A Step into America: The New Left Organizes the Neighborhood," ''New Politics'' Vol. XIV No. 2, pp. 133-141</ref>

In some of ERAP projects, such as the JOIN ("Jobs or Income Now") project in uptown Chicago, SDSers were replaced by white working-class activists (some bitterly conscious that their poor backgrounds had limited their acceptance within "the Movement"). In community unions such JOIN and its successors in Chicago, the Young Patriots and Rising Up Angry, White Lightening in the Bronx, and the October 4th Organization in Philadelphia white radicals (open in the debt they believed they owed to the SNCC and to the Black Panthers) continued to organise rent strikes, health and legal clinics, housing occupations and street protests against police brutality.<ref>Amy Sony, James Tracy (2011), ''Hillbilly Nationalists, Urban Race Rebels, and Black Power: Community Organizing in Radical Times''. Brooklyn, Melville House</ref>

While city-hall and police harassment was a factor, internal tensions ensured that these radical community-organizing efforts did not long survive the sixties.<ref>McDowell</ref>  [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] recalls that the most dispiriting feature of the ERAP experience was that, however much they might talk at night about "transforming the system," "building alternative institutions," and "revolutionary potential," the organizers knew that their credibility on the doorstep rested on an ability to secure concessions from, and thus to develop relations with, the local power structures. Far from erecting parallel structures, projects were built "around all the shoddy instruments of the state." ERAPers were caught in "a politics of adjustment."<ref>Kirkpatrick Sale (1973), ''SDS: The Rise and Development of The Students for a Democratic Society''. Random House</ref>

==Continental European New Left==
{{main|Protests of 1968}}
{{Frankfurt School}}
The European New Left appeared first in West Germany, which became a prototype for European student radicals.<ref>Stanley Rothman and S. Robert Lichter, ''Roots of radicalism: Jews, Christians, and the Left'' (1996) p. 354</ref> German students protesting against the Vietnam war often wore discarded US military uniforms, and they made influential contacts with dissident GIs—draftees who did not like the war either.<ref>Maria Hohn and Seungsook Moon, ''Over There: Living with the U.S. Military Empire from World War Two to the Present'' (2010) p. 275</ref>

In Europe [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] counterculture movement in the mid-1960s that focused on provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait. One manifestation of this was the French general strike that took place in Paris in May 1968, which nearly toppled the French government. In France the [[Situationist International]] reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]] and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. The expressed writing and political theory of these texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 insurrections in France]]; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.<ref name="Plant1992TheMost">{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}</ref> Another was the [[German student movement]] of the 1960s. [[Kommune 1]] or K1 was the first politically motivated [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in [[Germany]]. It was created on January 12, 1967, in [[West Berlin]] and finally dissolved in November 1969. During its entire existence, Kommune 1 was infamous for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between [[satire]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]. These events served as inspiration for the "[[Revolutionary spontaneity|Sponti]]" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstraße in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music, and drugs. All of a sudden, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, among them [[Jimi Hendrix]], who turned up one morning in the bedroom of Kommune 1.<ref>''Keith Richards: The Biography'', by Victor Bockris</ref> The [[Underground (British subculture)|underground]] was a [[counterculture|countercultural]] movement in the [[United Kingdom]] linked to the [[subculture|underground culture]] in the [[United States]] and associated with the [[hippie]] phenomenon. Its primary focus was around [[Ladbroke Grove]] and [[Notting Hill]] in [[London]]. It generated its own magazines and newspapers, bands, clubs and alternative lifestyle, associated with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and LSD use and a strong socio-political revolutionary agenda to create an alternative society. The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]] and [[West Berlin]] rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers.

The [[Prague Spring]] was legitimised by the Czechoslovak government as a socialist reform movement. The 1968 events in the Czechoslovakia were driven forward by [[Industrial sector|industrial]] workers, and were explicitly theorized by active Czechoslovak unionists as a revolution for workers' control. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The student activism of the New Left came to a head around the world in 1968. The [[May 1968 protests in France]] temporarily shut down the city of [[Paris]], while the [[German student movement]] did the same in [[Bonn]]. Universities were simultaneously occupied in May in Paris, in the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]], and in Japanese student strikes. Shortly thereafter, Swedish students [[Occupation of the Student Union Building|occupied a building at Stockholm University]]. However, all of these protests were shut down by police authorities without achieving their goals, which caused the influence of the student movement to lapse in the 1970s.

[[File:Situationist.jpg|thumb|240px|May 1968 slogan in [[Paris]] which reads: "It is forbidden to forbid!"]]
While the [[Autonomia]] in Italy have been called New Left, it is more appropriate to see them as the result of traditional, industrially oriented, communism re-theorising its ideas and methods.  Unlike most of the New Left, Autonomia had a strong blue-collar arm, active in regularly occupying factories. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Globally==
The [[New Left (Japan)|New Left in Japan]] began by occupying college campuses for several years in the 1960s. After 1970, they splintered into several freedom fighter groups including the [[United Red Army]] and the [[Japanese Red Army]]. They also developed the political ideology of [[Anti-Japaneseism]].

The [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (''Partido dos Trabalhadores'' – PT) is considered the main organization to emerge from the New Left in Brazil. According to Manuel Larrabure, "rather than taking the path of the old Latin American left, in the form of the guerrilla movement, or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] party", PT decided to try something new, while being aided by [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]] and other social movements. Its challenge was to "combine the institutions of [[liberal democracy]] with [[popular participation]] by communities and movements". However, PT has been criticized for its "strategic alliances" with the right-wing after [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] was [[Brazilian presidential election, 2002|elected president of Brazil]]. The party has distanced itself from social movements and youth organizations and for many it seems the PT's model of a new left is reaching its limits.<ref>Larrabure, Manuel.

In [[Australia]], the New Left was engaged in debates concerning the legitimacy of [[heterodox economics]] and [[political economy]] in tertiary education.<ref>G Butler, E Jones, FJB Stilwell (2009) Political economy now!: The struggle for alternative economics at the University of Sydney Darlington Press</ref> This culminated in the establishment of an [[Frank Stilwell (economist)|independent department of Political Economy]] at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref>Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016) "Radical Theories of Capitalism in Australia: Towards a Historiography of the Australian New Left", Honours Thesis, University of Sydney, viewed 20 April 2017, https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/16655</ref><ref>http://sydney.edu.au/arts/political_economy/ viewed 03/05/2017</ref>
