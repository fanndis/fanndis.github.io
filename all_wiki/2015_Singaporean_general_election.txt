==Background==
The maximum term of a Singaporean parliament is five years, within which it must be dissolved by the President and elections held within three months, as stated in the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore | work=Attorney-General's Chambers of Singapore website | url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?&actno=1999-REVED-CONST&date=latest&method=part&segid=931158660-001483#931158660-001928 | access-date=17 December 2008}}</ref> As like the previous elections since 1959, voting is compulsory and results are based on the [[first-past-the-post]] system. Elections are conducted by the [[Elections Department]], which is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office.

The General Election was the 17th General Election in Singapore and is the 12th since independence in 1965. The election coincides with the golden jubilee of the Republic of Singapore's founding.

The governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) have secured their 14th consecutive term in office since 1959. This will be the PAP's third election with [[Lee Hsien Loong]] as its Secretary-General, and the country's first election after the passing of its founding Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. Some analysts suggested that an early election was indeed possible to garner "sympathy votes" might well backfire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameface.ph/archive/index.php/t-30244.html?s=8846dc31eaa18cdeb6f935e223e52c7c|title=LEE KWAN YEW, Father of Modern Singapore, 1924-2015 [Archive] - GameFace.Ph|website=www.gameface.ph|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Chandran|first=Nyshka|date=2015-03-24|title=Will Singaporean politics change post-LKY?|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/24/will-singaporean-politics-change-post-lky.html|access-date=2020-09-21|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref> It is also the country's first election where there are no walkovers in any of the constituencies, as voting will take place in [[Tanjong Pagar GRC]] for the first time.

===Political parties===
{{main|List of political parties in Singapore}}

===Electoral divisions===
{{main|List of Singaporean electoral divisions (2015–20)}}
The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee is convened before every general election to review electoral boundaries in view of population growth and shifts. The Committee is appointed by the Prime Minister. The new electoral divisions were published on 24 July 2015, indicating the beginning of an election cycle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/pdf/White%20Paper%20on%20the%20Report%20of%20the%20Electoral%20Boundaries%20Review%20Committee%202015.pdf#zoom=100 |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012150707/http://www.eld.gov.sg/pdf/White%20Paper%20on%20the%20Report%20of%20the%20Electoral%20Boundaries%20Review%20Committee%202015.pdf#zoom=100 |archive-date=12 October 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Election results==
[[File:Polling station signs, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Singapore - 20150911.jpg|thumb|upright|Signs pointing to polling stations in [[Clementi, Singapore|Clementi]], in [[Holland–Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency|Holland–Bukit Timah GRC]]]]

After polls closed at 8pm, vote counting began. Results were announced by Ng Wai Choong, chief executive director of the [[Energy Market Authority]], who acted as the Returning Officer for the election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/GeneralElection/News/Story/STIStory_666918.html|title=Yam Ah Mee: GE's new Internet star|last=Wong|first=Tessa|date=10 May 2011|work=Straits Times|access-date=10 May 2011}}</ref> The first result was declared at 11.31pm on 11 September where PAP candidate [[Lam Pin Min]] won the [[Sengkang West Single Member Constituency]] with a majority of 17,564. The last result was declared at 3.10am on 12 September where [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] team contesting [[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency]], led by party's secretary-general [[Low Thia Khiang]], won the constituency by a narrow margin of 1.9%, or a majority of 2,612.

Contrary to expectations of a tougher contest with all constituencies being contested by the opposition parties, PAP won its best ever results since the 2001 general election, achieving a swing of 9.7% to achieve 69.9% of the vote as compared to the previous election in 2011 when it received 60.1%. The PAP unexpectedly reclaimed the constituency of [[Punggol East Single Member Constituency|Punggol East]] after it was lost to WP in a 2013 by-election, and achieved a swing in Aljunied GRC large enough to force a vote recount although the WP retained the constituency. With six elected seats for WP, three seats for the [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]] were eligible to complete a minimum of nine opposition members; WP was qualified for all three seats by-virtue of being the top three losing performers for the election (the single member constituencies of Punggol East (later declined) and [[Fengshan Single Member Constituency|Fengshan]], and one seat (later two) for the [[East Coast Group Representation Constituency]]), and thus WP had nine represented seats for the upcoming Parliament.

The victory for the [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency]] has post its widest swing among all other Single Member Constituencies for this election, with 16.05%, while the largest swing for all contested constituencies was [[Bishan–Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency]], with 16.66%. This victory resulted in the end of a 31-year reign of [[Singapore People's Party]] as they failed to win at least a seat in Parliament (including NCMPs) for the first time, despite Potong Pasir was SPP's best performing constituency for the election. Consequently, this was also the first time since 1986 only one opposition party ([[Singapore Democratic Party]], at the time) represented the Parliament, and after the 1981's [[1981 Anson by-election|Anson's by-election]] where WP being the only opposition party to represent the Parliament alone, as none of the other seven opposition parties, including SPP and two independents, won contests.

A poll held by the Institute of Policy Studies among 2,000 voters noted that 79 percent believed "The whole election system is fair to all political parties." up from 61 per cent in 2011<ref>{{Cite web|last=hermes|date=2015-11-15|title=Acceptance of a 'fair electoral system' part of new normal|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapolitics/acceptance-of-a-fair-electoral-system-part-of-new-normal|access-date=2020-11-22|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref>

Voter turnout for the election was 93.56%, with 2,304,331 votes cast.
