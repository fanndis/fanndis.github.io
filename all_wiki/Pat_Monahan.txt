==Music career==

Monahan began his musical career singing with [[cover band]] Rogues Gallery from 1988 to 1990. The band consisted of Monahan (lead vocals, percussion), Mark Emhoff (lead guitar, vocals), Mike Imboden (bass, keyboards, vocals), John McElhenny (drums, vocals) and his brother Matt (rhythm guitar, keyboards and vocals), in his hometown of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. After the dissolution of the band, he left Erie in late 1993 and moved to California, where he met Rob Hotchkiss. While progressing from the SF coffeehouse circuit to the LA club scene, Monahan and Hotchkiss added Jimmy Stafford (guitar), Charlie Colin (bass), and Scott Underwood (drums) to their lineup, thus officially forming [[Train (band)|Train]]. 
From 1994 to 2006, Monahan released four studio albums with Train. In 2002, the band earned two [[Grammy Award|Grammys]], one of them for the song "[[Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)]]", which was written by Monahan and inspired by his late mother, who had died of cancer.

Aside from his work with Train, Monahan also sang additional vocals on the song "Shimmer" with the band [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]] in 2001. In November 2005, he appeared as a guest vocalist on [[VH1]]'s  ''[[Decades Rock Live]]'', where he covered [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s hit single "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]". Later, he took part in ''Storytellers&nbsp;– The Doors: A Celebration'', paying tribute to [[The Doors]] by performing "[[Love Me Two Times]]".

From 2006 to 2009, Train took a three-year hiatus. Monahan released his first solo album, ''[[Last of Seven]]'', on September 18, 2007, and began a nationwide tour supporting it. He followed that tour with a small, intimate acoustic tour, which inspired his ''Last of Seven Acoustic'' compilation, available via digital download only. His first solo single, "Her Eyes", made the top 10 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard's'']] Hot AC chart. The album's second single was "Fifty Ways to Say Goodbye."

On ''Last of Seven'', Monahan duets with folk rock musician [[Brandi Carlile]], with special guest appearances by [[Richie Sambora]] and [[Graham Nash]]. Monahan worked with [[Guy Chambers]] to co-write two songs for [[Tina Turner]]'s hits album, ''[[Tina!: Her Greatest Hits]]''.

In 2009, Train returned to the studio with the album ''[[Save Me, San Francisco]]''. That same year, Monahan and some of his fellow Train bandmates took on small acting roles in the ''[[CSI: NY]]'' episode "Second Chances". Monahan played the former homeless drug addict Sam Baker (dating Debbie Fallon (played by [[Kim Kardashian]]) who becomes involved in a murder investigation. They performed the song "[[Hey, Soul Sister]]" from their new album, and "[[Calling All Angels]]".

On April 4, 2010, he performed with [[The Hollies]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony, as The Hollies were inducted. He sang lead vocals on the song "[[Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress]]". The following year, he contributed a cover of [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Maybe Baby (song)|Maybe Baby]]" for the tribute album, ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', which was released on September 6, 2011.

Monahan also recorded a duet with [[Martina McBride]], singing Train's song "Marry Me".
