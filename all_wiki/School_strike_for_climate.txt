The '''school strike for climate''' ({{lang-sv|Skolstrejk för klimatet}}), also known variously as '''Fridays for Future''' ('''FFF'''), '''Youth for Climate''', '''Climate Strike/Climatestrike''' {{sic}} or '''Youth Strike for Climate''', is an international movement of school students (in many countries also university students) who skip classes, mainly on Fridays, to participate in demonstrations to demand [[climate change mitigation|action]] from political and economical leaders, to [[climate change mitigation|limit climate disaster]], and for the [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuel industry]] to transition to [[renewable energy]]. Most regional branches of the movement see themselves also as a part of the [[Climate justice|Global Climate Justice Movement]]. The climate movement is in general very democratic and [[Grassroots|grassroots organized]].

Publicity and widespread organising began after Swedish pupil [[Greta Thunberg]] staged a protest in August 2018 outside the Swedish [[Riksdag]] (parliament), holding a sign that read "{{lang|sv|Skolstrejk för klimatet}}" ("School strike for climate").<ref name="Crouch">{{cite news |author-last=Crouch |author-first=David |title=The Swedish 15-year-old who's cutting class to fight the climate crisis |date=1 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, United Kingdom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/01/swedish-15-year-old-cutting-class-to-fight-the-climate-crisis |access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author-last=Weyler |author-first=Rex |title=The youth have seen enough |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/20260/the-youth-have-seen-enough/ |access-date=22 January 2019 |publisher=[[Greenpeace International]] |date=4 January 2019}}</ref>

==Digital climate strike==
The climate strike online movement, sometimes referred to as "digital strike", was started by two Asian-American climate activists from the [[United States]] in April 2019. This branch of climate striking was created in order to make climate activism accessible to those unable to strike physically. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.earthday.org/youth-digital-striking-fridays-for-future/|title=Can't Strike For the Planet?

==Scientific background==

It is [[Scientific consensus on climate change|accepted by the vast majority of scientists]] that the greenhouse effect which warms Earth is much increased by emission of vast amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] and some other gases by human activities.<ref>

== Awards ==
On 7 June 2019, Fridays for Future and Greta Thunberg were honoured with [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]]. Secretary General [[Kumi Naidoo]] said:

<blockquote>We are humbled and inspired by the determination with which youth activists across the world are challenging us all to confront the realities of the climate crisis. Every young person taking part in Fridays for Future embodies what it means to act on your conscience. They remind us that we are more powerful than we know and that we all have a role to play in protecting human rights against climate catastrophe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/climate-activists-greta-thunberg-and-the-fridays-for-future-movement-honored-with-top-amnesty-international-award/|title=Climate activists Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement honored with top Amnesty International award|website=Amnesty International USA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref></blockquote>
