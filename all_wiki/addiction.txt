Addiction is a disorder of the brain's [[reward system]] which arises through [[transcriptional]] and [[epigenetic]] mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.).<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /><ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /> [[FOSB#DeltaFosB|DeltaFosB]] (ΔFosB), a gene [[transcription factor]], is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions.<ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /><ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /><ref name="Nestler" /> Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the [[overexpression]] of ΔFosB in the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s of the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /><ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /> Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used [[preclinical research|preclinically]] as an addiction [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]].<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="What the ΔFosB?">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying ΔFosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br />ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity">{{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

[[Cognitive control]] and [[stimulus control]], which is associated with [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[classical conditioning]], represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors.<ref name="Cognitive - stimulus">{{cite journal | vauthors = Washburn DA | title = The Stroop effect at 80: The competition between stimulus control and cognitive control | journal = J Exp Anal Behav | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–13 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26781048 | doi = 10.1002/jeab.194 | quote = Today, arguably more than at any time in history, the constructs of attention, executive functioning, and cognitive control seem to be pervasive and preeminent in research and theory. Even within the cognitive framework, however, there has long been an understanding that behavior is multiply determined, and that many responses are relatively automatic, unattended, contention-scheduled, and habitual. Indeed, the cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and self-regulation that appear to be hallmarks of cognitive control are noteworthy only in contrast to responses that are relatively rigid, associative, and involuntary. }}</ref> Cognitive control, and particularly [[inhibitory control|inhibitory control over behavior]], is impaired in both addiction and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name="Executive functions">{{cite journal | vauthors = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | pages = 135–68 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control&nbsp;– resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking "outside the box," seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&nbsp;...<br />EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&nbsp;... The subthalamic nucleus appears to play a critical role in preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}}</ref><ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 313–21 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote ={{bull}} Executive function, the cognitive control of behavior, depends on the prefrontal cortex, which is highly developed in higher primates and especially humans.<br />{{bull}} Working memory is a short-term, capacity-limited cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision-making and behavior.&nbsp;...<br />These diverse inputs and back projections to both cortical and subcortical structures put the prefrontal cortex in a position to exert what is often called "top-down" control or cognitive control of behavior.&nbsp;... The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&nbsp;...<br />In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

Gambling provides a natural reward which is associated with compulsive behavior and for which clinical diagnostic manuals, namely the [[DSM-5]], have identified diagnostic criteria for an "addiction".<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /> In order for a person's gambling behavior to meet criteria of an addiction, it shows certain characteristics, such as mood modification, compulsivity, and withdrawal. There is evidence from functional neuroimaging that gambling activates the reward system and the [[mesolimbic pathway]] in particular.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Behavioral addictions" /> Similarly, shopping and playing video games are associated with compulsive behaviors in humans and have also been shown to activate the mesolimbic pathway and other parts of the reward system.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /> Based upon this evidence, [[gambling addiction]], [[video game addiction]], and [[shopping addiction]] are classified accordingly.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Behavioral addictions" />

==Risk factors==
{{See|Addiction vulnerability}}

There are a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for developing an addiction, that vary across the population.<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /> Genetic and environmental risk factors each account for roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an addiction;<ref name="Cellular basis" /> the contribution from epigenetic risk factors to the total risk is unknown.<ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /> Even in individuals with a relatively low genetic risk, exposure to sufficiently high doses of an addictive drug for a long period of time (e.g., weeks–months) can result in an addiction.<ref name="Cellular basis" />

=== Genetic factors ===
{{See also|Alcoholism#Genetic variation}}

It has long been established that genetic factors along with environmental (e.g., psychosocial) factors are significant contributors to addiction vulnerability.<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" /> [[Epidemiological method|Epidemiological]] studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for [[alcoholism]].<ref>Mayfield RD, Harris RA,1, Schuckit MA (May 2008) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442454/ "Genetic factors influencing alcohol dependence"] [[PMID]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18362899 18362899]</ref> Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies.<ref name=Kendler94/> Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal studies have shown that environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.<ref name=Kendler94>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendler KS, Neale MC, Heath AC, Kessler RC, Eaves LJ |title=A twin-family study of alcoholism in women |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=5 |pages=707–15 |date=May 1994 |pmid=8166312 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.5.707 }}</ref>

Overall, the data implicating specific genes in the development of drug addiction is mixed for most genes. One reason for this may be that the case is due to a focus of current research on common variants. Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population; however, when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1–1.3 percent. On the other hand, the rare variant hypothesis states that genes with low frequencies in the population (<1%) confer much greater additional risk in the development of the disease.<ref name="pmid23454283">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke TK, Crist RC, Kampman KM, Dackis CA, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP, Oslin DW, Ferraro TN, Lohoff FW, Berrettini WH | title = Low frequency genetic variants in the μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) affect risk for addiction to heroin and cocaine | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 542 | pages = 71–75 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23454283 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2013.02.018 | pmc=3640707}}</ref>

[[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) are used to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This is not to say that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of [[endophenotype]]s are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent to them, or both.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall FS, Drgonova J, Jain S, Uhl GR | title = Implications of genome wide association studies for addiction: are our a priori assumptions all wrong? | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–79 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23872493 | pmc = 3797854 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.07.006 }}</ref>

A study that highlights the significant role genetics play in addiction is the twin studies. Twins have similar and sometimes identical genetics. Analyzing these genes in relation to genetics has helped geneticists understand how much of a role genes play in addiction. Studies performed on twins found that rarely did only one twin have an addiction. In most cases where at least one twin suffered from an addiction, both did, and often to the same substance.<ref name="Crowe1991">{{cite journal|last1=Crowe|first1=J.R|title=Genetics of alcoholism|journal=Alcohol Health and Research World|pages=1–11|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-22020-001|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> Cross addiction is when already has a predisposed addiction and then starts to become addicted to something different.

Statistics have shown that those who start to drink alcohol at a younger age are more likely to become dependent later on. About 33% of the population tasted their first alcohol between the ages of 15 and 17, while 18% experienced it prior to this. As for alcohol abuse or dependence, the numbers start off high with those who first drank before they were 12 and then drop off after that. For example, 16% of alcoholics began drinking prior to turning 12 years old, while only 9% first touched alcohol between 15 and 17. This percentage is even lower, at 2.6%, for those who first started the habit after they were 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/age-and-substance-abuse/|title=Age and Substance Abuse – Alcohol Rehab}}</ref>

The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&nbsp;... In some people, there is a transition from "normal" to compulsive engagement in natural rewards (such as food or sex), a condition that some have termed behavioral or non-drug addictions (Holden, 2001; Grant et al., 2006a).&nbsp;... In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. This syndrome is characterized by a medication-induced increase in (or compulsive) engagement in non-drug rewards such as gambling, shopping, or sex (Evans et al, 2006; Aiken, 2007; Lader, 2008)."}}<br /><!--The following link is outside the template to make it hyperlinked while appearing to be part of the quote.-->[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/table/T1/ Table 1: Summary of plasticity observed following exposure to drug or natural reinforcers]"</ref><ref name="Nestler" /><ref name="ΔFosB reward" /> Consequently, ΔFosB is the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards (i.e., behavioral addictions) as well;<ref name="Nestler">{{cite journal |vauthors=Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction | journal = Nat.

Understanding the pathways in which drugs act and how drugs can alter those pathways is key when examining the biological basis of drug addiction. The reward pathway, known as the [[mesolimbic system|mesolimbic pathway]], or its extension, the [[mesocorticolimbic pathway]], is characterized by the interaction of several areas of the brain.
* The projections from the [[ventral tegmentum|ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) are a network of [[dopaminergic]] [[neurons]] with [[wikt:colocalize|co-localized]] postsynaptic [[glutamate]] receptors ([[AMPAR]] and [[NMDAR]]). These cells respond when stimuli indicative of a reward are present. The VTA supports learning and sensitization development and releases DA into the [[forebrain]].<ref name="Jones and Bonci">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones S, Bonci A |title=Synaptic plasticity and drug addiction |journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=20–25 |year=2005 |pmid=15661621 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2004.08.011}}</ref> These neurons also project and release DA into the nucleus accumbens,<ref name="Eisch and Harburg">{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisch AJ, Harburg GC |title=Opiates, psychostimulants, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Insights for addiction and stem cell biology |journal=Hippocampus |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=271–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16411230 |doi=10.1002/hipo.20161|s2cid=23667629 }}</ref> through the [[mesolimbic pathway]].

====Role of dopamine and glutamate====

Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward system in the brain. It plays a role in regulating movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure.<ref name=arch>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Fowler JS, Wang GJ, Swanson JM, Telang F | title = Dopamine in drug abuse and addiction: results of imaging studies and treatment implications | journal = Arch.

Excessive intake of many types of addictive drugs results in repeated release of high amounts of dopamine, which in turn affects the reward pathway directly through heightened [[dopamine receptor]] activation. Prolonged and abnormally high levels of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]] can induce receptor [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] in the neural pathway. Downregulation of [[mesolimbic]] dopamine receptors can result in a decrease in the sensitivity to natural reinforcers.<ref name=arch/>

Drug seeking behavior is induced by glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens. This idea is supported with data from experiments showing that drug seeking behavior can be prevented following the inhibition of [[AMPA]] glutamate receptors and glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens.<ref name="Kalivas and Volkow"/>

'''Reward sensitization''' is a process that causes an increase in the amount of reward (specifically, [[incentive salience]]{{#tag:ref|Incentive salience, the "[[motivational salience]]" for a reward, is a "desire" or "want" attribute, which includes a motivational component, that the brain assigns to a rewarding stimulus.<ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /><ref name="NAcc function" /> As a consequence, incentive salience acts as a motivational "magnet" for a rewarding stimulus that commands attention, induces approach, and causes the rewarding stimulus to be sought out.<ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.<br />Cue-triggered ‘wanting’ for the UCS<br />A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.<br />Cue as attractive motivational magnets<br />When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers ‘wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed ‘wanting’ – CS-triggered pulses of intensified ‘wanting’ for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed ‘wanting’ – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}</ref>|group="note"}}) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug). In simple terms, when reward sensitization to a specific stimulus (e.g., a drug) occurs, an individual's "wanting" or desire for the stimulus itself and its associated [[cue reactivity|cues]] increases.<ref name="NAcc function">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–48, 366–67, 375–76 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience ("wanting") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}}</ref><ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /><ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /> Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus.

Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that dopaminergic psychostimulants (e.g., [[amphetamine]]) and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess a bidirectional '''reward cross-sensitization''' effect{{#tag:ref|In simplest terms, this means that when either amphetamine or sex is perceived as more alluring or desirable through reward sensitization, this effect occurs with the other as well.|group="note"}} that is mediated through ΔFosB.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Amph-Sex X-sensitization through D1 signaling" /><ref name="Amph-Sex X-sensitization through NMDA signaling" /> In contrast to ΔFosB's reward-sensitizing effect, [[CREB]] transcriptional activity decreases user's sensitivity to the rewarding effects of the substance.

-Should probably mention the following since it's related to both the mechanisms and research sections:
1) Prolonged inhibition of class I HDACs results in histone hyper-acetylation, which in turn increases G9a expression and H3K9me2 synthesis
2) G9a catalyzes H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2 synthesis)
3) H3K9me2 is a repressive epigenetic mark that inhibits the induction of DeltaFosB in the NAcc by preventing transcription of the FosB gene
i.e., +HDACi → ↑ H3 acetylation & ↑H4 acetylation → ↑G9a → ↑H3K9me2 synthesis

==Diagnosis==
{{Further|Substance use disorder#Diagnosis|Problem gambling#Diagnosis}}
The 5th edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-5) uses the term "[[substance use disorder]]" to refer to a spectrum of drug use-related disorders. The DSM-5 eliminates the terms "[[drug abuse|abuse]]" and "dependence" from diagnostic categories, instead using the specifiers of ''mild'', ''moderate'' and ''severe'' to indicate the extent of disordered use. These specifiers are determined by the number of diagnostic criteria present in a given case. In the DSM-5, the term ''drug addiction'' is synonymous with ''severe substance use disorder''.<ref name="Surgeon General severe SUD" /><ref name="Brain disease" />

The DSM-5 introduced a new diagnostic category for behavioral addictions; however, [[problem gambling]] is the only condition included in that category in the 5th edition.<ref name="Addiction-dependence distinction" /> [[Internet gaming disorder]] is listed as a "condition requiring further study" in the DSM-5.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Petry NM, Rehbein F, Gentile DA, Lemmens JS, Rumpf HJ, Mößle T, Bischof G, Tao R, Fung DS, Borges G, Auriacombe M, González Ibáñez A, Tam P, O'Brien CP | title = An international consensus for assessing internet gaming disorder using the new DSM-5 approach | journal = Addiction | volume = 109 | issue = 9 | pages = 1399–406 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24456155 | doi = 10.1111/add.12457 }}</ref>

Past editions have used [[physical dependence]] and the associated withdrawal syndrome to identify an addictive state. [[Physical dependence]] occurs when the body has adjusted by incorporating the substance into its "normal" functioning – i.e., attains [[homeostasis]] – and therefore physical withdrawal symptoms occur upon cessation of use.<ref name="pmid10511013">{{cite journal |vauthors=Torres G, Horowitz JM | title = Drugs of abuse and brain gene expression | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10511013 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199909000-00007| citeseerx = 10.1.1.326.4903 }}</ref> Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms experienced when reducing or discontinuing a substance that the body has become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to body aches, [[anxiety]], [[irritability]], intense [[craving (withdrawal)|cravings]] for the substance, [[nausea]], [[hallucinations]], [[headaches]], cold sweats, [[tremor]]s, and seizures.

Medical researchers who actively study addiction have criticized the DSM classification of addiction for being flawed and involving arbitrary diagnostic criteria.<ref name="NHMH_3e terms-DSM flaw">{{cite book | vauthors = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE, Holtzman DM | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2015 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-182770-6 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 16: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote = The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2013), which uses the term substance use disorder, is flawed. Criteria used to make the diagnosis of substance use disorders include tolerance and somatic dependence/withdrawal, even though these processes are not integral to addiction as noted. It is ironic and unfortunate that the manual still avoids use of the term addiction as an official diagnosis, even though addiction provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}}</ref> Writing in 2013, the director of the United States [[National Institute of Mental Health]] discussed the invalidity of the DSM-5's classification of mental disorders:<ref name="DSM-V Insel">{{cite web| first = Thomas | last = Insel | name-list-style = vanc |title=Transforming Diagnosis|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref>
<blockquote> While DSM has been described as a "Bible" for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been "reliability" – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. The weakness is its lack of validity. Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever.</blockquote>

A meta-analytic review on the efficacy of various [[Behavioral therapy|behavioral therapies]] for treating drug and behavioral addictions found that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (e.g., [[relapse prevention]] and [[contingency management]]), [[motivational interviewing]], and a [[Community reinforcement approach and family training|community reinforcement approach]] were effective interventions with moderate effect sizes.<ref name="German meta-analysis">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walter M, Dürsteler KM, Petitjean SA, Wiesbeck GA, Euler S, Sollberger D, Lang UE, Vogel M | title = [Psychosocial Treatment of Addictive Disorders – An Overview of Psychotherapeutic Options and their Efficacy] | language = de | journal = Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–10 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25893493 | doi = 10.1055/s-0034-1399338 | quote = Addictive disorders are chronic relapsing conditions marked by compulsive and often uncontrolled use of psychotropic substances or stimuli.

For these psychotherapeutic treatments, mostly moderate effect sizes have been found. Their effectiveness seems to be highest in cannabis dependence. Empirical evidence for dependence on "hard" drugs is largest for contingency management, while for alcohol dependence motivational interviewing and the community reinforcement approach show the largest effect sizes. Presumably, combinations of different approaches as well as online interventions will bring further progress in the psychosocial treatment of addictive disorders in the future.}}</ref>

====Alcohol addiction====
{{further|Alcoholism}}
Alcohol, like opioids, can induce a severe state of [[physical dependence]] and produce withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]].

At present, no pharmacological therapy has been approved by the FDA to treat psychostimulant addiction. Many drugs have been tested, but none have shown conclusive efficacy with tolerable side effects in humans.<sup>172</sup>&nbsp;...<!--These drugs have included DA-receptor ligands, such as DA receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists, as well as DA-reuptake inhibitors.<sup>173,174</sup> One newer dopaminergic drug that has shown some promise is the antipsychotic medication aripiprazole, a partial agonist at D2-like receptors, which is currently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.<sup>175</sup> Clinical trials have thus far been mixed, with one study finding reduced cocaine craving and use, and another study showing increased cocaine use.<sup>176,177</sup>&nbsp;...
Recent evidence for dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling in addiction has led to the testing of N-acetylcysteine, a derivative of the amino acid cysteine that normalizes extracellular levels of Glu following cocaine administration.<sup>178,179</sup> Clinical trials found that N-acetylcysteine treatment attenuates cocaine craving and use and normalizes brain glutamate levels.<sup>180–182</sup> Other recent studies found trends toward significant reductions in METH use and craving produced by the antidepressant buproprion and the anticonvulsant topiramate, which has glutamate release-inhibiting properties.<sup>183,184</sup> While these compounds have not demonstrated overwhelming efficacy in reducing psychostimulant use or craving in all subjects tested, trends toward effects were observed and thus merit further investigation.
Other compounds that have been tested, with disappointing results, include β-adrenergic antagonists, opioid-receptor antagonists, 5-HT3-receptor antagonists, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.<sup>172,185–190</sup> Despite the lack of past successes, several newer medications are currently being investigated and have shown some initial success, such as the smoking-cessation aid varenicline, the α2 adrenergic agonist clonidine, and the antidepressant mirtazapine.<sup>191–194</sup> In addition, preclinical evidence strongly suggests potential therapeutic effects of compounds targeting receptors for endocannabinoids, the neuropeptide orexin, and CRF for the prevention of relapse to psychostimulant use.<sup>195–197</sup>
Future approaches for the treatment of psychostimulant-induced cognitive deficits and dependence include the use of cognitive enhancers.<sup>198–200</sup> Two promising examples include prescription stimulants, such as modafinil and methylphenidate, which have shown modest but potential treatment effects in METH users and cocaine users with comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, respectively.<sup>201–205</sup> In addition, galantamine, a cholinergic modulator and cognitive enhancer, has been reported to both decrease cocaine use and improve sustained attention in dependent subjects.<sup>206,207</sup> Together, these studies indicate that clinical trials of cognitive enhancers in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction are warranted. In addition to the pharmacological trials reviewed above, less conventional strategies that are gaining scientific momentum include vaccine therapies to immunoneutralize drug molecules and impede penetrance across the blood–brain barrier, enzyme conjugates that dramatically increase the metabolic breakdown of abused drugs, pharmacogenetic approaches based on individual genetic polymorphisms in addiction-related genes, and epigenetic modulators of drug-induced changes in gene expression.<sup>208–211</sup> While still in their relative infancy, these exciting new avenues of research offer a significant expansion of possible biologically based targets for the treatment of psychostimulant addiction.&nbsp;...
The tremendous need for more effective pharmacological treatments for psychostimulant addiction is a mainstay of contemporary addiction research. However, the recent downsizing of many major pharmaceutical companies away from psychiatric indications (including addiction) due to the lack of efficacy of experimental compounds in humans may require a sea change in the translational research approach.<sup>212,213</sup> --> A new emphasis on larger-scale biomarker, genetic, and epigenetic research focused on the molecular targets of mental disorders has been recently advocated.<sup>212</sup> In addition, the integration of cognitive and behavioral modification of circuit-wide neuroplasticity (ie, computer-based training to enhance executive function) may prove to be an effective adjunct-treatment approach for addiction, particularly when combined with cognitive enhancers.<sup>198,213–216</sup> Furthermore, in order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, individual and group psychotherapy, behavior-modification strategies, twelve-step programs, and residential treatment facilities.}}</ref><ref name="pmid24716825">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoops WW, Rush CR | title = Combination pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorder: a review of clinical findings and recommendations for future research | journal = Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 363–74 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24716825 | doi = 10.1586/17512433.2014.909283 | quote = Despite concerted efforts to identify a pharmacotherapy for managing stimulant use disorders, no widely effective medications have been approved. | pmc=4017926}}</ref><ref name="Cochrane 2013 treatments">{{cite journal | vauthors = Perez-Mana C, Castells X, Torrens M, Capella D, Farre M | title = Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence | journal = Cochrane Database Syst.

Current medical reviews of research involving lab animals have identified a drug class – class I [[histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s{{#tag:ref|Inhibitors of class I [[histone deacetylase]] (HDAC) enzymes are drugs that inhibit four specific [[histone-modifying enzyme]]s: [[HDAC1]], [[HDAC2]], [[HDAC3]], and [[HDAC8]].

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}</ref><ref name="Amphetamine epigenetics">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition. Studies employing co-administration procedures in which inhibitors are given acutely, just prior to psychostimulant administration, report heightened behavioral responses to the drug<sup>1,3,4,13,14</sup>.

The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation. Our present findings thus demonstrate clear cross talk among histone PTMs and suggest that decreased behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants following prolonged HDAC inhibition might be mediated through decreased activity of HDAC1 at H3K9 KMT promoters and subsequent increases in H3K9me2 and gene repression.}}<br />{{bull}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon-O'Brien E, Alaux-Cantin S, Warnault V, Buttolo R, Naassila M, Vilpoux C | title = The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate decreases excessive ethanol intake in dependent animals | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 676–89 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25041570 | doi = 10.1111/adb.12161 | s2cid = 28667144 | quote = Altogether, our results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of {{abbr|NaB|sodium butyrate}} in preventing excessive ethanol intake and relapse and support the hypothesis that {{abbr|HDACi|HDAC inhibitors}} may have a potential use in alcohol addiction treatment.}}<br />{{bull}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Castino MR, Cornish JL, Clemens KJ | title = Inhibition of histone deacetylases facilitates extinction and attenuates reinstatement of nicotine self-administration in rats | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = e0124796 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25880762 | pmc = 4399837 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0124796 | quote = treatment with NaB significantly attenuated nicotine and nicotine + cue reinstatement when administered immediately&nbsp;...

==Epidemiology==

Due to cultural variations, the proportion of individuals who develop a drug or behavioral addiction within a specified time period (i.e., the [[prevalence]]) varies over time, by country, and across national [[demographics|population demographics]] (e.g., by age group, socioeconomic status, etc.).<ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in addiction" />

===Asia===
The prevalence of alcohol dependence is not as high as is seen in other regions. In Asia, not only socioeconomic factors but also biological factors influence drinking behavior.<ref>Chen CC, Yin SJ. (Oct 2008) "Alcohol abuse and related factors in Asia". [[PMID]]: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19012127 19012127]</ref>

The overall prevalence of smartphone ownership is 62%, ranging from 41% in China to 84% in South Korea. Moreover, participation in online gaming ranges from 11% in China to 39% in Japan. Hong Kong has the highest number of adolescents reporting daily or above Internet use (68%). [[Internet addiction disorder]] is highest in the Philippines, according to both the IAT (Internet Addiction Test) – 5% and the CIAS-R (Revised Chen Internet Addiction Scale) – 21%.<ref>Mak KK, Lai CM, Watanabe H. (Nov 2014) "Epidemiology of internet behaviors and addiction among adolescents in six Asian countries". [[PMID]]: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25405785 25405785]</ref>

===Australia===
The prevalence of substance abuse disorder among Australians was reported at 5.1% in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Slade T, Johnston A, Teesson M, Whiteford H, Burgess P, Pirkis J, Saw S | author-link3= Maree Teesson | title = The Mental Health of Australians 2: Substance Use Disorders in Australia | publisher = Department of Health and Ageing, Canberra | date = May 2009 | url = https://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/A24556C814804A99CA257BF0001CAC45/$File/mha26.pdf }}</ref>

===Europe===
In 2015, the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 18.4% for heavy episodic alcohol use (in the past 30 days); 15.2% for daily tobacco smoking; and 3.8, 0.77, 0.37 and 0.35% in 2017 cannabis, amphetamine, opioid and cocaine use. The mortality rates for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in Eastern Europe.<ref>Peacock A, Leung J, Larney S.

Of those who do receive treatment, few receive evidence-based care. (There is no information available on how many individuals receive treatment for addiction involving nicotine.)<br />Risky substance use and untreated addiction account for one-third of inpatient hospital costs and 20 percent of all deaths in the United States each year, and cause or contribute to more than 100 other conditions requiring medical care, as well as vehicular crashes, other fatal and non-fatal injuries, overdose deaths, suicides, homicides, domestic discord, the highest incarceration rate in the world and many other costly social consequences.

In a statement issued to mark this milestone, ABAM President Robert J. Sokol summed up its significance: 'This landmark event, more than any other, recognizes addiction as a preventable and treatable disease, helping to shed the stigma that has long plagued it. It sends a strong message to the public that American medicine is committed to providing expert care for this disease and services designed to prevent the risky substance use that precedes it.'}}</ref> One-third of [[inpatient care|inpatient]] hospital costs and 20% of all deaths in the US every year are the result of untreated addictions and risky substance use.<ref name="ABAM" /><ref name="NIDA Addiction Medicine" /> In spite of the massive overall economic cost to society, which is greater than the cost of [[diabetes]] and all forms of [[cancer]] combined, most doctors in the US lack the training to effectively address a drug addiction.<ref name="ABAM" /><ref name="NIDA Addiction Medicine" />

Another review listed estimates of lifetime prevalence rates for several behavioral addictions in the United States, including 1–2% for compulsive gambling, 5% for sexual addiction, 2.8% for food addiction, and 5–6% for compulsive shopping.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /> A systematic review indicated that the time-invariant prevalence rate for sexual addiction and related compulsive sexual behavior (e.g., compulsive masturbation with or without pornography, compulsive cybersex, etc.) within the United States ranges from 3–6% of the population.<ref name="Systematic review - yet another DSM fail">{{cite journal | vauthors = Karila L, Wéry A, Weinstein A, Cottencin O, Petit A, Reynaud M, Billieux J | title = Sexual addiction or hypersexual disorder: different terms for the same problem?

A lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&nbsp;... Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches.}}</ref>

According to a 2017 poll conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]], almost half of US adults know a family member or close friend who has struggled with a drug addiction at some point in their life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nearly half of Americans have a family member or close friend who's been addicted to drugs|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/26/nearly-half-of-americans-have-a-family-member-or-close-friend-whos-been-addicted-to-drugs/|publisher=Pew Research Center| vauthors = Gramlich J|date=26 October 2017|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>

===South America===
The realities of opioid use and abuse in Latin America may be deceptive if observations are limited to epidemiological findings.

==Personality theories==
{{Main|Personality theories of addiction}}
[[Personality theories of addiction]] are [[psychology|psychological]] models that associate [[personality traits]] or modes of thinking (i.e., [[Affective science|affective states]]) with an individual's proclivity for developing an addiction. [[Data analysis]] demonstrates that there is a significant difference in the psychological profiles of drug users and non-users and the psychological predisposition to using different drugs may be different.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Fehrman E, Egan V, Gorban AN, Levesley J, Mirkes EM, Muhammad AK |title= Personality Traits and Drug Consumption.
