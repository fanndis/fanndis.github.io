Formally, the Peshmerga are under the command of the Kurdistan Regional Government's Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs. In reality, the Peshmerga force itself is largely divided and controlled separately by the two regional political parties: [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|Democratic Party of Kurdistan]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]]. Unifying and integrating the Peshmerga has been on the public agenda since 1992, but the forces remain divided due to factionalism which has proved to be a major stumbling block.<ref name="CMEC">{{cite journal|last1=van Wilgenburg|first1=Wladimir|last2=Fumerton|first2=Mario|title=Kurdistan's Political Armies: The Challenge of Unifying the Peshmerga Forces.|journal=Carnegie Middle East Center|date=16 December 2015|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/ACMR_WilgenburgFumerton_Kurdistan_English_final.pdf|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Mick Mulroy]], while highlighting the great partnership with the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]], also said that the U.S. partnership with the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga as the northern front against [[Saddam Hussein]] was also a model partnership.<ref name="c-span.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?460180-2/syria-middle-east-security-michael-mulroy-remarks|title=Syria and Middle East Security, Michael Mulroy Remarks &#124; C-SPAN.org|website=www.c-span.org}}</ref> He continued that the U.S. must support local partners to stabilize the areas that have been liberated from ISIS's control and prevent their return.<ref name="auto8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?464882-1/us-policy-syria|title=U.S. Policy Toward Syria &#124; C-SPAN.org|website=www.c-span.org}}</ref>

The Kurdish warrior tradition of rebellion has existed for thousands of years along with aspirations for independence, and early Kurdish warriors fought against the various Persian empires, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].<ref name="Lortz2015" /><ref>S. R. Valentine, ''Peshmerga: Those Who Face Death'', KDP, 2018, see the introduction and chapter one.</ref> Despite being viciously persecuted by the Ottoman Government, the Kurdish tribal militias that were the predecessors of the Peshmerga were also collaborative with the Ottoman Government shortly after [[World War I]] through assistance in perpetrating the genocides of [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]], [[Armenian Genocide|Armenians]], and [[Greek genocide|Greeks]] living in the Ottoman Empire at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hovanissian|first=Richard G.|title=The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies|year=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412835923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CB4Bh0-zrgoC&pg=PA271}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1896/07/26/archives/many-christians-killed-turks-and-kurds-slaughter-armenians-around.html |work = The New York Times |title = Many Christians Killed; Kurds and Turks Slaughter Armenians Around Van.

Historically the Peshmerga existed only as guerrilla organizations, but under the self-declared [[Republic of Mahabad]] (1946–1947), the Peshmerga led by [[Mustafa Barzani]] became the official army of the republic.<ref name="first mahabad source">{{cite web |first=Mufid |last=Abdulla |title=Mahabad – the first independent Kurdish republic |url=http://kurdistantribune.com/2011/mahabad-first-independent-kurdish-republic/ |work=The Kurdistan Tribune |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="ma barzani" /> After the fall of the republic and the execution of head of state [[Qazi Muhammad]], Peshmerga forces reemerged as guerrilla organizations that would go on to fight the [[Iran]]ian and [[Iraq]]i governments for the remainder of the century.<ref>{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Meiselas |title=Kurdistan: In the Shadow of History |edition=2nd |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-226-51928-9}}</ref>

In Iraq, most of these Peshmerga were led by [[Mustafa Barzani]] of the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]].<ref name="ma barzani">{{cite web |title=President |url=http://www.krgspain.org/government/profiles/english-president/ |work=[[Kurdistan Regional Government]] Representation in Spain |date=2015 |accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> In 1975 the Peshmerga were defeated in the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War]]. [[Jalal Talabani]], a leading member of the KDP, left the same year to revitalize the resistance and founded the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]]. This event created the baseline for the political discontent between the KDP and PUK that to this day divides Peshmerga forces and much of Kurdish society in Kurdistan.

After Mustafa Barzani's death in 1979, his son [[Masoud Barzani]] took his position.<ref name="ma barzani" /> As tension increased between KDP and PUK, most Peshmerga fought to keep a region under their own party's control while also fighting off Iraqi Army incursions. Following the [[Iran–Iraq War|First Persian Gulf War]], Iraqi Kurdistan saw the [[Kurdish Civil War]] between the two major parties, the KDP and the PUK, and Peshmerga forces were used to fight each other.<ref>S. R. Valentine, Peshmerga: Those Who Face Death, KDP, 2018, chapter six.</ref> The civil war officially ended in September 1998 when Barzani and Talabani signed the Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty.<ref>{{cite web |first=Frman |last=Abdulrahman |title=Never-ending mystery: what really happened to Kurdish civil war missing |url=http://www.niqash.org/articles/?id=3000 |work=niqash |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue and power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK), and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. By then, around 5,000 had been killed on both sides, and many more had been evicted for being on the wrong side.<ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=McDermid |title=New force emerges in Kirkuk |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/LB20Ak02.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> In the years after, tension remained high, but both parties moved towards each other, and in 2003 they both took part in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|overthrowing of the Baathist regime]] as part of the [[Iraq War]]. Unlike other militia forces, the Peshmerga were never prohibited by Iraqi law.<ref name=WhoPeshmerga>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28738975 Profile: Who are the Peshmerga?] BBC News.

Due to limited funding and the vast size of the Peshmerga forces, the KRG has long planned to downsize its forces from large numbers of low-quality forces to a smaller but much more effective and well-trained force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6oP3Y9ZM3sC&pg=PA129|title=Withdrawal from Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Consequently, in 2009, the KRG and Baghdad engaged in discussions about incorporating parts of the Peshmerga forces into the Iraqi Army in what would be the 15th and 16th [[Iraqi Army]] divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgEo2q76J_0C&pg=PA309|title=Iraq and the United States|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>Chapman, Dennis.

Some Peshmerga were already transferred but reportedly deserted again, and there are allegations that former Peshmerga forces remained loyal to the KRG rather than their Iraqi chain of command; regardless, thousands of members of the 80 Unit of KDP and  the 70 Unit of PUK are based in Baghdad, and they have good cooperation with other Iraqi forces in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Peshmerga, Iraqi Army form committees to start joint ops in disputed areas |agency=Rudaw |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/06022019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/1000-kurdish-soldiers-desert-from-iraqi-army.aspx?pageID=238&nID=48701&|title=1,000 Kurdish soldiers desert from Iraqi army |work=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Iraq's army and Kurds will join forces to retake Mosul |agency=PRI |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/iraqs-army-and-kurds-will-join-forces-retake-mosul}}</ref>

Peshmerga forces largely rely on old arms captured from battles. The Peshmerga captured stockpiles of weapons during the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991 Iraqi uprisings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/06/iraq-asks-krg-for-pre-saddam-weapons.html#|title=Iraqi Defense Ministry Asks KRG To Return Saddam-Era Weapons - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Several stockpiles of weapons were captured from the old Iraqi Army during the 2003 U.S. [[invasion of Iraq]], in which Peshmerga forces were active. Following the retreat of the new Iraqi Army during the June 2014 ISIS offensive, Peshmerga forces reportedly again managed to get hold of weapons left behind by the Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/as-isil-retreats-iraqi-kurds-gain-new-ammunition#page1|title=As ISIL retreats, Iraqi Kurds gain new ammunition|author=Hugh Naylor|work=The National|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Since August 2014, Peshmerga forces have also captured weapons from ISIS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/03/kurdish-forces-captured-a-isis-base-after-a-two-day-siege-but-the-isis-fighters-inside-somehow-slipped-away/|title=Kurdish forces captured an ISIS base after a two-day siege — but the ISIS fighters inside somehow slipped away|author=Richard Spencer, The Telegraph|date=3 October 2014|work=National Post|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> In 2015, for the first time, Peshmerga soldiers received urban warfare and military intelligence training from foreign trainers, the [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]].<ref>{{cite news|title=EXCLUSIVE: Coalition helps Peshmerga muscle up on urban warfare|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/160420155|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=Rudaw|date=16 April 2015}}</ref>

The Peshmerga arsenal is limited and confined by restrictions because the Kurdish Region has to purchase arms through the Iraqi government. Due to disputes between the KRG and the Iraqi government, arms flows from Baghdad to Kurdistan Region have been almost nonexistent, as Baghdad fears Kurdish aspirations for independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/03/iraq-peshmerga-desperate-for-us-arms-in-fight-against-isis/|title=Iraq's Peshmerga desperate for US arms in fight against ISIS|author=Hollie McKay|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/arms-for-kurdish-peshmerga-to-affect-military-balance/a-17853077|title=Arms for Kurdish Peshmerga to affect military balance|work=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Helfont2017" /> After the ISIS offensive of August 2014, multiple governments armed the Peshmerga with some light equipment such as light arms, night goggles, and ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/uk-britain-arms-supply-kurdish-forces-iraq-isis|title=UK prepares to supply arms directly to Kurdish forces fighting Isis|author=Nicholas Watt|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2014/8/state8392.htm|title=Seven western states join US to 27 September 2014}}</ref> However, Kurdish officials and Peshmerga stressed that they were not receiving enough.

The Peshmerga lack a proper medical corps and communication units.<ref name="Helfont2017" /> This became apparent during the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|ISIS offensive in 2014]] where the Peshmerga found itself lacking ambulances and frontline field hospitals, forcing wounded fighters to walk back to safety.<ref name="Helfont2017" /> There is also a lack of communication tools, as Peshmerga commanders are forced to use civilian cellphones to communicate with each other.<ref name="Helfont2017" /> Under the guidance of the [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve|US-led coalition]] the Peshmerga has started to standardize its weapons systems, replacing Soviet-era weapons with [[List of 5.56×45mm NATO firearms|NATO firearms]].<ref name="Helfont2017" />

===Issues===
The Peshmerga forces are plagued by frequent allegations of corruption, partisanship, nepotism, and fraud.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Peshmerga of Iraq |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insideiraq/2008/03/2008525185811788617.html |work=[[Aljazeera.com]] |date=1 March 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=KRG and the 'godfathers': 2006 secret US cable on Wikileaks |url=http://kurdistantribune.com/2014/krg-godfathers-2006-secret-cable-on-wikileaks/ |work=The Kurdistan Tribune |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jacqueline |last=Devigne |title="Iraqoncilable" Differences?

Those setting up such a scam split the salary of these employees.<ref name="Helfont2017" />

In addition the KDP and PUK have used the Peshmerga to exert or attempt to exert a monopoly on the use of force within their zones.<ref name="Helfont2017" /> In 2011 KDP Peshmerga fired on anti-government protesters in Sulaymaniyah, and the PUK later used its own security forces to break up these protests,<ref name="CMEC" /> leading to criticism from all of the opposition parties in the parliament. In 2014 the KDP used its Peshmerga to stop ministers from the [[Gorran Movement]] to enter Erbil and attend parliament.<ref name="Helfont2017" />

Outside of [[Kurdistan Region]] the Peshmerga has been accused of using force to exert control of local [[Arab]], [[Yazidi]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities, particularly after taking control of areas officially outside of Kurdistan Region during the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|Iraqi Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/11/13/marked-x/iraqi-kurdish-forces-destruction-villages-homes-conflict-isis|title=Marked With An "X" {{!}} Iraqi Kurdish Forces' Destruction of Villages, Homes in Conflict with ISIS|date=2016-11-13|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}</ref> 

The [[Assyrian Policy Institute]], a NGO, stated that Assyrians in the Nineveh Plains generally view the Peshmerga’s presence in the region as an attempt by the Kurdistan Regional Government to enact [[Kurdification|forced demographic change]] through military land-grabs on lands that have historically been inhabited by Assyrians.<ref name="contested">{{cite web|last=Hanna|first=Reine|date=June 1, 2020|title=Contested Control: The Future of Security in Iraq's Nineveh Plain|url=https://50f3ad00-5b28-4016-898f-6130d301c97a.filesusr.com/ugd/6ae567_98f8f8912baa40949a18a3a0b717eaea.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 27, 2020|website=Assyrian Policy Institute|pages=24}}</ref>

==Role of women==
{{main|Kurdish women}}

Women have played a significant role in the Peshmerga since its foundation. The Kurdish [[Zand tribe]] was known for allowing women in military roles.<ref name="Lortz2015" /> During the [[Iraqi–Kurdish conflict]] the majority of women served within the Peshmerga in supporting roles such as building camps, taking care of the wounded, and carrying munitions and messages.<ref name="Howard2002" /> Several women brigades served on the front lines.
