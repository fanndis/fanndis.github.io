'''Tarso Fernando Herz Genro''' (born March 6, 1947) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[politician]], and a member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (''Partido dos Trabalhadores &ndash; PT''). As a result of the [[Mensalão scandal]], Genro served the remainder of [[José Genoíno]]'s term as party president in 2005. [[Ricardo Berzoini]] was elected to the post later that year.

Following his service as interim president, Genro was a top political adviser to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], former [[President of Brazil]] (2006–2010), during the contentious, but quite successful, [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006 Presidential campaign]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/02/news/brazil.php Da Silva faces a runoff vote in Brazil - International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 16 March 2007, he became the new Minister of Justice in Lula's [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]].
