'''The University of Alabama''' ('''Alabama''', '''UA''', or '''Bama''') is a [[Public university|public]] [[Research university|research university]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. Established in 1820 and opened to students in 1831, the University of Alabama is the oldest<ref name="ua.edu">{{cite web |url=https://www.ua.edu/about/history |title=The University of Alabama |website= ua.edu}}</ref> and largest of the public [[List of colleges and universities in Alabama|universities in Alabama]] as well as the [[flagship university|flagship]] of the [[University of Alabama System]]. The university offers programs of study in 13 academic divisions leading to bachelor's, master's, [[Ed.S.|education specialist]], and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees. The only publicly supported [[University of Alabama School of Law|law school]] in the state is at UA. Other academic programs unavailable elsewhere in Alabama include doctoral programs in [[anthropology]], communication and information sciences, metallurgical engineering, music, [[Romance languages]], and social work.

As one of the first public universities established in the early 19th century southwestern frontier of the United States, the University of Alabama has left a cultural imprint on the state, region and nation over the past two centuries. The school was a center of activity during the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The University of Alabama [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|varsity football program]] (nicknamed the ''Crimson Tide''), which was inaugurated in 1892, ranks as one of the ten winningest programs in US history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 10 winningest NCAA teams |url=http://collegefootball.about.com/od/schools/a/schools-wins.htm |accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> In a 1913 speech then-president [[George H. Denny]] extolled the university as the "[[wikt:capstone|capstone]] of the public school system in the state [of Alabama]", lending the university its current nickname, ''The Capstone''. In addition, university alumni and faculty include 57 Goldwater Scholars, 15 Rhodes Scholars, 16 Truman Scholars, 36 Hollings Scholars, and 15 Boren Scholars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ua.edu/about/quickfacts/know.html|accessdate=May 8, 2020|title=University of Alabama Quick Facts}}</ref>

==History==
===Establishment===
[[File:University of Alabama 1859.jpg|thumb|View of the Quad in 1859. The Rotunda can be seen at center, with the halls visible in the background. All buildings depicted were destroyed on April 4, 1865.]]
{{Main|History of the University of Alabama}}

In 1818, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] authorized the newly created [[Alabama Territory]] to set aside a township for the establishment of a "seminary of learning". When [[Alabama]] was admitted to the [[United States of America|Union]] on December 14, 1819, a second township was added to the [[land grant]], bringing it to a total of 46,000 acres (186&nbsp;km²). The General Assembly of Alabama established the seminary on December 18, 1820, named it ''The University of the State of Alabama'', and created a Board of Trustees to manage the construction and operation of the university.<ref name="encyclopedia-alabama">{{cite web |title=University of Alabama (UA) |url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1678 |author=Clark E. Center, Jr. |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> The board selected a construction site and an architect to design the campus. The site the board chose was located, at the time, outside the city limits of the erstwhile [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]], Tuscaloosa.<ref name="Wolfe">{{cite book |title=The University of Alabama: A Pictorial History |last=Wolfe |first=Suzanne Rau |year=1983 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-0119-4}}</ref> [[William Nichols (architect)|William Nichols]], the architect of both the Alabama State Capitol building and [[Christ Episcopal Church (Tuscaloosa, Alabama)|Christ Episcopal Church]] in Tuscaloosa, was chosen to design the campus.

[[File:University of Alabama 1907.JPG|thumb|A view of either Tuomey Hall or Oliver-Barnard Hall, one of the first buildings constructed after the university reopened after the Civil War, in 1907]]
An academy-style institution during the Antebellum period, the university emphasized the [[classics]] and the social and natural sciences. There were around 100 students per year at UA in the 1830s.<ref name="encyclopedia-alabama"/>

As the state and university matured, an active literary culture evolved on campus and in Tuscaloosa. UA had one of the largest libraries in the country on the eve of the Civil War with more than 7,000 volumes. There were several thriving literary societies, including the Erosophic and the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] societies, which frequently had lectures by such distinguished politicians and literary figures as United States [[Supreme Court Justice|Supreme Court justice]] [[John Archibald Campbell|John A. Campbell]], novelist [[William Gilmore Simms]], and Professor [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|Frederick Barnard]] (later president of [[Columbia University]]).<ref name="Sellers"/> The addresses to those societies reveal a vibrant intellectual culture in Tuscaloosa; they also illustrate the proslavery ideas that were so central to the university and the state.<ref>Alfred L. Brophy, [http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/alabamaliteraryaddressesfinal.pdf The Law of Descent of Thought: Law, History, and Civilization in Antebellum Literary Addresses, Law and Literature] (2008) 20:343–402</ref>

Discipline and student behavior was a major issue at the university almost from the day it opened. Early presidents attempted to enforce strict rules regarding conduct.<ref name="encyclopedia-alabama"/> Students were prohibited from drinking, swearing, making unauthorized visits off-campus, or playing musical instruments outside a one-hour time frame. Yet riots and gunfights were not an uncommon occurrence. To combat the severe discipline problem, president [[Landon Garland]] lobbied and received approval from the legislature in 1860 to transform the university into a military school.<ref name="Sellers"/><ref>ECKINGER, H. (2013). The Militarization of the University of Alabama. ''Alabama Review'', ''66''(3), 163–185.</ref>

===From the Civil War to World War II===
Many of the cadets who graduated from the school went on to serve as officers in the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. As a consequence of that role, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops burned down the campus on April 4, 1865 (only 5 days before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9), which was unrelated to [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] several months earlier and farther east, in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Despite a call to arms and defense by the student cadet corps, only four buildings survived the burning: the [[President's Mansion (University of Alabama)|President's Mansion]] (1841), [[Gorgas-Manly Historic District#Gorgas House|Gorgas House]] (1829), [[Gorgas-Manly Historic District#Little Round House|Little Round House]] (1860), and [[Old University of Alabama Observatory|Old Observatory]] (1844).<ref name="alheritage2"/> The university reopened in 1871 and in 1880, Congress granted the university 40,000 acres (162&nbsp;km²) of coal land in partial compensation for $250,000 in war damages.<ref name="Wolfe"/>

The University of Alabama allowed female students beginning in 1892. The Board of Trustees allowed female students largely due to [[Julia S. Tutwiler]], with the condition that they be over eighteen, and would be allowed to enter the sophomore class after completing their first year at another school and passing an exam. Ten women from Tutwiler's Livingston school enrolled for the 1893 fall semester. By 1897, women were allowed to enroll as freshmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1112|title=Julia S. Tutwiler|work=Encyclopedia of Alabama}}</ref>

During World War II, UA was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="ua-v-12">{{cite web |url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/spr95/ww2.html |title=World War II and the Tech Connection |publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association |last=Goettling |first=Gary |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012134450/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/spr95/ww2.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> During this time the University of Alabama had extensions in other cities including [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]; the [[University of South Alabama]] was opened in 1963 to replace that program.

===Racial integration===
{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Wallace at University of Alabama edit2.jpg|thumb|right|George Wallace's "stand in the schoolhouse door" to attempt to stop integration of other races at the University of Alabama.]]

Until the 1960s, only white students were admitted to the university. The practice of [[racial segregation]] was common in the American South at this time and the university barred all students of color from attending. The first attempt to integrate the university occurred in 1956 when [[Autherine Lucy]] successfully enrolled on February 3 as a graduate student in library sciences after having secured a court order preventing the university from rejecting her application on the basis of race. In the face of violent protests against her attendance, Lucy was suspended (and later outright expelled) three days later by the board of trustees on the basis of being unable to provide a safe learning environment for her. The university was not successfully integrated until 1963 when [[Vivian Malone Jones|Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]] registered for classes on June 11.<ref>MOKRZYCKI, P. (2012). After the Stand Comes the Fall: Racial Integration and White Student Reactions at the University of Alabama, 1963–1976. ''Alabama Review'', ''65''(4), 290–313.</ref>

[[File:Malone Hood Plaza University of Alabama northeast view.jpg|thumb|Foster Auditorium and Malone-Hood Plaza today. Lucy Clock Tower is in the foreground.]]
Governor [[George Wallace]] made his infamous "[[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door]]", standing in the front entrance of [[Foster Auditorium]] in a symbolic attempt to stop Malone and Hood's enrollment. When confronted by [[United States Deputy Attorney General|U.S. deputy attorney general]] [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] and [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshal]]s sent in by [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Wallace stepped aside. President [[John F. Kennedy]] had called for the integration of the University of Alabama, as well.<ref>{{cite news |title=1963 Year in Review – Part 1 |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/University-of-Alabama/12295509434394-4/ |agency=United Press International |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> Although Hood dropped out of school after two months, he subsequently returned and, in 1997, received his PhD in philosophy. Malone persisted in her studies and became the first African American to graduate from the university. In 2000, the university granted her a doctorate of humane letters. Autherine Lucy's expulsion was rescinded in 1980, and she successfully re-enrolled and graduated with a master's degree in 1992. Later in his life, Wallace apologized for his opposition at that time to [[racial integration]]. In 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by rechristening the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting a clock tower – Autherine Lucy Clock Tower – in the plaza.

===2011 tornado===
{{Main|2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado}}
On [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27, 2011]], Tuscaloosa was hit by a tornado rated EF4 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], which left a large path of complete destruction but spared the campus. Six students who lived on off-campus premises were confirmed dead by the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ua.edu/weather/april-27-2011/in-memoriam/ |title=In Memoriam – April 27, 2011 Storm |work=ua.edu}}</ref> Due to the infrastructural damage of the city (approx. 12% of the city) and the loss of life, the university cancelled the rest of the spring semester and postponed graduation.

The university maintains the [[University of Alabama Arboretum]] in eastern Tuscaloosa and the [[Dauphin Island Sea Lab]] on [[Dauphin Island, Alabama|Dauphin Island]], just off the Alabama Gulf Coast. In 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the university a College Sustainability Report Card grade of "B+".<ref name="Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card">{{cite web |title=College Sustainability Report Card 2011 |publisher=Sustainable Endowments Institute |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-alabama |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>

===Landmarks===
UA is home to several museums, cultural facilities and historical landmarks.

The [[Alabama Museum of Natural History]] at Smith Hall exhibits Alabama's rich natural history. The oddest artifact there could be the [[Sylacauga (meteorite)|Sylacauga meteorite]], the largest known extraterrestrial object to strike a human being who survived. The [[Paul W. Bryant Museum]] houses memorabilia and exhibits on the history of UA athletic programs, most notably the tenure of football coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]]. Athletic trophies and awards are displayed at the [[Mal Moore]] Athletic Building, named for the university's former athletic director, near the Bryant Museum. The Sarah Moody Gallery of Art at Garland Hall hosts revolving exhibitions of contemporary art, including from the university's own permanent collection. The Ferguson Art Gallery at the Ferguson Center also hosts revolving art exhibitions. The [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Jones Archaeological Museum]] at [[Moundville, Alabama|Moundville]] exhibits the history of [[Mississippian culture]] in Alabama.

Numerous historical landmarks dot the campus, including the [[President's Mansion (University of Alabama)|President's Mansion]], [[Denny Chimes]], [[Foster Auditorium]] (a [[National Historical Landmark]]), the [[Gorgas–Manly Historic District]], and [[Old University of Alabama Observatory|Maxwell Observatory]].

A cemetery next to the Biology building includes the graves of two slaves who were owned by faculty members before the Civil War. Both men died in the 1840s, and their graves went unmarked until 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cw.ua.edu/2012/01/24/on-campus-gravesite-recalls-antebellum-university/|title=On-campus gravesite recalls antebellum university|work=ua.edu|access-date=August 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105174827/http://cw.ua.edu/2012/01/24/on-campus-gravesite-recalls-antebellum-university/|archive-date=November 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are 12 other academic divisions at the University of Alabama (see the table above). Eight divisions (<abbr title="Arts & Sciences">CAS</abbr>, C&BA, C&IS, Education, Engineering, HES, Nursing, and Social Work) grant undergraduate degrees. Degrees in those eight divisions at the master's, [[Ed.S.|specialist]], and [[doctorate|doctoral]] level are awarded through the Graduate School. The law school offers [[Juris Doctor|JD]] and [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] degree programs. CHS provides advanced studies in medicine and related disciplines and operates a family medicine residency program. Medical students are also trained in association with the [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]], from which they receive their degree.

The College of Continuing Studies provides correspondence courses and other types of distance education opportunities for non-traditional students. It operates a distance education facility in [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]].

Founded in 1971 and merged into the College of Arts and Sciences in 1996, the stated objectives of New College were to "create an opportunity for a highly individualized education that enables students to draw from the resources of all University classes and faculty" and to "serve as an experimental unit with the expectation of exporting successful innovations to other sectors of the University."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nc.as.ua.edu/about/history/ |title=History |website=New College, The University of Alabama |access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> The college allows undergraduate students flexibility in choosing their curriculum while completing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in interdisciplinary studies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nc.as.ua.edu/about/ |title=About |website=New College, The University of Alabama |access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> The ''New College Review'', a non-fiction cultural journal, is written, edited, designed and published by students.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nc.as.ua.edu/about/new-college-review/ |title=New College Review |website=New College, The University of Alabama |access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>

In fall 2018, the university had an enrollment of 38,390 students, consisting of 33,028 undergraduates and 5,362 postgraduates, from all [[List of counties in Alabama|67 Alabama counties]], all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 78 foreign nations. Alabama residents comprised 39.8% of the undergraduate student body; out-of-state residents comprised 58.1%, and international (non-resident alien) students comprised 2.0%.<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 at a Glance: Total Enrollment |url=http://oira.ua.edu/new/reports/?Report%20Type[0][0]=Enrollment%20at%20a%20Glance|publisher=The Office of Institutional Research and Assessment, University of Alabama|accessdate=April 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Student life==
[[File:Campus Scene - University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa - Tuscaloosa - Alabama - USA - 02 (34012835260).jpg|thumb|right|A group of students on campus, 2017]]

===Residential life===
The board of trustees chose to locate the UA campus in a field a mile away from the center of the town of Tuscaloosa (which was a considerable distance in early 19th century Alabama). The board consciously chose to make on-campus residence an integral part of the student experience at UA. Dormitories were among the first buildings erected at Alabama (the remains of one [Franklin Hall] is now the Mound on the Quad), and student residential life has been emphasized at UA ever since. Dormitories at the university currently include Blount Hall, Bryant Hall, Burke Hall, Harris Hall, John England, Jr. Hall, Lakeside Hall, Parham Hall, Paty Hall, Presidential Village I and II, Riverside Hall, Tutwiler Hall, and Ridgecrest East, West, and South. There are also two on-campus apartment complexes, Bryce Lawn and the Highlands.<ref>title=University of Alabama Halls | url=https://housing.sa.ua.edu/halls/ | access date=May 8, 2020</ref> Today nearly 30% of students live on campus, including over 90% of first-year freshmen.<ref name="common-data-set"/>

===Student government===
The Student Government Association is the primary student advocacy organization at UA. The SGA is governed by the SGA Constitution<ref name="SGA-constitution">{{cite web |title=SGA Constitution |url=http://sga.ua.edu/documents/SGA%20Constitution,%20ratified%2002.01.11.pdf |publisher=The University of Alabama Student Government Association |date=February 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}</ref> and consists of a legislative branch, an executive branch and a judicial council.

====SGA controversy====
{{Main|The Machine (social group)}}

Since its founding in 1914, a secretive coalition of fraternities and sororities, commonly known as "[[The Machine (social group)|The Machine]]", has wielded enormous influence over the [[Student Government Association]]. Occurrences of harassment, intimidation, and even criminal activities aimed at opposition candidates have been reported. Many figures in local, state, and national politics have come out of the SGA at the University of Alabama. ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' devoted its April 1992 cover story to an exposé of The Machine. The controversy led to the university disbanding the SGA in 1993, which wasn't undone until 1996.<ref name="Mathews2006">{{cite book|last=Mathews|first=Mary Chapman|title=A Mansion's Memories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFbh9_Pbm78C&pg=PT139|accessdate=January 15, 2013|year=2006|publisher=U of Alabama P|isbn=9780817315351|pages=139–}}</ref> "Machine" fraternities and sororities have traditionally accepted only white pledges, with only one documented case of an African American student being offered entry, in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff|first=CW|title=Confirmed facts about the machine |url=http://cw.ua.edu/2011/30/confirmed-facts-about-the-machine/|accessdate=September 13, 2013|newspaper=The Crimson White|date=November 30, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130913063723/http://cw.ua.edu/2011/30/confirmed-facts-about-the-machine/|archive-date=September 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Scherker|first=Amanda|title=University of Alabama Sorority Chapters Allegedly Discriminate Against Black Women: Report|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/university-alabama-sororities-black_n_3909348.html|accessdate=September 13, 2013|newspaper=HuffPost|date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

Greek letter organizations (GLOs) first appeared at the university in 1847 when two men visiting from [[Yale University]] installed a chapter of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Psi Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon |url=http://www.uadke.org/s/index.cfm?SSID=14 |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320160424/http://www.uadke.org/s/index.cfm?SSID=14 |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When DKE members began holding secret meetings in the old state capitol building that year, the administration strongly voiced its disapproval.<ref name="Sellers"/> Over a few more decades, 7 other fraternities appeared at UA: [[Alpha Delta Phi]] in 1850, [[Phi Gamma Delta]] in 1855, [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] in 1856 (this was the founding chapter), [[Kappa Sigma]] in 1867, [[Sigma Nu]] in 1874, [[Sigma Chi]] in 1876, and [[Phi Delta Theta]] in 1877.<ref name="GLOs">{{cite web |url=http://oira.ua.edu/d/sites/all/files/reports10/0910_factbook/0910_p56.pdf |title=Social Fraternities and Sororities |work=University of Alabama Factbook 2009–2010 |publisher=University of Alabama Office of Institutional Research and Assessment |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> Anti-fraternity laws were imposed that year, but were lifted in the 1890s.<ref name="Sellers"/> Women at the university founded the Zeta chapter of [[Kappa Delta]] sorority in 1903. [[Alpha Delta Pi]] soon followed.<ref name="GLOs" />

[[Hazing]] at UA fraternities, as in most American colleges, has been common. The [[Atlanta Constitution]] newspaper reported students receiving "100 licks with a paddle" by fellow students multiple times in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tavm.omeka.net/items/show/254|title=William Carlos Jemison, 1850–1901, Mayor of Tuscaloosa from 1880 to 1890 · Tuscaloosa Area Virtual Museum|website=tavm.omeka.net}}</ref>

In fall 2009, the university sanctioned 29 men's and 23 women's GLOs.<ref name="GLOs"/> Additionally, an unknown number of non-sanctioned GLOs existed. Four governing boards oversee the operations of the university-sanctioned GLOs: the [[Interfraternity Council]] (IFC), the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC), the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC) and the Unified Greek Council (UGC).

The number of men in GLOs more than doubled from 2002 to 2009, with fifteen fraternities reporting active memberships of more than 100 (where as recently as 2001 none reported memberships greater than 100). Following 2008 fall recruitment, almost all Panhellenic sororities participating through all rounds had potential new member class sizes of 80 or more; nearly all Panhellenic sororities also now have more than 200 total members. To accommodate growth in the student population since 2005, the university has sanctioned three new fraternities and two new sororities.<ref name="GLOs"/> Additionally, four new sorority houses were added, built behind the President's Mansion.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ethan Summers |title=Four new sorority houses to be built in 2011 |url=http://www.cw.ua.edu/2010/07/22/four-new-sorority-houses-to-be-built-in-2011 |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807214312/http://cw.ua.edu/2010/07/22/four-new-sorority-houses-to-be-built-in-2011/ |archive-date=August 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The University of Alabama's intercollegiate athletic teams are known as the ''Alabama Crimson Tide'' (this name can be shortened to ''Alabama'', the ''Crimson Tide'', or even the ''Tide''). The nickname ''Crimson Tide'' originates from a 1907 football game versus [[Auburn University]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] where, after a hard-fought game in torrential rain in which Auburn had been heavily favored to win, Alabama forced a tie. Writing about the game, one sportswriter described the offensive line as a "Crimson Tide", in reference to their jerseys, stained red from the wet dirt.

Alabama competes primarily in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (Western Division) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]. Alabama fields men's varsity teams in [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|football]], [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|basketball]], [[Alabama Crimson Tide baseball|baseball]], [[Alabama Crimson Tide golf|golf]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], swimming and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], tennis, and track and field. Women's varsity teams are fielded in [[Alabama Crimson Tide women's basketball|basketball]], [[Alabama Crimson Tide golf|golf]], cross country, [[Alabama Crimson Tide women's gymnastics|gymnastics]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], soccer, [[Alabama Crimson Tide softball|softball]], swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and [[Alabama Crimson Tide volleyball|volleyball]]. The Athletic facilities on campus include the [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]], named after legendary football coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] and former UA President George Denny, and the 14,619-seat [[Coleman Coliseum]]. Alabama's women's rowing team competes in the Big 12 conference of the NCAA's Division I.

Alabama maintains athletic rivalries with [[Auburn University]] and the [[University of Tennessee]]. The rivalry with Auburn is especially heated as it encompasses all sports. The annual Alabama-Auburn football game is nicknamed the ''[[Iron Bowl]]''. While the rivalry with Tennessee is centered around football for the most part, there is no shortage of acrimony here, especially given the recent history between then-UT Coach [[Phillip Fulmer]] and his relationship to the Tide's most recent NCAA probation. There are also rivalries with [[Louisiana State University]] (football and baseball), [[University of Mississippi]] (football and men's basketball), [[Mississippi State University]] (football, men's basketball), [[University of Georgia]] (women's gymnastics), and the [[University of Florida]] (football, softball).

===Football===

The [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama football]] program, started in 1892, has won 25 SEC titles and 17 national championships (including 9 awarded by the [[Associated Press]] and 8 by the Coaches Poll).<ref name="nationalchamps">{{cite web |title=Past Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I FBS) National Champions (formerly called Division I-A) |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/NCAA/Sports+and+Championship/General+Information/ia_football_past_champs.html |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611083727/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2FNCAA%2FSports+and+Championship%2FGeneral+Information%2Fia_football_past_champs.html |archive-date=June 11, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The program has compiled 36 10-win seasons and 59 bowl appearances, winning 32 of them – all [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] records. Alabama has produced 18 [[Alabama Crimson Tide football#College Football Hall of Fame inductees|hall-of-famers]], 97 [[List of Alabama Crimson Tide football All-Americans|All-Americans]] honored 105 times, and 2 Heisman trophy winners ([[Mark Ingram Jr.]] and [[Derrick Henry]]).

The Crimson Tide's current home venue, [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]], opened in 1929 with a capacity of around 12,000. The most recent addition of the stadium was completed in 2010. An upper deck was added in the south end zone, completing the upper deck around the stadium. The current official capacity of the stadium is 101,821. The previous addition was the north end zone expansion, completed 2006. The Tide has also played many games, including the [[Iron Bowl]] against rival [[Auburn University]], at [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

Nearly synonymous with Alabama football is legendary coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] whose record at the University of Alabama was 232–46–9. He led the Crimson Tide to 6 national titles in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979, which is tied with Notre Dame's legendary coach [[Knute Rockne]] and Alabama's current head football coach [[Nick Saban]]. Additionally, the 1966 team was the only one in the country to finish with a perfect record, but poll voters denied the 12–0 Alabama team the three-peat as Michigan State and Notre Dame played each other to a [[1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game|10–10]] tie in what was considered the "Game of the Century" and subsequently split the national championship.<!--somebody more familiar with this should place Bryant's stats during his tenure and nothing more. Anything deeper belongs either at [[University of Alabama athletics]] or [[Bear Bryant]]!-->

Alabama won its third BCS National Championship in January 2013 defeating Notre Dame 42–14, becoming the first school to win three BCS Titles. On January 1, 2015 No. 1 Alabama lost to No. 4 Ohio St. in the second game of the first College Football Playoffs 42–35. On December 12, 2015, running back [[Derrick Henry]] was awarded the Heisman Trophy, becoming only the second winner for the University of Alabama. On January 11, 2016, Alabama defeated Clemson to win the National Championship, 45–40. In January 2017, Alabama lost to Clemson 35–31 in the National Championship.

===School songs===
The school's fight song is "[[Yea Alabama]]", written in 1926 by Lundy Sykes, then editor of the campus newspaper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Studwell |first=William Emmett |author2=Bruce R. Schueneman |title=College Fight Songs II: A Supplementary Anthology |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7890-0920-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T_VguL00J0C&pg=RA1-PA21 |accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref> Sykes composed the song in response to a contest by the Rammer Jammer to create a fight song following Alabama's first Rose Bowl victory. The song as it is currently played by the Million Dollar Band during games and known to most people is simply the chorus of the larger song.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sparks |first=Linda |author2=Bruce Emerton |title=American college regalia: a handbook |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-313-26266-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/americancolleger00spar |url-access=registration |quote=yea alabama crimson tide. |accessdate=February 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tradition – Songs of Alabama |url=http://www.rolltide.com/trads/song-downloads.html |publisher=Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, University of Alabama |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041405/http://www.rolltide.com/trads/song-downloads.html |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Alabama Alma Mater is set to the tune of ''[[Annie Lisle]]'', a ballad written in the 1850s.
