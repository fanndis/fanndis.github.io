In [[heraldry]], '''argent''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|dʒ|ən|t}} is the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of [[silver (color)|silver]], and belongs to the class of light [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] called "metals". It is very frequently depicted as [[white]] and usually considered interchangeable with it. In engravings and line drawings, regions to be tinctured ''argent'' are either left blank, or indicated with the abbreviation '''''ar''.''' 

The name derives from [[Latin]] ''argentum'', translated as "[[silver]]" or "white [[metal]]". The word ''argent'' had the same meaning in Old French ''[[blazon]]'', whence it passed into the English language.

In some historical depictions of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], a kind of silver leaf was applied to those parts of the device that were argent. Over time, the silver content of these depictions has [[tarnish]]ed and darkened. As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish regions that were intended as "argent" from those that were "[[sable (heraldry)|sable]]". This leaves a false impression that the [[rule of tincture]] has been violated in cases where, when applied next to a dark colour, argent now appears to be sable due to [[tarnish]].

==Argent versus white==
Arthur Charles Fox-Davies argued extensively in his [[book]] ''[[The Art of Heraldry|The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclopaedia of Armory]]'' that, though extremely rare, the colour white existed as an independent tincture in heraldry separate from argent. He bases this in part on the "white [[label (heraldry)|label]]s" used to differentiate the arms of members of the [[British Royal Family]]. However, it has been argued that these could be regarded as "white labels proper", thus rendering white not a heraldic tincture.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scottish Heraldry Forum Message: Paton - help|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/Forum/ShowMessage.asp?ID=2700|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910033209/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/Forum/ShowMessage.asp?ID=2700|archivedate = 2003-09-10|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>

White does seem to be regarded as a different tincture from argent in [[Portuguese heraldry]], as evidenced by the arms of [[Santiago do Cacém|municipal de Santiago do Cacém]] in [[Portugal]], in which the white of the fallen Moor's clothing and the knight's horse is distinguished from the argent of the distant castle, and in the arms of the Logistical and Administrative Command of the [[Portuguese Air Force]].

==Meaning==
Sometimes, the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues, and represent certain elements and precious stones. Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries,<ref>{{cite book|first1= Thomas|last1= Woodcock|author-link1= Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|first2= John Martin|last2= Robinson|authorlink2= John Martin Robinson|title= The Oxford Guide to Heraldry|location= Oxford|year= 1988|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 0-19-211658-4|page=53}}</ref> it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are, since the information is so often sought after. Many sources give different meanings, but argent is often said to represent the following:
* Of jewels, the [[pearl]]
* Of heavenly bodies, the [[Moon]]
* Of metals, [[silver]]
