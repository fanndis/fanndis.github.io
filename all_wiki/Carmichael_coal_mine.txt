In August 2020 the traditional owners of the land on which the Adani Carmichael mine is being built, the Wangan and Jagalingou people blocked a road to the mine for 5 days.

=== Rail line ===
Two parallel proposals for rail lines between the Carmichael mine and port facilities were floated during the planning process.

In 2014, Adani signed an agreement with South Korean construction company [[POSCO]] to develop the [[North Galilee Basin Rail Project]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Adani, POSCO E&C sign pact to develop rail line in Australia |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/adani-posco-e-c-sign-pact-to-develop-rail-line-in-australia-114071800626_1.html |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> This {{convert|388|km|mi}} [[Standard-gauge railway|standard-gauge]] rail line would provide capacity of 100 million tonnes of coal per year, increasing access to the Galilee Basin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=North Galilee Basin Rail Project |url=http://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/assessments-and-approvals/north-galilee-basin-rail-project.html |website=www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="rg 0918"/> Authorities suggested the line be financed by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iminco.net/5-billion-northern-australia-infrastructure-facility-cash-for-mines/ |title=$5 Billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Cash For Mines |last= |first= |date= |website=|access-date=28 October 2017 |quote=}}</ref> though the Queensland provincial government rejected a funding request in November 2017.<ref name="guardian rail">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/09/setback-for-adani-as-aurizon-withdraws-loan-request-for-rail-line |title=Setback for Adani as Aurizon withdraws loan request for rail line |work=The Guardian |date=8 February 2018 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, Adani announced that it had abandoned plans to build the standard gauge line in favor of constructing a {{convert|200|km|mi}} [[3 ft 6 in gauge railways|1,067mm]] line to a connection with existing narrow-gauge trackage.<ref name="rg 0918">{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/freight/single-view/view/adani-scales-back-carmichael-rail-link-plans.html |title=Adani scales back Carmichael rail link plans |publisher=Railway Gazette International |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>

Queensland freight rail operator [[Aurizon]] had separate plans to develop narrow-gauge rail lines in the Galilee Basin to serve what it described as "several" entities planning mines in the area, including Carmichael, but with no firm agreements close to complete it withdrew a loan request from the NAIF in February 2018.<ref name="guardian rail"/>

== Financing ==

In 2015, the Government-owned [[State Bank of India]] (SBI) signed a [[Memorandum of understanding]] with Adani that it will offer a $1&nbsp;billion loan to the project, yet was widely reported that the Bank had withdrawn this offer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SBI to turn down Adani's $1&nbsp;billion Australian loan request – sources |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/13/india-adani-sbi-idINKBN0M914T20150313 |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> This was rejected by the bank's Chairman.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SBI rejects report of scrapping $1 bn loan pact with Adani |url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-rejects-reportscrapping361-bn-loan-pactadani_1329059.html |website=www.moneycontrol.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, a number of major international banks publicly ruled out financing the Carmichael Mine and Rail Project, or the [[Abbot Point|Abbot Point Coal Terminal]] on which the Carmichael project depends.

=== Financial viability ===
Analysts have doubt the mine is viable given seaborne (imported) thermal coal prices and market trends. 
In November 2013 [[Morgan Stanley]] valued the mine at $0 and said "the company does not plan to spend money on developing the mine until coal prices rise from current levels".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.adani.com/Common/Uploads/FinanceTemplate/3_FFReport_AEL_Morgan_Nov_13_293_update.pdf |title=Adani Enterprises Ltd – Hunkering Down; Waiting for Resolution on Adani Power |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate= |website= |last=Morgan Stanley}}</ref> In November 2014 Daniel Morgan, global commodities analyst at investment bank [[UBS]], said that a price of about $100–$110 a tonne was required to cover costs and return on capital.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Adani steps up Australia coal plans ahead of Modi visit |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/12/adani-ent-australia-coal-idUSL3N0T126820141112 |newspaper=Reuters |date=12 November 2014|access-date = 9 September 2015}}</ref> Seaborne [[thermal coal]] prices (Newcastle benchmark) have dropped from highs of around US$140/t in 2012 to around US$60/t in 2015 due to increases in production and reduction in seaborne coal demand.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UBS-report-Japan-et-al.pdf |title=Thermal Coal Markets – Opportunity for Japan? |publisher=UBS |last=Shaw |first=Lachlan|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191011/http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UBS-report-Japan-et-al.pdf|archive-date = 3 March 2016|url-status = dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In September 2015, [[UBS]] said in a briefing note "no new coal mines needed on 5+ year view" and projected prices recovering to $88/t by 2019—still below the required price for Carmichael.<ref name=":2" />

The director of energy finance studies Australasia at the [[Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis]], argued in 2015 that the Carmichael mine is a '[[stranded asset]]' due to structural decline in seaborne coal markets; Adani's already high debt gearing; difficulty raising capital, a recent company restructure and approval delays.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IEEFA-key-points-Adani-in-Galilee.pdf |title=Galilee Coal Basin:Carmichael – A Stranded Asset? |date=May 2015 |accessdate= |website= |publisher=IEEFA |last=Buckley |first=Tim}}</ref> In 2015, documents from Queensland Treasury released under [[Freedom of information laws by country|Freedom of Information]] showed senior officials advising Ministers that Carmichael "is unlikely to stack up on a conventional project finance assessment".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Adani's Carmichael Mine is unbankable says Queensland Treasury |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/adanis-carmichael-mine-is-unbankable-says-queensland-treasury-20150630-gi1l37.html |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, [[LG Corporation|LG]] announced it will not proceed with a contract to buy coal from the mine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Adani loses LG as big customer for Carmichael mine |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/adani-loses-lg-as-big-customer-for-carmichael-mine-20150902-gjdu73.html |accessdate=9 September 2015}}</ref> Most of the coal from the mine would be purchased by Adani in India. However, by June 2019, the costs of [[Solar energy#Development, deployment and economics|solar power generation]] in India had decreased to the point that government subsidies might be required to make coal powered generation in India economically feasible.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/change-is-coming-al-gore-says-economics-will-break-fossil-fuel-dinosaurs |title='Change is coming': Al Gore says economics will break fossil fuel dinosaurs |last=Remeikis |first=Amy |date=6 June 2019 |work=The Guardian|access-date=7 June 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

== Proposed government subsidies ==
{{As of |2017}} [[Mining in Australia|Australia's mining industry]] put "well over half a billion dollars into lobby groups that push coal and fossil fuels" .<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/adani-mine-australia-climate-change-848315/ |title=The World's Most Insane Energy Project Moves Ahead |last=Goodell |first=Jeff |date=14 June 2019 |website=Rolling Stone |language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref>

From 2015 onward, the Queensland and Australian Governments have proposed various forms of assistance to the project despite the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] commitment to phase out "inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies.

According to the mine's environmental impact statement it will produce 200&nbsp;million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] over the expected 60-year life of the mine.<ref name="fca">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/14/federal-court-asked-to-overturn-adani-mine-approval-impact-great-barrier-reef |title=Federal court asked to overturn Adani mine approval due to impact on Great Barrier Reef |author=Lenore Taylor |accessdate=21 January 2015 |date=14 January 2015 |newspaper=[[TheGuardian.com]]}}</ref> This includes gases produced during the mining process and from emissions created from the mining and transportation of the coal. Deciding on the approval for the mine, The President of the Land Court of Queensland stated, "there will be no increase of greenhouse gas emissions if the Carmichael mine is approved. This is because alternative supply will be sourced elsewhere to meet global demand if the mine is not approved."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2015/QLC15-048.pdf |title=Adani Mining Pty Ltd v Land Services of Coast and Country Inc & Ors [2015] QLC 48 |date=15 December 2015 |publisher=LAND COURT OF QUEENSLAND |page=103}}</ref>

The emissions from burning the amount of coal expected to be produced from this one mine, whether sourced from it or elsewhere, would, in a "worst-case"scenario be, "approximately 0.53–0.56% of the [[Emissions budget|carbon budget]] that remains after 2015 to have a likely chance of not exceeding 2 degrees warming...over at least 60 years... Approval of the Mine, therefore, could be either consistent or inconsistent with the goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees, depending on a range of external factors..." according to Doctor Chris Taylor and Associate Professor Malte Meinshausen.<ref name=":0" />

The revised 10 million tonnes of coal per annum Carmichael mine will produce 240,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. To put this in perspective Queensland overall produces more than 95.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=March 2019|title=Emissions Facts|url=https://www.adaniaustralia.com/-/media/190314%20-%20Emissions%20Facts%20_FINAL|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

Adani has applied for a water licence to extract up to 12.5 GL per year from the [[Belyando River]] for use at the Carmichael mine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.adanimining.com/Common/Uploads/SEISDocuments/39_SEISDoc_Appendix%20C4e%20-%20Application%20to%20take%20water%20from%20the%20Belyando%20River.pdf |title=SEIS Appendix 20 – Application to take water from the Belyando River |last=Adani|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304142308/http://www.adanimining.com/Common/Uploads/SEISDocuments/39_SEISDoc_Appendix%20C4e%20-%20Application%20to%20take%20water%20from%20the%20Belyando%20River.pdf|archive-date =4 March 2016|url-status =dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The mine will also use groundwater that flows to the surface during the process of "dewatering" the open cut pits and underground mines.

According to the Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) submitted by Adani, "maximum impacts in excess of 300m are predicted" for the local water table.  Beyond the mine boundary, Adani's groundwater model predicts water table levels to drop "typically between 20 and 50m" and "up to around 4m in the vicinity of the [Carmichael] river".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Supplementary EIS Documents |url=http://www.adanimining.com/seis-pdfdocs-details/50/154|archive-url = https://archive.today/20151020162014/http://www.adanimining.com/seis-pdfdocs-details/50/154|url-status = dead|archive-date = 20 October 2015 |website=www.adanimining.com |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> Impacts on ground water were central to a case in the QLD Land Court, where Adani's expert witness defended inferences drawn from drilling data, against allegations that this was insufficient to determine risks of collapses underground that could impact groundwater systems.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Groundwater dominates discussion at Adani court case |url=http://www.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/groundwater-dominates-discussion-adani-court-case/2601119/ |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

== Legal challenges ==
There have been a number of legal challenges to the project.

=== Native Title claims ===

==== ''Adani Mining Pty Ltd and Another v Adrian Burragubba, Patrick Malone and Irene White on behalf of the Wangan and Jagalingou People'' ====
Indigenous landholders mounted a challenge to Carmichael Mine, and called on the Queensland Government to refuse a mining lease to Adani Mining. In 2016 the [[Wangan people|Wangan and Jagalingou]] people voted 294 to 1 in favour of a [[Indigenous Land Use Agreement]] with Adani.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements Details|url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/searchRegApps/NativeTitleRegisters/Pages/ILUA_details.aspx?NNTT_Fileno=QI2016/015|access-date=2020-09-10|website=www.nntt.gov.au}}</ref>

=== Environmental law ===

==== ''Mackay Conservation Group v Commonwealth of Australia and Adani Mining'' ====
In January 2015, the [[Mackay Conservation Group]], based in [[Mackay Region|Mackay]], challenged the July 2013 federal approval of the Carmichael project by [[Greg Hunt]], Environment Minister, under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Mackay Conservation Group challenges Adani mine in Federal Court |url=http://www.theage.com.au/queensland/mackay-conservation-group-challenges-adani-mine-in-federal-court-20150115-12qwnp.html |newspaper=The Age |date=15 January 2015|access-date = 10 September 2015 |first=Jorge |last=Branco}}</ref> The Group was represented by the [[Environmental Defenders Office of NSW]].

* That the Minister unlawfully excluded consideration of greenhouse gas emissions to emissions directly associated with the operation of the mine. The Minister did not consider the much larger emissions associated with burning the coal from the mine. 
* That the Minister failed to consider Adani's poor record of environmental management in India, including building without approvals and illegally clearing mangroves,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/Global/australia/volunteer/Adani's%20record.pdf |title=Research Briefing: Adani's record of environmental destruction and non-compliance with regulations |date=10 March 2014 |accessdate= |website= |last=Greenpeace}}</ref> instead relying on a statement from the company that it has a good track record.
* That the Minister did not consider "approved conservation advice" for two [[endangered species]] that would be affected by the mine, the [[Yakka Skink]] and the [[ornamental snake]], as required by federal law.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 1999 – SECT 139 Requirements for decisions about threatened species and endangered communities |url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/s139.html |website=www5.austlii.edu.au |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>
The [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] set aside the approval on the latter ground. Despite reports Federal Court "overturned" the approval,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Court overturns approval of Adani Carmichael coal mine in Queensland |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/federal-court-overturns-approval-of-adani-carmichael-coal-mine-in-queensland-20150805-girtz9.html |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> the decision occurred by [[consent order]] signed by the [[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of Environment]] and [[Adani Group|Adani]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Court intervenes over Adani 'lawfare' |url=http://www.afr.com/news/federal-court-intervenes-over-adani-lawfare-20150819-gj2w2q |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

==== ''Adani Mining Pty Ltd v Land Services of Coast and Country Inc.'' ====
In May 2014 the Queensland Coordinator General recommended the project be approved<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/resources/project/carmichael/carmichael-coal-mine-and-rail-cg-report-may2014.pdf |title=Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Coordinator General's Report |date= |accessdate= |website=May 2014 |last= |first=}}</ref> and there was a call for public comment and objections. [[Coast and Country]], represented by [[Environmental Defenders Office Queensland]], brought a case to the [[Queensland Land Court]]. They contended:
# "Adani grossly overstated to the public the number of jobs, and royalties the mine would have for Queensland;
# The mine, rail and port as well as the burning of coal will cause damage to the Great Barrier Reef from climate change and ocean acidification;
# The mine will destroy the core population of endangered Black Throated Finch and may impact Waxy Cabbage Palms, and the potatoes grown in the area too;
# The mine will threaten the base flow of the Carmichael River and may threaten the ancient springs estimated to be one million years old; and
# The project is extremely risky and unlikely to be financially viable."<ref>{{Cite web |title=LATEST ON THE CASE: Adani Carmichael coal mine objection {{!}} Edo QLD|url = http://www.edoqld.org.au/adani-carmichael-live-feed/|website = www.edoqld.org.au|accessdate = 10 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150813230951/http://www.edoqld.org.au/adani-carmichael-live-feed/|archive-date = 13 August 2015|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

==== ''Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Minister for the Environment – Emissions challenge 2016–17'' ====
The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] (ACF) made a judicial review challenge under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (''EPBC Act'') which was dismissed in 2016, followed by an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://theconversation.com/why-arent-australias-environment-laws-preventing-widespread-land-clearing-92924 |title=Why aren't Australia's environment laws preventing widespread land clearing? |last=Hepburn |first=Samantha |work=The Conversation|access-date=3 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref> ACF lost the appeal in 2017. Adani Mining PTY LTD were the second respondents in the case.

The main contention was that the Minister did not consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the [[Great Barrier Reef]].

The case was dismissed because the court found that the cause and effect was complicated, the lower court stating that it was "not possible for him [the Minister] to draw firm conclusions as to the likely contribution of Adani's action to a specific increase in global temperature" and that if the coal was stopped from the Carmichael Mine it would likely be substituted from somewhere else.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2016/2016fca1042 |title=Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated v Minister for the Environment [2016] FCA 1042 |last= |first= |date= |website=|access-date=}}</ref> Dr Justine Bell-James has criticised the market substitution defence as the "only significant barrier remaining to a successful climate change case".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://theconversation.com/carmichael-mine-jumps-another-legal-hurdle-but-litigants-are-making-headway-69423 |title=Carmichael mine jumps another legal hurdle, but litigants are making headway |last=Bell-James |first=Justine |date=26 November 2016 |work=The Conversation |access-date=2 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The Court ordered ACF to be part of the legal costs for Adani and the Minister.

On 16 March 2020, the ACF once again lodged papers in court to take action against the government.

=== Criticism of legal action ===
Substantial controversy about federal environmental law followed the 2015 Federal Court decision to set aside the Carmichael approval (agreed by consent orders signed by the government). Government Ministers criticised the group bringing this case under [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999|federal environment law]], calling them "vigilante litigants" engaged in economic "sabotage".<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=18 August 2015—Government acts to protect jobs from vigilante litigants |url=http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2015/ThirdQuarter/18-August-2015-Government-acts-to-protect-jobs-from-vigilante-litigants.aspx |website=www.attorneygeneral.gov.au |accessdate=9 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150823020319/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2015/ThirdQuarter/18-August-2015-Government-acts-to-protect-jobs-from-vigilante-litigants.aspx|archive-date = 23 August 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>
