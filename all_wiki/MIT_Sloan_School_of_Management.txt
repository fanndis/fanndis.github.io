The '''MIT Sloan School of Management''' (also known as '''MIT Sloan''' or '''Sloan''') is the [[business school]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], United States.<ref name=about-mit-sloan />
MIT Sloan offers [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|master's]], and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degree programs, as well as [[executive education]].<ref name=about-mit-sloan /> Its degree programs are among the most selective in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111013/most-selective-business-schools/|title=Most Selective Business Schools|publisher=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]|date=October 20, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101153000/http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111013/most-selective-business-schools|archive-date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>
MIT Sloan emphasizes innovation in practice and research.<ref name=about-mit-sloan /> Many influential ideas in management and finance originated at the school, including the [[Black–Scholes model]], the [[Solow–Swan model]], the [[random walk hypothesis]], the [[binomial options pricing model]], and the field of [[system dynamics]]. The faculty has included numerous [[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel laureates in economics]] and [[John Bates Clark Medal]] winners.

==History==
[[File:MITSloanE62.jpg|thumb|250px|left|MIT Sloan completed its new central building, known as ''E62'', in 2010]]
The MIT Sloan School of Management began in 1914 as the engineering administration curriculum ("Course 15") in the MIT Department of Economics and Statistics. The scope and depth of this educational focus grew steadily in response to advances in the theory and practice of management.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.metromba.com/school/mit-sloan-school-of-management/|title=MIT - Sloan School of Management {{!}} MetroMBA|work=MetroMBA|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}</ref>

A program offering a master's degree in management was established in 1925. The world's first university-based mid-career education program—the [[Sloan Fellows]] program—was created in 1931 under the sponsorship of [[Alfred P. Sloan]], himself an 1895 MIT graduate, who was the chief executive officer of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and has since been credited with creating the modern corporation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|title=The MIT 150: 150 Ideas, Inventions, and Innovators that Helped Shape Our World|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=May 15, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2011}}</ref> An [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] grant established the MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 with the charge of educating the "ideal manager". In 1964, the school was renamed in Sloan's honor as the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. In the following decades, the school grew to the point that in 2000, management became the second-largest undergraduate major at MIT. In 2005, an undergraduate minor in management was opened to 100 students each year. In 2014, the school celebrated 100 years of management education at MIT.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Since its founding, the school has initiated many international efforts to improve regional economies and positively shape the future of global business. In the 1960s, the school played a leading role in founding the first [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta|Indian Institute of Management]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Other initiatives include the MIT-China Management Education Project, the International Faculty Fellows Program, and partnerships with [[IESE Business School]] in Spain, [[Sungkyunkwan University]] in [[South Korea]], [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]] in [[Portugal]], the [[Skolkovo Moscow School of Management]] in Russia, and [[Tsinghua University]] in China. In 2014, the school launched the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program ([http://reap.mit.edu REAP]), which brings leaders from developing regions to MIT for two years to improve their economies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/singapore-president-hosts-delegation-0724|title=Singaporean President Tony Tan hosts MIT delegation|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT News]]|date=July 24, 2015|access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref> In 2015, MIT worked in collaboration with the [[Central Bank of Malaysia]] to establish [[Asia School of Business]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://asb.edu.my/about/mit-connection|title=About Asia School of Business in collaboration with MIT Sloan|date=2020-02-18|website=Asia School of Business Malaysia|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>

The curriculum is focused on action learning, which requires that students apply concepts learned in the classroom to real-world business settings. Courses are taught using the [[case method]], lectures, team projects, and hands-on Action Learning Labs. The academic level of coursework is considered extremely demanding by business school standards, with a greater emphasis on analytical reasoning and [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] than most programs.<ref name=about-mit-sloan />

Academic rigor has a strong influence on the school's culture. The first semester, also known as the core, is often considered the most difficult semester by design. Courses are graded using letter grades and on the standard five-point MIT scale. In its graduate programs, anything less than a 4.0 ('B') average will result in the student not being allowed to graduate. Unlike most business schools, MIT Sloan does not offer any academic honors at graduation, consistent with the practice throughout all of MIT. The philosophy behind this is that the 'honor' is in being an MIT graduate.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mitsloan.mit.edu/student-blogs/mba-2015/where-we-earn-our-honors/|title = Where We Earn Our Honors|date=August 1, 2014|access-date=August 1, 2015 |publisher =MIT Sloan School of Management |last = Morales|first = Andrew}}</ref>

MIT Sloan closely collaborates with other parts of MIT, in particular the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science|School of Science]], and the [[MIT Department of Economics|Department of Economics]]. A special joint degree program with the School of Engineering is the [[Leaders for Global Operations]] (LGO) program, where students concurrently complete an MBA and a Master of Science in Engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://lgo.mit.edu/|title = Leaders for Global Operations|access-date = May 21, 2015|publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}</ref> Another joint degree program aimed at students with more industry experience (an average of 8 to 10 years) is the System Design and Management (SDM) program,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sdm.mit.edu/|title = System Design and Management|access-date = April 21, 2020|publisher =Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}</ref> where students complete a Master of Science in Engineering and Management. Whereas [[Sloan Fellows]] focus primarily on management coursework, LGO and SDM fellows complete a relatively equal mixture of engineering and management coursework.

[[File:MIT Building 10 and the Great Dome, Cambridge MA.jpg|thumb|250px|left|MIT Sloan degrees are conferred at Killian Court in the Institute-wide commencement]]
MIT also collaborates extensively with [[Harvard University]], and students at each institution often pursue simultaneous degrees at the other.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} MIT Sloan students can freely cross-register for courses at [[Harvard Business School]], and vice versa—the only leading business schools to have such an agreement. As a result, a number of courses have been created at each institution that regularly attract cross-registered students. MIT Sloan and the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]] offer a formal dual degree program.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In a 2014 article, the school's Dewey Library was rated the best business school library in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/2014/08/05/the-12-exceptional-business-school-libraries-in-the-united-states|title=12 Exceptional Business School Libraries|access-date =August 11, 2015|publisher=CEO Magazine}}</ref> In 2016, the school's MBA program was ranked #2 worldwide for social and environmental impact by ''[[Corporate Knights]]'' magazine.<ref name="Corporate Knights MBA Rankings">{{cite web

MIT Sloan students and alumni informally call themselves ''Sloanies''. The MIT Sloan culture is similar to, but also distinct from, overall [[Traditions and student activities at MIT|MIT culture]], and is influenced most strongly by its MBA program. MBA students come from more than 60 countries every year, with just over half coming from [[North America]], and 60% holding US citizenship. Prior to business school, engineering is the most popular undergraduate major among students. 40% of the class is female.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|title =Record percentage of women to enter MIT Sloan this year|access-date =August 11, 2015|publisher =[[CBS]]|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221543/http://www.cbs8.com/story/29696725/record-percentage-of-women-to-enter-mit-sloan-this-year-of-the-402-students-in-the-mba-class-of-2017-41-will-be-female-according-to-preliminary|archive-date =September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=profile2016>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/class-profile/|title=Class Profile|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|access-date=December 31, 2016}}</ref>

Creativity and invention are constant themes at the school. The MBA track in ''Entrepreneurship & Innovation'' features action learning labs which pair students with companies to learn how to solve complex problems relating to emerging technologies. These action learning labs include ''Entrepreneurship Lab'', ''Innovation Teams'', and ''Leading Sustainable Systems Lab''. ''Global Entrepreneurship Lab'' and ''Global Health Delivery Lab'' send MBA students to work onsite with startups in different parts of the world. The [[Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship]], one of the few business school entrepreneurship centers in the world focused on [[high tech]], offers many other entrepreneurial activities and mentorship throughout the year.<ref name=eitrack>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/program-components/special-tracks-dual-degrees/entrepreneurship-and-innovation-track/|title=Entrepreneurship & Innovation Track|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|access-date=August 2, 2015}}</ref> The annual [[MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition]] is one of the largest business plan competitions in the world, helping to launch more than 130 companies with a market capitalization of over $15 billion.<ref name=100k>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/student-experience/events-and-competitions/100k/|title=The MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|access-date=August 2, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:MIT Walker Memorial.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Walker Memorial is the primary venue for C-Functions and other events]]
A staple of MIT Sloan MBA life is the weekly ''C-Function'', which stands for "cultural function" or "consumption function". The school sponsors food and drink for all members of the MIT Sloan graduate community to enjoy entertainment organized by specific campus cultural groups or clubs as well as parties with non-cultural themes. C-Functions are usually held most Thursdays in the Walker Memorial building, which is also used as the venue for many other MIT Sloan community events. MIT Sloan alumni groups around the world also organize C-Functions for their club members, for social and networking activities.

Students at MIT Sloan run over 70 active clubs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pai-Ling Yin |url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/mit-sloan-community/clubs-and-activities/mit-sloan-student-clubs1/ |title=MIT Sloan Student Clubs|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> Some of the most popular clubs are the ''Sloan Women in Management Club'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloanwomeninmanagement.com/ |title=MIT Sloan Women In Management |publisher=Sloan Women In Management |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> the ''Entrepreneurship & Innovation Club''; the ''Design Club''; the ''Finance Club''; the ''Management Consulting Club''; the ''Entertainment, Media and Sports Club''; the ''Venture Capital and Private Equity Club''; the ''Product Management Club'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmclub.scripts.mit.edu/wp |title=The MIT Product Management Club|publisher=The MIT Product Management Club |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> and the ''Technology Club''.

[[File:2009 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Ray Allen]] of the [[Boston Celtics]] at the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]]]]
Throughout the school year, a number of professional and academic conferences are organized by, or in partnership with, the school. Annual highlights include the [[MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition]], the [http://www.mitvcconference.com MIT Venture Capital & Innovation Conference], the [http://www.mitbreakingthemold.com Sloan Women in Management Breaking the Mold Conference], the [http://www.mitcio.com MIT Sloan CIO Symposium], and the [http://www.mitcfo.com MIT Sloan CFO Summit]. The most visible conference—and the largest student-run conference in the world—is the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]], which [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] ranked the #3 most innovative sports company, behind only the NFL and [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]].<ref name=fastco>{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/industry/sports|title=The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies: Top 10: Sports|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=May 1, 2012|access-date=June 11, 2013}}</ref> The conference brings managers, players, and coaches from over 80 professional sports teams together with journalists, researchers, and students from over 170 different schools. With its focus on analytics in the sports industry, [[Bill James]], the creator of [[Sabermetrics]], said that "this conference is a culmination of 30 years of my work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnradio/grantland/player?id=7639733 |title=The B.S. Report: 3/2 |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 3, 2012|access-date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

Like the rest of the institute, MIT Sloan students have an extended period between semesters reserved for special activities. During the month of January, there are no formal classes at the school; instead, they are replaced by what is known as the [[Traditions and student activities at MIT#Independent Activities Period (IAP)|Independent Activities Period (IAP)]]. During IAP, students engage in activities that would be challenging to participate in alongside regular classes, often including international travel programs. In the middle of semesters, the MBA program has an additional, shorter gap, called the Sloan Innovation Period (SIP), focusing on intensive experiential leadership activities outside of the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/program-components/personalized-curriculum/sip/|title=Sloan Innovation Period|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|access-date=August 2, 2015}}</ref>

After commencement, MIT Sloan graduates wear the [[MIT class ring]], known as the ''Brass Rat''. Top recruiters of new MBA graduates of the school include [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[McKinsey & Company]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]. The school has over 20,000 alumni globally in 90 countries, with more than 20% who are presidents or CEOs. More than 650 companies have been founded by alumni of the school, including [[Akamai]], [[E-Trade|E*Trade]], [[Gartner]], [[Genentech]], [[HubSpot]], [[Lotus Software]], [[Teradyne]], [[Zipcar]], and Okta.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/|title=MIT Sloan MBA Program|publisher=MIT Sloan School of Management|access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://miter.mit.edu/articlestudent-founder-series-interview-frederic-kerrest|title=Student To Founder Series: Interview With Frederic Kerrest {{!}} The MIT Entrepreneurship Review|website=miter.mit.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-24}}</ref>
