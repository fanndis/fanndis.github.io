The '''discovery doctrine''', also called '''doctrine of discovery''', provided a philosophical framework for Christian explorers, 
to lay claim to territories uninhabited by Christians.  Under this belief, [[title (property)|title]] to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine was strongly held by  King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain who financed Columbus' first expedition to America. The Spanish monarchs were strongly backed on this by [[Pope Alexander VI]], who confirmed their right of possession of all newly discovered lands in the Americas.<ref>[https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ngier/discovery.htm] THE DOCTRINE OF DISCOVERY
AND THE CHRISTIAN CONQUEST OF THE WORLD by Nick Gier, Professor Emeritus, University of Idaho</ref> He repeated what had been said by earlier Popes such as Nicholas V. As described by the Upstander Project, 
{{Quote
|text=Two papal bulls, in particular, stand out: (1) Pope Nicholas V issued "Romanus Pontifex" in 1455, granting the Portuguese a monopoly of trade with Africa and authorizing the enslavement of local people; (2) Pope Alexander VI issued the Papal Bull “Inter Caetera” in 1493 to justify Christian European explorers’ claims on land and waterways they allegedly discovered, and promote Christian domination and superiority, and has been applied in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas.
The 1493 Papal decree aimed to justify Christian European explorers’ claims on land and waterways they allegedly discovered, and promote Christian domination and superiority, and has been applied in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Americas. If an explorer proclaims to have discovered the land in the name of a Christian European monarch, plants a flag in its soil, and reports his “discovery” to the European rulers and returns to occupy it, the land is now his, even if someone else was there first.<ref>[https://upstanderproject.org/firstlight/doctrine#:~:text=Two%20papal%20bulls%2C%20in%20particular,justify%20Christian%20European%20explorers'%20claims]</ref>}}
The 1823 U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'' is an example of this. It was the result of [[collusive lawsuit]]s where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result.<ref>''How the Indians Lost Their Land: Law and Power on the Frontier'' Stuart Banner, 2005, pg 171–2</ref><ref>''The Dark Side of Efficiency: Johnson v. M'Intosh and the Expropriation of American Indian Lands'', Eric Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1065 2000, pg 148</ref> 
The doctrine has continued to be used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring [[Indigenous peoples]] possession of land in favor of modern colonial/imperial governments, such as in the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case of [[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York|Sherrill v. Oneida Nation]].
The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists, and has strongly challenged in Canada.

== History ==
The Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] under the guise of discovery.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States & American Indians|last=Harjo|first=Susan Shown|publisher=[[National Museum of the American Indian]]|year=2014|isbn=9781588344786|location=Washington, DC|pages=15–16}}</ref> In 1494, the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Doctrine of Discovery.

In 1792, U.S. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] claimed that this European Doctrine of Discovery was international law which would also apply equally to dealings the infant U.S. government would have with non-Christian lands.<ref>https://truthout.org/articles/the-united-states-is-founded-upon-the-model-of-european-conquest-dispose-of-the-disposable-people/</ref> The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence [[American imperialism]] and treatment of indigenous peoples.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=[[An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States]]|last=Dunbar-Ortiz|first=Roxanne|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=197–201}}</ref>

==''Johnson v. M'Intosh''==
{{main article|Johnson v. M'Intosh}}
The plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the [[Piankeshaw]] tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the [[Indiana Territory]] to [[Lord Dunmore]], royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to [[William Henry Harrison]], governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title.<ref name=Watson>{{Cite web|url=http://law.shu.edu/Students/academics/journals/law-review/Issues/archives/upload/watson.pdf|title=Watson, Blake A., "John Marshall and Indian Land Rights: A Historical Rejoinder to the Claim of "Universal Recognition" of the Doctrine of Discovery", ''Seton Hall Law Review'', Vol.36, 481}}</ref> In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson.  Rather than [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] himself from the case, however, the Chief Justice wrote the decision for a unanimous [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].<ref name="frichner">Frichner, Tonya Gonnella.

===Decision===
Marshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it [[Thirteen Colonies|inherited that ownership]] from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], the original discoverer.

Marshall noted:
<blockquote>On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.<ref name=Marshall>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historytools.org/sources/Johnson-v-MIntosh.pdf |title=Marshall, John.

Chief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull [[Romanus Pontifex]] approved [[Portugal]]'s claims to lands discovered along the coast of [[West Africa]], and the 1493 [[Inter Caetera]] had ratified [[Spain]]'s right to conquer newly found lands, after [[Christopher Columbus]] had already begun doing so,<ref name=Newcomb>{{cite journal | last = Newcomb | first = Steve |date=Fall 1992 | title = Five Hundred Years of Injustice | journal = Shaman's Drum | pages = 18–20 | url = http://ili.nativeweb.org/sdrm_art.html | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}</ref> but stated:
"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the {{not a typo|Brazils}} by the same title."<ref name=Marshall/>

==United States law==
Marshall pointed to the exploration charters given to the explorer [[John Cabot]] as proof that other nations had accepted the doctrine.<ref name=Newcomb/>  The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and had no [[property]] rights but rather merely held a right of [[occupancy]].  Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase.

The doctrine was cited in other cases as well.  With ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but "domestic dependent nations".<ref name=Newcomb/>  The decisions in ''[[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]'' and ''[[Duro v. Reina]]'' used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe.<ref name=Robertson>{{cite web | url = http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html | title = Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law | accessdate = 2007-01-10 | last = Robertson | first = Lindsay G. |date=June 2001 | work = Native American Constitution and Law Digitization Project | publisher = The University of Oklahoma Law Center}}</ref>

The doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in [[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York]]. Writing for the majority, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] stated that "Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title [ownership] to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign—first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States."

== Legal critique ==
As the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, "no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights."<ref>Dussias, Allison M., "Squaw Drudges, Farm Wives, and the Dann Sisters' Last Stand: American Indian Women’s Resistance to Domestication and the Denial of Their Property Rights", 77 N.C. L. REV. 637, 645 (1999)</ref>

Professor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of "universal recognition" of the "doctrine of discovery" historically inaccurate.

In reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher [[Francisco de Vitoria]]'s 1532 ''De Indis'' nor ''De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros''. Vitoria adopted from [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'', and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by [[Juan López de Palacios Rubios|Palacios Rubios]]. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.<ref>Pagden, Anthony. ''Vitoria: Political Writings'', Cambridge University Press, 1991</ref> However, the legal scholar Anthony Anghie has demonstrated that Vitoria--after applying to the Indians the concept of ius gentium--then found them to be in violation of international law through their resistance to Spanish exploration and missionary activities. By resisting Spanish incursions, Indians were, according to Vitoria, provoking war with the Spanish invaders, thus justifying Spanish conquest of Indian lands.<ref>Anthony Anghie, ''Imperialism, Sovereignty, and the Making of International Law'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Pres, 2005): Ch. 1 “Francisco de Vitoria and the Colonial Origins of International Law.”</ref>

Marshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s purchase of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Providence Plantation]]. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land.<ref name=Watson/>

Nor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in [[New Netherland]] after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania.<ref name=Watson/>

Watson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the "discovery doctrine" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.<ref name=Watson/>

Discovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://1map.com/de/undesadspdorg|title=Department of Economic and Social Affairs - Social Policy and Development Division; Home|website=1map.com}}</ref>  The [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII) noted the Doctrine of Discovery "as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights".<ref name="frichner"/> The eleventh session of the UNPFII, held at the UN's New York headquarters from 7-18 May 2012, had the special theme of "“The Doctrine of Discovery: its enduring impact on indigenous peoples and the right to redress for past conquests (articles 28 and 37 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples)," <ref name="unfpii-11th">[https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/unpfii-sessions-2/unpfii-eleventh-session.html UNPFII Eleventh Session], United Nations Economic and Social Council, New York.

At the 222nd General Assembly of the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] (2016), commissioners called on members of the church to confess the church's complicity and repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery. The commissioners directed that a report be written reviewing the history of the Doctrine of Discovery; that report was approved by the 223rd General Assembly (2018), along with recommendations for a variety of additional actions that could be taken by the church at all levels to acknowledge indigenous peoples and to confront racism against them.<ref>[https://facing-racism.pcusa.org/item/41901/ PC(USA) "Doctrine of Discovery Report"].

In 2016, the Churchwide Assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), adopted Assembly Action CA16.02.04 entitled '''Repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery''' by a vote of 912-28, describing the Doctrine of Discovery as "an example of the 'improper mixing of the power of the church and the power of the sword'"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/RepudiationDoctrineOfDiscoverySPR2016.pdf|title=RepudiationDoctrineofDiscoverySPR2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
