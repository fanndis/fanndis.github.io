Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic [[hurricane belt]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Bridgetown, Barbados|Bridgetown]].

Inhabited by [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]] people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other [[Amerindian]]s, Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]].

==Etymology==
The name "Barbados" is from either the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term {{lang|pt|os barbudos}} or the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent, {{lang|es|los barbudos}}, both meaning "the bearded ones". It is unclear whether "bearded" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded [[fig-tree]] (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]''), indigenous to the island, or to the allegedly bearded [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] who once inhabited the island, or, more fancifully, to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying reefs. In 1519, a map produced by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] mapmaker [[Visconte Maggiolo]] showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, the island of [[Barbuda]] in the [[Leeward Islands|Leewards]] is very similar in name and was once named "{{lang|es|Las Barbudas|italic=unset}}" by the Spanish.

The original name for Barbados in the [[Pre-Columbian era]] was {{lang|awd|Ichirouganaim}}, according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Barbados the Red Land with White Teeth: Home of the Amerindians|url=http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/|accessdate=14 May 2010|publisher=Barbados Museum & Historical Society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505161730/http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/|archivedate=5 May 2010|url-status=dead|quote=A temporary exhibit which examined some of the preliminary excavations conducted at the dig site at Heywoods, St. Peter.}}</ref> or "Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Barbados – Geography / History |url=http://www.coucouandflyingfish.com/where.php |accessdate=14 May 2010 |year=2008 |publisher=Fun 'N' Sun Publishing Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213141038/http://www.coucouandflyingfish.com/where.php |archive-date=13 December 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> or simply "Teeth".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/News/pdf/guyana_consul_visit.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160524005039/http%3A//www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/News/pdf/guyana_consul_visit.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 May 2016 |title= Guyana Consul (Barbados) Visit to Former Amerindian Village Site in B'dos |first=Norman |last=Faria |date=17 June 2009 |work=Guyana Chronicle |publisher=Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations |page=2 |accessdate=14 May 2010 |quote=Adjacent to the park, there is still a fresh water stream.

A hundred or so metres away is the sea and a further five hundred metres [{{cvt|500|m|yd |-1|disp=out}}] out across a lagoon was the outlying reef where the Atlantic swells broke on the coral in shallow waters. As an aside, the word "''Ichirouganaim''", said to be an Arawak word used by the Amerindians to describe Barbados, is thought to refer to the "teeth" imagery of the waves breaking on the reefs off most of southern and eastern coasts. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1=Peter |title=Prehistoric Barbados |publisher= Barbados Museum and Historical Society |year=1991 |isbn=1-873132-15-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1= Peter |title= Prehistoric Settlements in the Caribbean: Fieldwork on Barbados, Tortola and the Cayman Islands |date= 2000 |publisher= Archetype Publications Ltd. |isbn=1-873132-22-0}}</ref>

Colloquially, Barbadians refer to their home island as "Bim" or other nicknames associated with Barbados, including "Bimshire". The origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. The [[National Cultural Foundation]] of Barbados says that "Bim" was a word commonly used by [[slave]]s, and that it derives from the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] term {{lang|ig|bém}} from {{lang|ig|bé mụ́}} meaning 'my home, kindred, kind',<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25">{{Cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited |page= 25 |isbn=978-0-333-92068-8}}</ref> the Igbo phoneme {{IPA-ig|e|}} in the Igbo orthography is very close to {{IPAc-en|ɪ}}.<ref name=Allsopp2003>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage |first=Richard |last=Allsopp |author2=Allsopp, Jeannette |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcari0000unse/page/101 101] |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2003 |isbn=9766401454 |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofcari0000unse/page/101 }}</ref> The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved [[Igbo people]] from modern-day southeastern [[Nigeria]] arriving in Barbados in the 18th century.<ref name=EltisRichardson1997>{{cite book |title= Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity, and Mortality in the Transatlantic Slave Trade |first=David |last=Eltis |author2=Richardson, David |page=87 |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |accessdate=24 November 2008 |url={{GBurl|kuXEzQZQmawC|pg=PA87}} |isbn=978-0-7146-4820-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Black Experience and the Empire |first=Philip D. |last=Morgan |author2=Hawkins, Sean |isbn=0-19-926029-X |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2004 |page=82 |url={{GBurl|kG824iVy1BsC|pg=PA82}} }}</ref> The words 'Bim' and 'Bimshire' are recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Chambers Dictionary|Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries]]''. Another possible source for 'Bim' is reported to be in the ''Agricultural Reporter'' of 25 April 1868, where the Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, [[Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge]]) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were "Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire".<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25"/> Lastly, in the ''Daily Argosy'' (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652, there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of 'Byam', the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as 'Bims' and that this became a word for all Barbadians.<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25"/>

===Pre-colonial period===

Archeological evidence suggests humans may have first settled or visited the island circa 1600 BC.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Barbados |title=Encyclopedia Britannica- Barbados |accessdate= 9 July 2019}}</ref><ref>Peter Drewett, 1993.

===European arrival===
[[File:1632 Cardona Descripcion Indias (11).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Portuguese Empire]] claimed Barbados from 1532 until 1620.]]
It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados, which most likely would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century. One lesser-known source points to earlier revealed works predating contemporary sources indicating it could have been the Spanish.<ref name="Spanish Main"/> Many, if not most, believe the [[History of Portugal (1415-1542)|Portuguese]], en route to [[Brazil]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.barbados.org/history1.htm |title= AXSES Systems Caribbean Inc., The Barbados Tourism Encyclopaedia |publisher= Barbados.org |date= 8 February 2007 |accessdate= 4 July 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000116155652/http://barbados.org/history1.htm |archive-date= 16 January 2000 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52655/Barbados/54603/History |title=''Britannica Encyclopaedia'': History of Barbados |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913025338/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52655/Barbados/54603/History |archive-date=13 September 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> were the first Europeans to come upon the island.

===English settlement in the 1600s===

The first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now [[Holetown]] (formerly Jamestown),<ref>Beckles p. 7.</ref> by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, Henry, consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English indentured laborers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.funbarbados.com/Sights/holetown.cfm|title=Holetown Barbados – Fun Barbados Sights|website=funbarbados.com|access-date=2017-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191845/http://www.funbarbados.com/Sights/holetown.cfm|archive-date=12 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some sources state that some Africans were amongst these first settlers.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/>

The settlement was established as a [[proprietary colony]] and funded by Sir [[William Courten]], a [[City of London]] merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands. So the first colonists were actually tenants and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company.<ref>[http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=10931 William And John] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122343/http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=10931 |date=17 November 2017 }}, 11 January 201, Shipstamps.co.uk</ref> Courten's title was later transferred to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], in what was called the "Great Barbados Robbery."{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Carlisle then chose as governor [[Henry Hawley (governor)|Henry Hawley]], who established the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/><ref name="Slavery and Economy in Barbados">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_01.shtml |title=Slavery and Economy in Barbados |accessdate= 9 July 2019}}</ref>

In the period 1640–60, the West Indies attracted over two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} By 1650 there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and 23,000 in [[New England]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Most English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given "freedom dues" of about £10, usually in goods.

== Geography and climate ==
{{Main|Geography of Barbados}}
[[Image:Barbados-2020 englisch.png|thumb|Map of Barbados]]

Barbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other [[West Indies]] Islands. Barbados is the easternmost island in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the [[Windward Islands]]. The island rises gently to the central highland region known as Scotland District, with the high point of the nation being [[Mount Hillaby]] {{cvt|340|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/>

In the parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] lies Barbados's capital and main city, [[Bridgetown]], containing 1/3 of the country's population.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> Other major towns scattered across the island include [[Holetown]], in the parish of [[Saint James, Barbados|Saint James]]; [[Oistins]], in the parish of [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]]; and [[Speightstown]], in the parish of [[Saint Peter, Barbados|Saint Peter]].

=== Geology ===
Barbados lies on the boundary of the [[South American plate|South American]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Geologic History of Barbados Beaches |first=Gabi |last=Logan |url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/geologic-history-barbados-beaches-57660.html |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2 July 2011 |quote=Barbados lies directly over the intersection of the Caribbean plate and the South American plate in a region known as a subduction zone.

The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about {{cvt|25|mm|in|0}} per 1,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbadosbeachhouse.com/barbados_sightseeing_animal_flower_cave.php |title=Barbados Sightseeing – Animal Flower Cave |year=2010 |work=Leigh Designs |publisher=Little Bay House |accessdate=10 July 2011 |quote=The Animal flower Cave is the island's lone accessible sea-cave and was discovered from the sea in 1780 by two English explorers. The cave's coral floor is estimated to be 400,000 to 500,000 years old and the "younger" coral section above the floor is about 126,000 years old. The dating was carried out by the German Geographical Institute, and visitors can see a "map" of the dating work in the bar and restaurant. The cave now stands some six feet above the high tide mark even though it was formed at sea level. This is because Barbados is rising about one inch per 1,000 years, which is yet another indication of the cave's age. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212233710/http://www.barbadosbeachhouse.com/barbados_sightseeing_animal_flower_cave.php |archive-date=12 December 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> This subduction means [[Geology|geologically]] the island is composed of [[coral]] roughly {{cvt|90|m|ft}} thick, where reefs formed above the sediment. The land slopes in a series of "terraces" in the west and goes into an incline in the east. A large proportion of the island is circled by [[coral reefs]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/>

The erosion of limestone in the northeast of the island, in the Scotland District, has resulted in the formation of various caves and [[Gully|gullies]]. On the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] east coast of the island [[coastal landforms]], including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area. Also notable in the island is the rocky cape known as [[Pico Teneriffe (Barbados)|Pico Teneriffe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadospocketguide.com/barbados-attractions/beaches-and-bays/north-coast-beaches/pico-teneriffe.html|title=Pico Teneriffe – Barbados Pocket Guide|last=Gloria|website=barbadospocketguide.com|access-date=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127022828/http://www.barbadospocketguide.com/barbados-attractions/beaches-and-bays/north-coast-beaches/pico-teneriffe.html|archive-date=27 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> or Pico de Tenerife, which is named after the fact that the island of [[Tenerife]] in [[Spain]] is the first land east of Barbados according to the belief of the locals.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Bathsheba, Barbados 08.jpg|thumb|[[Bathsheba, Saint Joseph, Barbados|Bathsheba, Saint Joseph]]]]
[[File:Crane Beach.JPG|thumb|Crane Beach is situated on the south east coast]]
The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the "[[wet season]]", this period runs from June to December. By contrast, the "[[dry season]]" runs from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between {{cvt|40|and|90|in|mm|order=flip}}.
From December to May the average temperatures range from {{convert|21|to|31|C|F}}, while between June and November, they range from {{convert|23|to|31|C|F}}.<ref name="weather1">{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070220165443/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archivedate =20 February 2007 | title =Average and Record Conditions at Bridgetown, Barbados| accessdate =10 September 2009 | work =BBC Weather}}</ref>

On the [[Köppen climate classification]] scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am). However, breezes of {{cvt|12|to|16|km/h|0}} abound throughout the year and give Barbados a [[climate]] which is moderately tropical.

Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, [[landslip]]s, and [[hurricanes]]. Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricanes]] during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal [[hurricane strike zone]]. On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was [[Hurricane Janet]] in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by [[Hurricane Tomas]], but this caused only minor damage across the country as it was only at Tropical Storm level of formation.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11660080 "Hurricane Tomas lashes Caribbean islands"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105151112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11660080 |date=5 November 2015 }}.

It was introduced to the West Indies in the late 17th century when slave trade ships travelled to the Caribbean from West Africa.

=== Ethnic groups ===
Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as "Bajan") are of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent ("[[Afro-Barbadian|Afro-Bajans]]") and mixed descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans ("Anglo-Bajans" / "Euro-Bajans") mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland, and Asians, predominantly Chinese and Indians (both Hindu and Muslim).
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada.

=== Languages ===
English is the [[official language]] of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of [[British English]].

An [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole language]], referred to locally as ''[[Bajan Creole|Bajan]]'', is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life, especially in informal settings.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> In its full-fledged form, Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island. The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English, for the general English speaker, depends on the level of creolised vocabulary and idioms. A Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an English speaker from another country.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Barbados}}
Barbados follows a policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]] and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states. Barbados is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060228195122/http://www.barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb], The Barbados government's Regional and International affiliations</ref> [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ). In 2005 the Parliament of Barbados voted on a measure replacing the UK's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] with the Caribbean Court of Justice based in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad and Tobago.

==== World Trade Organization, European Commission, CARIFORUM ====
Barbados is an original member (1995) of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. [[European Union]] relations and cooperation with Barbados are carried out both on a bilateral and a regional basis. Barbados is party to the [[Cotonou Agreement]], through which {{as of|2007|December}} it is linked by an [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] with the [[European Commission]]. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States]] (ACP). CARIFORUM is the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the [[European Union]]. There are also ongoing EU-[[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC) and EU-[[CARIFORUM]] dialogues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/barbados/ |title=European Union – EEAS (European External Action Service) &#124; EU Relations with Barbados |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=19 June 2014 |accessdate=10 November 2018}}</ref>

Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports.

There was a strong economy between 1999 and 2000 but the economy went into recession in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] in the United Kingdom. The economy rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004 which continued right through to 2008. The economy went into recession again from 2008 to 2013 before showing growth from 2014 to 2017. Then it declined to another recession from 2017 to 2019 during the world economic crisis. There were 23 downgrades by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The economy showed signs of recovery with 3 upgrades from Standard and Poor's and Moody's in 2019. From 1 January to 31 March 2020 the economy had started to grow, but then it experienced another decline due to the [[COVID-19 recession|COVID-19 economic recession]].

Traditional trading partners include Canada, the [[Caribbean Community]] (especially [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), the United Kingdom and the United States.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Barbados}}
'''Barbados''' is a blend of West African, Portuguese, Creole, Indian and British cultures. Citizens are officially called Barbadians. The term "Bajan" (pronounced BAY-jun) may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian, which at times can sound more like "Bar-bajan"; or, more likely, from English ''[[bay]]'' ("bayling"), Portuguese {{lang|pt|[[wikt:baiano|baiano]]}}.

The largest [[carnival]]-like cultural event that takes place on the island is the [[Crop Over]] festival, which was established in 1974. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries, Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to there to participate in the annual events.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities, and features the majority of the island's homegrown [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[soca music]] for the year. The male and female Barbadians who harvested the most sugarcane are crowned as the King and Queen of the crop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2camels.com/crop-over-festival.php |title=Crop Over Festival |publisher=2camels.com |accessdate=30 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305104727/http://www.2camels.com/crop-over-festival.php |archivedate=5 March 2010}}</ref> Crop Over gets under way at the beginning of July and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August. New calypso/soca music is usually released and played more frequently from the beginning of May to coincide with the start of the festival.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

As in other Caribbean countries of British colonial heritage, [[cricket]] is very popular on the island. The [[West Indies cricket team]] usually includes several Barbadian players. In addition to several warm-up matches and six "Super Eight" matches, the country hosted the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Barbados has produced many great cricketers including [[Sir Garfield Sobers]], [[Sir Frank Worrell]], [[Sir Clyde Walcott]], [[Sir Everton Weekes]], [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Wes Hall]], [[Charlie Griffith]], [[Joel Garner]], [[Desmond Haynes]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]].

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is also popular in Barbados.

[[Horse racing]] takes place at the [[Garrison Savannah Racetrack|Historic Garrison Savannah]] close to Bridgetown. Spectators can pay for admission to the stands, or else can watch races from the public "rail", which encompasses the track.

[[Basketball]] is an increasingly popular sport, played at school or college. [[Barbados national basketball team|Barbados's national team]] has shown some unexpected results as in the past it beat many much larger countries.

[[Polo]] is very popular amongst the rich elite on the island and the "High-Goal" Apes Hill team is based at the St James's Club.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ape hills polo |url=http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/ |website=Ape hills Club |accessdate=2 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112201200/http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/ |archivedate=12 January 2015 }}</ref> It is also played at the private [[Holders Festival]] ground.

In golf, the [[Barbados Open]], played at Royal Westmoreland Golf Club, was an annual stop on the [[European Seniors Tour]] from 2000 to 2009. In December 2006 the [[WGC-World Cup]] took place at the country's [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort on the Country Club course, an 18-hole course designed by [[Tom Fazio]]. The Barbados Golf Club is another course on the island. It has hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.

[[Volleyball]] is also popular and is mainly played indoors.

[[Tennis]] is gaining popularity and Barbados is home to [[Darian King]], currently ranked 270th in the world and is the 2nd highest ranked player in the Caribbean.

[[Motorsports]] also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar. Also, the [[Bushy Park, Barbados|Bushy Park Circuit]] hosted the [[Race of Champions]] and [[Global RallyCross Championship]] in 2014.

The presence of the trade winds along with favourable swells make the southern tip of the island an ideal location for wave sailing (an extreme form of the sport of [[windsurfing]]).

[[Netball]] is also popular with women in Barbados.

{{Main|Transport in Barbados}}
[[File:Barbados Midibus1.jpg|thumb|A Hino ACME Minibus B 163 in Speightstown, St. Peter, Barbados]]

Although Barbados is about {{cvt|34|km|mi}} across at its widest point, a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip (south-east) to North Point in St. Lucy (north-central) can take one and a half hours or longer due to traffic. Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens. In Barbados, drivers drive on the left side of the road.

Barbados is known for its many roundabouts. One famous roundabout is a roundabout located east of Bridgetown, where you will see an emancipation statue of a slave named Bussa.

Transport on the island is relatively convenient with "[[share taxis|route taxis]]" called "ZRs" (pronounced "Zed-Rs") travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down regardless of the number. They will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital [[Bridgetown]] or from [[Speightstown, Barbados|Speightstown]] in the northern part of the island.

Including the ZRs, there are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays). There are ZRs, the yellow minibuses and the blue [[Barbados Transport Board|Transport Board buses]]. A ride on any of them costs {{Currency|3.50|BBD|linked=no}}.<ref>[https://www.transportboard.com/about-us/fare-policy/ Fare Policy]: Barbados Transport Board</ref> The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems ("ZRs" and "minibuses") can give change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated [[Barbados Transport Board]] system cannot, but do give receipts. The Barbados Transport Board buses travel in regular bus routes and scheduled timetables across Barbados. Schoolchildren in school uniform including some Secondary schools ride for free on the government buses and for {{Currency|2.50|BBD|linked=no}} on the ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Barbados Transport Board's headquarters are located at Kay's House, Roebuck Street, St. Michael, and the bus depots and terminals are located in the Fairchild Street Bus Terminal in Fairchild Street and the Princess Alice Bus Terminal (which was formerly the Lower Green Bus Terminal in Jubilee Gardens, Bridgetown, St. Michael) in Princess Alice Highway, Bridgetown, St. Michael; the Speightstown Bus Terminal in Speightstown, St. Peter; the Oistins Bus Depot in Oistins, Christ Church; and the Mangrove Bus Depot in Mangrove, St. Philip. In July 2020, the [[Barbados Transport Board]] received 33 [[BYD Auto|BYD]] electric buses which were obtained not only to add to the aging fleet of diesel buses but also to assist the Government in their goal of eliminating the use of fossil fuels by the year 2030.<ref>{{Cite web|title=EV buses are here|url=https://epaper.barbadostoday.bb/infinity/article_popover_share.aspx?guid=f33c044d-c56c-4b0f-8918-cb5624b8e054|access-date=2020-09-16|website=epaper.barbadostoday.bb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=National Energy Policy for Barbados 2019 - 2030|url=https://www.energy.gov.bb/web/national-energy-policy-for-barbados-2019-2030|access-date=2020-09-16|website=www.energy.gov.bb}}</ref>

Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.

The island's lone airport is the [[Grantley Adams International Airport]]. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. In the first decade of the 21st century it underwent a {{US$|100 million}} upgrade and expansion in February 2003 until completion in August 2005.

There was also a helicopter shuttle service, which offered air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic was regulated by the [[Barbados Port Authority]].
