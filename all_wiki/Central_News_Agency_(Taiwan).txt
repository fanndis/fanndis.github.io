The '''Central News Agency''' ('''CNA''') is the [[State media|state-owned]] [[news agency]] in the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).  CNA is one of China's two historical news agencies in each territorial jurisdiction, the other being [[Xinhua News Agency]] in the mainland.

In addition to its [[Standard Chinese|Chinese (Mandarin)]] edition, it also has [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] editions.  It has a 300-strong employee base, and has overseas branches in some 30 countries.  It works with a number of well-known news agencies around the world; such as the US-based [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]] of London, England, the German [[Deutsche Welle]], and France-based [[Agence France-Presse]].

==History==
[[File:Central News Agency (Republic of China) textlogo 1990s.gif|thumb|left|CNA logo from the 1990s]]
===Mainland China===
The agency was founded {{Start date and age|1924|04|01|df=y}}, by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT).  Its headquarters was originally located in [[Guangzhou]] of [[mainland China]], but had to be relocated to [[Taipei]] in [[1949 in China|1949]], following the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) [[Government of China|government]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], due to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP)'s victory, while the CCP established its new official news agency, [[Xinhua News Agency]].<ref name=FocusTaiwan>{{Cite web|url=https://FocusTaiwan.tw/aboutus|title=About Us - Focus Taiwan - CNA English news|website=FocusTaiwan.tw|publisher=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]]|access-date=31 October 2020}}</ref>

===Taiwan===
Despite the [[Corporatization|corporatisation]] of the agency in [[1973 in Taiwan|1973]], it continued to receive heavy government subsidies, and remained the nation's official state agency.  At the time, journalists from CNA received preferential treatment on various occasions, mostly government-related press conferences.  On 1 July [[1996 in Taiwan|1996]], the agency took the form of a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]] under a bill passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]].<ref name=FocusTaiwan/>  Today, the agency is still the official news agency of Taiwan, and receives part of its funding from the [[Executive Yuan]].  However, its [[media influence]] is said to have diminished a great deal due to a rise in competition after the government decided to lift restrictions on mass media.
