'''Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Ви́кторович Лавро́в}}, {{IPA-ru|sʲɪrˈgʲej ˈvʲiktərəvʲɪtɕ ɫɐvˈrof|pron}}; born 21 March 1950) is a Russian diplomat and politician. In office since 2004, he is the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Foreign Minister of Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lavrov Sergey Viktorovich|url=http://www.mid.ru/bdomp/nsite-sv.nsf/f52f8031a8e7330d4325696c00322313/ea87493fb1ef95f8c3256e050047d1b2/$FILE/S.V.%20Lavrov%20(ENG).doc|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> Previously, he was the [[Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations|Russian Representative to the UN]], serving in the role from 1994 to 2004.

==Early life and education==
Lavrov was born on 21 March 1950<ref name=dub2012jun>{{cite news|last=Dubien|first=Arnaud|title=The composition of Russia's new Cabinet and Presidential Administration, and its significance|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/es/AFET/studiesdownload.html?languageDocument=EN&file=74731|accessdate=28 March 2013|newspaper=Policy Department DG External Policies|date=June 2012}}</ref> in Moscow, to an [[Armenians in Tbilisi|Armenian]] father and a [[Russians in Georgia|Russian]] mother from [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]].<ref name=lyons>{{cite news|last1=Lyons|first1=Kate|title=Cher, Kim Kardashian and Andre Agassi: Armenia's A-list diaspora|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/cher-kardashian-agassi-armenias-a-list-diaspora-genocide|agency=Guardian|date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Waal|first1=Thomas de|title=The Caucasus: An introduction|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199750436|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZ1oAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA97}}</ref> His mother worked in the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Trade. Lavrov graduated from high school with a silver medal. Since his favorite class was physics, he planned to enter either the [[Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (National Research Nuclear University)|National Research Nuclear University]] or the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]], but he entered the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] (MGIMO) and graduated in 1972.<ref name=dub2012jun/>

During his education at the MGIMO, Lavrov studied [[international relations]]. Soon he learned [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]], then the only official language of [[Sri Lanka]], as well as [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], the official language of the [[Maldives]]. Moreover, Lavrov learned [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], but has stated that he is unable to speak the French language fluently. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} After he was admitted to the university, Lavrov, along with other students, was sent for a month to build the [[Ostankino Tower]].

During his summer vacations, Lavrov also worked in [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]] and the [[Russian Far East]]. Each semester, Lavrov with his fellow students conducted drama performances, which were later presented on the main stage of the university. During the third year of his studies, Lavrov married.<ref name=Lenta>{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14161073/full.htm|script-title=ru:Лавров, Сергей|publisher=Lenta|language=ru|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

===Soviet Union===

====Diplomatic career in Sri Lanka====
Lavrov graduated in 1972. According to the rules of that time, a graduate of the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] had to work for the Foreign Ministry for a certain amount of time. Lavrov was employed in the Soviet embassy in Sri Lanka as an advisor, as he was already a specialist on the country. At the time, the Soviet Union and Sri Lanka had close market and economic cooperation and the Soviet Union launched the production of [[natural rubber]] in the country. The Soviet embassy in Sri Lanka also maintained relations with the Maldives. The embassy in Sri Lanka employed only 24 diplomats. Lavrov was given the task of continuously analysing the situation in the country, but he also worked as a translator, personal secretary and assistant to [[Rafiq Nishonov]], who would later become the [[Communist Party of Uzbekistan|12th First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbek SSR]]. In addition, he gained the diplomatic rank of an [[attaché]].<ref name=Lenta/>

====Section of the International Economic Relations and the U.N.====
In 1976, Lavrov returned to Moscow. He worked as a third and second secretary in the Section for the International Economic Relations of the USSR. There, he was involved in analytics and his office also worked with various international organizations including the [[United Nations]]. In 1981, he was sent as a senior adviser to the Soviet mission at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. In 1988, Lavrov returned to Moscow and was named Deputy Chief of the Section of the International Economic Relations of the USSR. Between 1990 and 1992 he worked as Director of the International Organization of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.<ref name=Lenta/>

===Russian Federation===
In October 1990, [[Andrey Kozyrev]], who led the control of the international organizations at the time, was named Foreign Minister of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. In that year, the powers of the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic were distributed. Until then the Russian SFSR had only a ceremonial role. In October 1991, the foreign ministers of all Soviet republics, except [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Baltic states]], held a meeting where they dealt with the Union of Foreign Ministries. In November 1990, the State Council decided to change its name from the Union of Foreign Ministries to the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union and in December that year, the Foreign Ministry of Soviet Russia became the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. In 1992, Lavrov was named director of the Department for International Organizations and Global Issues in the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. In April 1991, he was named deputy foreign minister. Lavrov was asked to oversee the activities of the Human Rights and International Cultural Cooperation and the two departments – for the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, international organizations and international economic cooperation.<ref name=Lenta/> Lavrov worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 1994 when he returned to work in the [[United Nations]], this time as the Permanent Representative of Russia. While in the latter position, he was the President of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in December 1995, June 1997, July 1998, October 1999,<ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/scpres1990.htm "Presidents of the Security Council: 1990–1999"], UN.org.</ref> December 2000, April 2002, and June 2003.<ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/scpres2000.htm "Presidents of the Security Council : 2000–"], UN.org.</ref>

[[File:Msc2011 SZ 002 Lavrov Clinton.jpg|thumb|Lavrov with U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], Munich, Germany, on 5 February 2011]]
On 9 March 2004, President [[Vladimir Putin]] appointed Lavrov to the post of minister of foreign affairs.<ref name=dub2012jun/> He succeeded [[Igor Ivanov]] in the post. On 21 May 2012, Lavrov was reappointed foreign minister to [[Dmitry Medvedev's First Cabinet|the cabinet]] led by prime minister [[Dimitri Medvedev]].<ref name=dub2012jun/>

Lavrov is regarded as continuing in the style of his predecessor: a brilliant diplomat but a civil servant rather than a politician. A [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russian foreign policy]] expert at London's pro-Western [[Chatham House]] has described him as "a tough, reliable, extremely sophisticated negotiator" but adds that "he's not part of [[Putin's inner sanctum]]" and that the toughening of Russian foreign policy has got very little to do with him.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Patrick|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6242774.stm|title=Profile: Putin's foreign minister Lavrov|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=14 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828102305/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6242774.stm|archive-date=28 August 2007}}</ref> Other diplomats have been much more critical in their appraisal of Lavrov, seeing him as emblematic of President Putin's resurgent violent foreign policies. US [[Secretary of State of the United States|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] found that Lavrov treated her poorly during negotiations, like a "jerk."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Isikoff|first1=Michael|last2=Corn|first2=David|author-link1=Michael Isikoff|author-link2=David Corn|date=13 March 2018|title=Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tzc3DwAAQBAJ&q=jerk+lavrov&pg=PT33|location=New York City|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=9781538728758}}</ref> A high-ranking official in the foreign policy apparatus of former US President [[George W.

On 15 January 2020, he resigned as part of the cabinet, after [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] delivered the [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly]], in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dmitry-medvedev-resign-russia-prime-minister-putin-quit-latest-a9284741.html |title=Russian PM resigns in shock move as Putin announces dramatic constitutional shake-up |last=Carroll |first=Oliver |date=15 January 2020 |website=The Independent |language=en |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref> On 21 January 2020, he maintained his position in [[Mikhail Mishustin's Cabinet]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/01/21/foreign-defense-and-energy-ministers-keep-their-position-in-new-russian-cabinet-a68996 |title=Foreign, Defense and Energy Ministers Keep Their Position in New Russian Cabinet |date=21 January 2020 |website=The Moscow Times |language=en |access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref>

====Civil war in Syria====
In 2012, in the early stages of the [[Syrian Civil War]], a Russian delegation travelled to Syria to affirm Russia's backing of the Syrian government of President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Lavrov and [[Mikhail Fradkov]], who were part of the delegation, were given a royal welcome by thousands of pro-Assad supporters. The supporters waved Russian flags in thanks to Russia's veto of a UN resolution calling for tough sanctions on the Syrian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/lavrov-in-syria-to-strongly-back-assad/452593.html|title=Lavrov in Syria to Strongly Back Assad – News|accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref>

In October 2019, Lavrov condemned [[Donald Trump]]'s decision to send American troops to guard [[Petroleum industry in Syria|Syria's oil fields]] and possibly exploit them, saying that any "exploitation of natural resources of a sovereign state without its consent is illegal".<ref>{{cite news |title=Iran, Russia take aim at U.S. military presence near Syrian oilfields |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-ministers/iran-russia-take-aim-at-u-s-military-presence-near-syrian-oilfields-idUSKBN1X82OQ |work=Reuters |date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

When [[Group of Eight|G8]] leaders voted to officially suspend Russia's membership on 24 March, Lavrov stated that the G8 was an informal organization and membership was optional for Russia.<ref name="CNN.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/24/politics/obama-europe-trip/index.html |title=U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8 |work=[[CNN]] |first=Jim |last=Acosta |date=25 March 2014 |access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref>

In a 30 March interview,<ref name=lav2>{{cite news |url=http://rt.com/news/lavrov-crimea-ukraine-west-181/ |title=Lavrov: If West accepts coup-appointed Kiev govt, it must accept a Russian Crimea |work=[[RT News]] |date=30 March 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> he spoke of the [[Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine|21 February agreement]] which was signed by [[Viktor Yanukovich]], [[Vitaly Klitchko]], [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]], and [[Oleg Tyagnibok]] as well as the Foreign Ministers of Poland, France and Germany to promote peaceful changes in Ukrainian power. Lavrov stressed federalism as a solution to the constitutional impasse in Ukraine, and deplored the disofficialisation of the Russian language. He noticed the work of the secretariat of the [[Council of Europe]] at the [[Venice Commission]] to prevent a legitimation of the Crimean referendum, and to expel Russia. Lavrov was "taken aback" when U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] called Russia a "regional power". He deplored the misuse of the [[Schengen Agreement]] to force Crimeans to visit [[Kyiv]] in order to gain a Schengen visa, and noticed that the E.U. proposes a visa-free regime for Ukrainian citizens. Lavrov stated that the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Maidan revolution]] in Kyiv and the results of the Crimean referendum should both be accepted equally by the West. He reiterated the three-part Russian proposal for the progress of Ukraine:
# Constitutional federalism
# Recognition of linguistic minorities
# That Ukraine be a non-aligned state

The Kyiv government on 30 March denounced Lavrov's proposals as amounting to “the complete capitulation of Ukraine, its dismemberment, and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10735013/Ukraine-crisis-Russia-withdrawing-troops-from-border-Putin-tells-Merkel.html |title=Ukraine crisis: Russia 'withdrawing troops from border', Putin tells Merkel |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=31 March 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref>

While Lavrov acknowledged that Russia is in contact with the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|Ukrainian separatist rebels]] he denied US and EU allegations that Moscow sponsored the rebellion and accused the United States of aggravating the conflict. "Our American colleagues still prefer to push the Ukrainian leadership toward a confrontational path." He added that chances for settling the Ukrainian crisis would have been higher if it only depended on Russia and Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/28/lavrov-us-ukraine-crisis-russia |title=Sergei Lavrov accuses US of fuelling Ukraine crisis |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 June 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> Lavrov said the separatists want to "defend their culture, their traditions, celebrate their holidays rather than anniversaries of [[Roman Shukhevych]] and [[Stepan Bandera]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140821174740/http://www.mid.ru/bdomp/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/e39851e809b2af8344257cf2002ea50c!OpenDocument Answers to questions of the mass media by the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, summarising the results of his negotiations with the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, Paris, 5 June 2014]. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia</ref>

In June 2016, Lavrov stated that Russia will never attack any [[NATO]] country, saying: "I am convinced that all serious and honest politicians know perfectly well than Russia will never attack a member state of NATO. We have no such plans."<ref name="newsweek">"[http://www.newsweek.com/lavrov-putin-baltic-nato-attack-never-estonia-lithuania-latvia-summit-defence-467530 Russia Will Never Attack Any NATO Member: Lavrov]". ''Newsweek.'' 7 June 2016.</ref> He also said: "In our security doctrine it is clearly stated that one of the main threats to our safety is the further expansion of NATO to the east."<ref name="newsweek"/>

==== 2017 North Korea crisis ====
Lavrov likened the war of words between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] and North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] to a kindergarten fight between two children, saying "Together with China we'll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them."<ref>"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/donald-trump-north-korea-fight-children-kindergarten-nursery-sergei-lavrov-a7962686.html Russia says war of words between Donald Trump and North Korea is 'a fight between two children']". ''The Independent.'' 23 September 2017.</ref>

Lavrov also said that the United States would not carry out a strike on North Korea because "they know for sure – rather than suspect – that it has atomic bombs." He said the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US invaded Iraq]] "solely because they had 100 percent information that there were no weapons of mass destruction left there."<ref>"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/north-korea-s-a-bomb-is-deterring-u-s-first-strike-russia-says North Korea’s A-Bomb Is Deterring U.S. First Strike, Russia Says]". Bloomberg. 24 September 2017.</ref>

==== U.S. sanctions ====
Lavrov criticized [[U.S. sanctions]] against countries like [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and Russia. In August 2018, Lavrov said, "unilateral enforcement measures are illegitimate in international affairs" [...]. "One way to counter these illegitimate barriers and restrictions is we can use national currencies on our bilateral trade". "I strongly believe that abuse of the role the U.S. dollar plays as an international currency will eventually result in its role being undermined".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Charles|date=14 August 2018|title=Are Russia And China Trying To Kill The Dollar?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/charleswallace1/2018/08/14/are-russia-and-china-trying-to-kill-king-dollar/#5d1193979488|work=Forbes|access-date=10 July 2020}}</ref>
