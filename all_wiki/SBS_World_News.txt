'''''SBS World News''''' is the news service of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] in Australia. Its flagship nightly bulletin is broadcast at {{nowrap|6.30pm}} on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] with additional weeknight 'late' bulletins from {{nowrap|10.30pm}} on SBS.

==History==

''The World News'' began as a half-hour bulletin, first seen in 1980, soon after the launch of the then-named Channel 0/28. [[George Donikian]] was the service's first presenter; veteran newsreader [[Mary Kostakidis]] began reading the weekend news in 1986. The network's long-running investigative documentary series ''[[Dateline (Australian TV program)|Dateline]]'' started in 1984.

Closed captioning for the ''World News'' was introduced in March 1997.

In 2002, a digital-only [[SBS World News Channel|World News Channel]] was launched, aimed at providing a comprehensive foreign-language news channel, mainly showing additional bulletins already seen in SBS' morning WorldWatch timeslot. No English-language bulletins were shown on the channel until its demise in 2009.

''World News Australia'' was relaunched in its current one-hour format in January 2006, in January 2007 taking over the timeslot of ''[[Toyota World Sport]]'' and signing [[CNN]] correspondent [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]] to co-present alongside [[Mary Kostakidis]]. The merger between the two programs took place as a result of a claimed drop-off in viewers between programs, when a solid block of advertising would be shown. As a result, the relaunch saw the introduction of commercial breaks during the bulletin.<ref>[http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1214 Commercials and Promotions FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111211236/http://www20.sbs.com.au/sbscorporate/index.php?id=1214 |date=11 January 2009 }} Accessed 20 May 2007</ref>

The new bulletin format has since lost viewers, with the late bulletin often out-rating the flagship 6.30 bulletin;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} most of this has been attributed to the perceived commercialisation of the bulletin by the SBS Board.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

A dispute between longtime presenter [[Mary Kostakidis]] and the network arose in August 2007, when she walked out of the network in frustration at what she saw as increased commercialisation at the network, and a shift away from the original values of both the news service and the station in general.<ref name="kostakidis-australian">{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Meade |title=Kostakidis in bitter SBS sign-off |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22286293-601,00.html |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=22 August 2007 |access-date=2 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824010752/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22286293-601,00.html |archive-date=24 August 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was widely speculated that Kostakidis' contract stipulated she would be the network's main news presenter, and maintain editorial control over bulletins, somewhat altered by World News Australia's change in format. Kostakidis took legal action<ref name="kostakidis=abc">{{cite news |title=SBS management to meet with Kostakidis |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/22/2012366.htm |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 August 2007 |access-date=2 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206173740/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/22/2012366.htm |archive-date=6 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> against SBS for breach of contract.

In 2009, World News Channel was replaced with [[SBS Two]] which became [[SBS Viceland|Viceland]] in 2017.

In February 2014, ''World News Australia'' was relaunched with new graphics along with a name, ''SBS World News''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2017 SBS World News was upgraded with a new set and improved website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sbs-news-unveils-exciting-rebrand-with-new-website-and-app|website=SBS News|publisher=SBS News|access-date=6 February 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206132942/https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sbs-news-unveils-exciting-rebrand-with-new-website-and-app|archive-date=6 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The program can now be streamed on the [http://www.sbsnews.com.au SBS News website] as well as the SBS News app.
