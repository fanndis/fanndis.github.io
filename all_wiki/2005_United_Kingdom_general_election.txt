{{UK general election navigation|1997|2001|2005|2010|2015}}
The '''2005 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday 5 May 2005, to elect [[List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election|646 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|led by]] [[Tony Blair]], won its third consecutive victory, with Blair becoming the only Labour leader beside [[Harold Wilson]] to form three majority governments. However, its [[Majority government|majority]] fell to 66 seats compared to the 167-seat majority it had won [[2001 United Kingdom general election|four years before]]. This was the first time the Labour Party had won a third consecutive election. As of 2020, it remains the last general election victory for the Labour Party and was also the last general election until [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] that a single political party would manage to achieve a large overall majority over all other parties.

The Labour campaign emphasised a strong economy; however, Blair had suffered a decline in popularity, which was exacerbated by the decision to send British troops to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]] in 2003. Despite this, Labour mostly retained its leads over the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in opinion polls on economic competence and leadership, and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leaders]] [[Iain Duncan Smith]] (2001–2003) and [[Michael Howard]] (2003–2005) struggled to capitalise on Blair's unpopularity, with the party consistently trailing behind Labour in the polls throughout the 2001–2005 parliament. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The Conservatives campaigned on policies such as immigration limits, improving poorly managed hospitals, and reducing high crime rates. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats|led by]] [[Charles Kennedy]], were opposed to the Iraq War, given that there had been no second [[United Nations|UN]] resolution,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://leftfootforward.org/2014/06/blair-is-not-the-only-one-with-iraq-amnesia/ |title=Blair is not the only one with Iraq amnesia – the Lib Dems were NOT anti-invasion, just anti-that-kind-of-invasion |publisher=Left Foot Forward |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |location=UK}}</ref> and collected votes from disenchanted Labour voters. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

[[Tony Blair]] was returned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], with Labour having 355 MPs, but with a popular vote share of 35.2%, the smallest of any majority government in UK electoral history. In terms of votes, it was only narrowly ahead of the Conservatives, but still had a comfortable lead in terms of seats. The Conservatives returned 198 MPs, with 32 more seats than they had won at the previous general election, and won the popular vote in [[England]], while still ending up with 91 fewer MPs in England than Labour. The Liberal Democrats saw their popular vote increase by 3.7% and won the most seats of any third party since [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], with 62 MPs. Anti-war activist and former Labour MP [[George Galloway]] was elected as the MP for [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] under the [[Respect Party|Respect – The Unity Coalition]] banner; [[Richard Taylor (British politician)|Richard Taylor]] was re-elected for [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern|Kidderminster Health Concern]] in [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]; and [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]] [[Peter Law]] was elected in [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]].

In [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], the more moderate of the main [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] parties, which had dominated Northern Irish politics since the 1920s, was reduced from six MPs to one, with party leader [[David Trimble]] himself being unseated. The more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] became the largest Northern Irish party, with nine MPs elected. Notable MPs leaving the House of Commons at this election included [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] leader [[David Trimble]], former [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] leader [[John Hume]], former Cabinet ministers [[Estelle Morris]], [[Paul Boateng]], [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], [[Gillian Shephard]], [[Virginia Bottomley]] and [[Michael Portillo]], the Father of the House of Commons [[Tam Dalyell]], [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] and [[Teddy Taylor|Sir Teddy Taylor]].

Following the election, Michael Howard resigned as Conservative leader and was [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election|succeeded]] by future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. Blair resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party in June 2007, and was replaced by then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]]. The election results were broadcast live on the BBC and presented by [[Peter Snow]], [[David Dimbleby]], [[Anthony King (political scientist)|Tony King]], [[Jeremy Paxman]], and [[Andrew Marr]].

==Overview==
{{For|events leading up to the date of the election|Pre-election day events of the 2005 United Kingdom general election}}
The governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Tony Blair]], was looking to secure a third consecutive term in office and to retain a large majority. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was seeking to regain seats lost to both Labour and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] since the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], and move from being the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition]] into government. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both main parties, but especially the Conservative Party, with a "decapitation" strategy targeting members of the [[Shadow Cabinet of Michael Howard|Shadow Cabinet]]. The Lib Dems had also wished to become the governing party, or to make enough gains to become the Official Opposition, but more realistically hoped to play a major part in a parliament led by a minority Labour or Conservative government. In Northern Ireland the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] sought to make further gains from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] in [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] politics, and [[Sinn Féin]] hoped to overtake the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] in [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] politics. (Note that Sinn Féin MPs do not take their seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]—they follow a policy of [[Abstentionism#Sinn Féin|abstentionsim]].) The pro-[[independence]] [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] (Party of Wales) stood candidates in every constituency in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] respectively.

Many seats were contested by other parties, including several parties without incumbents in the House of Commons. Parties that were not represented at Westminster, but had seats in the [[Devolution|devolved assemblies]] and/or the [[European Parliament]], included the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]], the [[UK Independence Party]], the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], the [[Scottish Green Party]], and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]]. The [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern|Health Concern]] party also stood again. A full list of parties which declared their intention to run can be found on the [[List of parties contesting the 2005 United Kingdom general election|list of parties contesting the 2005 general election]].

All parties campaigned using such tools as party [[manifesto]]s, [[party political broadcast]]s and touring the country in what are commonly referred to as [[Campaign bus|battle bus]]es.

[[2005 United Kingdom local elections|Local elections]] in parts of [[England]] and in [[Northern Ireland]] were held on the same day. The polls were open for fifteen hours, from 07:00 to 22:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC+1]]). The election came just over three weeks after the [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution of Parliament]] on 11 April by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], at the request of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Tony Blair]].

==Campaign==
Following the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] on 2 April, it was announced that the calling of the election would be delayed until 5 April.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1487012/Blair-delays-election-call.html |title=Blair delays election call |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 April 2005|location=London}}</ref>

Thanks to eight years of sustained economic growth Labour could point to a strong economy, with greater investment in public services such as education and health. This was overshadowed, however, by the issue of the controversial [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which met widespread public criticism at the time, and would dog Blair throughout the campaign. The Chancellor, [[Gordon Brown]], played a prominent role in the election campaign, frequently appearing with Blair and ensuring that the economy would remain the central focus of Labour's message.

Recently elected Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] brought a great level of experience and stability to a party that had ousted its former leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3225127.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tory leader ousted | date=29 October 2003}}</ref> just 18 months prior. The Conservatives focused their campaign on more traditional conservative issues like immigration, which created some controversy with the slogan "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-election-poster-sparks-complaints-of-racism-from-students-and-teachers-531552.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Tory election poster sparks complaints of racism from students and teachers | date=7 February 2005}}</ref> They also criticised Labour's "dirty" hospitals and high crime levels, under the umbrella of the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?"<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://www.conservatives.com/pdf/manifesto-uk-2005.pdf</ref>

However, Labour counter-attacked, by emphasising Howard's role in the unpopular [[Second Major ministry|Major Government of 1992–1997]], airing a [[party election broadcast]] attacking Howard, showing a montage of scenes from Howard's tenure as [[Home Secretary]], including prison riots and home repossessions. It also launched a billboard campaign showing Howard, and the Conservative Party's four previous leaders (Iain Duncan Smith, [[William Hague]], [[John Major]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]), with the caption "Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Toynbee|first=Polly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/05/eu.elections2003|title=Polly Toynbee: Humiliation could make Blair a Labour leader|date=2004-05-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

For the Liberal Democrats, this was the second and final election campaign fought by leader [[Charles Kennedy]], who strongly opposed the Iraq War and personally offered a more down-to-earth approach to voters, which proved popular. There were some questions, however, over Kennedy's abilities when, at the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch, he was asked about local income tax, but appeared confused on the figures.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4582930.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kennedy admits battling alcohol | date=5 January 2006}}</ref> Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives were keen to tackle Labour's introduction of [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], which both opposition parties opposed and promised to abolish.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/6994476.stm | work=BBC News | title=2005: Historic third term for Labour | date=20 September 2007}}</ref>

==Ballot==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

At the close of voting (2200 [[British Summer Time|BST]]) the ballot boxes were sealed and returned to the counting centres, where counting proceeded under the supervision of the [[returning officer]] who was obliged to declare the result as soon as it was known. As previously, there was serious competition amongst constituencies to be first to declare. [[Sunderland South (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland South]] repeated its performance in the last three elections and declared Labour incumbent [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]] re-elected as MP with a majority of 11,059 at approximately 2245 BST (failing by two minutes to beat its previous best, but making it eligible for entry into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as longest consecutive delivery of first results). The vote itself represented a swing (in a safe Labour seat, in a safe Labour region) of about 4% to the Conservatives and 4.5% to the Liberal Democrats, somewhat below the prediction of BBC/ITV exit polls published shortly after 2200 BST.

[[Sunderland North (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland North]] was the next to declare, followed by [[Houghton and Washington East (UK Parliament constituency)|Houghton and Washington East]], both of whose Labour MPs retained their seats but with reductions in the incumbent majorities of up to 9%. The first Scottish seat to declare was [[Rutherglen and Hamilton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen and Hamilton West]]&nbsp;— another safe Labour seat, also a Labour hold, but with the majority reduced by 4%. The first seat to change hands was [[Putney (UK Parliament constituency)|Putney]], where Labour's majority of 2,771 fell to a strong Conservative challenge, with a total swing of about 5,000 (6.2%). This was also the first seat to be declared for the Conservatives. The first Liberal Democrat seat to be declared was [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]], the constituency of Lib Dem deputy leader Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] which he had held since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]].

The constituency of [[Crawley (UK Parliament constituency)|Crawley]] in [[West Sussex]] had the slimmest majority of any seat, with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Laura Moffatt]] holding off the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' [[Henry Smith (British politician)|Henry Smith]] by 37 votes after three recounts.

==Polling==
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2005 United Kingdom general election}}
{{UK general election opinion polling|1997|2001|2005|2010|2015|la5=yes}}
Following problems with [[exit poll]]s in previous British elections, the BBC and ITV agreed for the first time to pool their respective data, using results from Mori and NOP. More than 20,000 people were interviewed for the poll at 120 polling stations across the country. The predictions were very accurate—initial projections saw Labour returned to power with a majority of 66 (down from 160),<ref name="media.guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1478206,00.html |title=Broadcasters hail success of joint poll|publisher=MediaGuardian |date= 6 May 2005|accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett}}</ref> and the final result (including [[South Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Staffordshire]], where the election was postponed due to the death of a candidate) was indeed a Labour majority of 66.

The projected shares of the vote in Great Britain were Labour 35% (down 6% on 2001), Conservatives 33% (up 1%), Liberal Democrats 22% (up 4%) and other parties 8% (up 1%).<ref name="media.guardian.co.uk"/> The Conservatives were expected to make the biggest gains, however&nbsp;— 44 seats according to the exit poll&nbsp;— with the Liberal Democrats expected to take as few as two. Whilst the Lib Dems' vote share predicted by the exit poll was accurate (22.6% compared to the actual 22.0%), they did better in some Lib Dem-Labour marginals than predicted on the basis of the national share of the vote, and achieved a net gain of 11 seats.

==2001 national result==
There were major boundary changes in Scotland, where the number of seats were reduced from 72 to 59. As a result of this each party lost some seats, and this [[Notional election results|notional election result]] below is based on the 2001 election results if they had been fought on these new 2005 boundaries.

[[File:Uk general election 2005 by age.png|thumb|right|250px|Votes cast by age group: Con, Lab, LD, other parties (green) and those not voting (grey).]]

At 04:28 BST, it was announced that Labour had won [[Corby (UK Parliament constituency)|Corby]], giving them 324 seats in the House of Commons out of those then declared and an overall majority, Labour's total reaching 355 seats out of the 646 House of Commons seats. Labour received 35.3% of the [[Direct election|popular vote]], equating to approximately 22% of the electorate on a 61.3% turnout, up from 59.4% turnout in 2001. Increased turnout was mostly attributed to the extension and promotion of the [[postal voting]] system, which has been criticised as being too insecure increasing the risk of [[electoral fraud]].

As expected, voter disenchantment led to an increase of support for many opposition parties, and caused many eligible to vote, not to turn out. Labour achieved a third successive term in office for the first time in their history, though with reduction of the Labour majority from 167 to 67 (as it was before the declaration of [[South Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Staffordshire]]). As it became clear that Labour had won an overall majority, [[Michael Howard]], the leader of the Conservative Party, announced his intention to retire from frontline politics. The final seat to declare was the delayed poll in South Staffordshire, at just after 1&nbsp;a.m. on Friday 24 June.

The election was followed by further criticism of the UK electoral system. Calls for reform came particularly from Lib Dem supporters, citing that they received only just over 10% of the overall seats with 22.1% of the popular vote. The only parties to win a substantially higher percentage of seats than they achieved in votes were Labour, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, and [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern|Health Concern]], which ran only one candidate. The results of the election give a [[Gallagher Index|Gallagher index of dis-proportionality]] of 16.76.

[[File:Results of the UK General Election, 2005.svg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Ring charts of the election results showing popular vote against seats won, coloured in party colours|Seats won in the election (outer ring) against number of votes (inner ring).]]

The Labour Government claimed that being returned to office for a third term for the first time ever showed the public approval of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s governance and the continued unpopularity of the Conservatives. Nevertheless, Labour's vote declined to 35.3%, the lowest share of the popular vote to have formed a majority government in the history of the UK House of Commons. In many areas the collapse in the Labour vote resulted in a host of seats changing hands. Labour also failed to gain any new seats, almost unique in any election since 1945. As well as losing seats to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, Labour also lost [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]], their safest seat in Wales,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/wales/4514385.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour loses safest seat in Wales | date=6 May 2005}}</ref> to Independent [[Peter Law]], and [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] to Respect candidate [[George Galloway]].

The Conservatives claimed that their increased number of seats showed disenchantment with the Labour government and was a precursor of a Conservative breakthrough at the next election. Following three consecutive elections of declining representation and then in 2001 a net gain of just one seat, 2005 was the first general election since their famous [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] [[landslide victory]] where the number of Conservative seats increased appreciably, although the Conservatives' vote share increased only slightly and this election did mark the third successive general election in which the Conservatives polled below 35%. In some areas the Conservative vote actually fell. The Conservatives claimed to have won the general election in England, since they received more votes than Labour although Labour still won a majority of seats.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-big-question-what-is-the-west-lothian-question-and-can-it-be-resolved-satisfactorily-406571.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Andy | last=McSmith | title=The Big Question: What is the West Lothian question, and can it be resolved satisfactorily? | date=4 July 2006}}</ref>

The Liberal Democrats claimed that their continued gradual increase in seats and percentage vote showed they were in a position to make further gains from both parties. They pointed in particular to the fact that they were now in second place in roughly one hundred and ninety constituencies and that having had net losses to Labour in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] and having not taken a single seat off Labour in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], they had held their gains off Labour from the 2001 general election and had actually made further gains from them. The Liberals also managed to take three seats from the Conservatives, one notable victory being that of [[Tim Farron]] over [[Tim Collins (politician)|Tim Collins]] in [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]], through the use of a "decapitation strategy", which targeted senior Tories.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Brendan | last1=Carlin | first2=David | last2=Sapsted | title=Defiant Kennedy takes 'decapitation' strategy into Tory heartland | date=4 May 2005}}</ref>

The Liberal Democrats increased their percentage of the vote by 3.7%, the Conservatives by 0.6%, and Labour's dropped by 5.4%.

The [[Media of the United Kingdom|UK media]] interpreted the results as an indicator of a breakdown in trust in the government, and especially in Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].

Meanwhile, the [[Scottish National Party]] improved its position in Scotland, regaining the [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]] and [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] from Labour, having lost both seats in 1987.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4519491.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP secures Western Isles victory | date=6 May 2005}}</ref> In Wales Plaid Cymru failed to gain any seats and lost [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]] to the Liberal Democrats. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists were all but wiped out, only keeping [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], with leader David Trimble losing his seat in [[Upper Bann (UK Parliament constituency)|Upper Bann]]. For the first time the DUP became the biggest party in Northern Ireland.

It was the first general election since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] in which no party received more than ten million votes. It was the most "three-cornered" election since [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], though the Liberal Democrats failed to match the higher national votes of the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]] in the 1980s either in absolute or percentage terms. The total combined vote for Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats proved to be the lowest main three-party vote since [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]].

[[File:2005 UK General Election Gallagher Index.png|right|thumb|The disproportionality of the House of Commons in the 2005 election was 16.89 according to the [[Gallagher Index]], mainly between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.]]

==Post-election events==
===Formation of government===
Following the election result, Labour remained in power and [[Tony Blair]] remained [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Cabinet shuffle|reshuffling]] Cabinet and junior ministers over the following weekend, with formal announcements made on 9 May 2005. The most senior positions of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Home Secretary]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] remained the same ([[Gordon Brown]], [[Charles Clarke]] and [[Jack Straw]] respectively), but a few new faces were added. Most notably, [[David Blunkett]] returned to cabinet as the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Work and Pensions Secretary]], although he was forced to resign again due to another scandal before the end of the year that spawned a national press and opposition campaign for his dismissal. [[Patricia Hewitt]] became the new [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]], [[Tessa Jowell]] remained as [[Culture Secretary]], whilst [[Alan Johnson]] was promoted to [[Trade and Industry Secretary]]. Meanwhile, [[Ruth Kelly]] retained the [[Secretary of State for Education|Education]] job and [[Margaret Beckett]] stayed put at [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment]].

The new Parliament met on 11 May for the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].

===New party leaders===
On 6 May, [[Michael Howard]] announced he would be standing down as leader of the Conservative Party, but not before a review of the leadership rules. The formal [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] began in October, and was ultimately won by [[David Cameron]]. On 7 May, [[David Trimble]] resigned as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; Sir [[Reg Empey]] was [[2005 Ulster Unionist Party leadership election|elected as his successor]] at an Ulster Unionist Council meeting on 24 June.

===End of the term===
Blair's successor as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]] visited [[Buckingham Palace]] on 6 April 2010 and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April. The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|next election]] was held on 6 May 2010.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8603591.stm Gordon Brown calls 6 May general election] – BBC News, 6 April 2010</ref>
