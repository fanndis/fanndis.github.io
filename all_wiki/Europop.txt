'''Europop''' (also spelled '''Euro pop''') is a style of [[pop music]] that originated in Europe during the mid to late 1960s<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /> and developed to today's form throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Many successful Europop artists came from Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania{{which|date=April 2020}}<!-- not one of the 36 in [[List of Europop artists]] is listed-->, Sweden,<!-- 7 of the 31 in [[List of Europop artists]] are from Sweden-->  and the United Kingdom.

==History==
During the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in [[Continental Europe|continental countries]], with the exception of [[ABBA]] (1972–1983). The Swedish four-piece band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored nineteen top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[Roxette]] and [[Ace of Base]] led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences.  In the 1990s, pop groups like the [[Spice Girls]], [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], [[Steps (pop group)|Steps]], [[Backstreet Boys]] and singer [[DJ BoBo]] were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group [[Eiffel 65]] were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]].

One of the main differences between [[American pop|American]] and European pop is that Europop is generally more [[Dance music|dance]] and [[Trance music|trance]] oriented. In central Europe, [[Italo disco]] (also known as 1980s [[Euro disco]]) and [[Euro house]] were the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.
