"'''I Care'''" is a song recorded by the American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). It was written by [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Chad Hugo]] and Beyoncé and produced by Bhasker and co-produced by Beyoncé with Hugo playing rhythm guitar.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/Beyonc%C3%A9-4/release/4058453 | title=Beyoncé - 4}}</ref> The song was recorded at the [[MSR Studios]] and was mixed by [[DJ Swivel|Jordan Young]] aka DJ Swivel at KMA Studio in [[New York City]]. "I Care" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[Ballad (music)|power ballad]], which also contains elements of [[soul music]] and [[rock music]]. Built on a [[Clapping|hand-clapped]] rhythm and pulsating [[Beat (music)|beats]], the song's instrumentation consists of screeching [[guitar]]s, low-profile [[synthesizers]], pounding [[drum]]s, heavy [[percussion instrument]] and a [[piano]]. In "I Care", Beyoncé admits her vulnerability to her indifferent love interest with both honesty and power. She sings with heartfelt emotion over cooing background vocals and scats alongside a multi-[[octave]] [[guitar solo]] towards the end of the song. "I Care" was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in Italy on March 23, 2012 as the seventh overall single from ''4''.

"I Care" was acclaimed by contemporary music critics who highlighted the heartfelt emotion, sadness and resentment with which Beyoncé sings. Critics also complimented the way she made effective use out the power in her lower register in the first and second [[Song structure (popular music)|verses]] until her voice slowly builds until the commanding [[Refrain|chorus]] is reached. They generally praised the guitar solo and the vocal power of Beyoncé which was displayed by "I Care" among other songs on ''4''. Following the release of ''4'' in early July 2011, "I Care" charted number 35 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]], based on downloads alone. The song was part of Beyoncé's [[set list]] for her [[revue]]s [[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]] (2011) and [[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]] (2012) as well as [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] (2013). It was also used as an interlude in her [[The Formation World Tour]] (2016).

==Production==
[[File:Chadhugo (300dpi).jpg|thumb|left|165px|Chad Hugo (''pictured'') played Rhythm Guitar<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/Beyonc%C3%A9-4/release/4058453 | title=Beyoncé - 4}}</ref> and co-wrote the song with Jeff Bhasker and Beyoncé.]]
[[DJ Swivel|Jordan Young]] aka DJ Swivel mixed "I Care" at New York's KMA Studio. He told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', "I didn’t really know I was going to mix 'I Care' until the last minute. Luckily, during the course of the album, I had a couple of days to myself and I mixed it just because I felt like it, so the demo was already somewhat mixed, and B[eyoncé] let me do the final mix also."<ref name="sound">{{cite web| url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct11/articles/dj-swivel.htm |title=DJ Swivel: Recording Beyoncé's 4 |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}</ref>

"I Care" comprised 75 tracks in total: 35 for the music and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing "I Care" was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect."<ref name="sound"/> As the layering of the [[drum]]s had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on "I Care" came to Swivel at around four o'clock in the morning during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6&nbsp;kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very [19]80s‑sounding gated reverb."<ref name="sound"/>

{{quote box|width=15%|quote=I am a producer as well, so part of what I think when I am mixing is: 'What is the sound the producer was trying to achieve?’ Sometimes a plug‑in won’t get that sound, so I’ll often take creative freedoms by doing some drum replacement, and if a producer doesn’t like it, it’s as simple as a mute — it’s no big deal. It’s never to change the sound; it’s just a utilitarian thing, to help execute a sound.|source=—[[DJ Swivel]], ''[[Sound on Sound]]''<ref name="sound"/>}}
Once he had the sound, he rolled off the bottom to "take the muddiness out".<ref name="sound"/> It was actually double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, and the rest of the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was "a little unorthodox" and therefore, he tried to refine it.<ref name="sound"/> Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play."<ref name="sound"/> Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that "[the listener] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers."<ref name="sound"/> Swivel further said that it started with "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" kick, and he then added a little thump to it.<ref name="sound"/>

Swivel dedicated much time in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal at the end of a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency."<ref name="sound"/> For the delay throws in the verses on "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], Beyoncé matches the [[guitar solo]] vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in.<ref name="sound"/> He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field."<ref name="sound"/> Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, "I like smooth sound, and with B[eyoncé] that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle."<ref name="sound"/>

==Critical reception==
"I Care" was highly acclaimed by critics.  Joanne Dorken of [[MTV UK]] wrote that "I Care" proves why Beyoncé "is still the best in the business", further adding that her vocals are flawless as she belts out notes "we didn't even realise were possible."<ref name="MTVUK"/> Similarly, David Amidon of [[PopMatters]] who stated that "[[1+1 (song)|1+1]] provides Beyoncé a song that "can compete with the favorites of this generation's parents", later wrote that "1+1" and "I Care" are "equally competent, if safer, attempts at the same formula".<ref name="popmatters"/> He added that the songs explain why she is "head and shoulders above her Clear Channel competition in R&B".<ref name="popmatters"/> However, he concluded that the two songs are misplaced on the tracklising of the album as "I Care" is "a jilted lover track" directly after "a pure love song" as "1+1".<ref name="popmatters"/> The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}} Thomas Conner commented that "I Care" is a "sad but superb" song.<ref name="Conner">{{cite web|last=Conner |first=Thomas |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2011/06/cd_review_beyonce_4.html |title=CD review: Beyonce, '4' – Music: Via Chicago |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225185417/http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2011/06/cd_review_beyonce_4.html |archivedate=February 25, 2012 }}</ref> Holly Gleason of ''Paste'' magazine noted that "I Care" creates "a backdrop for Knowles' shaft of vocal power", hinting that she played [[Etta James]] in the [[Musical film|musical]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008).<ref name="paste"/>

<blockquote>
Sitting on top of a piano with her band and orchestra watching on, Beyonce wrung every ounce of emotion from the lyrics of '1+1' and hit each note perfectly. It was an impressive display, but her rendition of 'I Care' was even better. [Beyoncé] whipped her hair to the brooding brass and ominous beat, while bringing the song to life with an immaculate vocal. Out of nowhere, this often-overlooked track now seems single-worthy.<ref name="idolator1">{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5975932/beyonce-roseland-ballroom-review|title=Beyonce's Intimate Night At Roseland Ballroom|first=Mike|last=Wass|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].
