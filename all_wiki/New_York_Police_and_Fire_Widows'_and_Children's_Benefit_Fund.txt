When Rusty was a boy, his uncle Marvin Morton was also killed in the line of duty as a New Orleans police officer, leaving behind a wife and young children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-close-little-known-charity-thrust-into-limelight.html|title=New Orleanian Rusty Staub became important figure in response to 9/11|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=NOLA.com|access-date=2016-10-11|via=}}</ref> Speaking about the loss, Staub remembered "How difficult it was for my uncle's family, I remember saying the rosary on the bed with my mom.

In its initial years, the organization hosted an annual gala, where widows and donors came together to support one another and raise funds for the cause. In addition, families would enjoy for a picnic at Shea Stadium, where children would throw out the first pitch and beneficiaries connected with the approximately six to eight new families who had lost a loved one that year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/16/nyregion/3-officers-deaths-turn-charity-event-somber.html|title=3 Officers' Deaths Turn Charity Event Somber|last=Wolff|first=Craig|date=1989-11-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-12}}</ref> Prior to September 11, 2001, the fund had raised $13 million in its then-16 year history,<ref name=":0" /> supporting approximately 500 families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/98a/pr153-98.html|title=Press Release Archives #153-98 - Police & Fire Widows & Children's Benefit Fund Reception|website=www.nyc.gov|access-date=2016-10-12}}</ref>

At the time, families received a $10,000 death benefit from the charity.<ref name=":0" /> Three hundred and fifty families first-responder families now represented an immediate need for $4 million, but in the weeks that followed, this need was met and exceeded.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/21/sports/baseball-staub-leading-drive-for-fund.html|title=BASEBALL; Staub Leading Drive for Fund|date=2001-09-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-12}}</ref> In the months following the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, the fund was able to give over $117 million to its beneficiaries.<ref name=":0" />
