'''Valentine's Day''', also called '''Saint Valentine's Day'''  or the '''Feast of Saint Valentine''',<ref>''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'', Revised ed., Allied Publishers, 2005 {{ISBN|9780550142108}}</ref> is celebrated annually on February 14. It originated as a Western Christian [[feast day]] honoring one or two early [[Christian martyrs]] named [[Saint Valentine]] and is recognized as a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance and [[love]] in many regions of the world.

There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Valentines connected to February 14,<ref>Ansgar, 1986, ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint valentine'', pp. 46–58</ref> including an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuted under the Roman Empire]] in the third century.<ref name="Cooper2013">{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=J.C.|title=Dictionary of Christianity|date=October 23, 2013|publisher=Routledge|language=en |isbn=9781134265466|page=278}}</ref><ref name=ChryssidesWilkins2014/> According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer.<ref name="Ball1993">{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=A Litany of Saints|date=January 1, 1992|publisher=[[Our Sunday Visitor|OSV]]|language=en|isbn=9780879734602}}</ref> Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed "Your Valentine" as a farewell before his execution;<ref name="Guiley2001">{{cite book|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|year=2001|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|language=en |isbn=9781438130262|page=341}}</ref> another addition posits that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry.<ref name="ChryssidesWilkins2014">{{cite book |last1=Chryssides |first1=George D. |last2=Wilkins |first2=Margaret Z. |title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century |date=2014 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-317-54557-6 |language=en |quote=The association between Valentine and lovers derives from a legend associated with Valentine of Rome.

Valentine, a physician priest, offered help to Christians whose lives were in peril and, although celibate himself, performed secret marriage rites for young men and women, defying the emperor's decree. He was discovered and imprisoned.}}</ref>

The Feast of Saint Valentine was established by [[Pope Gelasius I]] in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of Saint Valentine of Rome, who died on that date in AD 269.<ref name="Butler1981">{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Alban |title=Butler's Lives of the saints |date=1981 |publisher=Burns & Oates |isbn=9780860121121 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="ChanchreekJain2007">{{cite book |last1=Chanchreek |first1=K.

Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged [[Cupid]].

[[File:St-valentine 110921-01.jpg|thumb|Shrine of St. Valentine in [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]] in Dublin, Ireland]]

Numerous early Christian martyrs were named [[Saint Valentine|Valentine]].<ref>Henry Ansgar Kelly, in ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' (Leiden: Brill) 1986, accounts for these and further local Saints Valentine (Ch. 6 "The Genoese Saint Valentine and the observances of May") in arguing that Chaucer had an established tradition in mind, and (pp. 79 ff.) linking the Valentine in question to Valentine, first bishop of Genoa, the only Saint Valentine honoured with a feast in springtime, the season indicated by Chaucer. Valentine of Genoa was treated by [[Jacobus de Voragine|Jacobus of Verazze]] in his ''Chronicle of Genoa'' (Kelly p. 85).</ref> The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (''Valentinus presb. m. Romae'') and Valentine of Terni (''Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae'').<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', ''s.v.'' "Valentine": "The [[Acta Sanctorum|Acts]] of both are unreliable, and the Bollandists assert that these two Valentines were in fact one and the same."</ref> Valentine of [[Rome]] was a priest in Rome who was martyred in 269 and was added to the calendar of saints by [[Pope Gelasius I]] in 496 and was buried on the [[Via Flaminia]]. The relics of Saint Valentine were kept in the [[Catacombs of San Valentino|Church and Catacombs of San Valentino]] in Rome, which "remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of St. Valentine were transferred to the church of [[Santa Prassede]] during the pontificate of [[Pope Nicholas IV|Nicholas IV]]".<ref name="Matilda Webb 2001">Matilda Webb, The Churches and Catacombs of Early Christian Rome, 2001, Sussex Academic Press.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html |publisher=novareinna.com |title=Saint Valentine's Day: Legend of the Saint |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205081733/http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html |archive-date=February 5, 2016  }}</ref> The flower-crowned skull of Saint Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome.

Valentine of Terni became bishop of [[Interamna Nahars|Interamna]] (now [[Terni]], in central Italy) and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 273. He is buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location from Valentine of Rome. His relics are at the Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni (''Basilica di San Valentino''). Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas notes that "abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of Europe."<ref>Alison Chapman. Patrons and Patron Saints in Early Modern English Literature. Routledge. pg. 122.</ref> The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' also speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early [[martyrology|martyrologies]] under date of February 14.

February 14 is celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in various [[Christian denomination]]s; it has, for example, the rank of 'commemoration' in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]] in the [[Anglican Communion]].<ref name="Anglican"/> In addition, the [[feast day]] of Saint Valentine is also given in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|calendar of saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church]].<ref name="Pfatteicher2008"/> However, in [[Mysterii Paschalis|the 1969 revision]] of the [[Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints]], the feast day of Saint Valentine on February 14 was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] and relegated to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: "Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14."<ref>''Calendarium Romanum ex Decreto Sacrosancti Œcumenici Concilii Vaticani II Instauratum Auctoritate Pauli PP. VI Promulgatum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, MCMLXIX), p. 117.</ref>

The feast day is still celebrated in [[Balzan]] ([[Malta]]) where relics of the saint are claimed to be found, and also throughout the world by [[Traditionalist Catholics]] who follow the older, pre-[[Second Vatican Council]] calendar (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]).

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], St. Valentine is recognized on [[July 6 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 6]], in which [[Saint Valentine]], the Roman presbyter, is honoured; in addition, the Eastern Orthodox Church observes the feast of Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna, on [[July 30 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 30]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/st-valentines-day-legend-and-reality/|title=St. Valentine|work=pravmir.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116185820/http://www.pravmir.com/st-valentines-day-legend-and-reality/|archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarina.org/valentine.html Coptic Orthodox Church – From Where Valentine's Day Comes From] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525101359/http://www.stmarina.org/valentine.html |date=May 25, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.happy-valentines-day-2014.com/2014/01/valentines-day-history-myths.html |title= Happy Valentine's Day History And Myths Behind It |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151017022328/http://www.happy-valentines-day-2014.com/2014/01/valentines-day-history-myths.html |archive-date= October 17, 2015 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Legends ===
[[File:St-valentine-baptizing-st-lucilla-jacopo-bassano.jpg|thumb|left|''St Valentine baptizing St Lucilla'', [[Jacopo Bassano]].]]

J.C. Cooper, in ''The Dictionary of Christianity'', writes that Saint Valentine was "a priest of Rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted Christians."<ref name="JC Cooper 2013">J.C. Cooper, ''Dictionary of Christianity'', 2013, Routledge.</ref> Contemporary records of Saint Valentine were most probably destroyed during this [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in the early 4th century.<ref name="oruch"/> In the 5th or 6th century, a work called ''Passio Marii et Marthae'' published a story of martyrdom for Saint Valentine of Rome, perhaps by borrowing tortures that happened to other saints, as was usual in the literature of that period. The same events are also found in ''[[Bede|Bede's Martyrology]]'', which was compiled in the 8th century.<ref name="oruch"/><ref name="ansgar49">Ansgar, 1986, pp. 49–50</ref> It states that Saint Valentine was persecuted as a Christian and interrogated by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius II]] in person. Claudius was impressed by Valentine and had a discussion with him, attempting to get him to convert to Roman [[paganism]] in order to save his life. Valentine refused and tried to convert Claudius to Christianity instead. Because of this, he was executed. Before his execution, he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing Julia, the blind daughter of his jailer Asterius. The jailer's daughter and his forty-six member [[household]] (family members and servants) came to believe in [[Jesus]] and were [[baptized]].<ref name="Brewer1894">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA384|title=A Dictionary of Miracles: Imitative, Realistic, and Dogmatic|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott & Co.]]|year=1894|page=384|language=en|quote=St. Valentine, laying his hand upon her eyes, said in prayer, "O Thou who art the true Light, give light to this Thy servant." Instantly sight was restored to the blind child. Asterius and his wife, falling at the feet of Valentine, prayed that they might be admitted into the Christian fellowship; whereupon St. Valentine commanded them to break their idols, to fast for three days, to forgive their enemies, and to be baptized. Asterius and his wife did all the saint told them to do, and Valentine baptized them and all their household, to the number of forty-six in all. —''Les Petits Bollandistes'', vol. ii. pp. 510, 511.}}</ref><ref name="oruch"/>

A later ''Passio'' repeated the legend, adding that [[Pope Julius I]] built a church over his sepulchre (it is a confusion with a 4th-century tribune called Valentino who donated land to build a church at a time when Julius was a Pope).<ref name="ansgar49"/> The legend was picked up as fact by later martyrologies, starting by [[Bede]]'s martyrology in the 8th century.<ref name="ansgar49"/> It was repeated in the 13th century, in ''[[Golden Legend|The Golden Legend]]''.<ref>[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden169.htm ''Legenda Aurea'', "Saint Valentine"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904010018/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden169.htm |date=September 4, 2013 }}, catholic-forum.com.</ref>

There is an additional embellishment to ''The Golden Legend'', which according to Henry Ansgar Kelly, was added in the 18th century and widely repeated.<ref name="your valentine">Ansgar, 1986, p. 59. It originated in the 1797 edition of ''Kemmish's Annual'', according to Frank Staff, ''The Valentine and Its Origins'' (London, 1969), p. 122. Ansgar was unable to corroborate this.</ref> On the evening before Valentine was to be [[executed]], he is supposed to have written the first "valentine" card himself, addressed to the daughter of his jailer Asterius, who was no longer blind, signing as "Your Valentine."<ref name="your valentine"/> The expression "From your Valentine" was later adopted by modern Valentine letters.<ref name="Ruth Lee 1952">Ruth Webb Lee, ''A History of Valentines'', 1952, Studio Publications in association with Crowell.</ref> This legend has been published by both [[American Greetings]] and [[The History Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/st-valentine-beheaded|title=St. Valentine beheaded – Feb 14, 278|date=February 14, 2012|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|accessdate=April 9, 2015|quote=When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Valentine was arrested and dragged before the Prefect of Rome, who condemned him to be beaten to death with clubs and to have his head cut off. The sentence was carried out on February 14, on or about the year 270. Legend also has it that while in jail, St. Valentine left a farewell note for the jailer's daughter, who had become his friend, and signed it "From Your Valentine."|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316200003/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/st-valentine-beheaded|archive-date=March 16, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Valentineanddisciples.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Valentine|Saint Valentine of Terni]] and his disciples]]
[[John Foxe]], an English historian, as well as the [[Order of Carmelites]], state that Saint Valentine was buried in the [[Santa Prassede|Church of Praxedes]] in Rome, located near the cemetery of [[Saint Hippolytus]]. This order says that according to legend, "Julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave. Today, the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship."<ref>John Foxe.

Another embellishment suggests that Saint Valentine performed clandestine [[Christian views on marriage|Christian weddings]] for soldiers who were forbidden to marry.<ref name="David Harkness 1961">David James Harkness, Legends and Lore: Southerns Indians Flowers Holidays, vol. XL, No. 2, April 1961, University of Tennessee Newsletter (bimonthly), p. 15.</ref> The Roman Emperor Claudius II supposedly forbade this in order to grow his army, believing that married men did not make for good soldiers.<ref name="David Harkness 1961"/><ref name="Max Christensen 1997">Max L. Christensen, ''Heroes and Saints: More Stories of People Who Made a Difference'', 1997, Westminster John Knox Press.

According to legend, in order "to remind these men of their vows and God's love, Saint Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment", giving them to these soldiers and [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuted Christians]], a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on St. Valentine's Day.<ref name="Frank Staff 1969">Frank Staff, ''The Valentine & Its Origins'', 1969, Frederick A.

Saint Valentine supposedly wore a purple [[amethyst]] ring, customarily worn on the hands of Christian [[bishop]]s with an image of [[Cupid]] engraved in it, a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the Roman Empire;<ref name="Max Christensen 1997"/><ref name="AMNH 1958">''The Illustrated Library of the Natural Sciences'', Volume 1, 1958, Simon and Schuster. p. 85 "The amethyst is the birthstone for February, and Saint Valentine is supposed to have worn an amethyst engraved with a figure of Cupid"</ref> Roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them.<ref name="Max Christensen 1997"/> Probably due to the association with Saint Valentine, amethyst has become the [[birthstone]] of February, which is thought to attract love.<ref name="Hesse2007">{{cite book|author=Rayner W.

==Folk traditions==
While the European folk traditions connected with Saint Valentine and St. Valentine's Day have become marginalized by the modern Anglo-American customs connecting the day with [[romantic love]], there are some remaining associations connecting the saint with the advent of [[Spring (season)|spring]].<!--citation not needed here; the rest of the section gives examples of this statement-->

While the custom of sending cards, flowers, chocolates and other gifts originated in the UK, Valentine's Day still remains connected with various regional customs in England. In [[Norfolk]], a character called 'Jack' Valentine knocks on the rear door of houses leaving sweets and presents for children. Although he was leaving treats, many children were scared of this mystical person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/customdetail.php?id=45|title=British Folk Customs, Jack Valentine, Norfolk|work=information-britain.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113208/http://www.information-britain.co.uk/customdetail.php?id=45|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitnorwich.co.uk/valentines-romantic-norfolk.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628122719/http://www.visitnorwich.co.uk/valentines-romantic-norfolk.aspx |archive-date=June 28, 2009  }}</ref>

A proverb says that "Saint Valentine brings the keys of roots". Plants and flowers start to grow on this day. It has been celebrated as the day when the first work in the vineyards and in the fields commences. It is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day. Another proverb says ''"Valentin – prvi spomladin"'' ("Valentine – the first spring saint"), as in some places (especially [[White Carniola]]), Saint Valentine marks the beginning of spring.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dnevnik.si/novice/prosti_cas/1042422995 |title=Vreme kot nalašč za izlete |language=sl |trans-title=Weather As on Purpose for Trips |date=February 9, 2011 |newspaper=Dnevnik.si |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092540/http://dnevnik.si/novice/prosti_cas/1042422995 |archive-date=March 4, 2016  }}</ref> Valentine's Day has only recently been celebrated as the day of love. The day of love was traditionally March 12, the [[Saint Gregory]]'s day, or February 22, [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent's Day]]. The patron of love was [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], whose day has been celebrated on June 13.<ref name="GG2008-02-15" />

In [[Ancient Rome]], Lupercalia was observed February 13–15. It was a rite connected to purification and health, and had only slight connection to fertility (as a part of health) and none to love. Lupercalia was a festival local to the city of Rome. The more general Festival of [[Juno Februa]], meaning "Juno the purifier" or "the chaste Juno", was celebrated on February 13–14. Pope [[Gelasius I]] (492–496) abolished Lupercalia. Some researchers have theorized that Gelasius I replaced Lupercalia with the celebration of the [[Candlemas|Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] and claim a connection to the 14th century's connotations of romantic love, but there is no historical indication that he ever intended such a thing.<ref name="BDForbes2015">{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Bruce David|title=America's Favorite Holidays: Candid Histories|date=October 27, 2015|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|language=en|isbn=9780520284722|page=54|quote=There is no indication in suppressing the Lupercalia, Gelasius put anything else in its place.

Recent scholarship has refuted Baronius's assertion...there is no evidence that Gelasius advocated a celebration of Valentine's Day as a replacement for the Lupercalia. ...

The replacement of Lupercalia with Saint Valentine's celebration was suggested by researchers Kellog and Cox.

But, in the West and even in Eastern places such as Antioch and Alexandria, Nativity was celebrated on December 25, and this Purification was not celebrated. When this feast was introduced to Rome, it was directly placed in February 2. Around that time, Jerusalem adopted the Nativity date of December 25 and moved the Purification to February 2.</ref> Although it was called "Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary", it also dealt with the presentation of Jesus at the temple.<ref name="auto">Ansgar, 1976, pp. 60–61.</ref> Jerusalem's Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary on February 14 became the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] on February 2 as it was introduced to Rome and other places in the sixth century, after Gelasius I's time.<ref name="auto"/><!--Candlemas is treated elsewhere; here it is a confusing extraneity: Some historians argue that [[Candlemas]] (then held on February 14, later moved to February 2) was promoted as its replacement, but this feast was already being celebrated in [[Jerusalem]] by AD 381.--><!--the date was established in the martyrologies:"The pope also declared in 500 that the feast of [[St. Valentine]] would be on February 15."-->

[[Alban Butler]] in his ''Lifes of the Principal Saints'' (1756–1759) claimed without proof that men and women in Lupercalia drew names from a jar to make couples, and that modern Valentine's letters originated from this custom. In reality, this practice originated in the Middle Ages, with no link to Lupercalia, with men drawing the names of girls at random to couple with them. This custom was combated by priests, for example by [[Frances de Sales]] around 1600, apparently by replacing it with a religious custom of girls drawing the names of apostles from the [[altar]]. However, this religious custom is recorded as soon as the 13th century in the life of Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], so it could have a different origin.<ref name="ansgar">Ansgar, 1986, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_bqdZbKPztMC&pg=PA60&dq=saint+valentine's+lupercalia+year&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uXI4T8CgLITX0QWB4OiSAg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=saint%20valentine's%20lupercalia%20year&f=false 58–63]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001215758/https://books.google.com/books?id=_bqdZbKPztMC&pg=PA60&dq=saint%20valentine%27s%20lupercalia%20year&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uXI4T8CgLITX0QWB4OiSAg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK |date=October 1, 2016 }}</ref>

{{anchor|Chaucer's love}}

=== Chaucer's ''Parliament of Fowls''===
The first recorded association of Valentine's Day with romantic love is believed to be in the ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'' (1382) by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], a [[dream vision]] portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates.<ref name="oruch">Oruch, Jack B., "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2847741 St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February]", ''Speculum'', '''56''' (1981): 534–65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be "the original mythmaker in this instance."

In modern English:
<blockquote>"For this was on Saint Valentine's Day<br />When every bird comes there to choose his match<br />(Of every kind that men may think of!),<br />And that so huge a noise they began to make<br />That earth and air and tree and every lake<br />Was so full, that not easily was there space<br />For me to stand—so full was all the place."</blockquote>

Readers have uncritically assumed that Chaucer was referring to February 14 as Valentine's Day. Henry Ansgar Kelly has observed that Chaucer might have had in mind the feast day of St. Valentine of Genoa, an early [[bishop of Genoa]] who died around AD 307; it was probably celebrated on 3 May.<ref name="ansgar2001"/><ref>Kelly, Henry Ansgar, ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine'' (Brill Academic Publishers, 1997), {{ISBN|90-04-07849-5}}.

Jack B. Oruch notes that [[March equinox|the date on which spring begins]] has changed since Chaucer's time because of the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]] and the introduction of the more accurate [[Gregorian calendar]] only in 1582. On the [[Julian calendar]] in use in Chaucer's time, February 14 would have fallen on the date now called February 23, a time when some birds have started mating and nesting in England.<ref name="oruch"/>

Chaucer's ''Parliament of Fowls'' refers to a supposedly established tradition, but there is no record of such a tradition before Chaucer. The speculative derivation of sentimental customs from the distant past began with 18th-century [[Antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[Alban Butler]], the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. Most notably, "the idea that Valentine's Day customs perpetuated those of the Roman [[Lupercalia]] has been accepted uncritically and repeated, in various forms, up to the present".<ref name="ansgar"/><ref name="oruch 539">Oruch 1981:539.</ref>

Three other authors who made poems about [[birds mating]] on St. Valentine's Day around the same years: [[Otton de Grandson]] from Savoy, [[John Gower]] from [[England]], and a knight called Pardo from Valencia. Chaucer most probably predated all of them; but due to the difficulty of dating medieval works, it is not possible to ascertain which of the four may have influenced the others.<ref>Ansgar, 1986, Chapter 5, Grandson, Pardo and Gower, pp. 64–76</ref>

=== Court of love ===
The earliest description of February 14 as an annual celebration of love appears in the ''Charter of the Court of Love''. The charter, allegedly issued by [[Charles VI of France]] at [[Mantes-la-Jolie]] in 1400, describes lavish festivities to be attended by several members of the royal court, including a feast, amorous song and poetry competitions, [[jousting]] and dancing.<ref name="ansgar court"/> Amid these festivities, the attending ladies would hear and rule on disputes from lovers.<ref name="goodrich">Goodrich, Peter (1996) ''Law in the Courts of Love''</ref> No other record of the court exists, and none of those named in the charter were present at Mantes except Charles's queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], who may well have imagined it all while waiting out a plague.<ref name="ansgar court">Ansgar, 1986, Chapter 8, The Hibermantino of the Mating Season, pp. 131–138</ref>

===Valentine poetry===
The earliest surviving valentine is a 15th-century [[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]] written by [[Charles, Duke of Orléans]] to his wife, which commences.
{{quote|"Je suis desja d'amour tanné<br />
Ma tres doulce Valentinée..."|Charles d'Orléans|Rondeau VI, lines 1–2<ref>''[[:wikisource:Translation:A Farewell to Love]]'' in [[wikisource]]</ref>}} At the time, the duke was being held in the [[Tower of London]] following his capture at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], 1415.<ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/valentines-day History Channel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022134903/http://www.history.com/topics/valentines-day |date=October 22, 2016 }}, historychannel.com.</ref>

The earliest surviving valentines in English appear to be those in the ''[[Paston Letters]]'', written in 1477 by Margery Brewes to her future husband John Paston "my right well-beloved Valentine".<ref>Davis, Norman. ''The Paston Letters: A Selection in Modern Spelling''. Oxford University Press, 1983. pp. 233–5.</ref>

Valentine's Day is mentioned ruefully by Ophelia in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1600–1601):
{{quote|"To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,<br />All in the morning betime,<br />And I a maid at your window,<br />To be your Valentine.<br />Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,<br />And dupp'd the chamber-door;<br />Let in the maid, that out a maid<br />Never departed more."|William Shakespeare|''Hamlet'', Act IV, Scene 5}}

[[John Donne]] used the legend of the marriage of the birds as the starting point for his [[epithalamion]] celebrating the marriage of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[James I of England]], and [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], on Valentine's Day:

{{quote|"Hayle Bishop Valentine whose day this is<br />
All the Ayre is thy Diocese<br />
And all the chirping Queristers<br />
And other birds ar thy parishioners<br />
Thou marryest every yeare<br />
The Lyrick Lark, and the graue whispering Doue,<br />
The Sparrow that neglects his life for loue,<br />
The houshold bird with the redd stomacher<br />
Thou makst the Blackbird speede as soone,<br />
As doth the Goldfinch, or the Halcyon<br />
The Husband Cock lookes out and soone is spedd<br />
And meets his wife, which brings her feather-bed.<br />
This day more cheerfully than ever shine<br />
This day which might inflame thy selfe old Valentine."|John Donne|''Epithalamion Vpon Frederick Count Palatine and the Lady Elizabeth marryed on St. Valentines day''}}

The verse "[[Roses are red]]" echoes conventions traceable as far back as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590):

<blockquote>"She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,<br>
And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew."<ref>Spenser, ''The Faery Queene'' iii, Canto 6, Stanza 6: [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/fq/fq32.htm on-line text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061514/http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/fq/fq32.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>

The modern cliché Valentine's Day poem can be found in the collection of English nursery rhymes ''[[Gammer Gurton's Garland]]'' (1784):

<blockquote>"The rose is red, the violet's blue,<br />
The honey's sweet, and so are you.<br />
Thou art my love and I am thine;<br />
I drew thee to my Valentine:<br />
The lot was cast and then I drew,<br />
And Fortune said it shou'd be you."<ref>''Gammer Gurton's Garland'' (London, 1784) in I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd ed., 1997), p. 375.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XtAqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14&dq=%22I+drew+thee+to+my+Valentine%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ieUzT8CnAYOGhQeQ-NH0AQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22I%20drew%20thee%20to%20my%20Valentine%22&f=false ''Gammer Gurton's Garland''] , original 1810 version.

Valentine's Day customs – sending greeting cards (known as “valentines”), offering confectionary and presenting flowers – developed in early modern England and spread throughout the [[English-speaking world]] in the 19th century. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries, these customs spread to other countries, like those of [[Halloween|Hallowe'en]], or than aspects of [[Christmas]], (such as [[Santa Claus]]).

Valentine's Day is celebrated in many [[East Asia]]n countries with [[Singapore]]ans, [[China|Chinese]] and [[South Korea]]ns spending the most money on Valentine's gifts.<ref name="showbizandstyle.inquirer.net">Domingo, Ronnel.

In [[Brazil]], the ''[[Dia dos Namorados]]'' (lit.

In Chinese, Valentine's Day is called lovers' festival ({{zh|s=情人节|t=情人節}}; [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]: ''Qīng Rén Jié''; [[Hokkien]]: ''Chêng Lîn Chiat''; [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]: ''Chìhng Yàhn Jit''; [[Shanghainese language|Shanghainese]] ''Xin Yin Jiq''). The "Chinese Valentine's Day" is the [[Qixi Festival]], celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. It commemorates a day on which a legendary cowherder and weaving maid are allowed to be together. In [[Chinese culture]], there is an older observance related to lovers, called "[[Qixi Festival|The Night of Sevens]]" ({{zh|c=七夕|p=Qi Xi}}). According to the legend, the [[Altair|Cowherd star]] and the [[Vega|Weaver Maid star]] are normally separated by the [[Milky Way]] (silvery river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the 7th day of the 7th month of the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Schomp| first=Virginia| title=The ancient Chinese| date=2009| publisher=Marshall Cavendish Benchmark| location=New York| isbn=978-0-7614-4216-5| page=70}}</ref>

Valentine's Day celebrations did not catch on in India until around 1992.

In Iran, the [[Sepandarmazgan]], or Esfandegan, is a festival where people express love towards their mothers and wives, and it is also a celebration of earth in ancient Persian culture.
It has been progressively forgotten in favor of the Western celebration of Valentine's Day. The Association of Iran's Cultural and Natural Phenomena has been trying since 2006 to make Sepandarmazgan a national holiday on February 17, in order to replace the Western holiday.<ref>{{cite news |title=Esfandegan to Replace Valentine |newspaper=Iran Daily |page=6 |date=December 31, 2008 |url=http://www.nitc.co.ir/iran-daily/1387/3307/pdf/i6.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511131810/http://www.nitc.co.ir/iran-daily/1387/3307/pdf/i6.pdf |archive-date=May 11, 2011 }}, nitc.co.ir</ref>

====Israel====
In [[Israel]], the Jewish tradition of [[Tu B'Av]] has been revived and transformed into the Jewish equivalent of Valentine's Day. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the month of [[Av]] (usually in late August). In ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them ([[Mishna]] Taanith end of Chapter 4). Today, Tu B'Av is celebrated as a second holiday of love by secular people (along with Valentine's Day), and it shares many of the customs associated with Saint Valentine's Day in western societies. In modern Israeli culture Tu B'Av is a popular day to proclaim love, propose marriage, and give gifts like cards or flowers.<ref>{{cite news |title= Evolution of Tu Be'av into Jewish Valentine's Day |date= February 8, 2012 |work= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |author= Binyamin Kagedan |url= http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=279840 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130310234015/http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=279840 |archive-date= March 10, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], [[Morozoff Ltd.]] introduced the holiday for the first time in 1936, when it ran an advertisement aimed at foreigners. Later, in 1953, it began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates; other Japanese confectionery companies followed suit thereafter. In 1958, the [[Isetan]] [[Department stores in Japan|department store]] ran a "Valentine sale". Further campaigns during the 1960s popularized the custom.<ref name=japantimes>{{cite news |last=Gordenker |first=Alice |title=White Day |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/03/21/news/white-day/ |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106054215/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/03/21/news/white-day/ |archive-date=January 6, 2014  }}</ref><ref name="rupp">{{Cite book |title= Gift-giving in Japan: cash, connections, cosmologies |author= Katherine Rupp |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Stanford University Press]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-8047-4704-0|pages=149–151 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KHkyUp-EH2MC&q=japan+valentine%27s+day&pg=PA145 }}</ref>

The custom that only women give chocolates to men may have originated from the translation error of a chocolate-company executive during the initial campaigns.<ref name="jasgp">{{Cite journal |title=Valentine's Day in Japan |author=Chris Yeager |date=February 13, 2009 |publisher=[[Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia]] (JASGP) |url= http://jasgp.org/content/view/636/179/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083844/http://jasgp.org/content/view/636/179/ |archive-date=July 25, 2011 }}</ref> In particular, [[Office lady|office ladies]] give chocolate to their co-workers. Unlike western countries, gifts such as greeting cards,<ref name="jasgp"/> candies, [[flower]]s, or [[dating|dinner dates]]<ref name="yoshimura"/> are uncommon, and most of the gifts-related activity is about giving the right amount of chocolate to each person.<ref name="jasgp"/> Japanese chocolate companies make half their annual sales during this time of the year.<ref name="jasgp"/>

Many women feel obliged to give chocolates to all male co-workers, except when the day falls on a Sunday, a holiday. This is known as ''[[Giri choco|giri-choko]]'' (義理チョコ), from ''[[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]'' ("obligation") and ''choko'', ("chocolate"), with unpopular co-workers receiving only "ultra-obligatory" ''chō-giri choko'' cheap chocolate. This contrasts with ''[[Honmei choco|honmei-choko]]'' (本命チョコ, lit. "true feeling chocolate"), chocolate given to a loved one. Friends, especially girls, may exchange chocolate referred to as ''tomo-choko'' (友チョコ); from ''tomo'' meaning "friend".<ref>{{cite book | title = Office Ladies and Salaried Men: Power, Gender, and Work in Japanese Companies | author = Yuko Ogasawara | edition = illustrated | editor = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-520-21044-1 | pages = 98–113, 142–154, 156, 163 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9_yjfAZo4jIC&q=japan+chocolate+saint+valentin&pg=PA98 | publisher = [[University of California Press]]| location = Berkeley }}</ref>

In the 1980s, the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association launched a successful campaign to make March 14 a "reply day", where men are expected to return the favour to those who gave them chocolates on Valentine's Day, calling it [[White Day]] for the color of the chocolates being offered. A previous failed attempt to popularize this celebration had been done by a [[marshmallow]] manufacturer who wanted men to return marshmallows to women.<ref name="japantimes"/><ref name="rupp"/>

In Japan, the romantic "date night" associated to Valentine's Day is celebrated on [[Christmas Eve]].<ref>{{cite web |date= February 14, 2007 |author= Ron Huza (he was an [[English as a foreign or second language|ESL]] in Japan for 11 years) |title= Lost in translation: The cultural divide over Valentine's Day |work= [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |url= http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=2ae6a44a-2f29-45a3-a257-2a13b3d3149d |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084251/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=2ae6a44a-2f29-45a3-a257-2a13b3d3149d |archive-date= March 4, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

==== Lebanon ====
[[File:Valentine's day cupcakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Valentine's Day themed bouquet of [[cupcake]]s]]
[[Saint Valentine]] is the [[patron saint]] for a large part of the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] population. Couples take the opportunity of Valentine's feast day to exchange sweet words and gifts as proof of love. Such gifts typically include boxes of chocolates, cupcakes, and red roses, which are considered the emblem of sacrifice and passion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Lebanon|Lebanese]] people celebrate Valentine's Day in a different way in every city. In [[Beirut]], men take women out to dine and may buy them a gift. Many women are asked to marry on that day. In [[Sidon]], Valentine's Day is celebrated with the whole family – it is more about family love than a couple's love.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Malaysia ====
Islamic officials in [[West Malaysia]] warned Muslims against celebrating Valentine's Day, linking it with vice activities. Deputy Prime Minister [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] said the celebration of romantic love was "not suitable" for Muslims. Wan Mohamad Sheikh Abdul Aziz, head of the Malaysian Islamic Development Department ([[JAKIM#Official religion|Jakim]]), which oversees the country's Islamic policies said that a [[fatwa]] (ruling) issued by the country's top clerics in 2005 noted that the day 'is associated with elements of Christianity,' and 'we just cannot get involved with other religions' worshipping [[ritual]]s.' Jakim officials planned to carry out a nationwide campaign called "Awas Jerat Valentine's Day" ("Mind the Valentine's Day Trap"), aimed at preventing Muslims from celebrating the day on February 14, 2011. Activities include conducting raids in hotels to stop young couples from having unlawful sex and distributing leaflets to Muslim university students warning them against the day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysian Muslims warned against Valentine's Day |work=[[The Straits Times]] |date=February 13, 2011 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_634485.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094726/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_634485.html |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Malaysia Warns Muslims of Valentine's Day Trap |work=BBC News |date=February 13, 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12443104 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104223300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12443104 |archive-date=January 4, 2016  }}</ref>

On Valentine's Day 2011, West Malaysian religious authorities arrested more than 100 Muslim couples concerning the celebration ban. Some of them would be charged in the Shariah Court for defying the department's ban against the celebration of Valentine's Day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/malaysia-arrests-100-muslim-couples-for-celebrating-lovers-day/422743 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219111614/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/malaysia-arrests-100-muslim-couples-for-celebrating-lovers-day/422743 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 19, 2011 |title=Malaysia Arrests 100 Muslim Couples for Celebrating Lovers' Day |newspaper=The Jakarta Globe |accessdate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref>

====Finland and Estonia====
In Finland, Valentine's Day is called ''ystävänpäivä'' which translates into "Friend's Day". As the name indicates, this day is more about remembering friends, not significant others. In Estonia, Valentine's Day is called ''sõbrapäev'', which has the same meaning.<ref name="s6brap2ev">{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.ee/Berta/tahtpaev-valentinipaev.php|title=BERTA – Eesti rahvakalendri tähtpäevade andmebaas|work=folklore.ee|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219074035/http://www.folklore.ee/Berta/tahtpaev-valentinipaev.php|archive-date=February 19, 2016}}</ref>

====France====
In France, a traditionally [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] country, Valentine's Day is known simply as "[[Saint Valentine|Saint Valentin]]", and is celebrated in much the same way as other western countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://travelfranceonline.com/valentines-day-saint-valentin-tradition/|title=Traditions in france for valentine's day celebration|date=January 23, 2015|newspaper=Culture x Tourism|language=en-US|access-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020308/https://travelfranceonline.com/valentines-day-saint-valentin-tradition/|archive-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref>
The relics of Saint Valentin de Terni, the patron of the St Valentine's Day, are in the Catholic church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Jean-l’Evangéliste located in the southern France town of [[Roquemaure, Gard]].
The celebrations of "Fête des Amoureux" takes place every two years on the Sunday closest to February 14. The village gets dressed in its 19th-century costume and put on the program with over 800 people.

====Greece====
St. Valentine's Day, or Ημέρα του Αγίου Βαλεντίνου in Greek tradition was not associated with romantic love. In the Eastern Orthodox church there is another Saint who protects people who are in love, [[Hyacinth of Caesarea]] (feast day July 3), but this was not widely known until the late 1990s<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cretegazette.com/2009-02/agios-yakinthos.php |title=Agios Yakinthos |date=February 1, 2009 |work=Crete Gazette |access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> In contemporary Greece, Valentine's Day is generally celebrated as in the common Western tradition.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/young_greeks_celebrate_valentines_day_home/6100 |title=Young Greeks celebrate Valentine's Day at home |date=February 14, 2012 |work=GR Reporter |access-date=February 13, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]], the holiday is known as "Dia dos Namorados" (Lover's Day / Day of the Enamoured). As elsewhere, couples exchange gifts, but in some regions, women give a ''lenço de namorados'' ("lovers' handkerchief"), which is usually embroidered with love motifs.<ref name="Poelzl2009">{{cite book|last=Poelzl|first=Volker|title=CultureShock!

====Romania====
In recent years, Romania has also started celebrating Valentine's Day. This has drawn backlash from several groups, institutions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultura.ro/Documents.aspx?ID=190 |title=Valentine's Day versus Dragobete |accessdate=February 14, 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627093822/http://www.cultura.ro/Documents.aspx?ID=190 |archive-date=June 27, 2010 }}, cultura.ro {{in lang|ro}}</ref> and nationalist organizations like [[Noua Dreapta|Noua Dreaptǎ]], who condemn Valentine's Day for being superficial, commercialist, and imported Western [[kitsch]]. In order to counter the perceived denaturation of national culture, [[Dragobete]], a spring festival celebrated in parts of Southern Romania, has been rekindled after having been ignored during the Communist years as the traditional Romanian holiday for lovers. The holiday is named after a character from Romanian folklore who was supposed to be the son of [[Baba Dochia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandia.eu/dragobete-celebrating-love-romanian-style/|title=Dragobete 's Day – Celebrating love in the Romanian style|website=Romania Tours|language=en-US|access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> Its date used to vary depending on the geographical area, however nowadays it is commonly observed on February 24.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.elenacuza.ro/site/finlanda/dragobeteeng.htm |title=dragobeteeng |last=Cuza |first=Elena |access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref>

====Scandinavia====
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], February 14 is known as ''Valentinsdag'', and it is celebrated in much the same manner as in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Skandiblog">{{Cite web |url=http://skandihome.com/skandiblog/inspiration/valentines-day-the-scandinavian-way/ |title=Valentine's Day the Scandinavian way |last=Ripa |first=Ellen |date=February 6, 2017 |website=Skandiblog |language=en-US | publisher=Skandihome |access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> In [[Sweden]] it is called ''Alla hjärtans dag'' ("All Hearts' Day") and is not widely celebrated. A 2016 survey revealed that less than 50% of men and women were planning to buy presents for their partners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/650924/survey-on-valentine-s-day-celebration-traditions-in-sweden-by-gender/ |title=Sweden: Valentine's Day celebration traditions by gender 2016 |website=Statista |language=en |access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> The holiday has only been observed since the 1960s.<ref name="Skandiblog"/>
