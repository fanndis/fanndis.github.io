==History==
===Precursor miller companies===
[[File:Quaker Oats advertisement 1905.jpg|thumb|1905 magazine advertisement]]
In the 1850s, [[Ferdinand Schumacher]] and [[Robert Stuart (businessman)|Robert Stuart]] founded oat mills. Schumacher founded the [[German Mills American Oatmeal Company]] in [[Akron, Ohio]], and Stuart founded the North Star Mills in [[Ontario]], Canada. In 1870, Schumacher ran his first known cereal advertisement in the Akron Beacon Journal newspaper. In 1877, the Quaker Mill Company of Ravenna, Ohio was founded. "The name was chosen when Quaker Mill partner Henry Seymour found an encyclopedia article on Quakers and decided that the qualities described — integrity, honesty, purity — provided an appropriate identity for the company's oat product." Quaker Mill Company held the trademark on the Quaker name. In Ravenna, Ohio, on 4 September 1877, Henry Seymour of the [[Quaker Mill Company]] applied for the first trademark for a breakfast cereal, "a man in '[[Quaker]] garb'".<ref>Adams, Cecil.  [http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mquaker.html Is the guy on the Quaker Oats box John Penn?] [[The Straight Dope]] Accessed 28 July 2006.</ref> 

In 1879, John Stuart and his son Robert joined with George Douglas to form Imperial Mill and set up their operation in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. In 1881, [[Henry Parsons Crowell|Henry Crowell]] bought the Quaker Mill Company,<ref>Quaker.co.in [http://www.quaker.co.in/aboutus/quaker-history.aspx Quaker Oats History]</ref> and the following year he launched a national advertising campaign for Quaker Oats, introducing a cereal box that made it possible to buy in quantities other than bulk. He also bought the bankrupt Quaker Oat Mill Company in Ravenna, and held the key positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company from 1888 until late 1943, becoming known as the cereal tycoon. He donated more than 70% of his wealth to the [[Crowell Trust]].

In 1888, the American Cereal Company was formed by the merger of seven major oat millers. Ferdinand Schumacher became president, Henry Crowell, general manager and John Stuart the secretary treasurer. In 1889, the American Cereal Company introduced the half ounce trial size and, as a promotion, they distributed one to every home in [[Portland, Oregon]] via boys on bicycles. Later, this promotion was extended to other cities. A second promotion involved placing dinner plates within the then-regular (not round) boxes of oats.

===Quaker Oats Company===
In 1901, the Quaker Oats Company was founded in [[New Jersey]] with headquarters in Chicago, by the merger of four [[rolled oats|oat mills]]: the Quaker Mill Company in Ravenna, Ohio, which held the trademark on the Quaker name; the cereal mill in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]], [[Iowa]] owned by John Stuart, his son [[Robert Stuart (businessman)|Robert Stuart]], and their partner George Douglas; the [[German Mills American Oatmeal Company]] in Akron, Ohio, owned by Schumacher; The Rob Lewis & Co. American Oats and Barley Oatmeal Corporation. Formally known as "Good For Breakfast" instant oatmeal mix. In the same year, the whole merged company was acquired by [[Henry Parsons Crowell]], who also bought the [[bankrupt]] Quaker Oat Mill Company, also in Ravenna.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Strait Dope Mailbag - Is the guy on the Quaker Oats Box John Penn?| first = Cecil| last = Adams| url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mquaker.html| accessdate =  15 August 2007}}</ref> Crowell held the positions of general manager, president and chairman of the company until late 1943.

In 1908, Quaker Oats introduced the first in a series of cookie recipes on the box. In 1911, Quaker Oats purchased the Great Western Cereal Company. The iconic cylindrical package made its first appearance in 1915. Later that year, Quaker offered the first cereal box premium to buyers. By sending in one [[dollar]] and the cut out picture of the "Quaker Man" customers received a double boiler for the cooking of oatmeal. 

In the 1920s, Quaker introduced "Quaker Quick Oats" an early convenience food and also offered a crystal radio kit using the cylindrical package.<ref>[https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/marquettec_quaker_oats_radio_receiving_set.html Quaker Oats Radio Receiving Set], (radiomuseum.org)</ref> In the 1930s, Quaker was one of the many companies using the [[Dionne Quintuplets]] for promotional purposes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by [[Theodor Horydczak]], who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=quaker+oats&co=thc|title=Search Results: "Quaker Oats" : Prints & Photographs Online Catalog (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, (six miles west of [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]]), as a government-owned, contractor-operated 11,960-acre site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bombs for Hitler, Hirohito loaded at Grand Island |url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/homefront/homefront.news.owh.19430704b.html |website=The Great Plains During World War II |publisher=Plains Humanities Alliance |accessdate=26 October 2020}}</ref> Construction began in March 1942 and production ended on 15 August 1945.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Danny M.

In 1946, artist Jim Nash was commissioned to produce a head portrait of the Quaker Man, which became the basis for [[Haddon Sundblom]]'s famous version of 1957. In 1972, John Mills designed the current logo.

From 1946 to 1953, researchers from Quaker Oats, [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]] carried out experiments at the [[Walter E. Fernald State School]] to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ''Science Club'' and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. However, they were not told (and the consent form contained no information indicating) that the food their children were fed contained [[radionuclides|radioactive]] [[calcium]] and [[iron]].<ref name="pmid13278403"/><ref>{{cite book |title= ACHRE Report|accessdate=February 7, 2016 |chapter=Chapter 7: The Studies at Fernald School |chapter-url=https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap7_5.html |quote= It is clear that the doses involved were low and that it is extremely unlikely that any of the children who were used as subjects were harmed as a consequence.}}</ref> The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title=MIT and Quaker settle cereal suit |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=19980101&id=m9ggAAAAIBAJ&pg=1461,30454 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |work=Sun Journal |date=1 January 1998}}</ref> The company was later sued because of the experiments.

In 1968, a plant was built in [[Danville, Illinois]], which now makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker [[Oh's]], Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants.

In 1969, Quaker acquired [[Fisher-Price]], a toy company. In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', in return obtaining a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for [[candy bar]]s. In 1991, Quaker Oats spun off its Fisher-Price division.

In 1982, Quaker Oats purchased [[US Games]], a company that created games for the [[Atari 2600]]. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to [[Country Pure Foods]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/country-pure-foods-to-acquire-the-quaker-oats-companys-ardmore-farms-business-75788837.html|title=Country Pure Foods to Acquire The Quaker Oats Company's Ardmore Farms Business|first=Quaker Oats|last=Company|website=Prnewswire.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-quaker-oats-company-history/|title=History of The Quaker Oats Company – FundingUniverse|website=Fundinguniverse.com}}</ref>

In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of [[Van Camp's]] and [[Gatorade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Quaker-Oats-Company-Company-History.html |title=The Quaker Oats Company - Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=18 January 2012}}</ref>

Quaker bought [[Snapple]] for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to [[Wendy's/Arby's Group|Triarc]] in 1997 for $300 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morevalue.com/glossary/restrict/Divestiture-Snapple.html |title=Quaker Oats Sells Snapple At A $1 |publisher=Morevalue.com |date=28 March 1997 |accessdate=18 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116115549/http://www.morevalue.com/glossary/restrict/Divestiture-Snapple.html |archive-date=16 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Triarc sold it to [[Cadbury Schweppes]] for $1.45 billion in September 2000.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brian Graney |url=http://www.fool.com/news/breakfast/2000/breakfast000918.htm |title=Triarc Sells Snapple to Cadbury Schweppes [Breakfast With the Fool&#93; September 18, 2000 |publisher=Fool.com |date=18 September 2000 |accessdate=18 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314082143/http://www.fool.com/news/breakfast/2000/breakfast000918.htm |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]].

In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by [[Pinnacle Foods]] in 2004).

In August 2001, [[PepsiCo]] acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dobbyn |first1=Tim |title=Pepsi Gets to Buy Quaker |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-aug-02-fi-29723-story.html |website=The Los Angeles Times |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> primarily for its [[Gatorade]] brand of [[soft drink]]. The merger created the fourth-largest consumer goods company in the world. Though the main prize of PepsiCo was [[Gatorade]] non-carbonated sports drink, Quaker's cereal and snack food division complemented the existing [[Frito-Lay]] salty-snacks division.

Since the late 1980s, actor [[Wilford Brimley]] has appeared in television commercials extolling the virtues of oat consumption, typically to a young child, as to introduce the concept of oatmeal consumption as a long [[tradition]]. In the 1990s [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated children's show ''[[Rugrats]]'', the biggest fear of one of the characters, Chuckie Finster (the "scaredy-cat" of the bunch), was "the man on the oatmeal box". In ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'', Chuckie overcame this fear when he became "Chuckie Chan". The song lyrics to his transformation included the line "He can stare into the eye/of the oatmeal guy!"

In 2019 Quaker Oats announced the move of its Chicago offices to the [[Old Chicago Main Post Office]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=PepsiCo announces Chicago office move to Old Post Office building|url=https://abc7chicago.com/pepsico-pepsi-old-post-office-chicago/5711300/|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref>

===Canadian operations===
[[Image:Quakerptbo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Quaker Oats facility in Peterborough]]
The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company<ref>{{cite web | title = American Cereal Company | publisher = Ohio Historical Society | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=833
}}</ref> in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as "The Electric City" due to its [[hydropower]] resources,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peterborough-on.worldweb.com/|title=Peterborough Travel Guide: Peterborough, Ontario (ON) - WORLDWEB.COM|website=Peterborough-on.worldweb.com}}</ref> attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The [[Trent–Severn Waterway]] also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire.

When [[PepsiCo]] purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, [[Aunt Jemima]] instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, [[Gatorade]] sports drinks and the [[Propel Fitness Water|Propel]] fitness water sub-brand, [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]] juices, and various [[Frito-Lay]] snack products. Products are easily identified by the ''manufactured by'' address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility supplies the majority of [[Canada]] and exports limited portions to the [[United States]]. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets.

===Land giveaways in cereal boxes===
Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in [[Milford, Connecticut]]. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called "Liberty Park". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a "general foreclosure" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a [[Société Bic|BiC Corporation]] plant.<ref name=fjcp103>Juliano, Frank, "[http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Oatmeal-lots-gave-officials-indigestion-687006.php Oatmeal lots gave officials indigestion]", pp 1, A12, 3 October 2010, ''[[Connecticut Post]]''</ref>

In 1955, Quaker Oats again [[Klondike Big Inch Land Promotion|gave away land]] as part of a promotion, this one tied to the ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]].<ref name=fjcp103/>

==The Quaker man logo versus Quakers==
[[File:Quaker Oats (3092914571).jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Quaker Oats standing "Quaker Man" logo c.1900]]

The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word "Pure" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of [[William Penn]] (founder of the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]), the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crystalradio.net/oatbox/frontwithtop1.jpg|title=Quaker Oats box label, circa 1920s|website=Crystalradio.net|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref> Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the "Quaker man" as William Penn, and referred to him as "standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats."<ref>{{cite web |title=If it walks like William Penn, talks like William Penn and looks like William Penn . . . |url=http://phillyflashbacks.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/if-it-walks-like-william-penn-talks-like-william-penn-and-looks-like-william-penn/ |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> 

[[File:Quaker-Oats-4321.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Quaker Oats box, featuring the pre-2012 "Quaker Man" logo]]
In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and [[Haddon Sundblom]]'s now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist [[Harold W. McCauley]] as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by [[Saul Bass]], a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quaker Oats Guy Gets a Slimmer New Look |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/31/the-quaker-oats-guy-gets-a-slimmer-new-look/ |accessdate=3 January 2015 |work=Time |date=31 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dianhasan.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/identity-evolution-quaker-oats-usa/|title=Identity Evolution - Quaker Oats, USA|date=12 May 2011|website=Dianhasan.wordpress.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref> The man is now sometimes referred to as "Larry" by insiders at Quaker Oats.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Nassauer |title='Larry,' Quaker of Oatmeal Fame, Gets a Makeover |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303404704577309540451674640.html |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012 }}</ref>
And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: "Nothing is better for thee, than me".

The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo "does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in [[Quakers|Quaker garb]], including a [[wide awake hat|Quaker hat]], chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength."<ref>{{cite web | title = Quaker Oats Company Web Site - Quaker FAQ | url = http://www.quakeroats.com/about-quaker-oats/content/quaker-faq.aspx | accessdate = 22 January 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160527171039/http://www.quakeroats.com/about-quaker-oats/content/quaker-faq.aspx | archive-date = 27 May 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

The company has never had any ties with the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty ([[truth]] is often considered a [[Quaker testimony]]). ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' writes "According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877." <ref>{{cite web | title = The Strait Dope Mailbag - Is the guy on the Quaker Oats Box John Penn? | first = Cecil | last = Adams | url = http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mquaker.html | accessdate =  15 August 2007}}</ref>

Members of the Religious Society of Friends  have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beyond the Oatmeal Box | first = A.J. | last= Mendoza | url = http://www.friendsjournal.org/beyond-oatmeal-box/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Quaker Problems | first = Taylor Mary | last = Satterthwaite | url = http://www.friendsjournal.org/quaker-problems/ }}</ref> In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted [[Popeye]] as a "Quakerman" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and [[Bluto]].<ref>{{citation | title = Tough on Quaker Oats  | newspaper = Friends Journal  | page = 37  | date = May 1990 }}</ref> Later that decade, more letters were sparked by [[Power Rangers]] toys included in [[Cap'n Crunch]] cereal.<ref>{{citation | last = Deming | first = Victor | title = Mightier than a Megazord  | newspaper = Friends Journal  | page = 2  | date = June 1995 }}</ref>

==Informed consent controversy, research on children==
From 1946 to 1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]] carried out experiments at the [[Walter E. Fernald State School]] to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of disabled children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ''Science Club'' and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients.

===Trans fat content and litigation===
In 2010, two [[California]] consumers filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy [[trans fat]].
