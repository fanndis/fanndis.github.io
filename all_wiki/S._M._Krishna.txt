==Political career==
[[File:S M Krishna with Obamas.jpg|thumb|right|Krishna(center) with US President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] during a reception at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.]]
Krishna started his electoral political career in the year 1962 by winning Maddur Vidhan Sabha seat as an independent, defeating the prominent politician from [[Indian National Congress]] K V Shankar Gowda for whom [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] had campaigned. [http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/300117/i-look-to-the-congress-president-not-others-sm-krishna.html ]. Then he joined Praja Socialist Party, but lost from Maddur in 1967 to Congress' M M Gowda. He won the bye-poll for [[Mandya (Lok Sabha constituency)]] in 1968 when the sitting MP died, defeating the Congress nominee.

In 1968 he was influential in reconciliation between members of the Indian National Congress and Praja Socialist Party.  He served three terms as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] from the [[Mandya (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mandya]] constituency of Karnataka starting from 1968 bye-poll as a socialist. His next two terms were as a Congressman, winning elections in 1971 and 1980. Mandya has remained a Congress stronghold, represented in Lok Sabha later by his political proteges like Ambareesh and [[Divya Spandana]] (also known as Ramya). S M Krishna resigned from Lok Sabha in 1972, and became MLC in Karnataka and was appointed a minister by Devaraj Urs. 

After he went back to Lok Sabha in 1980, [http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/300117/i-look-to-the-congress-president-not-others-sm-krishna.html and] he served as minister under [[Indira Gandhi]] between 1983–84. He lost from Mandya Lok Sabha seat in 1984 and it is unclear if he served as a minister between 1984 and 1985 under [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Later he became a member of the Rajya Sabha in the years 1996 and 2006. He was member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and council at different times. Between 1989 and 1992 he was Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly and Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka.

In 1999, as [[Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee]] president, he led his party to victory in the assembly polls and took over as Chief Minister of Karnataka, a post he held until 2004. He was also instrumental in creating power reforms with ESCOMS and digitization of land records (BHOOMI) and many other citizen friendly initiatives. He encouraged private public participation and was a fore bearer of the [[Bangalore Agenda Task Force|Bangalore Advance Task Force]]. He later became the Governor of Maharashtra.

Krishna resigned as Governor of Maharashtra on 5 March 2008. It was reported that this was due to his intention to return to active politics in Karnataka.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/06/stories/2008030657110100.htm "S. M. Krishna quits as Governor"], ''The Hindu'', 6 March 2008.</ref> President [[Pratibha Patil]] accepted his resignation on 6 March.<ref>[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14618039 "Krishna resignation accepted, Jamir in charge of State"], [[Sify.com]], 6 March 2008.</ref>
Krishna entered the [[Rajya Sabha]] and subsequently took the oath of office as Union Cabinet Minister of External Affairs in the Council of Ministers under Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] on 22 May 2009.
