[[File:Nagant Revolver.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A Russian [[Nagant M1895]] [[revolver]]]]
'''Russian roulette''' ({{lang-ru|русская рулетка}}, ''russkaya ruletka'') is a lethal [[game of chance]] in which a player places a single [[Cartridge (firearms)|round]] in a [[revolver]], spins the [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]], places the muzzle against their head, and pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] in hopes that the loaded chamber does not align with the [[Hammer (firearms)|primer percussion mechanism]] and the barrel, causing the weapon to discharge. ''Russian'' refers to the supposed country of origin, and ''roulette'' to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver's cylinder, which is reminiscent of a spinning [[roulette]] wheel.

The deadly game is commonly associated with six-shot revolvers. If such is the case, [[expected value|mathematically]], the average number of consecutive pulls of the trigger before the gun discharges is 3.5. After a single spin, the probability of it firing is {{frac|6}}, followed by {{frac|5}} on the second pull, {{frac|4}} on the 3rd pull and so on, until if it failed to fire 5 times, the probability is {{frac|1}} (=1) on the final pull.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statisticalideas.blogspot.com/2015/06/abnormal-risks.html|title=Abnormal risks|website=Statistical Ideas|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=21 June 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191106183440/https://statisticalideas.blogspot.com/2015/06/abnormal-risks.html|archive-date=6 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> If the cylinder is re-spun after each trigger pull, the probability of firing remains 1 in 6 on each occasion, and the probability of it having fired after 6 pulls is <math>1-(\tfrac{5}{6})^6</math>, or about 66.5%.

==Origin==
According to Andrew Clarke, the first trace of Russian roulette can be found in the story "The Fatalist" of 1840, part of the collection ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], a Russian poet and writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5gD8SCymTU&list=PLFNYsCQU-KaMPQX8whHd19K6syiywZxwd&index=2&t=2s|title=The Deer Hunter Roberto Leoni Movie Reviews|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref> In the story the protagonist of the novel, Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin, says there is no predestination and proposes a bet emptying about twenty gold pieces onto the table. A lieutenant of the dragoons of the tsar of Serbian origin, Vulič, with passion for gambling, accepts the challenge and randomly takes one of the various-caliber pistols from its nail, cocks it and pours powder on the shelf. Nobody knows if the pistol is loaded or not. Vulič asks: "Gentlemen! Who will pay 20 gold pieces for me?", putting the muzzle of the pistol to his forehead. Then he asks Gregory to throw a card in the air and when this card touches the ground, he shoots. Fortunately, nothing happens, because the blow fails, but when Vulič cocks the pistol again, and aims it at the service cap hanging over the window, a shot rings out and smoke fills the room.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kittylevin.livejournal.com/29535.html|title=The Fatalist. Mikhail Lermontov. English Translation.|publisher=LiveJournal.com|accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>

The game spread among Russian garrison officials, becoming a foolish courage challenge. It became a way to alleviate the boredom of the long hours in distant garrisons; it also became an undertaking that, in the eyes of its players, superseded the duel.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

==Etymology==
The term ''Russian roulette'' was possibly first used in a 1937 short story of the same name by [[Georges Surdez]]:

{{quote|'Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' When I said I had not, he told me all about it. When he was with the Russian army in {{Not a typo|Rumania}}{{sic}}, around 1917, and things were cracking up, so that their officers felt that they were not only losing prestige, money, family, and country, but were being also dishonored before their colleagues of the Allied armies, some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, in a café, at a gathering of friends, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.<ref name="colliers_19370130_surdez" />}}

==Notable incidents==
* In a 1946 U.S. legal case, ''[[Commonwealth v. Malone]],'' 47 A.2d 445 (1946), a [[Pennsylvania]] teenager's conviction for murder in the second degree as a result of shooting a friend was upheld by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]]. In this case, the teenagers involved played a modified version of Russian roulette, called Russian poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of the revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. The court ruled that "When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of [[manslaughter]] even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/criminal-law/criminal-law-keyed-to-kadish/homicide/commonwealth-v-malone/2/ |title=Commonwealth v.

* In the 2012 video game ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', one of the challenges presented to students in the game's fourth chapter is a one-player Russian roulette game, which is played by Gundham Tanaka and Nagito Komaeda on two separate occasions. The latter plays an inverted version with five bullets and one empty chamber, surviving thanks to his "ultimate lucky student" talent. Tanaka plays with one bullet and also survives.
* In June 2017, the video game ''Super Russian Roulette'' was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game involves pointing the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] [[Light gun|light-gun]] accessory at the players' own heads, facing off against a computer-generated cowboy and up to three human players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batslyadams/super-russian-roulette-a-new-party-game-for-the-ne/description|title=Super Russian Roulette: A New Party Game for the NES|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batslyadams/super-russian-roulette-a-new-party-game-for-the-ne/posts/1917589|title=Update 16: State of the Saloon — Shipping Update #2 · Super Russian Roulette: A New Party Game for the NES|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.superrussianroulette.com/collections/frontpage|title=Shop|website=Batlab Electronics|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
* In the 2018 video game ''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'', depressed alcoholic Lieutenant Hank Anderson is revealed to often participate in Russian roulette while drunk. In the chapter "Russian Roulette", Connor ends up saving and sobering up Hank when he passed out playing Russian roulette. One ending depicts the character killing himself while in a miserable state.

===Drinking games===
There is a [[drinking game]] based on Russian roulette. The game involves six shot glasses filled by a non-player. Five are filled with water, the sixth with vodka. Among some groups, low quality vodka is preferred as it makes the glass representing the filled chamber less desirable. The glasses are arranged in a circle, and players take turns choosing a glass to take a shot from at random.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roulettegamesvariety.com/drinking-roulette.htm|title=Drinking Roulette Fun Game|website=roulettegamesvariety.com|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>

There is also a game called "Beer Hunter" (titled after the Russian roulette scenes in the film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''). In this game, six cans of beer are placed between the participants. One can is vigorously shaken, and the cans are scrambled. The participants take turns opening the cans of beer right under their noses; the person who opens the shaken can (and sprays beer up their nose) is deemed the loser.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Beer Hunter|url=http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|website=Modern Drunkard Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209054418/http://drunkard.com/issues/01_07/md_drinking_games.html|archive-date=2014-12-09}}</ref>
