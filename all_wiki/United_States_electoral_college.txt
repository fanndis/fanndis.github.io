The '''United States Electoral College''' is the group of presidential electors required by the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] to form every four years for the sole purpose of electing the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. Each [[U.S. state|state]] [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|appoints electors]] according to its [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]], equal in number to its [[United States congressional apportionment|congressional delegation]]. [[Federal government of the United States|Federal office holders]] cannot be electors. Of the current 538 electors, an [[absolute majority]] of 270 or more ''electoral votes'' is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves an absolute majority there, a [[contingent election]] is held by the [[United States House of Representatives]] to elect the president, and by the [[United States Senate]] to elect the vice president.

Currently, the states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws against [[faithless elector]]s. All jurisdictions use a [[Plurality voting|winner-take-all method]] to choose their electors, except for [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]], which choose [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|one elector per congressional district]] and two electors for the [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the highest statewide vote. The [[United States Electoral College#Meetings|electors meet and vote]] in December and the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration of the president and vice president]] takes place in January.

The appropriateness of the Electoral College system is a matter of ongoing debate. Supporters argue that it is a fundamental component of [[Federalism in the United States|American federalism]] by preserving the Constitutional role of the states in presidential elections. It is the implementation by the states that may leave it open to criticism; winner-take-all systems, especially in populous states, may not align with the principle of "[[one man, one vote|one person, one vote]]".{{efn|Writing for in the policy journal [[National Affairs]], Allen Guelzo argues, "it is worthwhile to deal directly with three popular arguments against the Electoral College. The first, that the Electoral College violates the principle of "one man, one vote." In assigning electoral college votes by winner-take-all, the states themselves violate the one-person-one-vote principle. Hillary Clinton won only 61.5% of the California vote, "and she collected all 55 of California’s electoral votes as a result." The disparity in Illinois was "even more dramatic". Clinton won that state's popular vote 3.1 million to 2.1 million, and that 59.6% share granted her 100% of Illinois 20 electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/in-defense-of-the-electoral-college| title=In Defense of the Electoral College| publisher=National Affairs| date=April 2, 2018| last=Guelzo| first=Allen| accessdate=November 5, 2020}}</ref>}} The Electoral College has promoted political stability by fostering a broad-based, enduring, and generally moderate [[Political parties in the United States|party system]] that is grounded on the count of both voting and non-voting residents for state apportionment of electors.{{efn|Allen Guelzo, the director of Civil War Studies at Gettysburg College observes, "The Constitution mandates that each state choose electors up to the combined number of its representatives and senators.

== Procedure==
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution directs each [[U.S. state|state]] to appoint a quantity of electors equal to that state's congressional delegation (members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] plus two [[United States Senate|Senators]]). The same clause empowers each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] to determine the manner by which that state's electors are chosen but prohibits federal office holders from being named electors.

== Background ==
The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 used the [[Virginia Plan]] as the basis for discussions, as the Virginia proposal was the first. The Virginia Plan called for Congress to elect the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_529.asp|title=Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787: May 29|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref> Delegates from a majority of states agreed to this mode of election. After being debated, however, delegates came to oppose nomination by Congress for the reason that it could violate the separation of powers. [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] then made a motion for electors for the purpose of choosing the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_602.asp|title=Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787: June 2|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

Later in the convention, a committee formed to work out various details including the mode of election of the president, including final recommendations for the electors, a group of people apportioned among the states in the same numbers as their representatives in Congress (the formula for which had been resolved in lengthy debates resulting in the [[Connecticut Compromise]] and [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]), but chosen by each state "in such manner as its Legislature may direct". Committee member [[Gouverneur Morris]] explained the reasons for the change; among others, there were fears of "intrigue" if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met together regularly, as well as concerns for the independence of the president if he were elected by Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_904.asp|title=Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787: September 4|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

However, once the Electoral College had been decided on, several delegates (Mason, Butler, Morris, Wilson, and Madison) openly recognized its ability to protect the election process from cabal, corruption, intrigue, and faction. Some delegates, including James Wilson and James Madison, preferred popular election of the executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/james-wilson-popular-sovereignty-and-the-electoral-college|title=James Wilson, popular sovereignty, and the Electoral College|publisher=National Constitution Center|access-date=April 9, 2019|date=November 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ashbrook.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/madisons_debates.pdf|title=The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 by James Madison|publisher=Ashland University|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref> Madison acknowledged that while a popular vote would be ideal, it would be difficult to get consensus on the proposal given the prevalence of [[slavery]] in the South:
{{quote|There was one difficulty, however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the fewest objections.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&fileName=002/llfr002.db&recNum=60&itemLink=r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28fr00218%29%29%230020061&linkText=1 Records of the Federal Convention, p. 57] Farrand's Records, Volume 2, A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875, Library of Congress</ref>}}

In ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[James Madison]] explained his views on the selection of the president and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In [[Federalist No. 39]], Madison argued that the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of [[Federalism in the United States|state-based]] and [[Proportional representation|population-based]] government. [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have two houses: the state-based [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Meanwhile, the president would be elected by a mixture of the two modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed39.asp|title=The Federalist 39|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

[[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[Federalist No. 68]] laid out what he believed were the key advantages to the Electoral College. The electors come directly from the people and them alone, for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name="The Federalist Papers: No. 68">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained that the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint "the great body of the people" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of [[Republic|republican government]]. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name="The Federalist Papers: No. 68"/>

Another consideration was that the decision would be made without "tumult and disorder", as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates,</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified but with a talent for "low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity" attaining high office.<ref name="The Federalist Papers: No. 68"/>

Additionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against "an interested and overbearing majority" and the "mischiefs of faction" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as "a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." A republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers), would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>

Although the United States Constitution refers to "Electors" and "electors", neither the phrase "Electoral College" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century that the name "Electoral College" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845, and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as "college of electors".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U.

== History ==
Initially, state legislatures chose the electors in many of the states. From the early 19th century, states progressively changed to selection by popular election. In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], there were six states in which electors were still legislatively appointed. By [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], only [[South Carolina]] had not transitioned. Since [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], electors in every state have been chosen based on a popular election held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name=CRS2017THN/> The popular election for electors means the president and vice president are in effect chosen through [[indirect election]] by the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral College |website=history.com|url=https://www.history.com/topics/electoral-college|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> 

{{anchor|EvsP}}Since the mid-19th century, when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes nationwide, except in four elections: [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], when there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, the true national popular vote is uncertain. The electors failed to select a winning candidate, so the matter was decided by the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/|title=Presidents Winning Without Popular Vote|first=D'Angelo|last=Gore|date=December 23, 2016|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]}}</ref>

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]] of the Constitution provided the original plan by which the electors voted for president. Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.

The original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)#Framers of the Constitution|Framers of the Constitution]]:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/media/documents/chang.pdf|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>

# Individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis.

(Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa68.htm Federalist 68]). Hamilton strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, "The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted." ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>

# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.

Election expert, William C. Kimberling, reflected on the original intent as follows:

<blockquote>"The function of the College of Electors in choosing the president can be likened to that in the Roman Catholic Church of the [[College of Cardinals]] selecting the Pope. The original idea was for the most knowledgeable and informed individuals from each State to select the president based solely on merit and without regard to State of origin or political party."<ref>William C. Kimberling, [https://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php ''Essays in Elections: The Electoral College''] (1992)</ref></blockquote>

Furthermore, the original intention of the framers was that the Electors would not feel bound to support any particular candidate, but would vote their conscience, free of external pressure. [[Supreme Court Associate Justice]] [[Robert H. Jackson]] wrote:

<blockquote>"No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated, what is implicit in its text, that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214|title=RAY v.

==== Breakdown and revision ====
The emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.

In 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr were tied with one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.

Having already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (The votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election.). On the 36th ballot, Delaware's lone Representative, [[James A. Bayard (politician, born 1767)|James A. Bayard]], made it known that he intended to break the impasse for fear that failure to do so could endanger the future of the Union. Bayard and other Federalists from South Carolina, Maryland, and Vermont abstained, breaking the deadlock and giving Jefferson a majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/february-17/|title=Today in History - February 17|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

Responding to the problems from those elections, Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.

=== Evolution to the general ticket ===
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:
{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}

In [[Federalist No. 68]] Alexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks]... They [the [[Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)#Framers_of_the_Constitution|framers of the constitution]]] have not made the appointment of the President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men [i.e. Electors pledged to vote one way or another], who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes [i.e., to be told how to vote]; but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons [Electors to the Electoral College] for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have EXCLUDED from eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the President in office [in other words, no one can be an Elector who is prejudiced toward the president]... Thus without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias [Electors must not come to the Electoral College with bias]. Their transient existence, and their detached [unbiased] situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it."<ref name="Hamilton, Federalist 68">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They intended that this would take place district by district. The district plan was carried out by some states until 1892.<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiWltoZmSlYC&pg=RA5-PA402|title=Hearings|first=United States Congress|last=Senate|date=November 3, 1961|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}</ref> For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated "the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the name of a candidate for president was ''not'' on the ballot. Instead citizens voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.

Some state leaders began to adopt the strategy that the favorite partisan presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way—a "general ticket" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name="fairvote.org">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all "How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became, as Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] wrote, "voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities."<ref>Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Though this was indisputably in violation of the concepts Hamilton articulated in the Federalist #68, once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name="fairvote.org"/>

When [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]], two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be "made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president]."<ref name="Hamilton, Federalist 68"/> Hamilton stated that the electors were to ''analyze'' the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term "deliberate." Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector in violation of the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no "analysis" or "deliberate" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts, and it was inconceivable that a "general ticket" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name="Madison to Hay, 1823">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}} 

The Founding Fathers intended that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district, and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.

Each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. However, [[Federalist No. 68|Federalist #68]], insofar as it reflects the intent of the founders, states that Electors will be "selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass," and with regard to choosing Electors, "they [the framers] have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America." In spite of Hamilton's perspective, several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].

Madison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: "the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward," Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name="Madison to Hay, 1823"/> Hamilton drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289|title=Founders Online: Draft of a Resolution for the Legislature of New York for the{{nbsp}}...|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> However, Hamilton's [[Burr-Hamilton duel|untimely death]] in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further. Madison also drafted a constitutional amendment that would insure the original "district" plan of the framers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/04-03-02-0109|title=Founders Online: From James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> Jefferson agreed with Hamilton and Madison saying, "all agree that an election by districts would be the best."<ref name="auto3"/> Jefferson explained to Madison's correspondent why he was doubtful of the amendment being ratified: "the states are now so numerous that I despair of ever seeing another amendment of the constitution." <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-3707|title=Founders Online: From Thomas Jefferson to George Hay, 17 August 1823|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref>

=== Evolution of selection plans ===
In 1789, the at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland. Massachusetts, Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and state legislatures chose in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina).<ref>{{cite web|title=1788 Election For the First Term, 1789–1793|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html#1788|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601231820/https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html|archivedate=June 1, 2006|website=U.

By 1800, Virginia and Rhode Island voted at large; Kentucky, Maryland, and North Carolina voted popularly by district; and eleven states voted by state legislature. Beginning in 1804 there was a definite trend towards the winner-take-all system for statewide popular vote.<ref name="auto">Presidential Elections 1789–1996.

By 1832, only South Carolina legislatively chose its electors, and it abandoned the method after 1860.<ref name="auto"/> Maryland was the only state using a district plan, and from 1836 district plans fell out of use until the 20th century, though Michigan used a district plan for 1892 only.

=== Three-fifths clause and the role of slavery ===
After the initial estimates agreed to in the original Constitution, Congressional and Electoral College reapportionment was made according to a decennial census to reflect population changes, modified by counting [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths of slaves]]. On this basis after the first census, the Electoral College still gave the free men of slave-owning states (but never slaves) extra power (Electors) based on a count of these disenfranchised people, in the choice of the U.S. president.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115308/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/ Apportionment by State (PDF)], House of Representatives, History, Art & Archives, viewed January 27, 2019. 

Unlike composition in the College, from 1803 to 1846, the U.S. Senate sustained parity between free-soil and slave-holding states. Later a run of free-soil states, including Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas, were admitted before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</ref>

At the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], the College composition in theory amounted to 49 votes for northern states (in the process of abolishing slavery) and 42 for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first (i.e. 1788) presidential election lacked votes and electors for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7) and for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript U.S. Constitution Transcript], held at the U.S. National Archives, viewed online on February 5, 2019.</ref> For the next two decades the three-fifths clause led to electors of free-soil Northern states numbering 8% and 11% more than Southern states. The latter had, in the compromise, relinquished counting two-fifths of their slaves and, after 1810, were outnumbered by 15.4% to 23.2%.<ref>Brian D. Humes, Elaine K. Swift, Richard M.

The continuing, uninterrupted northern free-soil majority margin in the Electoral College would have been significantly smaller had slaves been counter-factually counted as whole persons, but still the South would have been a minority in the Electoral College over these sixty-eight years.</ref> Scholars further conclude that the three-fifths clause had low impact on sectional proportions and factional strength, until denying the North a pronounced supermajority, as to the Northern, federal inititive to abolish slavery. The seats that the South gained from such "slave bonus" were quite evenly distributed between the parties. In the First Party System (1795–1823), the Jefferson Republicans gained 1.1 percent more adherents from the slave bonus, while the Federalists lost the same proportion. At the Second Party System (1823–1837) the emerging Jacksonians gained just 0.7% more seats, versus the opposition loss of 1.6%.<ref>Brian D. Humes, et al.

The three-fifths slave-count rule is associated with three or four outcomes, 1792&ndash;1860:
 
*The clause, having reduced the South's power, led to John Adams's win in 1796 over Thomas Jefferson.<ref>Brian D. Humes, Elaine K. Swift, Richard M. Valley, Kenneth Finegold, and Evelyn C. Fink, "Representation of the Antebellum South in the House of Representatives: Measuring the Impact of the Three-Fifths Clause", Chapter 15 in David W. Brady and Mathew D.

*In 1800, historian [[Garry Wills]] argues, Jefferson's victory over Adams was due to the slave bonus count in the Electoral College as Adams would have won if citizens' votes were used for each state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power|last=Wills|first=Garry|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2005|isbn=9780618485376|pages=1–3 |language=en}}</ref> However, historian [[Sean Wilentz]] points out that Jefferson's purported "slave advantage" ignores an offset by electoral manipulation by anti-Jefferson forces in Pennsylvania.

*In 1824, the presidential selection was passed to the House of Representatives, and John Quincy Adams was chosen over Andrew Jackson, who won fewer citizens' votes. Then Jackson won in 1828, but would have lost if the College were citizen-only apportionment. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. 

The first "Jeffersonian" and "Jacksonian" victories were of great importance as they ushered in sustained party majorities of several Congresses and presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D. Humes, et al. "Representation of the Antebellum South in the House of Representatives: Measuring the Impact of the Three-Fifths Clause" in David W. Brady and Mathew D.

Besides the Constitution prohibiting Congress from regulating foreign or domestic slave trade before 1808 and a duty on states to return escaped "persons held to service",<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript Constitution of the United States: A Transcription], online February 9, 2019. See Article I, Section 9, and in Article IV, Section 2.</ref> legal scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]] argues that the College was originally advocated by slaveholders as a bulwark to prop up slavery. In the Congressional apportionment provided in the text of the Constitution with its Three-Fifths Compromise estimate, "Virginia emerged as the big winner [with] more than a quarter of the [votes] needed to win an election in the first round [for Washington's first presidential election in 1788]." Following the 1790 census, the most populous state in the [[United States Census, 1790|1790 Census]] was Virginia, with 39.1% slaves, or 292,315 counted three-fifths, to yield a calculated number of 175,389 for congressional apportionment.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H9KwtRkiO1YC&pg=PA42&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false First Census of the United States], Chapter III in "A Century of Population Growth from the first Census", volume 900, United States Census Office, 1909 In the 1790, Virginia's...population was 747,610, Pennsylvania was 433,633.(p. 8).

Supporters of the College have provided many counterarguments to the charges that it defended slavery.

=== Fourteenth Amendment ===
[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 2|Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment]] requires a state's representation in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to be reduced if the state denies the right to vote to any male citizen aged 21 or older, unless on the basis of "participation in rebellion, or other crime". The reduction is to be proportionate to such people denied a vote. This amendment refers to "the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States" (among other elections). It is the only part of the Constitution currently alluding to electors being selected by popular vote.

On May 8, 1866, during a debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], the leader of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the House of Representatives, delivered a speech on the amendment's intent. Regarding Section 2, he said:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111027145627/http://america.library4history.org/VFW-1865-McKinley/RECONSTRUCTION/FOURTEENTH-AMENDMENT.html The Fourteenth Amendment from America Book 9] (archived from [http://america.library4history.org/VFW-1865-McKinley/RECONSTRUCTION/FOURTEENTH-AMENDMENT.html the original] on 2011-10-27)</ref>
{{quote|The second section I consider the most important in the article. It fixes the basis of representation in Congress. If any State shall exclude any of her adult male citizens from the elective franchise, or abridge that right, she shall forfeit her right to representation in the same proportion. The effect of this provision will be either to compel the States to grant universal suffrage or so shear them of their power as to keep them forever in a hopeless minority in the national Government, both legislative and executive.<ref>The selected papers of Thaddeus Stevens, v.2, Stevens, Thaddeus, 1792–1868, Palmer, Beverly Wilson, 1936, Ochoa, Holly Byers, 1951, Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh, Digital Research Library, 2011, pp. 135–36</ref>}}

Federal law ({{usc|2|6}}) implements Section 2's mandate.

=== Meeting of electors ===
{{See also|Electoral Count Act}}

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 4: Election day|Article II, Section 1, Clause 4]] of the Constitution authorizes Congress to fix the day on which the electors shall vote, which must be the same day throughout the United States. And both [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 4: Election day|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]] and the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] that replaced it specifies that "the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted."

In 1887, Congress passed the [[Electoral Count Act]], now codified in [[Title 3 of the United States Code|Title 3, Chapter 1]] of the United States Code, establishing specific procedures for the counting of the electoral votes. The law was passed in response to the disputed [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], in which several states submitted competing slates of electors. Among its provisions, the law established deadlines that the states must meet when selecting their electors, resolving disputes, and when they must cast their electoral votes.<ref name=CRS/><ref>{{cite web|first=Edward-Isaac|last=Dovere|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-biden-electoral-count-act-1887/615994/|title=The Deadline That Could Hand Trump the Election|publisher=The Atlantic|date=2020-09-09|accessdate=2020-11-09}}</ref>

Since 1936, the date fixed by Congress for the meeting of the Electoral College is "on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December next following their appointment".<ref>[[Title 3 of the United States Code|3 USC]] 7</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/PresidentialElectionEvents.phtml |title=Dates of U.S. Presidential Election "Events": 1789 to the present|website=The Green Papers}}</ref>

Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, disqualifies all elected and appointed [[Federal government of the United States|federal officials]] from being electors. The [[Office of the Federal Register]] is charged with administering the Electoral College.<ref name="Zak">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-electoral-college-isnt-a-real-place-but-someone-has-to-answer-its-phones-these-days/2016/11/16/816f3838-aaa7-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html|title=The electoral college isn't a real place: But someone has to answer all the angry phone calls these days |first=Dan|last=Zak|date=November 16, 2016|newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref>

After the vote, each state sends to Congress a certified record of their electoral votes, called the Certificate of Vote. These certificates are opened during a [[joint session of Congress]], held in the first week of January, and read aloud by the incumbent vice president, acting in his capacity as President of the Senate. If any person receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, that person is declared the winner.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Electoral College?|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html|work=U.S. Electoral College|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> If there is a tie, or if no candidate for either or both offices receives an absolute majority, then choice falls to Congress in a procedure known as a [[contingent election]].

=== Summary ===
Even though the aggregate national popular vote is calculated by state officials, media organizations, and the [[Federal Election Commission]], the people only [[Indirect election|indirectly elect]] the [[President of the United States|president]]. The president and vice president of the United States are elected by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors from the fifty states and [[Washington, D.C.]] Electors are selected state-by-state, as determined by the laws of each state. Since the [[1824 United States presidential election|election of 1824]], the majority of states have chosen their presidential electors based on [[Winner-takes-all voting|winner-take-all]] results in the statewide popular vote on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name="FVWTA">{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Devin|title=How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All|url=http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all/|website=Fairvote|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2020}}, [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] are exceptions as both use the [[#congressional district method|congressional district method]]; Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1996.<ref name="ecollege" /> In most states, the popular vote [[ballot]]s list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]]). The slate of electors that represent the winning ticket will vote for those two offices. Electors are nominated by a party and pledged to vote for their party's candidate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-11|title=The Electoral College |url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-electoral-college.aspx |access-date=2020-11-15 |website=National Conference of State Legislatures}}</ref> Many states require an elector to vote for the candidate to which the elector is pledged, and most electors do regardless, but some "[[faithless elector]]s" have voted for other candidates or refrained from voting.

A candidate must receive an [[absolute majority]] of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a [[#Contingencies|contingency procedure]] established by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote winners as vice president.

==== Apportionment ====
{{further|United States congressional apportionment}}
[[File:US 2010 Census State Population Per Electoral Vote.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Population per electoral vote for each state and Washington, D.C. (2010 census). By 2020 estimates, a single elector could represent more than 700,000 people or under 200,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://act.represent.us/sign/electoral-college/|title=The Electoral College and the PopularVote Explained|website=act.represent.us|accessdate=November 8, 2020}}</ref>]]

A state's number of electors equals the number of representatives plus two electors for the senators the state has in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>The present allotment of electors by state is shown in the ''Electoral vote distribution'' section.</ref><ref>The number of electors allocated to each state is based on [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution, subject to being reduced pursuant to [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives|Section{{nbsp}}2 of the Fourteenth Amendment]].</ref> The number of representatives is based on the respective populations, determined every ten years by the [[United States Census]]. Based on the 2010 census, each representative represented on average 711,000 individuals.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf Congressional Apportionment. 2010 Census Briefs] U.S. Census.</ref>

Under the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]], [[Washington, D.C.]], is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state but no more electors than the least populous state. Because the least populous state ([[Wyoming]], according to the 2010 census) has three electors, D.C. cannot have more than three electors. Even if D.C. were a state, its population would entitle it to only three electors. Based on its population per electoral vote, D.C. has the second highest per capita Electoral College representation, after Wyoming.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.xls Table 1.

Currently, there are 538 electors, based on 435 representatives, 100 senators from the fifty states and three electors from Washington, D.C. The six states with the most electors are [[California]] (55), [[Texas]] (38), [[New York (state)|New York]] (29), [[Florida]] (29), [[Illinois]] (20), and [[Pennsylvania]] (20). The District of Columbia and the seven least populous states—[[Alaska]], [[Delaware]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wyoming]]—have three electors each.

==== Nominations ====
The custom of allowing recognized [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]] to select a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] of prospective electors developed early. In contemporary practice, each [[Ticket (election)|presidential-vice presidential ticket]] has an associated slate of potential electors. Then on Election Day, the voters select a ticket and thereby select the associated electors.<ref name=CRS2017THN/>

Candidates for elector are nominated by state chapters of nationally oriented political parties in the months prior to [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. In some states, the electors are nominated by voters in primaries the same way other presidential candidates are nominated. In some states, such as [[Oklahoma]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], electors are nominated in party conventions. In [[Pennsylvania]], the campaign committee of each candidate names their respective electoral college candidates (an attempt to discourage [[faithless elector]]s). Varying by state, electors may also be elected by state legislatures or appointed by the parties themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rawstory.com/2016/10/how-is-the-president-elected-here-is-a-basic-guide-to-the-electoral-college-system/|title=How is the president elected?

==== Selection process ====
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution requires each state legislature to determine how electors for the state are to be chosen, but it disqualifies any person holding a federal office, either elected or appointed, from being an elector.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edisonresearch.com/home/archives/ClevelandPlainDealer10-29-2004.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710171414/http://www.edisonresearch.com/home/archives/ClevelandPlainDealer10-29-2004.pdf|archivedate=July 10, 2011|title=Brown learns he can't serve as Kerry elector, steps down|publisher=Cleveland Plain Dealer (reprint at Edison Research)|author=Sabrina Eaton|date=October 29, 2004|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref> Under [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section{{nbsp}}3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]], any person who has sworn an [[oath]] to support the United States Constitution in order to hold either a state or federal office, and later rebelled against the United States directly or by giving assistance to those doing so, is disqualified from being an elector. However, Congress may remove this disqualification by a two-thirds vote in each House.

The Electoral College never meets as one body. Electors meet in their respective [[List of capitals in the United States#State capitals|state capitals]] (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the same day (set by Congress as the Monday after the second Wednesday in December) at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment12/|title=Twelfth Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment23/|title=Twenty-third Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/3/1/7|title=U.S.C. §&nbsp;7 : US Code – Section 7: Meeting and vote of electors|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

Although procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official – often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent — who reads the [[Certificate of Ascertainment]]. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.

When the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in [[New Jersey]] for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.

Under the [[Electoral Count Act]] (updated and codified in {{usc|3|9}}), each state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote, and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College – For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);
* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];
* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and
* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.

A staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress. The Certificates are arranged – unopened – in alphabetical order and placed in two special mahogany boxes. [[Alabama]] through [[Missouri]] (including the [[District of Columbia]]) are placed in one box and [[Montana]] through [[Wyoming]] are placed in the other box.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28555802|title=Congress meets to count electoral votes|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 9, 2009|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> Before 1950, the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State's]] office oversaw the certifications, but since then the Office of Federal Register in the Archivist's office reviews them to make sure the documents sent to the archive and Congress match and that all formalities have been followed, sometimes requiring states to correct the documents.<ref name=Zak/>

==== Faithless electors ====
{{main|Faithless elector}}

An elector votes for each office, but at least one of these votes (president or vice president) must be cast for a person who is not a resident of the same state as that elector.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kuroda|first1=Tadahisa|year=1994|title=The Origins of the Twelfth Amendment: The Electoral College in the Early Republic, 1787–1804|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-29151-7|page=168}}</ref> A "faithless elector" is one who does not cast an electoral vote for the candidate of the party for whom that elector pledged to vote. Faithless electors are comparatively rare because electors are generally chosen among those who are already personally committed to a party and party's candidate.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Linda S. |date=November 2, 2020 |title=VERIFY: Electors seldom go rogue in casting a state's votes for president |language=en-US |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/verify/verify-faithless-electors-rare/507-8f5e13fb-2dc8-4ad3-93b0-c2c4b31ffebe |access-date=2020-11-09}}</ref>  Thirty-three [[U.S. state|states]] plus the [[District of Columbia]] have laws against faithless electors,<ref>{{cite web|title=Faithless Elector State Laws|url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws|website=Fair Vote|accessdate=July 25, 2020}}</ref> which were first enforced after the 2016 election, where [[Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidential election|ten electors voted or attempted to vote contrary]] to their pledges. 
Faithless electors have never changed the outcome of a U.S. election for president. Altogether, 23,529 electors have taken part in the Electoral College as of the 2016 election; only 165 electors have cast votes for someone other than their party's nominee. Of that group, 71 did so because the nominee had died{{snd}}63 Democratic Party electors in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], when presidential nominee [[Horace Greeley]] died; and eight Republican Party electors in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], when vice presidential nominee [[James S. Sherman]] died.<ref>{{cite web|title=Faithless Electors|last=Penrose|first=Drew|date=March 19, 2020|url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_electors|website=Fair Vote|accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref>

While faithless electors have never changed the outcome of any presidential election, there are two occasions where the vice presidential election has been influenced by faithless electors: 
* In the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]], 18 electors pledged to the Federalist Party ticket cast their first vote as pledged for John Adams, electing him president, but did not cast their second vote for his running mate Thomas Pinckney. As a result, Adams attained 71 electoral votes, Jefferson received 68, and Pinckney received 59, meaning Jefferson, rather than Pinckney, became vice president.<ref>Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton.

* In the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 election]], Virginia's 23 electors, who were pledged to [[Richard Mentor Johnson]], voted instead for former U.S. Senator [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]], which left Johnson one vote short of the majority needed to be elected. In accordance with the Twelfth Amendment, a contingent election was held in the Senate between the top two receivers of electoral votes, Johnson and [[Francis Granger]], for vice president, with Johnson being elected on the first ballot.<ref name=SB12192016NCC>{{cite web|last=Bomboy|first=Scott|title=The one election where Faithless Electors made a difference|date=December 19, 2016|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-one-election-where-faithless-electors-made-a-difference|work=Constitution Daily|publisher=National Constitution Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>

The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] mandates Congress assemble in joint session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the election.<ref>"The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted." [https://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html ''Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11–27''], National Archives and Records Administration</ref> The session is ordinarily required to take place on January{{nbsp}}6 in the calendar year immediately following the meetings of the presidential electors.<ref name="3USC15">{{usc|3|15}}, ''Counting electoral votes in Congress''</ref> Since the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], the newly elected Congress declares the winner of the election; all elections before [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] were determined by the outgoing House.

The [[Office of the Federal Register]] is charged with administering the Electoral College.<ref name="Zak"/> The meeting is held at 1{{nbsp}}p.m. in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name="3USC15" /> The sitting vice president is expected to preside, but in several cases the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]] has chaired the proceedings. The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.

Members of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. 

A state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. 

In [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes from Georgia were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=David A. McKnight|title=The Electoral System of the United States: A Critical and Historical Exposition of Its Fundamental Principles in the Constitution and the Acts and Proceedings of Congress Enforcing It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z2d29DZj9gC|year=1878|publisher=Wm. S. Hein Publishing|isbn=978-0-8377-2446-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z2d29DZj9gC&pg=PA313 313]}}</ref>

Objections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised, although it did occur during the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000 presidential election between Governor George W. Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. 

If there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.

After the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final state of the vote. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.

=== Contingencies ===
{{further|Contingent election}}

==== Contingent presidential election by House ====
The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).

In this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' — each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.

The House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.

==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====
If no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election – this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.

Additionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a "majority of the whole number" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L. Paige Whitaker and Thomas H. Neale, January 16, 2001|publisher=Ncseonline.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> Further, the language requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting vice president from breaking any tie that might occur,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Longley|first1=Lawrence D.|last2=Pierce|first2=Neal R.|title=The Electoral College Primer 2000|place=New Haven, CT|journal=Yale University Press|year=1999|page=13}}</ref> although some academics and journalists have speculated to the contrary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/storm.htm|work=USA Today|title=Election evolves into 'perfect' electoral storm|date=December 12, 2000|accessdate=June 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515165111/http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/storm.htm|archivedate=May 15, 2006}}</ref>

The only time the Senate chose the vice president was in [[1836 United States presidential election#1837 contingent election|1837]]. In that instance, the Senate adopted an alphabetical [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll call]] and voting aloud. The rules further stated, "[I]f a majority of the number of senators shall vote for either the said [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] or [[Francis Granger]], he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States"; the Senate chose Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsj&fileName=026/llsj026.db&recNum=228&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A@field%28DOCID%2B@lit%28sj0262%29%29%3A%230260003&linkText=1|title=Senate Journal from 1837|publisher=Memory.loc.gov|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

==== Deadlocked election ====
Section 3 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] specifies if the House of Representatives has not chosen a ''president-elect'' in time for the inauguration (noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on January 20), then the ''vice president-elect'' becomes [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]] until the House selects a president. Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president. Neither of these situations has ever occurred.

   NOTE REGARDING SORTING FOR 1864–68 ELECTIONS
   The southern states are shown as an explicit '0' between secession and restoration of representation in Congress.
   In order to sort these separately from the {{not polled}} states not yet admitted, an explicit sort key is used.
   This apparently disrupts the automatic recognition of numeric sorting.
   This is fixed by adding a hidden leading zero in the sort key for single-digit entries in 1864.
   No sort key is needed for double-digit entries.
   I would expect the same problem to occur in 1868 when three states are not yet restored.
   However, it does not seem to be necessary, probably because Alabama (first in alpha order) was already restored.
   It seems possible that this fix may not work on all browsers.
   If further problems are noted, ping me on the talk page and I'll have another look at it.

Before the advent of the "short ballot" in the early 20th century (as described in [[United States Electoral College#Selection process|Selection process]]) the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the ''general ticket''. The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered [[at-large]] or [[winner-takes-all voting]]. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.

The question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected "in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct" and wrote these words "operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: "[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it."<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v. Gore'', (Justice Stevens dissenting)] (quote in second paragraph)</ref> Extensive research on alternate methods of electoral allocation have been conducted by Collin Welke, Dylan Shearer, and Riley Wagie in 2019.
=== Appointment by state legislature ===
In the earliest presidential elections, state legislative choice was the most common method of choosing electors.

Excluding South Carolina, legislative appointment was used in only four situations after 1832:
* In 1848, [[Massachusetts]] statute awarded the state's electoral votes to the winner of the at-large popular vote, but only if that candidate won an absolute majority. When the vote produced no winner between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] parties, the state legislature selected the electors, giving all 12 electoral votes to the Whigs (which had won the plurality of votes in the state).<ref name="CongQrt">{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=266}}</ref>
* In 1864, [[Nevada]], having joined the Union only a few days prior to Election Day, had no choice but to legislatively appoint.<ref name="CongQrt" />
* In 1868, the newly reconstructed state of [[Florida]] legislatively appointed its electors, having been readmitted too late to hold elections.<ref name="CongQrt" />
* Finally, in 1876, the legislature of the newly admitted state of [[Colorado]] used legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to hold a popular election.<ref name="CongQrt" />
Legislative appointment was brandished as a possibility in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]]. Had the recount continued, the Florida legislature was prepared to appoint the Republican slate of electors to avoid missing the federal safe-harbor deadline for choosing electors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/july-dec00/session_11-30.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124044300/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/july-dec00/session_11-30.html|archivedate=2001-01-24|title=Legislative Action?, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, November 30, 2000|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

The Constitution gives each state legislature the power to decide how its state's electors are chosen<ref name="CongPres" /> and it can be easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: [[bicameral]] legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=254}}</ref>

=== Electoral districts ===
Another method used early in U.S. history was to divide the state into [[electoral district]]s. By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated into congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].

=== Congressional district method ===
There are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another was used in New York in 1828 and proposed for use in Virginia. Under the implemented method, one electoral vote goes per the plurality of the popular votes of each [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional district]] (for the [[U.S. House Of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]); and two per the statewide popular vote. This may result in greater proportionality. It has often acted as the other states, as in 1992, when [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with a clear plurality on 47% of the vote; in a truly proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

In 2013, the Virginia proposal was tabled. Like the other congressional district methods, this would have distributed the electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia's 11 congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional districts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-in-virginia-other-states-seeking-electoral-college-changes/2013/01/24/430096e6-6654-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|title=Republicans in Virginia, other states seeking electoral college changes|newspaper=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=January 24, 2013|first1=Nia-Malika|last1=Henderson|first2=Errin|last2=Haines|date=January 25, 2013}}</ref> A similar method was used in New York in 1828: the two at large electors were elected by the electors selected in districts.

A congressional district method is more likely to arise than other alternatives to the winner-takes-whole-state method, in view of the main two parties' resistance to scrap first-past-the-post.

== Contemporary issues ==
Arguments between proponents and opponents of the current electoral system include four separate but related topics: indirect election, disproportionate voting power by some states, the winner-takes-all distribution method (as chosen by 48 of the 50 states, and the District of Columbia), and federalism. Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion focus mostly on the allocation of the voting power among the states. Gary Bugh's research of congressional debates over proposed constitutional amendments to abolish the Electoral College reveals reform opponents have often appealed to a traditional republican version of representation, whereas reform advocates have tended to reference a more democratic view.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bugh|first1=Gary E.|year=2016|chapter=Representation in Congressional Efforts to Amend the Presidential Election System|chapterurl={{Google books|eJ4WDAAAQBAJ|page=5|plainurl=yes}}|editor1-first=Gary|editor1-last=Bugh|title=Electoral College Reform: Challenges and Possibilities|publisher=Routledge|pages=5–18|isbn=978-1-317-14527-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/11/02/opinion/20081102_OPCHART.html|title=Op-Chart: How Much Is Your Vote Worth?

The elections of [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive at least a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the nationwide [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]].<ref name="GeorgeEdwards" /> In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so it is uncertain what the national popular vote would have been if all presidential electors had been popularly elected.

Opponents of the Electoral College claim such outcomes do not logically follow the normative concept of how a democratic system should function. One view is the Electoral College violates the principle of political equality, since presidential elections are not decided by the one-person one-vote principle.<ref name="GeorgeEdwards" /> Outcomes of this sort are attributable to the federal nature of the system. Supporters of the Electoral College argue candidates must build a popular base that is geographically broader and more diverse in voter interests than either a simple national plurality or majority. Neither is this feature attributable to having intermediate elections of presidents, caused instead by the [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] method of allocating each state's slate of electors. Allocation of electors in proportion to the state's popular vote could reduce this effect.

Proponents of a national popular vote point out that the combined population of the 50 biggest cities (not including [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|metropolitan areas]]) amounts to only 15% of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/section.php?s=5|title=National Popular Vote – Electoral college reform by direct election of the President|last=Hernandez|first=Carlos Felipe|website=archive.nationalpopularvote.com|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018074322/http://archive.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/section.php?s=5|archive-date=October 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> They also assert that candidates in popular vote elections for governor and U.S. Senate, and for statewide allocation of electoral votes, do not ignore voters in less populated areas.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090805174259/http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/m7.php ''Myths about Big Cities and Big States''] by National Popular Vote (archived from [http://nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/m7.php the original] on 2009-08-05)</ref>{{better source|date=October 2018}} In addition, it is already possible to win the required 270 electoral votes by winning only the 11 most populous states; what currently prevents such a result is the organic political diversity between those states (three reliably Republican states, four swing states, and four reliably Democratic states), not any inherent quality of the Electoral College itself.<ref>{{Citation|last=CGP Grey|title=Re: The Trouble With The Electoral College – Cities, Metro Areas, Elections and The United States|date=2016-11-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wLQz-LgrM&t=1m27s|accessdate=2017-02-11}}</ref>

Elections where the winning candidate loses the national popular vote typically result when the winner builds the requisite configuration of states (and thus captures their electoral votes) by small margins, but the losing candidate secures large voter margins in the remaining states. In this case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would aggregate to a plurality of the ballots cast nationally. However, commentators point out that the national popular vote observed under the Electoral College system may not reflect the popular vote observed under a National Popular Vote system, as each electoral institution produces different incentives for, and strategy choices by, presidential campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/09/your-candidate-got-more-of-the-popular-vote-irrelevant/|title=Your candidate got more of the popular vote?

Conversely, the institutional structure of a national popular vote system would encourage candidates to pursue voter turnout wherever votes could be found, even in safe states they are already expected to win, and in safe states they have no hope of winning.

==== Exclusive focus on large swing states ====

Critics argue that the Electoral College is less democratic than a national direct popular vote and is subject to manipulation because of [[faithless electors]];<ref name="auto4"/><ref name="auto6"/> that the system is antithetical to a democracy that strives for a standard of "[[One man, one vote|one person, one vote]]";<ref name="auto8"/> and there can be elections where one candidate wins the national popular vote but another wins the electoral vote, as in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]s.<ref name="auto7"/>  Individual citizens in less populated states with 5% of the Electoral College have proportionately more voting power than those in more populous states,<ref name="auto9"/> and candidates can win by focusing their resources on just a few "[[swing state]]s".<ref name="auto5"/>

According to this criticism, the Electoral College encourages political campaigners to focus on a few so-called swing states while ignoring the rest of the country. Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while four out of five voters in the national election are "absolutely ignored", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered safe for a particular party — [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas — and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be safe for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C. Edwards III]] in 2011.<ref name="GeorgeEdwards">{{Cite book|last=Edwards III|first=George C.|authorlink=George C. Edwards III| title=Why the Electoral College is Bad for America|publisher=Yale University Press|edition=Second|year=2011|location=New Haven and London|pages=1, 37, 61, 176–77, 193–94|isbn=978-0-300-16649-1}}</ref> Edwards also asserted that in the 2008 election, the campaigns did not mount nationwide efforts but rather focused on select states.<ref name="GeorgeEdwards" />

==== Discouragement of turnout and participation ====
Except in closely fought swing states, voter turnout does not affect the election results due to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage a political party or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in those swing states.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite journal|last=Nivola|first=Pietro|title=Thinking About Political Polarization|publisher=Brookings Institution Policy Brief|date=January 2005|url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2005/01politics_nivola.aspx|issue=139|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820060557/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2005/01politics_nivola.aspx|archivedate=August 20, 2008}}</ref> If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Koza|first=John|title=Every Vote Equal: A State-Based Plan for Electing the President by National Popular Vote|year=2006|page=xvii|url=http://www.every-vote-equal.com/files/Every-Vote-Equal.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113010411/http://www.every-vote-equal.com/files/Every-Vote-Equal.pdf|archivedate=2006-11-13|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors to turn out to vote. The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==== Obscuring disenfranchisement within states ====
According to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems ''within'' a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.

Legal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name="amar">{{Cite journal|last1=Amar|first1=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

{{quote|The founders' system also encouraged the continued disfranchisement of women. In a direct national election system, any state that gave women the vote would automatically have doubled its national clout. Under the Electoral College, however, a state had no such incentive to increase the franchise; as with slaves, what mattered was how many women lived in a state, not how many were empowered{{nbsp}}... a state with low voter turnout gets precisely the same number of electoral votes as if it had a high turnout. By contrast, a well-designed direct election system could spur states to get out the vote.<ref name="amar"/>}}

==== Lack of enfranchisement of U.S. territories ====
{{see also|Voting rights in the United States#Overseas and nonresident citizens}}

[[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not entitled to electors in presidential elections. Constitutionally, only U.S. states (per [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]]) and [[Washington, D.C.]] (per the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]]) are entitled to electors.

==== Advantage based on state population ====
Researchers have variously attempted to measure which states' voters have the greatest impact in such an indirect election.

Each state gets a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of population, which gives low-population states a disproportionate number of electors per capita.<ref name=":0" /> For example, an electoral vote represents nearly four times as many people in California as in Wyoming.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Miroff|first1=Bruce|last2=Seidelman|first2=Raymond|last3=Swanstrom|first3=Todd|title=The Democratic Debate: An Introduction to American Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/democraticdebate00miro|url-access=registration|date=November 2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=0-618-05452-9|edition=Third}}<!--|accessdate=6 October 2015--></ref> Sparsely populated states are likely to be increasingly overrepresented in the electoral college over time, because Americans are increasingly moving to big cities and because cities are growing especially in the biggest states.<ref name=":0" /> This analysis gives a strong advantage to the smallest states, but ignores any extra influence that comes from larger states' ability to deliver their votes as a single bloc.

Countervailing analyses which do take into consideration the sizes of the electoral voting blocs, such as the [[Banzhaf power index]] (BPI) model based on [[probability theory]] lead to very different conclusions about voters' relative power.{{Clarify|date=November 2016}} In 1968, [[John F. Banzhaf III]] (who developed the Banzhaf power index) determined that a voter in the state of New York had, on average, 3.312 times as much voting power in presidential elections as a voter in any other U.S. state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Banzhaf|first=John|date=1968|title=One Man, 3.312 Votes: A Mathematical Analysis of the Electoral College|url=http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1780&context=vlr|journal=Villanova Law Review|volume=13}}</ref> It was found that based on 1990 census and districting, individual voters in California, the largest state, had 3.3 times more individual power to choose a president than voters of Montana, the largest of the states allocating the minimum of three electors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/~livingst/Banzhaf/|title=Banzhaf Power Index|author=Mark Livingston, Department of Computer Science|publisher=University of North Carolina}}</ref> Because Banzhaf's method ignores the demographic makeup of the states, it has been criticized for treating votes like independent coin-flips.

==== Disadvantage for third parties ====

In practice, the winner-take-all manner of allocating a state's electors generally decreases the importance of minor parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109153753/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 9, 2009|title=Third Parties?|author=Jerry Fresia|date=February 28, 2006|publisher=Zmag.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> However, it has been argued{{who|date=March 2020}} that the Electoral College is not a cause of the two-party system, and that it had a tendency to improve the chances of third-party candidates in some situations.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Schmidt, Steffen W.|authorlink1=Steffen Schmidt|author2=Shelley, Mack C.|author3=Bardes, Barbara A|title=American Government and Politics Today 2008–2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|year=2008

=== Support ===
==== Maintenance of the nation's federal character ====
[[File:50 of the U S population lives in 143 counties based on 2019 American Community Survey - Copy.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Half the U.S. population lives in 143 {{nowrap|urban{{\}}suburban}} counties out of [[List of United States counties and county equivalents|3,143 counties or county equivalents]] (2019 American Community Survey)]]

The United States of America is a [[federal republic]] that consists of component states. Proponents of the current system argue the collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater than that given to a small, though numerically equivalent, portion of a very populous state. The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.

For many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]] (1830s), many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government, to the detriment of the States.<ref name="FEC">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010112063831/http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|archivedate=October 11, 2001|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>

In his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to "mend it, don't end it," in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of states in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref>

==== Criticality of the preference of minority groups in close states====
Instead of decreasing the power of [[minority group]]s by depressing voter turnout, proponents argue that by making the votes of a given state an all-or-nothing affair, minority groups provide the critical edge that allows a candidate to win a close-battle state. This encourages candidates there to court a wide variety of such minorities and [[advocacy group]]s.<ref name="FEC" />

==== Encouragement of stability through the two-party system ====
{{main|Two party system}}

Proponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] as beneficial. They argue that the two party system has provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections]. FairVote.org (2010-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref>

==== Flexibility if a presidential candidate dies ====
According to this argument, the fact the Electoral College is made up of real people instead of mere numbers allows for human judgment and flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled around the time of the election, though state laws binding electors and the lack of a single assembly of electors complicate coordination of a unified selection. 

Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public: according to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots<ref>Note: this may be a few days or even weeks before an election; many states cannot change ballots at a late stage.</ref> until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots.<ref>Note: the day when the electors cast their votes is the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.</ref>

In the [[1872 United States presidential election|election of 1872]], defeated [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] candidate [[Horace Greeley]] died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], who also supported Greeley, but 63 of the 66 the Greeley electors split their votes for four alternate candidates.<ref>Note: three electoral votes which were still cast for Greeley, despite him being dead, were rejected.</ref><ref name="tws2H11">{{cite news|author=Ethan Trex|title=Electoral College for dummies|publisher=CNN|quote=...{{nbsp}}In 1872, though, Democrat Horace Greeley died just over three weeks after Ulysses S.

==== Isolation of election problems ====
Some supporters of the Electoral College note that it isolates the impact of any election fraud, or other such problems, to the state where it occurs. It prevents instances where a party dominant in one state may dishonestly inflate the votes for a candidate and thereby affect the election outcome. For instance, recounts occur only on a state-by-state basis, not nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|last=Darlington|first=Richard B.|url=http://www.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/electorl.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303014609/http://www.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/electorl.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2000|title=The Electoral College: Bulwark Against Fraud|publisher=Cornell University Department of Psychology|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> However, results in a single state where the popular vote is very close—such as Florida in 2000—can decide the national election.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/m3.php | title=Myths about Recounts | website=NationalPopularVote.com | publisher=National Popular Vote Inc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108045037/http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/answers/m3.php | archive-date=November 8, 2008}}</ref>

== Efforts to abolish or reform ==
{{main|Efforts to reform the United States Electoral College}}

Since 1800, over 700 proposals to reform or eliminate the system have been introduced in Congress. Proponents of these proposals argued that the electoral college system does not provide for direct democratic election, affords less-populous states an advantage, and allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the most votes. None of these proposals have received the approval of two-thirds of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and three-fourths of the [[U.S. state|states]] required to amend the Constitution.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43823.pdf |title=The National Popular Vote (NPV) Initiative: Direct Election of the President by Interstate Compact |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=2019-10-28 |last1=Neale |first1=Thomas H. |last2=Nolan |first2=Andrew |accessdate=2020-11-08}}</ref>

=== Bayh–Celler amendment ===
The closest the United States has come to abolishing the Electoral College occurred during the [[91st United States Congress|91st Congress]] (1969–1971).<ref>For a more detailed account of this proposal read ''The Politics of Electoral College Reform'' by Lawrence D. Longley and Alan G. Braun (1972)</ref> The [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1968]] resulted in [[Richard Nixon]] receiving 301 electoral votes (56% of electors), [[Hubert Humphrey]] 191 (35.5%), and [[George Wallace]] 46 (8.5%) with 13.5% of the popular vote. However, Nixon had received only 511,944 more popular votes than Humphrey, 43.5% to 42.9%, less than 1% of the national total.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1968 ''1968 Electoral College Results''], National Archives and Records Administration</ref>

Representative [[Emanuel Celler]] (D–New York), chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], responded to public concerns over the disparity between the popular vote and electoral vote by introducing House Joint Resolution 681, a proposed Constitutional amendment that would have replaced the Electoral College with a simpler plurality system based on the national popular vote. With this system, the pair of candidates (running for president and vice-president) who had received the highest number of votes would win the presidency and vice presidency provided they won at least 40% of the national popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Text of Proposed Amendment on Voting|work=The New York Times|date=April 30, 1969|page=21}}</ref>

On April 29, 1969, the House Judiciary Committee voted 28 to{{nbsp}}6 to approve the proposal.<ref>{{cite news|title=House Unit Votes To Drop Electors|work=The New York Times|date=April 30, 1969|page=1}}</ref> Debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives ended on September 11, 1969<ref>{{cite news|title=Direct Election of President Is Gaining in the House|work=The New York Times|date=September 12, 1969|page=12}}</ref> and was eventually passed with bipartisan support on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339 to 70.<ref>{{cite news|title=House Approves Direct Election of The President|work=The New York Times|date=September 19, 1969|page=1}}</ref>

On October 8, 1969, the ''New York Times'' reported that 30 state legislatures were "either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embodying the direct election plan if it passes its final Congressional test in the Senate." Ratification of 38 state legislatures would have been needed for adoption. The paper also reported that six other states had yet to state a preference, six were leaning toward opposition, and eight were solidly opposed.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Survey Finds 30 Legislatures Favor Direct Vote For President|work=The New York Times|date=October 8, 1969|page=1}}</ref>

On August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report advocating passage of the proposal to the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee had approved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6. The six members who opposed the plan, Democratic senators [[James Eastland]] of Mississippi, [[John Little McClellan]] of Arkansas, and [[Sam Ervin]] of North Carolina, along with Republican senators [[Roman Hruska]] of Nebraska, [[Hiram Fong]] of Hawaii, and [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina, all argued that although the present system had potential loopholes, it had worked well throughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the full Senate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senate Unit Asks Popular Election of the President|work=The New York Times|date=April 24, 1970|page=1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/24/archives/senate-unit-asks-popular-election-of-the-president-amendment-to.html|first=Warren|last=Weaver}}</ref> He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided Republican senators to support the proposal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bayh Calls for Nixon's Support As Senate Gets Electoral Plan|work=The New York Times|date=August 15, 1970|page=11}}</ref> However, Nixon, while not reneging on his previous endorsement, chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the proposal.<ref name="NYT-9-18-70">{{cite news|title=Senate Refuses To Halt Debate On Direct Voting|work=The New York Times|date=September 18, 1970|page=1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/18/archives/senate-refuses-to-halt-debate-on-direct-voting-plan-for-popular.html|first=Warren|last=Weaver}}</ref>

On September 8, 1970, the Senate commenced openly debating the proposal,<ref>{{cite news|title=Senate Debating Direct Election|work=The New York Times|date=September 9, 1970|page=10}}</ref> and the proposal was quickly [[Filibuster#United States|filibustered]]. The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern senators and conservatives from small states, both Democrats and Republicans, who argued that abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states' political influence.<ref name="NYT-9-18-70" /> On September 17, 1970, a motion for [[cloture]], which would have ended the filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for cloture,<ref name="NYT-9-18-70" /> failing to receive the then-required two-thirds majority of senators voting.<ref>The Senate in 1975 reduced the required vote for cloture from two-thirds of those voting (67 votes) to three-fifths (60 votes). ''See'' [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm United States Senate website.]</ref> A second motion for cloture on September 29, 1970, also failed, by 53 to 34. Thereafter, the Senate majority leader, [[Mike Mansfield]] of Montana, moved to lay the proposal aside so the Senate could attend to other business.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senate Puts Off Direct Vote Plan|work=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1970|page=1}}</ref> However, the proposal was never considered again and died when the 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971.

=== Carter proposal ===
On March 22, 1977, President Jimmy Carter wrote a letter of reform to Congress that also included his expression of abolishing the Electoral College. The letter read in part:{{quote|My fourth recommendation is that the Congress adopt a Constitutional amendment to provide for direct popular election of the President. Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment. I prefer to allow the Congress to proceed with its work without the interruption of a new proposal.<ref>''[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7218. Jimmy Carter Letter to Congress]'', Jimmy Carter: "Election reform Message to the Congress", Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, ''The American Presidency Project.''</ref>}}

President Carter's proposed program for the reform of the Electoral College was very liberal for a modern president during this time, and in some aspects of the package, it went beyond original expectations.<ref name=CarterNYTimes77>"Carter Proposes End Of Electoral College In Presidential Votes", ''The New York Times'', March 23, 1977, Pages 1, 18.</ref>
Newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw President Carter's proposal at that time as "a modest surprise" because of the indication of Carter that he would be interested in only eliminating the electors but retaining the electoral vote system in a modified form.<ref name="CarterNYTimes77"/>

Newspaper reaction to Carter's proposal ranged from some editorials praising the proposal to other editorials, like that in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', criticizing the president for proposing the end of the Electoral College.<ref>"Carter v. The Electoral College", ''Chicago Tribune'', March 24, 1977, Section 3, Page 2</ref>

In a letter to ''The New York Times'', Representative [[Jonathan B. Bingham]] (D-New York) highlighted the danger of the "flawed, outdated mechanism of the Electoral College" by underscoring how a shift of fewer than 10,000 votes in two key states would have led to President Gerald Ford winning the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]] despite Jimmy Carter's nationwide 1.7 million-vote margin.<ref>{{cite news| title=Letters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/15/archives/letters-to-reform-our-presidential-election-system-the-cabs.html|accessdate=18 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=15 March 1979}}</ref>

=== Current proposals to abolish ===
Since January 3, 2019, [[joint resolution]]s have been made proposing constitutional amendments that would replace the Electoral College with the popular election of the president and vice president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wreg.com/2017/01/05/cohen-proposes-elimination-of-electoral-college/|title=Rep.

=== National Popular Vote Interstate Compact ===
{{main|National Popular Vote Interstate Compact}}

As of July 2020, fifteen states plus the District of Columbia have joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.<ref name=ssn>{{cite web|url=https://windermeresun.com/2020/07/09/what-is-national-popular-vote-bill-national-popular-vote-interstate-compact-why-is-it-important/|title=What Is National Popular Vote Bill/National Popular Vote Interstate Compact & Why Is It Important|author=Susan Sun Numamaker|date=July 9, 2020|website=Windemere Sun|accessdate=July 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/sites/default/files/eve-4th-ed-ch6-web-v1.pdf#page=5|title=Text of the compact|publisher=National Popular Vote}}</ref> Those joining the [[Interstate compact|compact]] will, acting together [[Coming into force|if and when]] reflecting a majority of electors (at least 270), pledge their electors to the winner of the national [[Direct election|popular vote]]. The compact applies [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution, which gives each state legislature the [[plenary power]] to determine how it chooses electors.

Some scholars have suggested that [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10, Clause 3]] of the Constitution requires [[United States Congress|congressional]] consent before the compact could be enforceable;<ref>Neale, Thomas H. [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/132240.pdf Electoral College Reform] Congressional Research Service pp. 21–22, viewed November 23, 2014.</ref> thus, any attempted implementation of the compact without congressional consent could face court challenges to its constitutionality. Others have suggested that the compact's legality was strengthened by ''[[Chiafalo v. Washington]]'', in which the Supreme Court upheld the power of states to enforce electors' pledges.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fadem |first1=Barry |title=Supreme Court's "faithless electors" decision validates case for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/14/supreme-courts-faithless-electors-decision-validates-case-for-the-national-popular-vote-interstate-compact/ |publisher=Brookings Institution |accessdate=August 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717034751/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/14/supreme-courts-faithless-electors-decision-validates-case-for-the-national-popular-vote-interstate-compact/ |archivedate=July 14, 2020 |date=July 14, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Litt |first1=David |title=The Supreme Court Just Pointed Out the Absurdity of the Electoral College.

This means that if states that combine to hold a majority of electoral votes all agree to support the popular-vote winner, they can do an end-run around the Electoral College. America would still have its clumsy two-step process for presidential elections. But the people’s choice and the electors’ choice would be guaranteed to match up every time.}}</ref>

Electors of the sixteen adherents of the compact number 196, which is 73% of the 270 required for it to take effect, or be considered justiciable.<ref name=ssn/>
