'''Marc Bouwer''' is a [[fashion designer]] who was raised in [[South Africa]] and now works in [[New York City]].

==Career==
Upon winning the South African Vogue Young Designers Award, Marc Bouwer moved to [[New York City]].  Shortly after, Bouwer's portfolio was noticed by designer [[Halston]]. Bouwer apprenticed with Halston fine tuning his design skills, particularly draping.  Bouwer's "cut" and modern use of stretch fabrics, such as [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]] and [[spandex]], in [[evening gown|evening wear]] coined the term "bathing suit gown" and gave way to "athletic glamour".<ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bouwer Biography|url=http://www.marcbouwer.com/biography/biography.swf|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>  Opening house in 1990 with business partner, Paul Margolin, Marc Bouwer Couture has since graced the covers and pages of publications including [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], [[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]], and [[InStyle]]. Actress [[Angelina Jolie]] arrived at the 2004 Academy Awards in a [[White Marc Bouwer dress of Angelina Jolie|white satin Marc Bouwer gown]], later named one of the best Oscar dresses of all time by [[André Leon Talley]].<ref>http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/andre-leon-talley-on-the-best-oscars-dresses-of-all-time/#1</ref> In February 2012, [[Patti Stanger]] was one of a group of celebrities that walked down a [[catwalk]] in various red dresses for the 'Heart Truth Red Dress Collection show, part of [[New York Fashion Week]]. Patti wore a size 2 Marc Bouwer red dress.<ref name=reddress>{{cite web|url=http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/stars-hit-runway-heart-health?page=10|title=Stars Hit the Runway for Heart Health|date=10 February 2012|publisher=Shape.com|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>  Most recently Bouwer helped in reintroducing us to loyal client and friend, [[Shania Twain]], designing the costumes for her Still The One Tour which opened December 1, 2012 at [[Caesars Palace]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|title=The Man Behind Shania Twain's Vegas Look|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/11/30/the-man-behind-shanias-vegas-look|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=30 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Billboard|first=Staff|title=Shania Twain Kicks Off Vegas Run With First Show in 8 Years|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/473910/shania-twain-kicks-off-vegas-run-with-first-show-in-8-years<|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=Billboard Magazine|date=2 December 2012}}</ref>

Bouwer was the first American designer to produce a virtual fashion show in response to economic struggle across the globe as well as in respect to the environment. As opposed to bringing us to [[Bryant Park]], Bouwer took us, and his inaugural Spring/Summer 2009 collection, to the web.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marc Bouwer Spring 2009 New York Fashion Week|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topic/person/marc-bouwer-fashion-show-marc-bouwer-spring-2009-new-york-fashion-week-video-8nIVkix4U7g-42057-5.html|publisher=Firstpost.com|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>  Not only did this new medium of fashion allow friends and clients to experience the collection if unable to physically attend a show, but it also opened the experience into the offices and homes of stylists, buyers, journalists, and fashionistas everywhere.  Bouwer felt it was his "social and environmental responsibility" to pave way to such a movement "minimizing impact and waste".<ref>http://marcbouwer.com/Spring2009/press/download/MarcBouwerS09PressRelease.pdf</ref>  Bouwer virtually presented his Fall 2010 collection, starring [[Candice Swanepoel]], before taking the experience one step further.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwXO7g4-gp0</ref>  In February 2011 Bouwer was the first designer to present a virtual 3D fashion show with his Fall 2011 collection starring model [[Selita Ebanks]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rubaum-Keller|first=Irene|title=Marc Bouwer: The First Ever 3D Fashion Show at Fashion Week|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/irene-rubaumkeller-/marc-bouwer-the-first-eve_b_819883.html|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=12 January 2013|date=8 February 2011}}</ref>

==Awards==
Bouwer's awards for avoiding [[animal products]] in his fashions include a PETA Humanitarian Award, and The [[United States Humane Society|United States Humane Societies]] “Compassion in Fashion Award”.
