The '''2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute''' was a pricing dispute between [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] that occurred when Russian [[natural gas]] company [[Gazprom]] refused to conclude a supply contract for 2009 unless Ukrainian gas company [[Naftogaz]] paid its accumulating debts for previous gas supplies.<ref name=upstream241208/> The dispute began in 2008 with a series of failed negotiations, and on January 1 Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.<ref name="Russia to cut Ukraine gas supply"/> On January 7 the dispute turned to crisis when all Russian gas flows through Ukraine were halted for 13 days, completely cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, most of which depends on Russian gas, and partially to other European countries.<ref name="ox">[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG27-TheRussoUkrainianGasDisputeofJanuary2009AComprehensiveAssessment-JonathanSternSimonPiraniKatjaYafimava-2009.pdf The Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute of January 2009: a comprehensive assessment] [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], Retrieved on 19 June 2012</ref> <!-- was: http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf -->

Throughout the crisis the Russian and Ukrainian sides blamed each other for the cutoff. On January 11 and 12, the [[European Union]] deployed an independent monitoring mission in an attempt to solve the crisis, but the mission met with little success. On January 12, Gazprom announced that it was willing to start delivering gas through the [[Sudzha]] metering station into the pipeline that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer for technical reasons and instead suggested an alternative route through [[Valuyki]] and Pisarevka metering stations, additionally insisting that supplies be fully restored. This was refused by Gazprom.<ref name="ox"/><ref name=interfax20090114a>{{Cite news|title=Naftogaz offers different transit route to Gazprom – source in Naftogaz |publisher=Interfax-Ukraine |date=January 14, 2009 |url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/5017/ |accessdate=January 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061248/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/5017/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}</ref>

On January 18 the dispute was resolved when [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] and his [[Ukrainian Prime Minister|Ukrainian counterpart]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] negotiated a new contract that covered the next ten years (on October 11, 2011, a Ukrainian court [[Yulia_Tymoshenko#2011_trial_and_imprisonment_and_other_criminal_cases_against_Tymoshenko|sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in prison]] for [[abuse of office]] because she signed this deal<ref name=BBCOct2011/>).

There is no consensus amongst analysts on who bore the most responsibility for the crisis. Due to the absence of international monitors on both sides of the [[Natural gas transmission system of Ukraine|Ukrainian pipeline system]], it is impossible to determine with certainty who was responsible for interrupting gas flow to Europe.<ref name="ox"/>

==Background==
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 21 July 2008-3.jpg|thumb|250px|President Medvedev meets with Gazprom CEO [[Alexei Miller]] in his office in the Kremlin (July 21, 2008)]]
Throughout 2008 there were numerous contract and pricing disputes between Russian and Ukrainian gas/transit companies. In October 2008, [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] and [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a deal that included provisions to raise import prices and transit [[tariff]]s to "market, economically based and mutually agreed levels" within three years, and that Naftogaz would buy gas directly from Gazprom and be the sole importer to Ukraine, removing [[intermediaries]]. In November, Gazprom and Naftogaz signed a long-term contract with similar provisions; however, this document differed in that it referred to transit fees remaining at their 2008 level and didn't specify an import price.<ref name="ox"/><ref name=unian241008>{{Cite news| title = Gazprom, Naftogaz sign long-term cooperation deal| publisher=UNIAN| date =October 24, 2008| url= http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-280400.html| accessdate =December 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119112006/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-280400.html| archivedate=January 19, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In the third week of November, Gazprom CEO Miller announced that if no agreement was reached by the end of the year, prices could rise significantly higher than what was currently being proposed. A few days later Prime Minister Putin warned that if there was any interference with transit gas, supplies to Ukraine would be cut off. These warnings were repeated throughout December, with additional warnings that disruptions to European supplies could result. The [[European Commission]] did not attempt to intervene, but the Energy Charter Secretariat issued a statement on December 23 which recalled the principle of uninterrupted transit. This was seen as a reminder to Ukraine of its obligations under the [[Energy Charter Treaty]], which it has signed and, unlike Russia, ratified.<ref name="ox"/>

Large amounts of debt remained outstanding by year's end. Naftogaz CEO Vladimir Trykolych said that Naftogaz owed $1.26–1.27&nbsp;billion to [[RosUkrEnergo]] in total, but claimed that Naftogaz had no debt to Gazprom.<ref name=unian211108>{{Cite news| title = Ukraine has no gas debt to Russia – Tymoshenko| publisher=UNIAN| date =November 21, 2008| url= http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-285883.html| accessdate =December 17, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119215935/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-285883.html| archivedate=January 19, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, on December 2, Naftogaz acknowledged that it owed $1&nbsp;billion to Gazprom, and said it was having trouble making payments on time due to unexpected losses in 2008. Later in mid-December, Gazprom stated that a debt of $2.195&nbsp;billion had accumulated. In response, Naftogaz made a payment of $800&nbsp;million, and promised to pay another $200&nbsp;million soon. Gazprom proposed to make an upfront transit payment at the 2008 rate in order to provide funds for the debt to be cleared, but Naftogaz rejected the offer.

On December 19, Gazprom released a statement saying that no supply contract could be signed for 2009 because Ukraine said it would not make any more payments in 2008. This was denied by a Naftogaz spokesman. On the same day, [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]]'s spokesman on international energy security stated that Ukraine had paid for its October and September supplies, and that although it still had to pay for November's supply before the end of 2008, no other payments would be due until the end of January.<ref name="ox"/> On December 23, President Yushchenko said that part of the debt was restructured for January – February 2009, but Gazprom denied that there was any such agreement and said that it remained committed to cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 if Ukraine did not pay its remaining $1.67&nbsp;billion debt for gas supplies and an additional $450&nbsp;million in fines.<ref name=upstream241208>{{Cite news| title = Kiev told to pay up or gas is off| newspaper=[[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]]

Along with the payment, the chief executive of Naftogaz, [[Oleh Dubyna]], wrote a letter to Gazprom threatening that if it delivered gas for transit to Europe, Naftogaz would consider the gas to belong to an "unidentified owner" and could [[confiscate]] it under [[Law of Ukraine|Ukrainian customs law]]. This was received as a threat to divert gas as Ukraine had done during the [[Russia–Ukraine gas dispute of 2005–2006|2006 gas dispute]].<ref name="ox"/>

On December 31, after which gas supplies to Ukraine would be cut off, the two parties failed to come to an agreement on import and transit prices, and obstacles remained. Naftogaz promised to transit gas to Europe even if supplies to Ukraine were cut, however, it added that without a contract in place it would not supply [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute#Technical gas and accusations of stealing|technical gas]] and would instead take gas from Russia's volumes to keep the system functioning. Gazprom refused, arguing that this would be theft.<ref name="sim">Simon Pirani, Oxford, [https://archive.is/20130101083613/http://www.res.ethz.ch/analysis/rad/details.cfm?lng=en&id=95596 The Russian-Ukrainian Gas Conflict] ''page 3'' Retrieved on October 16, 2009</ref>

===Gas supplies to Europe cut off===

On January 5, in a televised conversation between Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] and Gazprom CEO [[Alexei Miller]], Putin agreed with a proposal by Miller to reduce gas flows to Europe via Ukraine. Putin elaborated that the gas flow should be reduced by the amount Ukraine had [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute#Technical gas and accusations of stealing|allegedly stolen]] since deliveries ended on January 1, and instructed Miller to inform Gazprom's European partners.<ref name="Russia to cut Ukraine gas supply">{{cite news| title = Russia to cut Ukraine gas supply |work=BBC News | date =January 5, 2009| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7812368.stm| accessdate =January 5, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090117130639/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7812368.stm| archivedate=January 17, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="ox3">[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf The Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute of January 2009: a comprehensive assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116184545/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf |date=November 16, 2009 }} [[Oxford university|Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], ''section 3'', Retrieved on October 13, 2009</ref>

On January 6, Gazprom deputy CEO [[Aleksandr Medvedev]] stated at press conferences in both London and Berlin that Ukraine had blocked three of the four transit lines "in an unprecedented and unilateral move". Naftogaz denied the accusation and said it had used its own gas for technical purposes. [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Yushchenko]] stated that during the course of the day Gazprom had sharply cut supplies to Europe via Ukraine from 262 mmcm to 73.6 mmcm. Later a Gazprom spokesman stated that Gazprom had only put 64.7 mmcm into the system, and that it was expecting Ukraine to make up the remaining 65.3 mmcm needed to make the total order of 130 mmcm.<ref name="ox3"/> In a telegram sent to the leadership of the European Union and heads of European states that consume Russian natural gas, President Yushchenko said "Ukraine consumes only the gas it produces itself and gas pumped into Ukrainian storage facilities, which has been paid for in full".

On January 7, all Russian gas flow through Ukraine was halted, completely cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, much of which is completely reliant on Russian gas, and partially to other parts of Europe.

On January 10, the EU continued talks with Russia to finalize details of the written protocol. After several hours of negotiations, [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Mirek Topolánek]] and Prime Minister Putin reached an agreement on conditions for the monitoring arrangement. [[European Commissioner]] [[Andris Piebalgs]] confirmed that he was also ready to sign the agreement, which left only Ukraine's signature needed in order to start the monitoring operation.<ref name=precidency100109b>{{Cite news| title = Topolánek and Putin have agreed on gas supply monitoring| publisher = The Czech Presidency of the EU Council| date = January 10, 2009| url = http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/premier-ceske-republiky-a-predseda-evropske-rady-mirek-topolanek--5601/| accessdate = January 10, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716060457/http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/premier-ceske-republiky-a-predseda-evropske-rady-mirek-topolanek--5601/| archive-date = July 16, 2011| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

On January 11, Topolánek flew to Kyiv where he presented the agreement to Ukrainian representatives, and Ukraine signed the protocol. However, Prime Minister Tymoshenko added the handwritten words "with declaration attached" next to her signature.<ref name="oxeu"/> The added declaration included, among other things, a clause asserting that Ukraine did not steal gas earmarked for Europe, a demand that Russia must provide Ukraine with 21 mmcm of technical gas daily, free of charge, and that Ukraine had no outstanding debts to Gazprom,<ref>{{cite news| title = FACTBOX-Russia rejects Kiev additions to gas monitoring deal| work=Reuters| date =January 11, 2009| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSLB9094820090111?sp=true| accessdate = January 11, 2009}}</ref>  effectively blaming the Russian side for the crisis.

===Attempts to restore gas supplies===
Although international monitors had been deployed, it became clear by the next day that they would have nothing to monitor, as mutual accusations between Russia and Ukraine over who was responsible for blocking gas flow continued. The Russian side claimed that its attempts to restore gas flow were still being blocked, while the Ukrainian side argued that no supplies could be received because no technical agreement had been reached between the parties.<ref name=telegraph150109>{{cite news| title = Ukraine blocks gas after Russia turns taps on| author=Bruno Waterfield| newspaper=Telegraph| date =January 15, 2009| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/4227364/Ukraine-blocks-gas-after-Russia-turns-taps-on.html| accessdate = February 23, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323191121/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/4227364/Ukraine-blocks-gas-after-Russia-turns-taps-on.html| archivedate=March 23, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Naftogaz sent a letter to Gazprom CEO [[Alexei Miller]] arguing that Gazprom was not only responsible for supplying technical gas, but also additional linepack gas of {{convert|140|e6m3|abbr=off}} in order to restart the system.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf The Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute of January 2009: a comprehensive assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116184545/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf |date=November 16, 2009 }} [[Oxford university|Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], ''Section 3'', Retrieved on October 13, 2009</ref>

On January 12, Gazprom announced that it was ready to start delivering gas through the [[Sudzha]] metering station that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer, claiming this would have left its eastern regions of [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]], [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] and portions of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]] starved of gas.<ref>

It insisted that deliveries be fully restored because the system had been partially reconfigured to work in reverse in order to supply consumers in eastern Ukraine with backup supplies, and European transit pipelines were working in such a way that they were unable to accept Russian gas for transit to Europe without cutting off those eastern regions.<ref name="ox3"/>  Naftogaz added that a resumption of transit would require conclusion of a technical agreement.

===Crisis resolved===
{{Further|2010 Kharkiv Pact}}
On January 18, after a day of talks, Putin and Tymoshenko reached a deal on restoring gas supplies to both Europe and Ukraine. The parties agreed, among other things, that Ukraine would get a 20% discount for 2009 gas supplies on condition that the tariff for transporting Russian gas to European consumers through Ukraine remained at 2008 prices for the duration of the year, and that starting on January 1, 2010, all prices and tariffs would move to European standards, without any exemptions or discounts.<ref name=BBC180109A>{{cite news| title = 'Gas to flow' after Moscow deal|work=BBC News | date =January 18, 2009| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7834796.stm| accessdate = January 18, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090117202237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7834796.stm| archivedate=January 17, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The two sides also agreed to stop using [[intermediaries]], referring to [[RosUkrEnergo]], a company joint owned by Gazprom and two Ukrainian businessmen.<ref name=reuters180109A>{{cite news | title = EU wary as Russia and Ukraine reach gas deal| work=Reuters| date =January 18, 2009| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5062Q520090118?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0| accessdate = January 18, 2009}}</ref>  The next day, the head of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, along with the head of Naftogaz, Oleh Dubyna, signed the agreement, and Putin announced that he had ordered Gazprom to start deliveries in full volume and through all necessary routes.<ref name=Reuters190109A>{{cite news | title = Russia and Ukraine sign 10-year gas supply deal| author=Oleg Shchedrov| author2=Ron Popeski| work=Reuters| date =January 19, 2009| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5062Q520090119?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true| accessdate = January 19, 2009}}</ref> Additionally, the claim of a $600&nbsp;million debt owed to RosUkrEnergo by Naftogaz was dropped.<ref name=UNA190109>{{Cite news | title = Ukraine, Russia Agree On Gas Supplies To Ukraine For 2009–2019| publisher=Ukrainian News Agency| date =January 19, 2009| url = http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/174732.html| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130105053149/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/174732.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = January 5, 2013| accessdate = January 19, 2009}}</ref> The deal is to remain in force until the end of 2019.<ref name=UkNGOSW15713>[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2013-07-15/kyiv-s-gas-strategy-closer-cooperation-gazprom-or-a-genuine-div Kyiv’s gas strategy: closer cooperation with Gazprom or a genuine diversification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023132057/http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2013-07-15/kyiv-s-gas-strategy-closer-cooperation-gazprom-or-a-genuine-div |date=October 23, 2013 }}, [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] (15 July 2013)</ref>

According to the agreement, Ukraine would pay $360/mcm (thousand cubic meter) for the first quarter of 2009, and each following quarter will be stipulated depending on the price formula. Additionally, Ukraine must pay for supplies for any given month by the seventh day of the following month.

The agreement was altered on November 20, 2009 after a meeting between Tymoshenko and Putin in [[Yalta]]; Ukraine would not be fined for buying less gas than what the original agreement stipulated, this was done in view of the [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8369705.stm Russia agrees to ease Ukraine gas supply terms], [[BBC News]] (November 20, 2009)</ref>

==Impact on Europe==
On January 2, a day after Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, [[Hungary]], Romania and [[Poland]] were the first countries to report that pressure in their pipelines had fallen. [[Bulgaria]] reported that their supply was also falling and that transit to [[Turkey]], Greece and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] was affected.<ref name=bbc312009B/> Two days later the [[Czech Republic]] and Turkey reported drops in pipeline pressure.<ref name=Reuters030109A>{{cite news| title = Russia gas disruption spreads to Czechs, Turks| author=Yuri Kulikov| author2=Tanya Mosolova| work=Reuters| date =January 4, 2009| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4BN32B20090104?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true| accessdate = January 4, 2009}}</ref> Starting on January 7, several countries began to report a significant drop in gas supplies from Russia. Throughout the crisis many countries were unprepared and had been left without supplies for days, leading to significant economic and humanitarian consequences; Bulgaria was forced to stop production in some of its important industrial plants, while one country, [[Slovakia]], declared a [[state of emergency]].<ref name=reutersfactbox712009>{{cite news| title = FACTBOX – 18 countries affected by Russia-Ukraine gas row| work=Reuters| date =January 7, 2009| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE5062Q520090107?sp=true| accessdate = January 7, 2009}}</ref> The most severely affected countries were in Southeastern Europe, most of which rely completely on Russia for gas and at the time didn't have sufficient alternative energy sources. However North-West Europe wasn't much effected by the cutoff and none of Europe's major markets came close to cutting off customers. Many European countries had made investments since the [[Russia–Ukraine gas dispute of 2005–2006|2006 crisis]] which put them in a better position.<ref name="oxchart"/>

None of Gazprom's European clients have sued Gazprom for irregularities in gas shipments in January 2009, hence Gazprom suspended its litigation with Naftogaz Ukraine at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce over alleged violation of contractual terms on transiting natural gas to Europe by Naftogaz late December 2009.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/56249/ Gazprom suspends litigation with Naftohaz Ukraine at Stockholm Arbitration Institute], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 31, 2009)</ref>

Despite calls for European energy diversity being amplified as a result of the crisis, Russia's European customers have long term legal contracts for gas deliveries. Most of these contracts stretch beyond 2025–2030 and obligations to these contracts remain despite the crisis. Thus European countries can do little in the short-medium term in the ways of diversification away from Russian gas, but diversification of delivery routes away from Ukraine could potentially be achieved within a few years via projects such as the [[South Stream]] and [[Nord Stream]] pipeline systems.<ref name="ox11"/><ref name="ox10"/>

==Technical gas and accusations of stealing==
Gas required to run the [[compressor station]]s is known as "fuel gas" worldwide, or "technical" gas in the former [[Soviet Union]].

On January 15, Prime Minister Putin in collaboration with [[Paolo Scaroni]], CEO of Italian energy company [[Eni]], made a proposal to create a [[consortium]] of European utilities that would temporarily solve the crisis by financing the supply of technical gas needed to ensure transit to Europe, but this idea was dismissed as gas supplies were restored shortly thereafter.<ref name=reuters160109eni>{{cite news| title = FACTBOX – Eni's Ukraine gas transit consortium| author=Stephen Jewkes| work=Reuters| date =January 16, 2009| url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE50F58Y20090116?sp=true| accessdate = January 13, 2009}}</ref>

==Alleged political motives==

''[[The Times]]'' published an article alleging that the key aim of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] was to stifle the continued expansion of the [[expansion of the European Union|EU]] and [[Expansion of NATO|NATO]] into Eastern Europe by exposing Ukraine as an unreliable ally.<ref name=time070109>{{cite news|title=Comment: Gazprom is not a market player, it's a political weapon |author=Roger Boyes|work=The Times |location=London |date=January 7, 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5458245.ece|accessdate=January 8, 2009}}</ref> This view was shared by [[Vladimir Milov]], president of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow and former deputy energy minister of Russia, who also claimed that Russia was putting pressure on the Ukrainian government for pursuing pro-western goals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russia-Ukraine feud goes beyond gas pipes|work=The International Herald Tribune|date=January 14, 2009|url=http://iht.com/articles/2009/01/14/europe/gazprom.2-407519.php?page=2|accessdate=January 14, 2009}}</ref> The [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO|US Ambassador to NATO]], [[Kurt Volker]], stated that although it was a commercial dispute, he believed that Russia was using the event to gain political leverage.<ref name=times080109b>{{cite news|title=Nato warning for Russia over 'political' gas crisis|work=The Times |location=London |author=Rory Watson |author2=David Charter|date=January 8, 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5477684.ece|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref> Contrarily, the [[Oxford university|Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]] concluded in a report: "We do not believe that the often-cited desire of the Russian government to use energy as an economic or political ‘weapon' against European countries played any part in this crisis."<ref name="ox11"/> Although the report also stated that the Russian decision to cut back deliveries on January 5, 2009 "may have reflected Prime Minister Putin’s anger and frustration, and been aimed at punishing Ukraine for its repeated threats to disrupt transit.

According to Fyodor Lukyanov, an editor of the journal ''Russia in Global Affairs'', Ukraine was desperate not to pay more for gas due to the poor state of its economy and believed that the longer the conflict dragged on the more the blame would be laid on Russia, which would give Ukraine a position of strength in negotiating.<ref name=reuters712009>{{cite news| title=What is Russia's end-game in gas row?| author=Christian Lowe| work=Reuters| date=January 7, 2009| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5062VY20090107?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true| accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> Gazprom deputy CEO [[Alexander Medvedev]] suggested that Ukraine's actions were being orchestrated by the United States.

On January 14, Prime Minister Tymoshenko said that an agreement with Russia on prices had nearly been achieved, but had been broken up. She laid blame on [[RosUkrEnergo]]'s part owner, Dmytro Firtash, former fuel and energy minister [[Yuriy Boyko]], and former head of the presidential administration Sergei Levochkin, who had lobbied against the agreement, and suggested that [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Yushchenko]] had been complicit. Shortly after, Boyko countered that Tymoshenko herself had been lobbying in the interests of business owners Igor Bakai and [[Viktor Medvedchuk]]. According to Boyko, Tymoshenko had delayed payment of Ukraine's debts in order to arrange for a company owned by Medvedchuk and Bakai to export large volumes of Russian gas.<ref name="ox7">[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf The Russo-Ukrainian gas dispute of January 2009: a comprehensive assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116184545/http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG27.pdf |date=November 16, 2009 }}, section 7, [[Oxford university|Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], Retrieved on October 13, 2009</ref>

According to Tammy Lynch, Senior [[Research Fellow]] at [[Boston University]]'s Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy, one of the PR problems for Ukraine was the fact that most Western media is based in Moscow and maintains regular contact with political and business elites there; Ukraine's interests, even in a dispute like this, are peripheral to the 'big issue' of Russia's relations with Europe.<ref name=reuteranalyses712009/>

== Public reaction in Ukraine ==
{{main|Remember about the Gas — Do not buy Russian goods!}}
Another political pressure to Ukraine during the gas conflict, and the fact overlap of gas supplies from Russia, led to the renewal of the civil campaign "Remember the gas - do not buy Russian goods!" on January 1, 2009. In January 2009, variety of different movements carried out the campaigns against Russian policy toward Ukraine, particularly using calls to boycott Russian goods.

==Aftermath (Tymoshenko conviction)==
