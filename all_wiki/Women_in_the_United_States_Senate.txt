There have been 57 total '''women in the [[United States Senate]]''' since its establishment in 1789.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/levels_of_office/documents/senate.pdf |title=Women in the U.S. Senate 1922–2015 |publisher=[[Center for American Women and Politics]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703021204/http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/levels_of_office/documents/senate.pdf |archive-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref> The first woman who served as a U.S. senator, [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], represented [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a single day in 1922. The first woman elected to the Senate was [[Hattie Caraway]] from [[Arkansas]] in 1932. Seventeen of the women who have served were appointed; seven of those were appointed to succeed their deceased husbands. The [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]] has had 26 female senators, meaning for the first time in history, one-fourth of the members of the U.S. Senate are female. Of the 57 women in the U.S. Senate, 36 have been [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 21 have been [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. The 58th woman in the Senate will take her seat in 2021.

For its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until [[1920 United States Senate elections|1920]], few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of [[women's suffrage]] in many states until ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as [[sex discrimination]].

The first woman in the U.S. Senate was [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], who served representing [[List of United States senators from Georgia|Georgia]] for only one day in 1922. [[Hattie Caraway]] became the first woman to win election to the Senate representing [[List of United States senators from Arkansas|Arkansas]], in 1932. [[Margaret Chase Smith]] was the first woman to serve in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and Senate; she first served in the House, and began serving in the Senate in 1949. Margaret Chase Smith won her [[1960 United States Senate elections|1960]] race for Senate in the nation's first ever race pitting two women (her and [[Lucia Cormier]]) against each other for a Senate seat. [[Muriel Humphrey Brown]] was the first and only [[Second Lady of the United States|Second Lady]] to serve in the United States Senate. After her husband, [[Hubert Humphrey]], was defeated in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], he won back his old Senate seat representing [[List of United States senators from Minnesota|Minnesota]]. Following his unexpected death in office, Brown was appointed by the [[Governor of Minnesota]] in 1978 to fill her late husband's Senate seat. She served for less than one year, and did not seek reelection.

In 1978, [[Nancy Kassebaum]] became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate representing [[List of United States senators from Kansas|Kansas]] without her husband having previously served in Congress.<ref group="n">
Of the female senators who preceded Kassebaum:
[[Rebecca Latimer Felton]], [[Rose McConnell Long]], [[Dixie Bibb Graves]], [[Vera C. Bushfield]], [[Eva Bowring]], [[Elaine S. Edwards]], [[Muriel Humphrey]], and [[Maryon Pittman Allen]] were all appointed and were never elected; [[Gladys Pyle]] (R-SD) and [[Hazel Abel]] (R-NE), were elected, but not to full terms (i.e., to complete terms where the previous senator had died or resigned, not to new six-year terms); [[Hattie Caraway]] and [[Maurine Brown Neuberger]] were both elected to full six-year terms, but their husbands had held the seat previously. [[Margaret Chase Smith]]'s (R-ME) husband never served in the Senate, but he did serve in the House. When he died, Margaret won the ensuing election. Of the appointed senators, Long, Bushfield, Humphrey, and Allen were all appointed to fill out part of the terms of their deceased husbands, while Graves and Edwards were appointed by their husbands, the Governor of their states at the time. However, Kassebaum's [[Alf Landon|father]] means that the first woman to be elected without any family connections was [[Paula Hawkins]], elected in 1980.</ref> Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was [[Paula Hawkins]] (R-FL), elected in [[1980 United States Senate election in Florida|1980]]. She was also the first and to date only female member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] elected to the United States senate. There were still few women in the Senate near the end of the 20th century, long after women began to make up a significant portion of the membership of the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination]] hearings, and the subsequent election of the [[103rd United States Congress]] in [[1992 United States Senate election|1992]], which was dubbed the "[[Year of the Woman]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/year_of_the_woman.htm|title=Year of the Woman|website=U.S. Senate}}</ref> In addition to [[Barbara Mikulski]], who was reelected that year (1992), four women were elected to the Senate, all Democrats. They were [[Patty Murray]] of [[List of United States senators from Washington|Washington]], [[Carol Moseley Braun]] of [[List of United States senators from Illinois|Illinois]], and [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Barbara Boxer]], both of [[List of United States senators from California|California]]. [[Carol Moseley Braun]], who was African-American, was the first [[person of color|woman of color]] in the Senate. She was also the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator, winning the 1992 Democratic primary election over [[Alan Dixon]]. Later in 1992, [[Dianne Feinstein]] was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated [[John F. Seymour|John Seymour]] in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/blog/jewesses-in-politics-represent |title=Jewesses in politics represent! &#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=November 5, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="congress1">{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/member/dianne-feinstein/F000062 |title=Dianne Feinstein &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="congress2">{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/member/barbara-boxer/B000711 |title=Barbara Boxer &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>

The first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Barbara Boxer]] (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993 until 2016 when Boxer retired and Feinstein was joined by [[Kamala Harris]]. In June 1993, [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female {{party shortname|Republican Party (United States)}} senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive "boys' club". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years with the exception of the 2004 cycle (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). Since 2004, at least two new women have been elected to the Senate every two years, with the exceptions of 2010, when [[Kelly Ayotte]] of [[New Hampshire]] was the only new woman elected to the Senate, and 2020, when [[Cynthia Lummis]] of [[Wyoming]] was the lone newly-elected female senator.

[[Olympia Snowe]] of [[List of United States senators from Maine|Maine]] arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] and both houses of the [[Maine state legislature]]. She and later [[Debbie Stabenow]] of [[Michigan]] and [[Kyrsten Sinema]] of [[Arizona]] are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, [[Debbie Stabenow|Stabenow]] and [[Maria Cantwell]] became the first women to defeat incumbent ''elected'' senators in a general election, unseating Senators [[Spencer Abraham]] and [[Slade Gorton]] respectively.<ref group="n">[[Bob Krueger]] and [[John F. Seymour]], defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein respectively, were appointed to the Senate by the governors of their states.</ref> [[Hillary Clinton]] is the first and only [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] to run for and/or to win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001 becoming the first female senator of [[List of United States senators from New York|New York]], and served until 2009 when she resigned to become the 67th [[United States Secretary of State]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], before becoming the first woman to receive a major party's nomination for president in [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2016]]. She was replaced by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], who has been reelected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].

In 2008, [[Kay Hagan]] became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, [[Elizabeth Dole]]. Upon the opening of the [[112th United States Congress]] in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat [[Jeanne Shaheen]] was joined by newly elected Republican [[Kelly Ayotte]], making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties. [[Barbara Mikulski]] became the longest-serving woman senator (and Congresswoman) in 2012; she retired in 2017 as still the longest-serving after serving for forty years.

In 2012, there was a second "Year of the Woman" with the election of five women and the reelection of six women. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats [[Tammy Baldwin]] of [[List of United States senators from Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], [[Heidi Heitkamp]] of [[List of United States senators from North Dakota|North Dakota]], [[Mazie Hirono]] of [[List of United States senators from Hawaii|Hawaii]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] of [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], and Republican [[Deb Fischer]] of [[List of United States senators from Nebraska|Nebraska]]. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist person in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.

[[Joni Ernst]] became the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate when she joined in 2015. [[Catherine Cortez Masto]], elected in 2016 was the first Latina senator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senators_chronological.htm|title=U.S. Senate: senators, 1789 to present|website=senate.gov|access-date=April 8, 2018}}</ref> In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the [[top-two primary]], [[Attorney General of California]] [[Kamala Harris]] and U.S. Representative [[Loretta Sanchez]] became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Maggie Hassan]], both of [[List of United States senators from New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] hold the distinction of being the first and second women elected both governor and senator of a state; both served as [[Governor of New Hampshire]] and served together in the Senate starting in 2017.

In 2017 [[Tammy Duckworth]] became the first female double amputee in the U.S. Senate. On April 9, 2018, Duckworth gave birth to her daughter Maile Pearl, becoming the first incumbent senator to give birth.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/09/600896586/tammy-duckworth-becomes-first-u-s-senator-to-give-birth-while-in-office|title=Tammy Duckworth Becomes First U.S. senator To Give Birth While In Office|work=NPR.org|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> Shortly afterward, rules were changed so that a senator has the right to bring a child under one year old on the Senate floor and breastfeed them during votes.<ref name="rules">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/tammy-duckworth-senate-baby-rules/index.html|title=Babies now allowed on Senate floor after rule change|first=Sunlen|last=Serfaty|work=CNN|date=April 18, 2018}}</ref> The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.<ref name="rules"/><ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/a-duckling-onesie-and-a-blazer-the-senate-floor-sees-its-first-baby-but-many-traditions-stand/2018/04/19/451ea160-43e0-11e8-ad8f-27a8c409298b_story.html |title=A duckling onesie and a blazer: The Senate floor sees its first baby, but many traditions stand |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 2018 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

In 2018 [[Kyrsten Sinema]] defeated [[Martha McSally]] to become [[List of United States senators from Arizona|Arizona]]'s first female senator, and the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor [[Doug Ducey]] announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of [[Jon Kyl]]. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election.

Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 21 have been Republicans. As of 2019, no female U.S. senator has ever died in office, won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, switched parties, or represented a [[third party (United States)|third party]] in her career.

Some female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see [[list of female United States presidential and vice-presidential candidates]].

{{legend|#9D3FFF|One male and one female senator}}
{{legend|#FF5599|Two female senators}}]]
Commencing in January 2020, and as of December, there have been 26 women serving in the United States Senate, 17 Democrats and 9 Republicans, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.

In January 2017, the number of serving women senators reached a record of 21, 16 of whom were Democrats, and the other 5 being Republicans. Democratic Senators [[Barbara Mikulski]] and [[Barbara Boxer]] did not seek reelection in 2016, while four new Democratic senators were elected: [[Catherine Cortez Masto]] (Nevada), [[Tammy Duckworth]] (Illinois), [[Kamala Harris]] (California), and [[Maggie Hassan]] (New Hampshire). Incumbent Republican senator [[Kelly Ayotte]] (New Hampshire) lost to Hassan. Both of the seats that changed hands from Republican to Democrat were won by women (Duckworth and Hassan); this was also the case in the 2018 Senate election (Rosen and Sinema). 

In January 2018, after the appointment of Democrat [[Tina Smith]] of Minnesota to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of [[Al Franken]], and in April 2018 after the appointment of Republican [[Cindy Hyde-Smith]] of Mississippi to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of [[Thad Cochran]], the number reached 23.  In January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two women senators (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators increased to 25, with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, [[Kelly Loeffler]] was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26.

[[Martha McSally]] lost reelection to a full term on November 3, 2020, and left Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, [[Cynthia Lummis]], the first woman senator from Wyoming, is scheduled to commence her term, so the number of female senators is expected to reach 26 once again.  Loeffler is facing a special runoff election to be held on January 5, and would continue in the Senate past mid-January only if she won.  In addition, Kamala Harris has been declared the Vice President-elect and is expected to become Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, 2021, which may drop the number of female senators to 24 or 25 (depending on the results of Loeffler's runoff election in Georgia and who is appointed as Harris's successor).

Currently, five states ([[California]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]) are represented by two women in the U.S. Senate. Ten current female senators had previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives, a distinction long held only by Margaret Chase Smith: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Capito, Duckworth, Blackburn, Rosen, and Sinema. When the new Senate convenes on January 3, 2021, the number is expected to reach eleven once again due to Lummis being seated.

{{United States Senate}}
Before 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is [[Muriel Humphrey]] (D-MN), the widow of former senator and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Recent examples of selection include [[Jean Carnahan]] and [[Lisa Murkowski]]. In [[2000 United States Senate elections|2000]], [[Jean Carnahan]] (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, [[Mel Carnahan]]. Carnahan—even though dead—defeated the incumbent senator, [[John Ashcroft]]. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by [[Missouri Governor]] [[Roger B. Wilson|Roger Wilson]] until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent [[2002 United States Senate elections|2002 election]] to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father [[Alaska Governor]] [[Frank Murkowski]], who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her retention bid in [[2004 United States Senate elections|2004]].

Two recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator [[Elizabeth Dole]] (R-NC), is married to former [[Senate Majority Leader]] and 1996 Republican presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] and served as [[Secretary of Transportation]] under [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] and [[Secretary of Labor]] under [[George H.W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]]; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY), wife of former President [[Bill Clinton]], was [[First Lady of the United States]] and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|unsuccessful campaign]] for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] for the eventual victor of that election, [[Barack Obama]]. In 2016, she ran a [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|successful campaign]] for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]].

Another famous name is [[Nancy Kassebaum Baker|Nancy Landon Kassebaum]] (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate [[Alf Landon]]. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator [[Howard Baker]] (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress ([[Margaret Chase Smith]] was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat). At the time of her retirement in 1997, Kassebaum was the second longest serving female senator, after Smith; since that year five women have had Senate careers longer than Kassebaum's.

Among the women elected or selected in Senate history, by stature, [[Barbara Mikulski]] (D-MD) is the shortest at {{convert|5|ft|0|in|m}}, whereas [[Kelly Loeffler]] (R-GA) is the tallest at {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/04/29/four-possible-candidates/4cf509db-f269-4dc6-b774-72199910f8aa/|title=Four Possible Candidates|first=Elisabeth|last=Bumiller|date=April 29, 1984|work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Risk, hoops memories entice new Dream owner Loeffler |url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/risk-hoops-memories-entice-new-dream-owner-loeffler/WDPsGpIV66px3SsHgkA7FP/ |access-date=December 1, 2020 |work=AJC |date=December 3, 2019 |quote=A skinny 5-foot-11, her nickname on the court was NBC — 'Newborn Calf.'}}</ref> Mikulski and Loeffler have also been the shortest and tallest respectively among all female members of Congress.

32 states have been represented by female senators, and 20 are currently represented. In 2009, North Carolina became the first state to have been represented by female senators of both parties, and the first to have a female senator succeeded by a female senator from the other party. In 2011, New Hampshire became the second state to be represented by female senators from both parties, and the first to have female senators of both parties serving concurrently. In 2021, Wyoming is expected to become the 33rd state to have a female senator.
