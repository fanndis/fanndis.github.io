===Dry gangrene===
Dry gangrene is a form of [[coagulative necrosis]] that develops in [[ischemia|ischemic]] [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], where the blood supply is inadequate to keep tissue viable. It is not a disease itself, but a symptom of other diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Tyler|title=Gangrene Management: Today and Tomorrow|date=2015|publisher=Hayle Medical|isbn=978-1632412232}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> The term ''dry'' is used only when referring to a limb or to the gut (in other locations, this same type of necrosis is called an infarction, such as [[myocardial infarction]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Simon |title=Underwood's Pathology: A Clinical Approach |date=2018 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780702072109 |page=124 |edition=7th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jtRDwAAQBAJ |access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref> Dry gangrene is often due to [[peripheral artery disease]], but can be due to [[acute limb ischemia]]. As a result, people with arteriosclerosis, high cholesterol, diabetes and smokers commonly have dry gangrene.<ref name=":0" /> The limited oxygen in the ischemic limb limits [[putrefaction]] and bacteria fail to survive. The affected part is dry, shrunken, and dark reddish-black. The line of separation usually brings about complete separation, with eventual falling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removed surgically, a process called [[autoamputation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Al Wahbi|first=Abdullah|date=2018-06-01|title=Autoamputation of diabetic toe with dry gangrene: a myth or a fact?|journal=Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy|volume=11|pages=255–264|doi=10.2147/DMSO.S164199|issn=1178-7007|pmc=5987754|pmid=29910628}}</ref>

Dry gangrene is the end result of chronic [[ischemia]] without [[infection]]. If ischemia is detected early, when [[ischemic wound]]s rather than gangrene are present, the process can be treated by [[revascularization]] (via vascular bypass or angioplasty).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aiello A, Anichini R, Brocco E, Caravaggi C, Chiavetta A, Cioni R, Da Ros R, De Feo ME, Ferraresi R, Florio F, Gargiulo M, Galzerano G, Gandini R, Giurato L, Graziani L, Mancini L, Manzi M, Modugno P, Setacci C, Uccioli L |title=Treatment of peripheral arterial disease in diabetes: a consensus of the Italian Societies of Diabetes (SID, AMD), Radiology (SIRM) and Vascular Endovascular Surgery (SICVE) |journal=Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=355–69 |year=2014 |pmid=24486336 |doi=10.1016/j.numecd.2013.12.007 |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, once gangrene has developed, the affected tissues are not salvageable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gerhard-Herman|first1=MD|last2=Gornik|first2=HL|last3=Barrett|first3=C|last4=Barshes|first4=NR|last5=Corriere|first5=MA|last6=Drachman|first6=DE|last7=Fleisher|first7=LA|last8=Fowkes|first8=FG|last9=Hamburg|first9=NM|last10=Kinlay|first10=S|last11=Lookstein|first11=R|last12=Misra|first12=S|last13=Mureebe|first13=L|last14=Olin|first14=JW|last15=Patel|first15=RA|last16=Regensteiner|first16=JG|last17=Schanzer|first17=A|last18=Shishehbor|first18=MH|last19=Stewart|first19=KJ|last20=Treat-Jacobson|first20=D|last21=Walsh|first21=ME|title=2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.|journal=Circulation|date=2017|volume=135|issue=12|pages=e726–79|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000471|pmid=27840333|pmc=5477786}}</ref> Because dry gangrene is not accompanied by infection, it is not as [[wiktionary:emergent|emergent]] as gas gangrene or wet gangrene, both of which have a risk of sepsis.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] is a risk factor for peripheral vascular disease, thus for dry gangrene, but also a risk factor for wet gangrene, particularly in patients with poorly controlled blood sugar levels, as elevated serum glucose creates a favorable environment for bacterial infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vayvada|first1=H|last2=Demirdover|first2=C|last3=Menderes|first3=A|last4=Karaca|first4=C|title=Necrotising fasciitis in the central part of the body: diagnosis, management and review of the literature.|journal=International Wound Journal|date=August 2013|volume=10|issue=4|pages=466–72|pmid=22694053|doi=10.1111/j.1742-481x.2012.01006.x}}</ref>

===Wet gangrene===
[[File:Wet gangrene of the foot.jpg|thumb|Wet gangrene of the foot]]
Wet, or infected, gangrene is characterized by thriving bacteria and has a poor [[prognosis]] (compared to dry gangrene) due to sepsis resulting from the free communication between infected fluid and circulatory fluid. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by [[Putrefying bacteria|saprogenic]] microorganisms (''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' or ''[[Bacillus fusiformis]]'', for example), which cause tissue to swell and emit a foul odor. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) or arterial blood flow.<ref name=":0" /> The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood, which promotes the rapid growth of bacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbed, causing systemic manifestation of sepsis and finally death. The affected part is edematous, soft, putrid, rotten, and dark.

Because of the high mortality associated with infected gangrene (about 80% without treatment and 20% with treatment), an emergency salvage amputation, such as a [[guillotine amputation]], is often needed to limit systemic effects of the infection.<ref name=CochAmp/> Such an amputation can be converted to a formal amputation, such as a [[below knee amputation|below- {{black|or}} above-knee amputation]].<ref name=CochAmp>{{cite journal|last1=Tisi|first1=PV|last2=Than|first2=MM|title=Type of incision for below knee amputation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 April 2014|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD003749|pmid=24715679|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003749.pub3|pmc=7154343}}</ref>

===Gas gangrene===
{{Main|Gas gangrene}}
Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produces gas within tissues. It can be caused by ''[[Clostridium]]'', most commonly [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin|alpha toxin]]-producing ''C. perfringens'', or various nonclostridial species.<ref name=Yang2015 /><ref name="Sakurai">{{cite journal|last1=Sakurai|first1=J.|last2=Nagahama|first2=M.|last3=Oda|first3=M.|s2cid=12940936|title=''Clostridium perfringens'' alpha-toxin: characterization and mode of action|journal=Journal of Biochemistry|date=November 2004|volume=136|issue=5|pages=569–74|doi=10.1093/jb/mvh161|pmid=15632295}}</ref> Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by the bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissue in the vicinity. Because of its ability to quickly spread to surrounding tissues, gas gangrene should be treated as a [[medical emergency]], this is the most fatal form of gangrene, it is highly fatal, even with treatment (50%), which can be 100% if left untreated.

Gas gangrene is caused by bacterial [[exotoxin]]-producing clostridial species, which are mostly found in soil, and other anaerobes such as ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and anaerobic [[Streptococcus|streptococci]]. These environmental bacteria may enter the muscle through a wound and subsequently proliferate in necrotic tissue and secrete powerful toxins, which destroy nearby tissue, generating gas at the same time. A gas composition of 5.9% hydrogen, 3.4% carbon dioxide, 74.5% nitrogen, and 16.1% oxygen was reported in one clinical case.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chi CH, Chen KW, Huang JJ, Chuang YC, Wu MH |author-link4=Chuang Yin-ching |title=Gas composition in ''Clostridium'' septicum gas gangrene |journal=Journal of the Formosan Medical Association |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=757–59 |date=December 1995 |pmid=8541740 }}</ref>

Gas gangrene can cause necrosis, gas production, and sepsis. Progression to [[bacteremia|toxemia]] and [[septic shock|shock]] is often very rapid.

===Other types===
*[[Necrotizing fasciitis]], also known as hemolytic streptococcal gangrene, is a very rare infection that spreads deep into the body along tissue planes. It is characterized by infection with ''S.pyogenes'', a gram-positive cocci bacteria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-hcp/necrotizing-fasciitis.html|title=For Clinicians: Type II Necrotizing Fasciitis {{!}} CDC|date=2019-02-21|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>
*[[Noma (disease)|Noma]] is a gangrene of the face common in Africa and Asia, with 99% of cases occurring there, whereas the disease is practically non-existent in other continents.
*[[Fournier gangrene]] is a type of necrotizing fasciitis that usually affects the genitals and groin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Levenson| first1=RB|last2=Singh|first2=AK|last3=Novelline|first3=RA|title=Fournier gangrene: role of imaging |journal=Radiographics |volume= 28 |issue=2 |pages=519–28 |date=March–April 2008 |pmid=18349455|doi=10.1148/rg.282075048 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

*Severe [[mesenteric ischemia]] may result in gangrene of the [[small intestine]].
*Severe [[ischemic colitis]] may result in gangrene of the [[large intestine]].

==Treatment==
Treatment varies based on the severity and type of gangrene.<ref name=":0" />

===Lifestyle===
Exercises such as walking and massage therapy may be tried.<ref name=":0" />

===Medication===

Medications may include pain management, medications that promote circulation in the [[circulatory system]] and antibiotics. Since gangrene is associated with periodic pain caused by too little blood flow, pain management is important so patients can continue doing exercises that promote circulation. Pain management medications can include opioids and opioid-like analgesics. Since gangrene is a result of [[ischemia]], circulatory system management is important. These medications can include [[antiplatelet drug]], [[anticoagulant]], and [[fibrinolytics]]. As infection is often associated with gangrene, [[antibiotics]] are often a critical component of its treatment. The life-threatening nature of gangrene requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics in an inpatient setting.<ref name=":0" /> Antibiotics alone are not effective because they may not penetrate infected tissues sufficiently.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lipsky BA |title=Evidence-based antibiotic therapy of diabetic foot infections |journal=FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. |volume=26 |issue=3–4 |pages=267–76 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10575138 |doi=10.1016/s0928-8244(99)00143-1|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Surgery===

Surgical removal of all dead tissue, however, is the mainstay of treatment for gangrene. Often, gangrene is associated with underlying infection, thus the gangrenous tissue must be [[debridement|debrided]] to hinder the spread of the associated infection. The extent of surgical debridement needed depends on the extent of the gangrene, and may be limited to the removal of a finger, toe, or ear, but in severe cases may involve a [[amputation|limb amputation]].<ref name=":0" />

Dead tissue alone does not require debridement, and in some cases, such as dry gangrene, the affected part falls off (autoamputates), making surgical removal unnecessary. Waiting for autoamputation however may cause health complications as well as decreased quality of life.<ref name=":0" />

After the gangrene is treated with debridement and antibiotics, the underlying cause can be treated. In the case of gangrene due to [[critical limb ischemia]], revascularization can be performed to treat the underlying peripheral artery disease.

Ischemic disease of the legs is the most common reason for amputations. In about a quarter of these cases, the other side requires amputation in the next three years.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1232102|Amputations of the Lower Extremity}}</ref>

Angioplasty should be considered if severe blockage in lower leg vessels ([[Posterior tibial artery|tibial]] and [[peroneal artery]]) leads to gangrene.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007393.htm |title=Angioplasty and stent placement – peripheral arteries |access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

===Other===
[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] treatment is used to treat gas gangrene. It increases pressure and oxygen content to allow blood to carry more oxygen to inhibit anaerobic organism growth and reproduction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu R, Li L, Yang M, Boden G, Yang G |title=Systematic review of the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy in the management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=166–75 |year=2013 |pmid=23374620 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.10.021 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Wallen wounded by Minie ball.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Confederate Army]] Private Milton E. Wallen lies in bed with a gangrenous amputated arm]]
As early as 1028, [[fly|flies]] and [[maggot]]s were commonly used to treat chronic wounds or [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] to prevent or arrest necrotic spread,<ref name="Shi">{{Cite journal | doi=10.12968/bjcn.2014.19.Sup12.S6| pmid=25478859|title = Maggot debridement therapy: A systematic review| journal=British Journal of Community Nursing| volume=19| pages=S6–S13|year = 2014|last1 = Shi|first1 = Eric| last2=Shofler| first2=David}}</ref> as some species of maggots consume only dead flesh, leaving nearby living tissue unaffected. This practice largely died out after the introduction of antibiotics, [[acetonitrile]],{{Citation needed| date=February 2009}} and [[enzyme]] to the range of treatments for wounds. In recent times, however, maggot therapy has regained some credibility and is sometimes employed with great [[efficacy]] in cases of chronic tissue necrosis.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The French [[Baroque music|Baroque composer]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] contracted gangrene in January 1687 when, while conducting a performance of his ''[[Te Deum]]'', he stabbed his own toe with his pointed staff (which was used as a [[baton (conducting)|baton]]). The disease spread to his leg, but the composer refused to have his toe [[amputation|amputated]], which eventually led to his death in March of that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Trivia – The Death of Lully|url=http://www.utahsymphony.org/blog/2010/08/music-trivia-the-death-of-lully/|website=The Musician's Lounge|publisher=Utah Symphony Orchestra|access-date=March 7, 2017|date=August 2010}}</ref>

French King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] died of gangrene in his leg on 1 September 1715, four days prior to his 77th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Laurenson|first1=John|title=The strange death of Louis XIV|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/the-strange-death-of-louis-xiv/|website=The Spectator|access-date=12 March 2017|date=21 November 2015}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The [[etymology]] of gangrene derives from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|gangraena}} and from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{transl|grc|gangraina}} (γάγγραινα), which means "[[putrefaction]] of tissues".<ref>Liddell & Scott's Lexicon, Oxford University Press, 1963 edition</ref> It has no etymological connection with the word [[green]], despite the affected areas turning black, green, or yellowish brown.
