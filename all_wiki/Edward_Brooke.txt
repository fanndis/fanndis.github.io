'''Edward William Brooke III''' (October 26, 1919 – January 3, 2015) was an American [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] politician. In [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1966|1966]], he became the first African American popularly elected to the [[United States Senate]].<ref group=note>The first African-American senator, [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]], was appointed by the Mississippi state legislature to an unexpired term in 1870. [[Blanche Bruce]] was the first African American elected to the Senate, elected by the Mississippi state legislature to a full term in 1874. Prior to the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] in 1913, U.S. Senators were elected by state legislatures.</ref> He represented [[Massachusetts]] in the Senate from 1967 to 1979.

Born and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]], Brooke graduated from the [[Boston University School of Law]] after serving in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. After serving as chairman of the Finance Commission of [[Boston]], Brooke won election as [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] in 1962. In 1966, he defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor [[Endicott Peabody]] in a landslide to win election to the Senate.

In the Senate, Brooke aligned with the liberal<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Leah M. |title="The Challenge of Change": Edward Brooke, The Republican Party, and the Struggle for Redemption |journal=Souls |pages=91–118 |doi=10.1080/10999949.2011.551479 |date=18 March 2011|volume=13 |s2cid=144076032 }}</ref> faction in the Republican party. He co-wrote the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which prohibits [[Housing discrimination in the United States|housing discrimination]]. Brooke became a prominent critic of President [[Richard Nixon]] and was the first Senate Republican to call for Nixon's resignation in light of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Brooke won re-election in 1972, but he was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Paul Tsongas]] in [[1978 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|1978]]. After leaving the Senate, Brooke practiced law in Washington, D.C. and was affiliated with various businesses and non-profits.

==Early years==
Edward William Brooke III was born on October 26, 1919, in [[Washington, D.C.]], to Edward William Brooke Jr. and Helen (Seldon) Brooke. He was the second of three children;<ref>Cutler, pp. 13–14.</ref> He was raised in a middle-class section of the city, and attended [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]], then one of the most prestigious academic high schools for African Americans.<ref>Cutler, pp. 14–18.</ref> After graduating in 1936, he enrolled in [[Howard University]], where he first considered medicine, but ended up studying social studies and political science.<ref>Cutler, p. 20.</ref> Brooke graduated in 1941, and enlisted in the [[United States Army]] immediately after the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Cutler, p. 23.</ref>

Brooke was commissioned as an officer, served five years in the Army, saw combat in [[Italy]] during World War II as a member of the segregated [[U.S. 366th Infantry Regiment|366th Infantry Regiment]], and earned a [[Bronze Star Medal]]. In Italy Brooke met his future wife Remigia Ferrari-Scacco, with whom he had two daughters, Remi and Edwina. Following his discharge, Brooke graduated from the [[Boston University School of Law]] in 1948. "I never studied much at Howard," he reflected, "but at Boston University, I didn't do much else but study."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barlow|first1=Rich|title=Remembering a Pioneering Politician|journal=Bostonia|date=February 2015|pages=12|publisher=Boston University}}</ref> His papers are stored at Boston University's [[Mugar Memorial Library#Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center|Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center]].

==Political career==
In 1950 he ran for a seat in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. Brooke won the Republican nomination, but lost the general election.<ref name="jacobs">Jacobs, Sally. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20030610171159/http://boston.com/globe/magazine/2000/3-5/featurestory2.shtml The unfinished chapter]" ''Boston Globe'', March 5, 2000.</ref> Brooke made two more tries for office, including one for [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|secretary of state]], but lost both races.{{r|time19670217}} The loss in the secretary's race (to [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]], a future mayor of Boston) was particularly close. Republican leaders took notice of Brooke's potential.<ref>Cutler, p. 63.</ref>

Governor [[John Volpe]] sought to reward Brooke for his effort, and offered him a number of jobs, most judicial in nature. Seeking a position with a higher political profile, Brooke eventually accepted the position of chairman of the Finance Commission of Boston, where he investigated financial irregularities and uncovered evidence of corruption in city affairs. He was described in the press as having "the tenacity of a [[terrier]]", and it was reported that he "restore[d] to vigorous life an agency which many had thought moribund."<ref>Cutler, pp. 65–67.</ref> He parlayed his achievements there into a successful election as [[Attorney General of Massachusetts]] in 1962; he was the first African-American to be elected attorney general of any state.<ref name=cnn /> In this position, Brooke gained a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of [[organized crime]] and corruption, securing convictions against a number of members of the [[Foster Furcolo|Furcolo]] administration; an indictment against Furcolo was dismissed due to lack of evidence.<ref>Cutler, pp. 104–105.</ref> He also coordinated with local police departments on the [[Boston strangler]] case, although the press mocked him for permitting an alleged psychic to participate in the investigation.<ref name="time19670217">{{cite news|title=The Senate: An Individual Who Happens To Be a Negro|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/printout/0,8816,839437,00.html|accessdate=December 24, 2010|newspaper=Time|date=February 17, 1967|volume=89|issue=7}}</ref> Brooke was portrayed in the [[The Boston Strangler (film)|1968 film dramatizing the case]] by [[William Marshall (film and television actor)|William Marshall]].

==U.S. Senator==

[[1966 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|In 1966]], Brooke defeated former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Endicott Peabody]] with 1,213,473 votes to 744,761, and served as a [[United States Senator]] for two terms, from January 3, 1967, to January 3, 1979. The black vote had, ''Time'' wrote, "no measurable bearing" on the election as less than 3% of the state's population was black, and Peabody also supported civil rights for blacks. Brooke said, "I do not intend to be a national leader of the Negro people", and the magazine said that he "condemned both [[Stokely Carmichael]] and Georgia's [[Lester Maddox]]" as extremists; his historic election nonetheless gave Brooke "a 50-state constituency", the magazine wrote, "a power base that no other Senator can claim".{{r|time19670217}} A member of the moderate-to-liberal Northeastern wing of the Republican Party, Brooke organized the Senate's "Wednesday Club" of progressive Republicans who met for Wednesday lunches and strategy discussions.<ref name=Bloomberg>{{cite news|last1=Giroux|first1=Greg|title=Edward Brooke Served in a Different Era of Senate Politics|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-04/edward-brooke-served-in-a-different-era-of-senate-politics|accessdate=January 7, 2015|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=January 4, 2015}}</ref> Brooke, who supported [[Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]{{r|time19670217}} and New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s bids for the 1968 GOP presidential nomination against [[Richard Nixon]]'s, often differed with President Nixon on matters of social policy and civil rights.<ref name="New York Times" /> In 1967, Brooke was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] from the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners NAACP Spingarn Medal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802063355/http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |date=2014-08-02 }}</ref>

In 1967, Brooke went to [[Vietnam]] on a three-week trip as a fact-finding mission. During his first formal speech in Senate following the trip, he reversed his previous position on [[Vietnam War]] that increased negotiations with the North Vietnamese rather than an escalation of the fighting were needed. He began to favor President Johnson's "patient" approach to Vietnam as he had been convinced that "the enemy is not disposed to participate in any meaningful negotiations".<ref>{{cite web |title=BROOKE, Edward William, III |url=https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9905 |website=History, Art & Archives |publisher=United States House of Representatives |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>

By his second year in the Senate, Brooke had taken his place as a leading advocate against discrimination in housing and on behalf of affordable housing.<ref name="Boston Globe" /> With [[Walter Mondale]], a Minnesota Democrat and fellow member of the [[Senate Banking Committee]], he co-authored the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968 Fair Housing Act]], which prohibits discrimination in housing. The Act also created HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] as the primary enforcer of the law.<ref name="Boston Globe" /> President Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act into law on April 11, one week after the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Dissatisfied with the weakened enforcement provisions that emerged from the legislative process, Brooke repeatedly proposed stronger provisions during his Senate career.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 1969, Congress enacted the "[[Brooke Amendment]]" to the federal publicly assisted housing program which limited the tenants' out-of-pocket rent expenditure to 25 percent of their income.<ref name="Boston Globe" /> Additionally, Brooke voted in favor of the confirmation of [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/90-1967/s176|title=CONFIRMATION OF NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL, THE FIRST NEGRO APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT.|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref>

During the Nixon presidency, Brooke opposed repeated Administration attempts to close down the [[Job Corps]] and the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] and to weaken the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]—all foundational elements of President Lyndon Johnson's [[Great Society]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1969, Brooke spoke at a [[Wellesley College]]'s commencement against "coercive protest" and was understood by some students as calling protesters "elite [[wikt:ne'er-do-well|ne'er-do-well]]s"<ref name="The Choice 2016">{{citation |title=The Choice 2016 |series=FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/the-choice-2016/ <!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7uScWHcTzk&t=30m30s--> |at=30:30–32:30}}</ref> Then student government president [[Hillary Rodham]] departed from her planned speech to rebut Brooke's words, affirming the "indispensable task of criticizing and constructive protest," for which she was featured in [[Life magazine]].<ref name="The Choice 2016" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Dedman |first=Bill |date=9 May 2007 |title=Reading Hillary Rodham's hidden thesis |work=MSNBC |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17388372/ |access-date=1 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite speech |last=Rodham |first=Hillary D. |date=1969 |title=Hillary D.

Brooke was a leader of the bipartisan coalition that defeated the Senate confirmation of [[Clement Haynsworth]], the President's nominee to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. <!--Why? -->A few months later, he again organized sufficient Republican support to defeat Nixon's second Supreme Court nominee [[Harrold Carswell]]. Nixon next nominated [[Harry A. Blackmun]], who was confirmed and later wrote the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' opinion.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Edward W.

Despite Brooke's disagreements with Nixon, the president reportedly respected the senator's abilities; after [[1968 United States presidential election|Nixon's election]] he had offered to make Brooke a member of his cabinet, or appoint him as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|ambassador to the UN]].<ref name="Boston Globe" /> The press discussed Brooke as a possible replacement for [[Spiro Agnew]] as Nixon's running mate in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]].<ref name="time19711213">{{cite news|title=The Brooke Scenario|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910147,00.html|accessdate=December 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221195016/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910147,00.html | archive-date=December 21, 2008 | newspaper=Time|date=December 13, 1971}}</ref> While Nixon retained Agnew, Brooke was [[1972 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|re-elected in 1972]], defeating Democrat John J. Droney by a vote of 64%–35%.

Before the first year of his second term ended, Brooke became the first Republican to call on President Nixon to resign,<ref name="Boston Globe" /> on November 4, 1973, shortly after the [[Watergate]]-related "[[Saturday night massacre]]". He had risen to become the ranking Republican on the [[Senate Banking Committee]] and on two powerful Appropriations subcommittees, Labor, [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS) and Foreign Operations. From these positions, Brooke defended and strengthened the programs he supported; for example, he was a leader in enactment of the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]], which ensured married women the right to establish credit in their own name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_48/-39955-1.html |title=Edward Brooke to Be Honored |last= Williams|first= Christie|date= 27 October 2009|website=[[RollCall.com]] |access-date= 7 December 2016|quote=And he introduced and passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which leveled the playing field for women seeking access to credit and loans.}}</ref>

In 1974, with Indiana senator [[Birch Bayh]], Brooke led the fight to retain [[Title IX]], a 1972 amendment to the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], which guarantees equal educational opportunity (including athletic participation) to girls and women.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1975, with the extension and expansion of the [[Voting Rights Act]] at stake, Brooke faced senator [[John C. Stennis]] (D-Mississippi) in "extended debate" and won the Senate's support for the extension. In 1976, he also took on the role of supporter of [[Pro-choice|wide-scale, legalized abortion]]. The Appropriations bill for HHS became the battleground over this issue because it funds [[Medicaid]]. The [[Anti-abortion movements|Anti-abortion movement]] fought, eventually successfully, to prohibit funding for abortions of low-income women insured by Medicaid. Brooke led the fight against restrictions in the [[Senate Appropriations Committee]] and in the House–Senate Conference until his defeat.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The press again speculated on his possible candidacy for the Vice Presidency as [[Gerald Ford]]'s running mate in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], with ''Time'' calling him an "able legislator and a staunch party loyalist".<ref name="time19751117">{{cite news|title=A Brand New Race for 2nd Place|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917950,00.html|accessdate=December 25, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716012847/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917950,00.html | archive-date=July 16, 2010 | newspaper=Time|date=November 17, 1975}}</ref>

Brooke went through a divorce late in his second term. His finances were investigated by the Senate, and [[John Kerry]], then a prosecutor in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], announced an investigation into statements Brooke made in the divorce case. Prosecutors eventually determined that Brooke had made false statements about his finances during the divorce, and that they were pertinent, but not material enough to have affected the outcome. Brooke was not charged with a crime, but the negative publicity cost him some support in his 1978 reelection campaign, and he lost to [[Paul Tsongas]].<ref name="jacobs" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/images/day5/01.htm |title=/ Photo gallery |publisher=Boston.com |date=June 16, 1978 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>United Press International, Galveston Daily News, [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/16988434/ Sen.
