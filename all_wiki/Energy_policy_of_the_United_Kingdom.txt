The current '''energy policy of the United Kingdom''' is the responsibility of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] (BEIS), after the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] was merged with the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] in 2016. Energy markets are also regulated by the [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]] (Ofgem).

Areas of focus for energy policy by the UK government have changed since the [[Electricity Act 1989]] and the [[Gas Act 1986]] privatised these utilities. The policy focuses of successive UK governments since the full liberalisation of gas and electricity markets in 1998 and 1999,<ref name="appgreport2012">{{cite report|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/38852/1/uk-energy-policy.pdf|title=UK Energy Policy 1980-2020|publisher=Institute for Engineering and Techology (ICT) and Parliamentary Group for Energy Studies|author-last1=Pearson|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Watson|author-first2=Jim|date=2012|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> have included managing energy prices, [[Decarbonisation Measures in Proposed UK Electricity Market Reform|decarbonisation]], the rollout of [[smart meters]], and improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the UK building stock.

==Overview==
The 2007 White Paper: "Meeting the Energy Challenge" set out the [[uk government|Government]]'s international and domestic [[energy (society)|energy]] strategy to address the long term energy challenges faced by the UK, and to deliver four policy goals:
# To put the UK on a path to cut [[carbon dioxide emissions]] by some 60% by about 2050, with real progress by 2020;
# To maintain [[energy security|reliable energy supplies]];
# To promote [[market competition|competitive markets]] in the UK and beyond, helping to raise the rate of [[sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]] and to improve [[productivity]]; and
# To ensure that every [[home]] is adequately and affordably [[heating|heated]].

The scope of energy policy includes the [[electricity generation|production]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]], [[transport]] [[fuel]] usage, and means of heating (significantly [[Natural Gas]]).
The policy recognises: "Energy is essential in almost every aspect of our lives and for the success of our [[economy]]. We face two long-term energy challenges:
* [[mitigation of global warming|Tackling climate change]] by reducing carbon dioxide emissions both within the UK and abroad; and
* Ensuring [[energy security|secure]], [[clean energy|clean]] and [[fuel poverty|affordable]] energy as we become increasingly dependent on imported fuel."

The policy also recognises that the UK will need around 30-35GW of new electricity generation capacity over the next two decades as many current [[coal fired power plant|coal]] and [[nuclear power stations]], built in the 1960s and 1970s, reach the end of their lives and are set to close.

The 2006 Energy Review reintroduced the prospect of new nuclear power stations in the UK.  Following a [[judicial review]] requested by [[Greenpeace]], on 15 February 2007 elements of the 2006 Energy Review were ruled 'seriously flawed', and 'not merely inadequate but also misleading'. As a result, plans to build a new generation of nuclear power stations were ruled illegal at that time. ''(See [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom#2006 Energy review|Nuclear power in the United Kingdom]] for details)''.  In response, the Government ran "The Future of Nuclear Power" consultation from May to October 2007.  The Government's response to the consultation conclusions, published in January 2008, state "set against the challenges of [[climate change]] and [[energy security|security]] of supply, the evidence in support of new nuclear power stations is compelling."

The January 2008 Energy Bill updates the [[legislation|legislative framework]] in the UK to reflect their current policy towards the [[energy market]] and the challenges faced on climate change and security of supply.  Key elements of the bill address nuclear, [[carbon capture and storage]], [[renewables]], and [[North Sea oil|offshore gas and oil]].  A framework to encourage investment in [[nuclear power]] within a new regulatory environment was simultaneously published in the January 2008 Nuclear White Paper.

In October 2008, the Government created the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] to bring together energy policy (previously with the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]]), and climate change mitigation policy (previously with the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]).

===Scotland===
Though energy policy is an area [[reserved powers|reserved]] to the UK government under the [[Scotland Act 1998]] that established devolved government for Scotland, the [[Scottish Government]] has an [[Energy policy of Scotland|energy policy for Scotland]] at variance with UK policy, and has planning powers to enable it to put some aspects of its policy priorities into effect.

== Energy markets ==
A ''Research and Markets'' review estimated the 2006 total market value of UK inland energy consumption was GBP 130.73bn. Consumption by the energy sector was valued at GBP 28.73bn, while the value of consumption by the non-energy sector was GBP 128.2bn, with [[transport]] being the largest component of the non-energy sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS82989+18-Feb-2008+BW20080218 |title=This Review Analyses the UK Market for Primary and Secondary Energy Together With Industry |publisher=Reuters.com |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>
The UK is currently proposing wide-ranging [[Decarbonisation Measures in Proposed UK Electricity Market Reform|reforms of its electricity market]], including measures such as [[contracts for difference]] for generators and a [[capacity market]] to ensure security of supply in the latter half of this decade.

==Primary energy sources of electricity supply==
[[File:DounreayJM.jpg|thumb|Decommissioned [[Dounreay]] nuclear power complex]]

Historically a country emphasising its nuclear and off-shore natural gas production, the United Kingdom is currently in transition to become a net energy importer.

In 2011 the percentage of electricity supply derived from [[primary energy]] sources was as follows:<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65895/5991-statistical-press-release-dukes-2012.pdf</ref>

*[[Natural gas]]: 41%
*[[Coal]]: 29%
*[[Nuclear power|Nuclear]]: 18%
*[[Renewables]]: 12%
*Other: 2%.

===Coal===
Coal usage may be expected to decline steadily because of eroding cost advantages and  pressure to reduce [[sulfur]] and carbon (carbon dioxide) emissions, notwithstanding ongoing subsidy policies designed to retain jobs in the [[coal mining]] industry. Future coal usage is highly dependent on legislative drivers on emissions and the need to have security of supply. Whilst the costs of burning coal with desulfurisation and carbon capture facilities is greatly increased, it is still being actively considered as part of the UK energy strategy due to large domestic reserves, higher price stability than natural gas and reduced capital expenditure and construction time for plant compared to nuclear power.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The 2002 Energy Review concluded that the option of new investment in [[clean coal technology]] (through [[carbon sequestration]]) needed to be kept open, and that practical measures should be taken to do this.<ref name="archive2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.piu.gov.uk/2002/energy/report/3.html |title=The Energy Review |date=24 February 2003 |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219233659/http://www.piu.gov.uk/2002/energy/report/3.html |archive-date=19 December 2003 }}</ref>

In November 2015, it was announced by the UK Government that all coal fired power stations would be closed by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34851718|title=UK's coal plants to close by 2025|date=18 November 2015|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=UK coal plants must close by 2025, Amber Rudd announces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12001752/UK-coal-plants-must-close-by-2025-Amber-Rudd-to-announce.html|date=18 November 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=7 March 2016|location=London|first=Emily|last=Gosden}}</ref>

[[Ironbridge Power Station|Ironbridge]] ceased operations in late 2015. Then in 2016, three power stations closed at [[Rugeley Power Station|Rugeley]], [[Ferrybridge Power Station|Ferrybridge]] and [[Longannet Power Station|Longannet]]. [[Eggborough Power Station|Eggborough]] closed in 2018 and has been granted consent to convert into a gas fired power station. [[Lynemouth power station|Lynemouth]] power station was converted to run on [[biomass]] in 2018 and [[Uskmouth power stations|Uskmouth]] is being converted. It has been announced that [[Cottam power stations|Cottam]] will close in 2019 and [[Kilroot power station|Kilroot]] will also close imminently.

In May 2016, for the first time solar power produced more electricity than coal, producing 1.33TWh over the month compared to 0.9TWh from coal.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK solar eclipses coal power over month for first time.|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/solar-sets-british-record-for-may-producing-more-electricity-than-coal|date=7 June 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 June 2016|location=London|first=Damian|last=Carrington}}</ref> On 21 April 2017, for the first time since the 19th century, the UK had a 24-hour period without any generation from coal power.<ref>{{cite news|title=British power generation achieves first ever coal-free day|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/britain-set-for-first-coal-free-day-since-the-industrial-revolution|date=22 April 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 April 2017|location=London}}</ref> As of 2018, the use of coal power is decreasing to historic lows not seen since before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Coal supplied 5.4% of UK electricity in 2018, down from 7% in 2017, 9% in 2016, 23% in 2015 and 30% in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Countdown to 2025: Tracking the UK coal phase out|url=http://www.carbonbrief.org/countdown-to-2025-tracking-the-uk-coal-phase-out|date=10 February 2016|work=Carbon Brief|accessdate=7 March 2016|first=Simon|last=Evans}}</ref>

===Gas===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a massive expansion in [[natural gas|gas-fired]] generation capacity, known as the [[Dash for Gas]].  The rapidity of construction of gas-fired plants (compared to coal-fired or nuclear plants) was especially attractive due to the high interest rates of the period.

Natural gas looks set to take a smaller part in providing future UK energy needs. Domestic production from the [[North Sea]] gas fields continues to lessen. And despite investment to enhance [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and storage of imported natural gas (mostly from [[Norway]]) there is a reluctance to allow too great a reliance on [[Russia]] and its gas exports for energy needs.

By 2021, North Sea oil and natural gas production is predicted to slip 75 percent from 2005 levels to less than one million barrels per year. Oil and coal reserves for all of Europe are among the most tenuous in the developed world: for example, Europe's reserves to annual consumption ratio stands at 3.0,<ref>{{cite book |first=Ron |last=Nielsen |title=The little green handbook |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-312-42581-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/littlegreenhandb00ronn }}</ref> perilously low by world standards.

A new "dash for gas" was announced by energy secretary [[Amber Rudd]] in November 2015. This is required to fill the gap between the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2025 and the delayed opening of new nuclear power stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simplyswitch.com/amber-rudd-criticised-for-focus-on-gas/|title=Amber Rudd Criticised for Focus on Gas – Simply Switch|date=19 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner|title=UK to close all coal power plants in switch to gas and nuclear|first=Rowena|last=Mason|date=18 November 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

===Nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power in the United Kingdom}}
Following the UK Government's January 2008 decision to support the building of new nuclear power stations, EDF announced that it plans to open four new plants in the UK by 2017. EON and Centrica have also shown interest in building further plants.  It is unlikely that more nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland as the [[Scottish Government]] is opposed.

===Renewable energy===
{{Main|Renewable energy in the United Kingdom}}
From the mid-1990s [[renewable energy]] began to contribute to the electricity generated in the United Kingdom, adding to a small [[hydroelectricity]] generating capacity. Renewable energy sources provided for 6.7 per cent of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in 2009,<ref name=DUKES>{{cite web|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Statistics/publications/dukes/313-dukes-2010-ch7.pdf |title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES) |page=184 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306062621/http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Statistics/publications/dukes/313-dukes-2010-ch7.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> rising to 11.3% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225043/statistics_press_notice_2013.pdf |title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: Digest of United Kingdom energy statistics (DUKES)|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>

==Energy end usage==
:''See main article [[Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom]]''
For 2005, the break down of UK energy usage by sector was approximately:
*[[Transport]]: 35%
*[[Space heating]]: 26%
*[[Industrial sector|Industrial]]: 10%
*[[Water heating]]: 8%
*[[Lighting]]/small electrics: 6%
There is a steady increase of fuel usage driven by an increasingly affluent and mobile population, so that fuel use increased by ten percent in the decade ending 2000.  This trend is expected to be mitigated by increased percentage of more efficient diesel and [[hybrid vehicle]]s.

United Kingdom space and hot water heating consume a greater share of end use compared to the US and more mild southern [[Europe]]an or [[tropical]] [[climate]]s.  With regard to building and planning issues affecting energy use, the UK has developed guidance documents to promote [[energy conservation]] through local councils, especially as set forth in Part L of the Building Regulations (Conservation of Fuel and power).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1164177 |title=Department for Communities and Local Government – GOV.UK |publisher=Odpm.gov.uk |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825003847/http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1164177 |archive-date=25 August 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>  The associated document. Part 2B, addresses commercial uses, and is generally complete as to heating issues; the guidance is lacking on lighting issues, except with guidelines for local switching of lighting controls.  In particular there are no standards set forth for illumination levels, and [[over-illumination]] is one of the most significant unneeded costs of commercial energy use.

From June 2007 buildings in the England and Wales have to undergo [[Energy Performance Certificate|Energy Performance Certification]] before they are sold or let, to meet the requirements of the [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings|European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882&PressNoticeID=2174 |title=Government launches compulsory energy rating for homes to help cut carbon emissions.

==Energy market policy history==

===1980s market liberalisation===
Under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] during the 1980s and 1990s, Government policy was one of market [[Liberalization|liberalisation]] linked to the [[Privatization|privatisation]] of state controlled energy companies and the dismantling of the [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]].

As a consequence, Government no longer has the ability to directly control the energy markets. Regulation is now carried out through the [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]] (OFGEM) in Great Britain, and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uregni.gov.uk/|title=Utility Regulator|website=www.uregni.gov.uk|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> while energy policy is largely limited to influencing the operation of the market. Such influence is exerted through taxation (such as North Sea Oil Tax<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4500540.stm |title=Business &#124; Brown doubles North Sea oil tax |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>), subsidy (such as the [[United Kingdom Climate Change Programme#Renewables Obligation|Renewables Obligation]]), incentives, planning controls, the underwriting of liabilities (such as those carried by the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]]), grants, and funding for research.

===1990s to 2000s===
The UK Government continued to make reforms throughout the 1990s in the interests of creating a competitive energy market. VAT was first applied to domestic energy in 1994.<ref name="appgreport2012"></ref>

When the Labour Government came to power in 1997, the commitment to creating a competitive energy market was maintained, with new Energy Minister [[John Battle (politician)|John Battle]] MP also emphasising the Government's social obligation to protect the poorest households and its environmental commitments.<ref name="appgreport2012"></ref> 

The Labour Government introduced [[Winter Fuel Payment]]s for people aged over 60 and, in its first major piece of energy legislation, passed the [[Utilities Act 2000]]. This legislation implemented a licensing system for energy suppliers and created the [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets|Gas and Electricity Market Authority]] and Ofgem as a regulator, and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council (known as Energywatch) as a statutory body with responsibility for protecting and promoting the interests of gas and electricity consumers in Great Britain. 

In 1999, the process of full liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets had been completed when all UK households were able to switch their gas or electricity supplier. Households were encouraged to save money on their gas and electricity bills by switching between different energy providers, with about a third of gas and electricity customers switching between 1998 and 2003.<ref name="bbcfeb2003">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1578972.stm|title=Q&A: Switching energy supplier|work=BBC News|date=2003-02-03|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> By the mid-2000s, the market was dominated by what became known as the [[Big Six energy suppliers]], constisting of [[British Gas]], [[EDF Energy]], [[E.ON]], [[npower (United Kingdom)|npower]], [[Scottish Power]], and [[SSE plc|SSE]]. 

Parliament also passed the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, a [[Private_Members%27_Bills_in_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|private member's bill]] introduced by Conservative MP [[David Amess]], which set out the Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy - defining "fuel poverty" as any household living on a lower income in a home which cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost - with a commitment to eliminate fuel poverty by 2016.

In 2008, Ofgem launched its Energy Supply Probe as its first major investigation of competition in the electricity and gas markets since the full liberalisation of the two markets. The Probe found there were a range of features in these markets that weakened competition, but found no evidence of a [[cartel]] or that retail energy price rises could not be justified by wholesale costs.<ref name="ofgemprobe2008">{{cite report|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/sites/default/files/docs/2008/10/energy-supply-probe---initial-findings-report.pdf|title=Energy Supply Probe - Initial Findings Report|publisher=Ofgem.gov.uk|date=2008-10-06|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref><ref name="bbcnews20081006">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7654734.stm|title=What the energy market probe means for you|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-06|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

===2010 to present===
In the run-up to the 2010 election, the Labour Government passed the [[Energy Act 2010]]. Among other reforms, this introduced the Warm Home Discount scheme, which came into effect in 2011, and which placed a legal obligation on larger energy suppliers to deliver support to people living in fuel poverty or in a fuel poverty risk group. This replaced a number of other schemes giving reduced tariffs to some low-income customers.<ref name="ofgemwhd2011">{{cite report|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem-publications/58952/warm-home-discount-guidance-licensed-electricity-suppliers-and-licensed-gas-suppliers-pdf|title=Warm Home Discount: Guidance for Licensed Electricity Suppliers and Licensed Gas Suppliers|date=2011-05-19|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

Partly in response to increasing concerns about the pricing of energy tariffs by suppliers, Ofgem followed up its Energy Supply Probe with a Retail Market Review, which it launched in November 2010. <ref name="ofgemreview2010">{{cite report|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem-publications/39708/rmrfinal.pdf|title=The Retail Market Review - Findings and initial proposals|publisher=Ofgem.gov.uk|date=2011-03-21|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> The review found that complexity in the gas and electricity markets was a barrier to consumers and competition. It found that 75% of consumers were on their supplier's standard "evergreen" tariffs (also called "Standard Variable Tariffs" or SVTs), the more expensive default option than fixed-term tariffs that would save them money over a set period of time. It also found that that energy prices tended to rise in response to wholesale cost increases more quickly than they fell with decreases, and that competition was weakened by significant barriers that were preventing new suppliers from entering the market. They proposed a series of measures including changing some license conditions of suppliers, to make pricing more transparent and reduce barriers for new suppliers to compete for customers, as well as working to improve consumer trust in [[comparison shopping website|price comparison website]]s.<ref name="ofgemreview2010"></ref>

The [[Coalition Government]] elected in 2010 published their own white paper on energy in 2011, which focused on decarbonisation and security of supply, but which backed Ofgem's findings and proposed reforms.<ref name="whitepaper2011">{{cite report|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48129/2176-emr-white-paper.pdf|title=Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low‑carbon electricity|publisher=Department for Energy and Climate Change|date=July 2011|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> Advocates for further reform included the consumer group [[Which?]] and Consumer Focus (later [[Consumer Futures]]), the statutory body formerly known as Energywatch.<ref name="hoclibrary2013">{{cite report|url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06440/|title=Simplifying Energy Tariffs|publisher=House of Commons Library|author-last1=Richards|author-first1=Patsy|author-last2=White|author-first2=Edward|date=2013-08-15|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

The Government later announced its intention to force energy suppliers to offer their cheapest tariffs to consumers, and subsequently made amendments in the [[Energy Act 2013]] to give Ofgem greater powers.<ref name="hoclibrary2013"></ref> In 2014, the Government amended the legislative Fuel Poverty Strategy for England to target improving as many fuel poor homes as is reasonably practicable to a minimum energy efficiency rating of Band C, by the end of 2030.<ref name="govfps2014">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/fuel-poverty-strategy-for-england|title=Fuel poverty strategy for England|publisher=Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|date=2019-07-22|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

On 24 September 2013, the Leader of the Labour Party and former Secretary of State for Energy, [[Ed Miliband]], announced plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if Labour won the next general election, saying the move would save average households £120 and businesses £1,800. <ref name="bbcnews20130824">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-24213366|title=Ed Miliband: Labour would freeze energy prices|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2013-09-24|accessdate=2020-10-21}},</ref> The announcement was criticised by energy suppliers, and labelled "Marxist" and potentially "catastrophic" by the Government, but was supported by around two-thirds of the British public.<ref name="cif2013">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-tories|title=Ed Miliband's energy price freeze policy has sent the Tories into a tailspin|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Wood|first=Stewart|date=2013-10-14|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

====Default tariff energy price cap====
In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] made a commitment that the Conservative Party manifesto would include a policy to apply price controls to energy bills. May wrote in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, saying that "the energy market is not working for ordinary working families" and that if she was re-elected she would introduce a price cap policy that would save households up to £100 each.<ref name="independent20170308">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-price-controls-energy-bills-ed-miliband-freeze-general-election-2017-latest-a7725271.html|title=Theresa May lays out plan for state to control energy prices|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Stone|first=Jon|date=2017-03-08|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

The ''Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill 2018'' was introduced in legislation and had its first reading on 26 February 2018, following a period of pre-legislative scrutiny from the cross-party Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee.<ref name="govuk20180226">{{cite press release|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-introduces-new-legislation-to-cap-poor-value-energy-tariffs-in-time-for-next-winter|title=Government introduces new legislation to cap poor value energy tariffs in time for next winter|publisher=Gov.uk|date=2018-02-26|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> The legislation completed its passage through Parliament on 18 July 2018 and received Royal Assent the next day.<ref name="govuk20180719">{{cite press release|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/victory-for-consumers-as-cap-on-energy-tariffs-to-become-law|title=Victory for consumers as cap on energy tariffs to become law|publisher=Gov.uk|date=2018-07-19|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

The Tariff Cap Act stipulated that the price cap would be in place from the end of 2018 until 2020, when Ofgem would recommend whether the cap should remain on an annual basis up to 2023. Ofgem would also review the level of the cap at least every 6 months while it is in place.<ref name="govuk20180719"></ref>

In September 2018, Ofgem proposed that the initial level of the "'''default tariff price cap'''" would mean that energy suppliers would not be allowed to charge more than £1,136 a year for a typical dual fuel customer paying by direct debit, and that this would save than 11m British households on default or standard variable tariffs an average of £75 a year on their gas and electricity bills.<ref name="ft20180906">{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/45108614-b19c-11e8-99ca-68cf89602132|title=Energy price cap set to benefit 11m households|author-last1=McCormick|author-first1=Myles|author-last2=Sheppard|author-first2=David|work=Financial Times|date=2018-09-06|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref> 

The price of the cap is set for each unit of gas and electricity used (‘kWh’) plus a daily standing charge so that it varies with consumption. Ofgem designed the cap level to take into account several different factors: wholesale energy costs (how much a supplier has to pay to get the gas and electricity to supply households with energy), energy network costs (the regional costs of building, maintaining and operating the pipes and wires that carry energy across the country), policy costs (the costs related to government social and environmental schemes to save energy, reduce emissions and encourage take-up of renewable energy), operating costs (the costs incurred for suppliers to deliver billing and metering services, including smart metering), payment method uplift allowance (the additional costs incurred through billing customers with different payment methods), headroom allowance (allowing suppliers to manage uncertainty in their costs), Earnings Before Interest & Taxes, or "EBIT" (a rate of return on suppliers’ investments), and [[Value-added tax|VAT]] (5% tax added to the level of the tariff). 

In November 2018, Ofgem finished its consultation and published its decision that the first level of the cap would be set at £1,137 a year for a typical direct debit dual fuel bill in November 2018.<ref name="ofgemdecision2018">{{cite report|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2018/11/decision_-_default_tariff_cap_-_overview_document_0.pdf|title=Decision – Default tariff cap – Overview document|publisher=Ofgem.gov.uk|date=2018-11-06|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

The energy price cap then came into force from 1 January 2019. At its initial level, the cost of electricity for those on default tariffs was capped at 17p per kWh, with gas was capped at 4p per kWh. Dual fuel users would pay no more than £177 a year for a standing charge, electricity-only users would pay no more than £83, and gas users £94.<ref name="bbcnews20190101">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46720908|title=Energy price cap comes into force|last=Peachey|first=Kevin|work=BBC News|date=2019-01-01|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

The first change in the level of the price cap was announced in February 2019, with the cap level rising by £117 for typical direct debit dual fuel bills from 1 April 2019, a rise that Ofgem .<ref name="bbcnews20190207"> ">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47133564|title=Energy prices to increase for millions as Ofgem raises cap|last=Peachey|first=Kevin|work=BBC News|date=2019-02-07|accessdate=2020-10-21}}</ref>

==Energy supply and decarbonisation policy history==
===Early 2000s: climate change rises up the agenda===
In 2005, the Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] commissioned [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]] to look into the economics of climate change. The influential Stern Report concluded that climate change was the "greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen".<ref name="appgreport2012"></ref>

Joining over 170 other nations, the UK committed to reduction<ref>''Carbon Abatement Technology for Fossil Fuels'', UK DTI, 2005</ref> of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, with consequent constraints to its [[energy policy]].  The UK produced four percent of the world's [[greenhouse gas]]es as of 2003, compared to 23 percent by the US<ref>''In Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change'', Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, US DOE, 2006</ref> and 20 percent for the rest of [[Europe]].  The long-term reduction goal for carbon emissions is 80 percent decrease by 2050.  A scheme of trading for carbon [[emission credits]] has been developed in Europe that will allow some of the reduction to arise from economic transactions.

Road transport emissions reduction has been stimulated since 1999 by the banding of [[Vehicle Excise Duty]].  Bands for new vehicles are based on the results of a laboratory test, designed to calculate the theoretical potential emissions of the vehicle in grammes of CO<sub>2</sub> per kilometre travelled, under ideal conditions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fuel's gold – the cost of carbon emissions |first=Andrew |last=English

[[Aviation fuel]] is not regulated under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], so that if the UK is successful in carbon emission reduction, [[aviation]] will constitute 25 percent of UK generated [[greenhouse gas]]es by 2030.

The UK government has one project in the planning stage for natural gas fed power generation with carbon capture by seawater.  This facility is contemplated at [[Peterhead]], [[Scotland]], a relatively remote exposure to the [[North Sea]].

Prof Kevin Anderson raised concern about the growing [[Environmental impact of aviation|effect of air transport on the climate]] in a paper<ref>{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=K. |last2= Bows |first2=A. |year= 2008  |title=Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends.

Anderson claims that even at a reduced annual rate of increase in UK passenger air travel and with the government's targeted emissions reductions in other energy use sectors, by 2030 aviation would be causing 70% of the UK's allowable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

===Energy White Paper, 2003===
The UK Government published its White Paper on Energy ("Our Energy Future – creating a Low Carbon Economy") in 2003, establishing a formal energy policy for the UK for the first time in 20 years.  Essentially, the White Paper recognised that a limitation of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO2 – the main gas contributing to [[global climate change]]) was going to be necessary.  It committed the UK to working towards a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, and identified business opportunities in so doing: a recurrent theme throughout the document was "cleaner, smarter energy".  It also claimed to be based on four pillars: the environment, energy reliability, affordable energy for the poorest and competitive markets.

The White Paper focused more on analysing the issues than in providing detailed policy responses.  Some detail began to filter through in a series of follow-on documents, including an Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan (April 2004) and the DTI Microgeneration Strategy "Our Energy Challenge" (March 2006).  Nonetheless, most of the policies were a continuation of business as usual, with emphasis on market-led solutions and an expectation that consumers act rationally, for example in installing energy efficiency measures to make running cost savings.

In November 2005 it was announced that the Government, under DTI leadership, would undertake a full scale Energy Review, and over 500 organisations and individuals made detailed submissions as part of this review.  Officially, the review was to take stock of the outcomes to date of the White Paper, which a particular focus on cutting carbon (emissions of which remained stubbornly high) and to look in more detail at security of supply, as the UK's oil and gas production from the [[North Sea]] had peaked, and Russia was seen as being a high-risk supplier of gas.

Unofficially, it was widely felt that the real reason behind the review was to allow [[nuclear power]] back into the energy debate, as it had been sidelined in the 2003 White Paper.  That document had said "This white paper does not contain specific proposals for building new nuclear power stations. However we do not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new nuclear build might be necessary if we are to meet our carbon targets. Before any decision to proceed with the building of new nuclear power stations, there will need to be the fullest public consultation and the publication of a further white paper setting out our proposals."  The Energy Review was therefore to be this public consultation.

===Energy Review, 2006===
In the light of a fast changing world energy context, increasing [[energy dependence|dependence]] on oil and gas imports, concerns about [[carbon emissions]], and a need to accelerate investment in electricity infrastructure and power stations the UK Government undertook the 2006 Energy Review.  One aspect of the 2006 Review dealt with development of nuclear power.  [[Greenpeace]] challenged the Government's process of consultation on proposals to develop nuclear power and following a [[judicial review]] requested by [[Greenpeace]], on 15 February 2007 the consultation process was ruled 'seriously flawed', and 'not merely inadequate but also misleading'. As a result, plans to build a new generation of [[nuclear power plant]]s were delayed while the UK Government reran the consultation process in a way that complied with the court's decision. ''See [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom#2006 Energy review|Nuclear power in the United Kingdom]] for details''.

====Contents====
The Energy Review Report 2006 came out as a broader and more balanced document than critics (in advance) had expected.  It started by reiterating the Government's four long-term goals for energy policy:

*To put the UK on a path to cut [[carbon dioxide emissions]] by some 60% by about 2050, with real progress by 2020;
*To maintain reliable energy supplies;
*To promote competitive markets in the UK and beyond, helping to raise the rate of sustainable economic growth and to improve productivity; and
*To ensure that every home is adequately and affordably heated.

It then identified two major long-term energy challenges:

*Tackling climate change, along with other nations, as global carbon emissions from human activity continue to grow; and
*Delivering secure, clean energy at affordable prices, as we become increasingly dependent on imports for our energy needs.

The Review took an internationalist response, stressing that the world's economies need to get on a path to being significantly less carbon-intensive, and noting rising global demand, especially from countries such as India and China. This means using less energy in products and services and changing the way energy is produced so that more of it comes from [[low-carbon power|low-carbon]] sources.  It also identified the need for a fairer distribution of energy around the world, and identified that many resources, especially of fossil fuels which are concentrated in just a few countries.

It placed its main concerns and proposals into three groups:

'''''Saving Energy'''''

The starting point for reducing carbon emissions is to save energy. The challenge is to secure the heat, light and energy we need in homes and businesses in a way that cuts the amount of oil, gas and
electricity used and the carbon dioxide emitted.  Actions proposed include:

*Increasing information, e.g. through [[Home Information Pack]]s
*Raising basic standards, removing inefficient goods from the market
*Making best use of the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] and [[Climate Change Levy]]
*Making the Government estate [[carbon neutral]] by 2012
*Increasing the focus on energy efficient transport

'''''Cleaner Energy'''''

Cost-effective ways of using less energy will help move towards the carbon reduction goal. But on their own they will not provide the solution to the challenges faced: there is also a need to make the energy used cleaner.  Under this head, the Government considered:

*more distributed energy generation including low-carbon heat
*more use of community based systems, including [[Cogeneration|CHP]]
*a strong commitment to [[carbon pricing]] in the UK, through improving the operation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
*a strengthened commitment to the [[Renewables Obligation]]
*proposals for reform of the planning regime for electricity projects
*a clear statement of our position on new nuclear build
*support for carbon capture and storage
*developing alternative fuels for transport

'''''The Energy Security Challenge'''''

The challenges of reducing carbon emissions and ensuring [[Energy security|security of supply]] are closely linked. Security of supply requires that we have good access to available fuel supplies, the infrastructure in place to transport them to centres of demand and effective markets so that supply meets demand in the most efficient way. Many of the measures already described for tackling carbon emissions also contribute to the healthy diversity of energy sources that is necessary for meeting the energy security challenge.

There are two main security of supply challenges for the UK:

*Managing increased dependence on oil and gas imports, especially in the light of the global distribution of energy reserves and growing international demand; and
*Ensuring that the market delivers substantial and timely investment in electricity generating capacity and networks so that households and businesses have the electricity they need at affordable prices.

The Government's response is to continue to open up markets and to work internationally to develop strong relationships with suppliers, developing liberalised markets.

So where does [[nuclear power in the United Kingdom|nuclear power]] fit within this debate?  Although it is mentioned a lot more in the Review compared to the White Paper (441 times, compared to 55 to be exact), the Government does not propose building new stations itself.  Instead, it will leave it to the market, although it will ease some of the planning constraints (which it also aims to do for renewables) and look into providing a design authorisation procedure.  As with many other aspects of the Energy Review Response, the document is not likely to be the last word on the subject, as there are plans for further consultation, and the establishment of further reviews and studies in issues such as identifying suitable sites, and managing the costs of decommissioning and long term waste management.

===Energy White Paper, 2007===
The 2007 Energy White Paper: ''Meeting the Energy Challenge''<ref name="2007EWP">[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205174605/http:/www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/publications/white_paper_07/file39387.pdf 2007 Energy White Paper: Meeting the Energy Challenge], ''[[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'', published 2007-05-23, accessed 25 May 2007</ref> was published on 23 May 2007. The 2007 White Paper outlines the Government's international and domestic strategy for responding to two main  challenges:<ref name="2007EWP" />
*cutting [[carbon emissions]] to tackle [[global warming]]
*ensuring secure, clean and affordable energy as imports replace declining production from [[North Sea oil|North Sea oil and gas]]
It seeks to do this in a way that is consistent with its four energy policy goals:<ref name="2007EWP" />
*cutting the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by some 60% by about 2050, with real progress by 2020;
*maintaining the reliability of energy supplies;
*promoting competitive markets in the UK and beyond, helping to raise the rate of sustainable economic growth and to improve productivity; and
*ensuring that every home is adequately and affordably heated.

The paper anticipates that it will be necessary to install 30–35 [[gigawatt|GW]] of new [[electricity generation]] capacity within 20 years to plug the energy gap resulting from increased demand and the expected closure of existing power plants. It also states that, based on existing policies, renewable energy is likely to contribute around 5% of the UK's consumption by 2020,<ref name="2007EWP" /><!--page 23--> rather than the 20% target mentioned in the 2006 Energy Review.

'''''Proposed Energy Strategy'''''

In summary, the government's proposed strategy involves 6 components:<ref name="2007EWP" />
*Establishing an international framework to tackle climate change, including the [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|stabilisation of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations]] and a stronger [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]]
*Providing legally binding carbon targets for the whole UK economy, reducing emissions through the implementation of the [[United Kingdom Climate Change Bill|Climate Change Bill]].
*Making further progress in achieving fully competitive and transparent international markets, including further liberalisation of the European Union energy market.
*Encouraging more [[energy conservation|energy saving]] through better information, incentives and regulation
*Providing more support for low carbon technologies, including increased international and domestic public-private sector collaboration in the areas of research, development, demonstration and deployment – for example though the launch of the [[United Kingdom Energy Technologies Institute|Energy Technologies Institute]] and the [[Environmental Transformation Fund]].

To achieve the government's aims, the White Paper proposes a number of practical measures, including:<ref name="2007EWP" />

'''''Energy conservation'''''

Businesses:
*A new mandatory [[cap and trade]] scheme for organisations consuming more than 6,000 [[MWh]] of electricity per year, to be known as the [[Carbon Reduction Commitment]].
*The introduction of [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s for business premises and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s for public sector organisations.
*The extension of [[smart meter]]ing to most business premises within 5 years.
Homes:
*A requirement for all new homes to be [[zero-carbon building]]s as soon as practically possible and  preferably by 2016.
*Improving the energy efficiency of existing homes.
*Improving the efficiency of [[consumer electronics]] and [[domestic appliances]], and the possible phase-out of [[incandescent light bulb|inefficient light bulbs]] by around 2011.
*Increasing the [[Carbon Emission Reduction Target]] for the electricity and gas industries for 2008–2011.
*A requirement that new domestic [[electricity meter]]s should have [[Real-time computing|real time]] displays from 2008, and a commitment to upgrade existing domestic meters on request.
Transport:
*The introduction of a [[Low Carbon Transport Innovation Strategy]]
*Support for including aviation within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme

'''''Energy supply'''''
*The introduction of a [[Biomass Strategy]] to expand the use of [[biomass]] as an energy source.
*Measures to grow [[distributed generation|distributed electricity generation]] and distributed heat generation alongside the centralised system.
*A reconfirmation that, under the [[Renewables Obligation]], renewable energy should supply 10% of electricity generation by 2010, an 'aspiration' to achieve 20% by 2020, together with the introduction of bands within the Obligation to support different renewable technologies.
*The launch in November 2007 of a competition to demonstrate commercial-scale [[carbon capture and storage]] technology
*A 'preliminary view is that it is in the public interest to give the private sector the option of investing in new [[nuclear power in the United Kingdom|nuclear power]] stations'. A consultation on this was launched at the same time as the White Paper.
*The introduction of the [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] in 2008–2009, with a commitment that [[biofuel]]s should provide 5% of transport fuel by 2010–2011.
*Measures to support the recovery of the remaining oil and gas reserves from the North Sea.
*Removing barriers to developing new energy infrastructure and power plants through reform of [[planning permission]] processes, as detailed in the 2007 Planning White Paper: ''Planning for a Sustainable Future.''

'''''Response of the Scottish Government'''''

The [[Scottish Government]] responded to the UK government paper by making clear that it was against new nuclear power stations being built in Scotland and had the power to prevent any being built{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.  In a statement to parliament, Energy Minister [[Jim Mather]] stated "Members will be aware that Greenpeace, backed by the courts, have forced the UK Government to consult properly on the future role of nuclear power. We will respond and we will make clear that we do not want and do not need new nuclear power in Scotland. If an application were to be submitted for a new nuclear power station that will be for Scottish Ministers to determine. We would be obliged to look at it – but given our policy position, our generating capacity, our multiplicity of energy sources and our strong alternative strategies such an application would be unlikely to find favour with this administration."<ref>[http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/News/This-Week/Speeches/energypolicy Statement to Scottish Parliament, May 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202225853/http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/News/This-Week/Speeches/energypolicy |date=2 December 2008 }}</ref>

===Climate Change Act, 2008===
{{Main|Climate Change Act 2008}}
On 13 March 2007, a draft [[Climate Change Act 2008|Climate Change Bill]] was published following cross-party pressure over several years, led by environmental groups. The Act puts in place a framework to achieve a mandatory 80% cut in the UK's [[carbon emissions]] by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.<ref>[http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000610/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], published 13 March 2007, accessed 13 March 2007.</ref> The Bill was passed into law in November 2008.<ref>http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/pdf/ukpga_20080027_en.pdf</ref> With its passing the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law, or to create such a legally binding framework.<ref>[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climate/legislation/index.htm UK – Adaptation in the Climate Change Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011095837/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climate/legislation/index.htm |date=11 October 2009 }}, Defra</ref>

The [[Committee on Climate Change]], whose powers are invested by Part 2 of the Act, was formally launched in December 2008 with [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Lord Adair Turner]] as its chair.

In April 2009 the Government set a requirement for a 34% cut in emissions by 2020, in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, and announced that details of how this would be achieved would be published in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/22/carbon-emissions-budget-20091|title=Budget 2009: Darling promises 34% emissions cuts with world's first binding carbon budgets|first=Juliette|last=Jowit|date=22 April 2009|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

* Over 1.2 million people will be employed in green jobs.
* The efficiency of 7 million homes will have been upgraded, with over 1.5 million of them generating renewable energy.
* 40% of electricity will be generated from low carbon sources (renewables, nuclear power and clean coal).
* Gas imports will be 50% lower than would otherwise have been the case.
* The average new car will emit 40% less carbon compared to 2009 levels.

=== Energy Bill, 2012–2013 ===

The [[Energy Act 2013|Energy Bill 2012–2013]] aims to close a number of coal power stations over the next two decades, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and has financial incentives to reduce energy demand. The construction of a new generation of nuclear power stations will be facilitated, helped by the establishment of a new Office for Nuclear Regulation. Government climate change targets are to produce 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% on 1990 levels by 2025 and by 80% on 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20539981 Energy Bill to create 'low carbon economy', says Davey] bbc 29 November 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20458326 Energy bill Q&A] bbc 29 November 2012</ref>

=== Select Committee report, 2016 ===

The Energy and Climate Change [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] reported on 15{{nbsp}}October 2016 on upcoming challenges for energy and climate policy. The committee recommended investment in [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] on the supply side and in [[efficient energy use|efficiency technologies]] that smooth out demand peaks, by switching devices off and on and running them at lower power during times of stress, for example.<ref name="harvey-2016">

== Implementing Policy: Government oversight ==
Government supervision of the coal, gas and electricity industries was established in the nineteenth century. Since then specific departments of state and regulatory bodies have had responsibility for policy implementation, regulation and control.

=== History ===
The supply of energy in the nineteenth century – in the form of coal, gas and electricity – was largely by private companies and municipal gas and electricity undertakings. Public control of these supplies was generally in the hands of local authorities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=Trevor I.|title=A History of the British Gas Industry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1981|isbn=0198581572|location=Oxford|pages=40–41}}</ref> Such control was exercised through limiting prices and dividends and by encouraging competition. State intervention was through legislation such as the ''Mines and Collieries Act 1842'', and the ''Gasworks Clauses Act 1847'' which restricted company dividends to ten per cent.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Electric Lighting Acts 1882 to 1909|''Electric Lighting Act 1882'']] established control over electricity supply industry from its earliest days. It required undertakings to obtain a License or Order from the [[Board of Trade]] to generate and supply electricity. The Board of Trade and the Home Office therefore provided early oversight and control of the energy industries.

=== New Government bodies ===
Between 1919 and 1941 the newly created [[Ministry of Transport]] assumed control of the electricity industry. Under wartime conditions the Ministry of Fuel and Power was established in 1942 to coordinate energy supplies. UK Government policy was enacted through a succession of Ministries and Departments. These are summarised in the following table.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Hannah|first=Leslie|title=Electricity before Nationalisation|publisher=MacMillan|year=1979|isbn=0333220862|location=London}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=The Electricity Council|title=Electricity Supply in the United  Kingdom: a Chronology|publisher=The Electricity Council|year=1987|isbn=085188105X|location=London}}</ref>

== Fossil energy public support ==
[[David Cameron]] announced subsidies for the [[North Sea oil]] and gas industry in March 2014 resulting in the production of 3-4bn more barrels of oil "than would otherwise have been produced".<ref>[The UK government is playing both sides of the climate conflict] The Guardian 3 March 2014</ref>

==Renewable energy targets==

The first targets for renewable energy, 5% of by the end of 2003 and 10% by 2010 'subject to the cost to consumers being acceptable' were set by [[Helen Liddell]] in 2000.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120722232153/http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/sources/renewables/policy/renewables-obligation/key-stages/order-2002/page42163.html New and renewable energy: prospects for the 21st Century. Conclusions in response to the public consultation], [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], DTI/Pub 4649/9k/1/00/NP, URN 00/590, January 2000.</ref>

The UK Government's goal for [[renewable energy]] production is to produce 20% of electricity in the UK by 2020. The 2002 Energy Review<ref name="archive2002"/> set a target of 10% to be in place by 2010/2011. The target was increased to 15% by 2015 and most recently the 2006 Energy Review further set a target of 20% by 2020.

Subsequently, the Low Carbon Transition Plan of 2009 made clear that by 2020 the UK would need to produce 30% of its electricity, 12% of its heat and 10% of its fuels from renewable sources.<ref>The Low Carbon Transition Plan and Press Notice</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.anaerobic-digestion.com/general/uk-low-carbon-transition-plan-summary|title=The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan – Summary and Update – The Anaerobic Digestion Biofuels Blog|date=1 February 2015}}</ref>

For [[Scotland]], the [[Scottish Government]] has a target of generating 100% of electricity from renewables by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25451385 |title=BBC News – Renewable energy use at record high in Scotland |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>  Renewables located in Scotland count towards both the Scottish target and to the overall target for the UK.

Although [[renewable energy]] sources have not played a major role in the UK historically, there is potential for significant use of [[tidal power]] and [[wind energy]] (both on-shore and [[wind farms in the UK|off-shore]]) as recognised by formal UK policies, including the ''Energy White Paper'' and directives to councils<ref>[http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planning/planningpolicyguidance/planningpolicystatements/planningpolicystatements/pps22/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423000415/http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planning/planningpolicyguidance/planningpolicystatements/planningpolicystatements/pps22/ |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref> in the form of PPS 22. The [[Renewables Obligation]] acts as the central mechanism for support of renewable sources of electricity in the UK, and should provide subsidies approaching one billion [[pounds sterling]] per annum by 2010. A number of other grants and smaller support mechanisms aim to support less established renewables. In addition, renewables have been exempted from the [[Climate Change Levy]] that affects all other energy sources.

The amount of renewable generation added in 2004 was 250 [[megawatt]]s and 500 megawatts in 2005.  There is also a program established for [[micro-generation]] (less than 50 KWe (kilowatt electrical) or 45 KWt (kilowatt thermal) from a low carbon source)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/60019--a.htm#26 |title=The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> as well as a [[Solar cell|solar]] voltaic program.  By comparison both [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] have photovoltaic (solar cell) programmes much larger than the installed base in the UK. [[Hydroelectric]] energy is not a viable option for most of the UK due to terrain and lack of force of [[river]]s.

===Biofuels===

The government has established a goal of five percent of the total [[transport]] [[fuel]] that must be from renewable sources (e.g. ethanol, biofuel) by 2010 under the [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]].  This goal may be ambitious, without the necessary infrastructure and paucity of research on appropriate UK crops, but import from France might be a realistic option (based upon the French [[wine lake]]).

In 2005 [[British Sugar]] announced that it will build the UK's first [[ethanol]] [[biofuel]] production facility, using British grown [[sugar beet]] as the feed stock. The plant in [[Norfolk]] will produce 55,000 [[metric tonnes]] of ethanol annually when it is completed in the first quarter of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanolproducer.com/article.jsp?article_id=70 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095228/http://www.ethanolproducer.com/article.jsp?article_id=70 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It has been argued that even using all the UK's [[set-aside]] land to grow biofuel crops would provide less than seven per cent of the UK's present transport fuel usage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/02-03/biofuels/quant_bioethanol.htm |title=Bioethanol Production |publisher=Esru.strath.ac.uk |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

==Fuel poverty==
{{Main|fuel poverty}}
Reducing occurrence of [[fuel poverty]] (defined as [[household]]s paying over ten percent of income for heating costs) is one of the four basic goals of UK energy policy.  In the prior decade substantial progress has been made on this goal,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} but primarily due to government subsidies to low-income families rather than through fundamental change of home design or improved energy pricing.  The following national programs have been specifically instrumental in such progress: Winter Fuel Payment, [[Child Tax Credit]] and Pension Credit.  Some benefits have resulted from the Warm Front Scheme in [[England]], the Central Heating Programme in [[Scotland]] and the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in [[Wales]].  These latter programs provide economic incentives for physical improvement in [[Building insulation|insulation]], etc.

==Public opinion==
The UK is largely supportive of renewable energy and this is primarily driven by concerns about climate change and dependence on fossil fuels.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Energy Sector – A Force for Good? |url=http://www.molten-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Energy-Sector-A-Force-for-Good.pdf |publisher=Molten Group |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116042625/http://www.molten-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Energy-Sector-A-Force-for-Good.pdf |archive-date=16 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In July 2013, the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] published a national survey of public attitudes towards energy in the UK.<ref>[http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2243/1/SYNTHESIS_FINAL.pdf Transforming the UK energy system – public values, attitudes and acceptability], ''[[UK Energy Research Centre]]'', published 2013-16-07, accessed 2016-22-01</ref>
*74% of participants were very or fairly concerned about [[climate change]].
*82% were worried about the UK becoming too dependent upon energy from other countries.
*79% wanted to see a reduction in the use of [[fossil fuels]] over the next few decades.
*81% expressed a desire to reduce their energy use.
*85% supported [[solar energy]].
*75% supported [[wind energy]].
*42% had never heard of carbon capture and storage ([[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]]) and when given further information many expressed concern, viewing it as a "non transition" – a continuation of unsustainable practices associated with fossil fuels.
*The public was undecided on the role of [[nuclear power]] in the future energy mix. Over half (54%) said they would oppose the building of a new nuclear power station in their area.
*A majority (53%) were willing to use [[electric vehicles]], rising to 75% if they performed as well as conventional models.

This can be compared with a similar study from the 1st Annual World Environment Review, published in June 2007, which revealed that:<ref>[http://www.gmi-mr.com/gmipoll/release.php?p=20070605 First Annual World Environment Review Poll Reveals Countries Want Governments to Take Strong Action on Climate Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022050731/http://www.gmi-mr.com/gmipoll/release.php?p=20070605 |date=22 October 2013 }}, ''Global Market Insite'', published 2007-06-05, accessed 9 May 2007</ref>
*81% are concerned about climate change.
*79% think their Government should do more to tackle global warming.
*73% think that the UK is too dependent on fossil fuels.
*77% think that the UK is too reliant on foreign oil.
*87% think that a minimum 25% of electricity should be generated from renewable energy sources.
*24% think that the Government should do more to expand nuclear power.
*56% are concerned about nuclear power.
*76% are concerned about carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries.
*61% think it appropriate for developed countries to demand restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries.

== Peak oil ==

In their October 2009 report, the Government-funded [[UK Energy Research Centre]] (UKERC) noted that the implications of reaching the [[peak oil|peak of world oil production]] had, until the late 2000s, caused little concern among the world's governments. The UKERC report concluded that this peak could be expected before 2030, but that there is a 'significant risk' of a peak before 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Global+Oil+Depletion|title=The Global Oil Depletion Report|date=8 October 2009|publisher=[[UK Energy Research Centre]]|access-date=9 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012080159/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Global+Oil+Depletion|archive-date=12 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The UK Government has no contingency plans for oil peaking before 2020.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/08/peak-oil-could-hit-soon Peak oil could hit soon, report says], [[The Guardian]], 8 October 2009</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/14/george-monbiot-smallpox-oil-supply We spend millions on smallpox, but nothing on the far greater threat of peak oil.] George Monbiot, [[The Guardian]], 14 April 2009</ref>

The UKERC report's authors warn of the risk that 'rising [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]] will encourage the rapid development of [[carbon intensity|carbon-intensive]] alternatives (such as coal) which will make it difficult or impossible to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]]'<ref name="UKERC-Oct09">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=0910GlobalOilRelease|title=UKERC Report Finds 'Significant Risk' of Oil Production Peaking in Ten Years |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018120151/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=0910GlobalOilRelease |archive-date=18 October 2009 |date=8 October 2009 |publisher=[[UK Energy Research Centre]]}}</ref> and that 'early investment in [[alternative energy|low-carbon alternatives]] to conventional oil is of considerable importance' in avoiding this scenario. It is suggested that the current measures being established to address climate change may not be sufficient or rapid enough to address the challenges of peak oil, but that it will require 'both improved understanding and much greater awareness of the risks presented by global oil depletion' for further action to become politically feasible.<ref>[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=12 October 2009 }}, page xi, August 2009, published 8 October 2009, [[UK Energy Research Centre]], {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}</ref>

== Analysis and criticism ==

A 2016 paper argues that current UK energy policy is a contradictory mix of free market policies and government interventions, with an undue emphasis on electricity.  It concludes that the government needs to develop a clearer strategy if it is to address the three goals of economic effectiveness, environmental protection, and energy security.<ref name="keay-2016">
