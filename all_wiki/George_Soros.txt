Born in [[Budapest]], Soros survived the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] and moved to the United Kingdom in 1947. He studied at the [[London School of Economics]] and was awarded a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], then obtaining a [[master's degree|master's]], and eventually a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) from [[University of London]].<ref name=LSE1/><ref name=LSE2/> Soros began his business career by taking various jobs at [[merchant bank]]s in the United Kingdom and then the United States, before starting his first [[hedge fund]], Double Eagle, in 1969. Profits from his first fund furnished the seed money to start [[Soros Fund Management]], his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed to [[Quantum Fund]] and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in [[assets under management]], and {{as of|2011|lc=y}} it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ungeheuer |first=Frederick |date=May 4, 1987 |title=George Soros: World's Champion Bull Rider |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964280,00.html |url-status=live |access-date=February 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129014750/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964280,00.html |archive-date=January 29, 2017 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

Soros was born in Budapest in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]] to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots.

Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians. Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while completing an inventory of a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been "the happiest [year] of his life," for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Michael T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&pg=PA5 |title=Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire |publisher=Knopf |year=2002 |isbn=9780375405853 |page=5 |language=en |access-date=November 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127052744/https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&pg=PA5 |archive-date=January 27, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Michael T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&pg=PA37 |title=Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire |publisher=Knopf |year=2002 |isbn=9780375405853 |page=37 |language=en |access-date=November 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127091624/https://books.google.com/books?id=W1Jn4zYBom8C&pg=PA37 |archive-date=January 27, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1945, Soros survived the [[Siege of Budapest]], in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city.

==Investment career==

===Early business experience===
In a discussion at the [[Los Angeles World Affairs Council]] in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', asked Soros, "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?" Soros replied, "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every [[merchant bank]] in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank."<ref>[http://www.lawac.org/speech-archive/pdf/2006/Soros_612.pdf Consequences of the War on Terror] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129063644/http://www.lawac.org/speech-archive/pdf/2006/Soros_612.pdf |date=January 29, 2012 }} September 20, 2006, Los Angeles World Affairs Council.

===Singer and Friedlander===
In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank [[Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander#Singer & Friedlander|Singer & Friedlander]] of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the [[arbitrage]] department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book |last=Arnold |first=Glen |title=The Great Investors: Lessons on Investing from Master Traders |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=9780273743385 |location=United Kingdom |page=416}}</ref>

===F. M. Mayer===
In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage [[Trader (finance)|trader]] for F. M. Mayer (1956–59). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the [[Coal and Steel Community]], which later became the [[Common Market]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite book |last=Soros |first=George |url=https://archive.org/details/sorosonsorosstay00soro_0/page/326 |title=Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve |last2=Koenen |first2=Krisztina |last3=Wien |first3=Byron |date=1995 |publisher=J.

===Wertheim and Co===
In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to [[Wertheim & Co.]]. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.<ref>Kaufman, Michael T., Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire, Chapter 8</ref> He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963.

During this period, Soros developed the theory of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] based on the ideas of his tutor at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Karl Popper]]. Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops.  Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical "virtuous" or "vicious" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Soros |first=George |year=2013 |title=Fallibility, reflexivity, and the human uncertainty principle |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=309–329 |doi=10.1080/1350178x.2013.859415 |hdl-access=free |hdl=10.1080/1350178X.2013.859415 |s2cid=144650771}}</ref><ref name="A">{{Cite book |last=Soros, George |url=https://archive.org/details/newparadigmforfi00soro_0 |title=The New Paradigm for Financial Markets |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-58648-683-9 |location=New York}}</ref>

===Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder===
From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at [[Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder]] resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the [[Interest Equalization Tax]], which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966 he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies.

In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle [[hedge fund]] with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.<ref>''Soros on Soros'', p47</ref> It was based in [[Curaçao]], [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Antilles]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Koven |first=Steven G. |title=American immigration policy confronting the nation's challenges |last2=Götzke |first2=Frank |date=2010 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-95940-5 |edition=1 |location=New York |page=89}}</ref> Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S.

In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12&nbsp;million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and [[Jim Rogers]] received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.<ref name="auto1" />

===Soros Fund Management===
In 1970, Soros founded [[Soros Fund Management]] and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.<ref name="georgesoros.com">[http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/archive/category/finance/ "George Soros"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711084948/http://www.georgesoros.com/faqs/archive/category/finance/ |date=July 11, 2011 }}.

In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder.

It was later renamed as the [[Quantum Fund]], named after the physical theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.<ref name="auto" />

By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.<ref>''Soros on Soros'', p56</ref>

In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1&nbsp;billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5&nbsp;billion family fortune, due to changes in [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors.

====Economic crisis in the 1990s and 2000s====
Soros had been building a huge [[Short (finance)#Currency|short position]] in pounds sterling for months leading up to September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.<ref name="amazon1">{{Cite book |last=Sebastian Mallaby |title=More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite |date=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Penguin Press HC |isbn=9781594202551}}</ref>

By September 16, 1992, the day of [[Black Wednesday]], Soros's fund had [[short (finance)|sold short]] more than $10&nbsp;billion in [[pound sterling|pound]]s,<ref name="georgesoros.com" /> profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] countries or [[floating exchange rate|float]] its currency.

Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, [[Devaluation|devaluing]] the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1&nbsp;billion.<ref>Mallaby, Sebastian, ''More Money Than God'', Penguin, 2010, p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-255-1}}.</ref> He was dubbed "the man who [[breaking the bank|broke the Bank]] of England".<ref>Litterick, David (September 13, 2002), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html "Billionaire who Broke the Bank of England"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406155925/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2773265/Billionaire-who-broke-the-Bank-of-England.html |date=April 6, 2018 }}, ''The Telegraph''.</ref> The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] was £3.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name="telly">{{Cite news |last=Johnston |first=Philip |date=September 10, 2012 |title=Black Wednesday: The day that Britain went over the edge |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/9533474/Black-Wednesday-The-day-that-Britain-went-over-the-edge.html |url-status=live |access-date=April 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228182924/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/9533474/Black-Wednesday-The-day-that-Britain-went-over-the-edge.html |archive-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> [[Stanley Druckenmiller]], who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: "[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position."<ref>Steven Drobny, ''Inside the House of Money'', John Wiley & Sons: Hoboken, NJ, 2006.</ref><ref>''Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve'' (John Wiley, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-471-12014-8}}</ref>

On October 26, 1992, ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Soros as saying: "Our total [[Position (finance)|position]] by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10&nbsp;billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when [[Norman Lamont]] said just before the [[devaluation]] that he would borrow nearly $15&nbsp;billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell."

Soros was believed to have traded billions of [[Finnish markka]]s on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the [[early 1990s depression in Finland|early 1990s depression]]. The [[Bank of Finland]] and the [[Finnish Government]] commented at the time they believed that a "conspiracy" was impossible.<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 10, 1996 |title=Amerikkalainen suursijoittaja keinotteli Suomen markalla Miljardien markkojen kauppojen takana tiettävästi George Soros Suomen Pankki ja hallitus pitävät salaliittoa mahdottomana |url=https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000003507500.html |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020120052/https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000003507500.html |archive-date=October 20, 2019 |access-date=October 20, 2019 |publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |language=fi |quote=An American finacnier speculated with the Finnish mark - The man behind the trade of billions worth of markkas presumably was George Soros - The Finnish Bank and Government think that a conspiracy is impossible}}</ref>

In 1997, during the [[Asian financial crisis]], the prime minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]] for welcoming [[Myanmar]] as a member. With a history of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background ("It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge")<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 24, 2003 |title=Mahathir's dark side |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3597972/Mahathirs-dark-side.html |url-status=live |access-date=April 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421180307/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3597972/Mahathirs-dark-side.html |archive-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref> and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070111172941/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200612/s1812946.htm "Malaysian ex-premier Mahathir and billionaire Soros end feud"].

By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)<ref>Soros, George (1999). ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered'', 2nd ed., PublicAffairs, {{ISBN|978-1-891620-27-0}}, pp. 208–209.</ref></blockquote>

In 1999, economist [[Paul Krugman]] was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets.

<blockquote>[N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is 'Soroi'.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Krugman |first=Paul |title=The accidental theorist: and other dispatches from the dismal science |publisher=W.W.

In an interview concerning the [[late-2000s recession]], Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, [[market fundamentalism]] with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been "some kind of an [[ideological]] excess." In Soros's view, the markets' moods—a "mood" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality—"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles."<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 6, 2009 |title=George Soros on the financial crisis {{!}} Odeo: Search, Discover and Share Digital Media from Millions of Audio and Video Clips |url=http://odeo.com/episodes/23475214-George-Soros-on-the-financial-crisis |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206215514/http://odeo.com/episodes/23475214-George-Soros-on-the-financial-crisis |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

In reaction to the late-2000s recession, he founded the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system.

====Société Générale insider trade====
In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges Pébereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in [[Société Générale]], a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under [[Jacques Chirac]]).<ref name=saltmarsh /> Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité.

In 1989, the [[Autorité des marchés financiers (France)|Commission des Opérations de Bourse]] (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered [[insider trading]]. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Heather |date=October 4, 2011 |title=Soros Insider-Trading Conviction Reviewed by Human Rights Court |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-04/soros-insider-trading-conviction-reviewed-by-human-rights-court.html |url-status=live |access-date=October 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007211428/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-04/soros-insider-trading-conviction-reviewed-by-human-rights-court.html |archive-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,<ref name="IHT20060614">[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-soros.1974397.html "Insider trading conviction of Soros is upheld"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207061449/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-soros.1974397.html |date=February 7, 2017 }}.

== Personal life ==
Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war.

== Political involvement ==
Until the 2004 presidential election, Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political campaigns. According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], during the 2003–2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various [[527 Group]]s (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. § 527). The groups aimed to defeat President [[George W. Bush]]. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called [[Democracy Alliance]], which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.<ref>{{Cite news |title=New Alliance of Democrats Spreads Funding |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html |url-status=live |access-date=July 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001075131/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html |archive-date=October 1, 2006}}</ref>

In August 2009, Soros donated $35&nbsp;million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140&nbsp;million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 federal recovery act]].<ref name="NPR090409" />

Soros was an initial donor to the [[Center for American Progress]], and he continues to support the organization through the [[Open Society Foundations]].

In October 2011, a [[Reuters]] story, "Soros: Not a funder of [[Occupy Wall Street|Wall Street Protests]]," was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined "Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?" with a lede stating that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement "may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]." Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and [[Adbusters]]' co-founder [[Kalle Lasn]] both saying that Adbusters—the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests—had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that "indirect financial links" existed between the two as late as 2010.<ref>Egan, Mark; Nichols, Michelle (October 13, 2011).

===Reflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory===
Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a "near to equilibrium" or a "far from equilibrium" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the "[[efficient market hypothesis]]") does not apply in these situations.  Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.<ref name="A" /> He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:<ref name="A" />

# Reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena. Examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include (a) equity leveraging or (b) the [[Trend following|trend-following]] habits of speculators.
# Reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions; i.e., the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities.
# Investors' observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes.

A recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.<ref name="A" /> Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses.  More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses.  Lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively).  Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still.

This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.

The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Solow |first=Robert |date=February 8, 1999 |title=The Amateur |journal=The New Republic}}</ref> but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the ''[[Journal of Economic Methodology]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2013 |editor-last=Hands |editor-first=D.

The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of [[complexity economics]], as developed at the [[Santa Fe Institute]], although Soros had not publicized his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arthur |first=W.

===Reflexivity in politics===
Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the "[[open society]]" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' by his mentor [[Karl Popper]]), the largest current threat is from [[market fundamentalism]].

He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bubbleofamerican00soro |title=The Bubble of American Supremacy: Correcting the Misuse of American Power |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58648-217-6}}</ref>

===View of problems in the free market system===
Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as [[market fundamentalism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soros |first=George |title=The Alchemy of Finance |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-44549-4 |page=13}}</ref>

==== Market predictions ====
Soros's book ''The New Paradigm for Financial Markets'' (May 2008), described a "superbubble" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:

{{quote|I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in ''The Alchemy of Finance'' (in 1987), then in ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' (in 1998), and now in this book.

He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.

{{quote|I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight.  When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.<ref name="predict" />}}

In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51K0A920090221 Soros sees no bottom for world financial "collapse"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103000810/https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51K0A920090221 |date=November 3, 2020 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', February 21, 2009, Retrieved August 17, 2009.</ref> "We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom."

In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis akin to 2008]] based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking [[Chinese yuan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Haigh |first=Adam |last2=Ondaatjie |first2=Anusha |date=6 January 2016 |title=George Soros Sees Crisis in Global Markets That Echoes 2008 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-07/global-markets-at-the-beginning-of-a-crisis-george-soros-says |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210101242/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-07/global-markets-at-the-beginning-of-a-crisis-george-soros-says |archive-date=February 10, 2017 |access-date=15 January 2016 |website=bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg LP}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Clinch |first=Matt |date=January 7, 2016 |title=Soros: It's the 2008 crisis all over again |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/07/soros-its-the-2008-crisis-all-over-again.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116060225/http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/07/soros-its-the-2008-crisis-all-over-again.html |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2016 |website=cnbc.com |publisher=CNBC LLC.}}</ref>

Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of [[George W. Bush]] in the U.S. and [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism.  Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the "Jewish financiers" who, in antisemitic terms, "ruled the world by proxy", suggested that if we change the direction of those policies, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. [[Abraham Foxman]], national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of what's out there, and "blamed the victim" when holding Jews responsible for [[antisemitism]]. Jewish philanthropist [[Michael Steinhardt]], who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified, "George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be."<ref name="Heilman_JTA">{{Cite news |last=Heilman |first=Uriel |date=November 8, 2003 |title=Soros Says Jews And Israel Cause Anti-Semitism |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |url=http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=13428&intcategoryid=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119203952/http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=13428&intcategoryid=4 |archive-date=November 19, 2003}}</ref>  Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by "giv[ing] up on the tribalness".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beattie |first=Kirk |title=Congress and the Shaping of the Middle East |publisher=Seven Stories Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-60980-562-3 |location=New York}}</ref>

In a subsequent article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Soros emphasized that

<blockquote>I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.<ref>Soros, George.

In 2017, Israeli businessman [[Beny Steinmetz]] filed a $10-million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the [[government of Guinea]] to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to "long-standing animus toward the state of Israel".<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/05/george-soros-battles-10b-lawsuit-familiar-charges-wielding-political-influence.html George Soros battles $10B lawsuit, familiar charges of wielding political influence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506110907/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/05/george-soros-battles-10b-lawsuit-familiar-charges-wielding-political-influence.html |date=May 6, 2017 }} Fox News</ref><ref>[https://www.courthousenews.com/mining-company-sues-george-soros-10-billion Mining Company Sues George Soros for $10 Billion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424091639/http://www.courthousenews.com/mining-company-sues-george-soros-10-billion/ |date=April 24, 2017 }}

When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in ''The Age of Fallibility'' that "the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States", he responded that "it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world.

Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help [[Black African|black]] students attend the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[apartheid]] South Africa,<ref name="GSb" /> and began funding dissident movements behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent [[democratization]] in the [[post-Soviet states]]. These efforts, mostly in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the [[Open Society Foundations]] (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the [[Stefan Batory Foundation]] in Poland). As of 2003, [[PBS]] estimated that he had given away a total of $4&nbsp;billion.<ref name="PBS" /> The OSI says it has spent about $500&nbsp;million annually in recent years.

In 2003, former [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Paul Volcker]] wrote in the foreword of Soros's book ''The Alchemy of Finance'':

<blockquote>George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game.
