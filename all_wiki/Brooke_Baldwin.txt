==Clay Travis "boobs" incident==
On September 15, 2017, [[Clay Travis]] appeared as a guest on [[CNN]], with Baldwin, to discuss free speech, specifically whether ESPN personality, [[Jemele Hill]], should be fired for calling [[Donald Trump]] a "white supremacist" and stating that police officers were "modern day slave catchers" on her personal Twitter page.

Travis received criticism for using a phrase he commonly used on his radio show when he said "...I'm a First Amendment absolutist - the only two things I 100 percent believe in are the First Amendment and boobs..."<ref name= concha>Concha, Joe.
