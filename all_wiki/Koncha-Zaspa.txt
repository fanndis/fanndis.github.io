'''Koncha-Zaspa''' ({{lang-uk|Конча-Заспа}}) is a [[Subdivisions of Kyiv#Historical neighborhoods|historic neighbourhood]] in the [[Holosiiv Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) of the city of [[Kyiv]], the capital of [[Ukraine]]. It is known for being the place where Ukraine's political elite live.<ref name="30716568ZeDacha"/><ref name="4240509 The closed world of state dacha"/> Koncha-Zaspa is located in the southern part of the city. In the 1920s the territory was the first state preserve in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

==Description==
The general area is located along the [[Dnieper]] river and consists mostly of woodland, while its northern part includes the former settlement of Chapayivka (before the 1920s Vita Litovska) which has been part of Kyiv since 1957. Among other former settlements are Kozyn and Plyuty. 

In Koncha-Zaspa are located several sanatoriums "Koncha-Zaspa", "Zhovten", "Prolisok" as well as the [[Dynamo Training Center|training site]] of the [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]] with a [[Dynamo Training Center|stadium]] (just outside Chapayivka). Here is located a building of culture "Koncha-Zaspa" and a memorial complex Koncha-Zaspa.

Through the neighborhood runs the Stolychne shose (Capital highway, P01), along which are located numerous elite [[dacha]]s designated for the local Communist [[nomenklatura]]. Before the establishment of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime, the area was reserved for a couple of famous Kyiv monasteries ([[Vydubychi Monastery|Vydubychi]] and Vveden) as well as the [[Tsar]] family. Following [[Modern history of Ukraine#Independent Ukraine (1991 to present)|Ukraine's independence]] in 1991 the neighborhood continues to be the place where many of Ukraine's political elite have lived for decades, some received dachas for life, some for temporary use.<ref name="4240509 The closed world of state dacha">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2009/10/14/4240509 The closed world of state dachas.
