'''Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association''' was a [[savings and loan association]] based in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. The company operated from 1979 until 1989 when it was shut down by federal regulators as a result of [[bank failure]], leading to a loss of $60 million for the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]. Beginning in 1982, the bank was owned and managed by [[Jim McDougal]], a friend of [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]. On March 8, 1992, during the [[1992 United States presidential election]] the bank was the subject of an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Jeff Gerth]], which linked the bank to [[Whitewater Development Corporation]], owned by McDougal and the Clintons.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/us/1992-campaign-personal-finances-clintons-joined-s-l-operator-ozark-real-estate.html | title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Personal Finances; Clintons Joined S.& L.

McDougal was investigated to determine if he improperly diverted money from the bank to Whitewater or the Clinton campaign during the [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1984]].

==History==
In 1979, the bank received a state savings and loan charter from Arkansas as Woodruff County Savings and Loan.<ref name=Barth>{{cite book | first1=James R. | last1=Barth | first2=R.

In April 1982, an audit by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]], the bank's regulator, found substantial losses and questioned the solvency of the bank.<ref name=Barth/> Later in 1982, Madison was acquired by [[Jim McDougal]] and Steve Smith.<ref name=Barth/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9604/13/whitewater.background/index.html | title=Whitewater started as 'sweetheart' deal | work=[[CNN]] | date=May 6, 1996}}</ref> [[John Latham (Whitewater)|John Latham]] was named [[chief executive officer]]. The bank continued its rapid growth, increasing in assets from $6.7 million at the end of 1982 to $48.6 million in 1986.<ref name=Barth/> In 1983, McDougal and his wife, [[Susan McDougal]], took control of the institution.<ref name=Barth/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/caught-in-the-whitewater-net/ | title=Caught In The Whitewater Nets | work=[[CBS News]] | date=May 19, 1998}}</ref>

In a 1984 audit, federal regulators found the bank was making unsound loans and noted that if paper losses were realized, Madison would be insolvent.<ref name=Barth/>

In August 1986, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ordered McDougal's removal from management of Madison, although he remained its owner.<ref name=Barth/> [[Robert W.

In 1986, the assets of the bank peaked at $125.5 million.<ref name=Barth/>

On March 2, 1989, Madison was seized by Federal regulators and put into [[receivership]] with the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation]] as receiver.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/03/business/us-regulators-seize-37-ailing-savings-units-in-6-states.html | title=U.S. Regulators Seize 37 Ailing Savings Units in 6 States | first=THOMAS C. | last=HAYES | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 1989}}</ref>

On April 14, 1997, Jim McDougal was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud conspiracy charges as a result of bad loans made by Madison. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison and payment of $4.27 million in [[restitution]] to the [[Small Business Administration]] and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/04/14/mcdougal/ | title=Jim McDougal Draws Three Years in Prison | work=[[CNN]] | date=April 14, 1997}}</ref>

Madison Guaranty and McDougal hired the [[Rose Law Firm]], where Mrs. Clinton worked, as a defense attorney. Mrs. Clinton's  billing records on Madison Guaranty and McDougal's [[Castle Grande]] [[real estate development]] project could not be found. How much work she actually did on Madison and Castle Grande was the subject of the missing billing records. McDougal also held a fundraiser at Madison Guaranty that paid off Clinton's campaign debt of $50,000. Madison cashier's checks accounted for $12,000 of the funds raised. On January 4, 1996, Clinton's billing records were found on a table in the White House, which showed that she performed 60 hours of legal work for Madison in 1985 and 1986.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/timeline2.htm | title=Whitewater Time Line (1995-1998) | work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>
