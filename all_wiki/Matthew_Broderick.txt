==Career==
[[File:Matthew Broderick.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Broderick in Sweden during his promotion of ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'']]
Broderick's first major acting role came in an [[HB Studio]] workshop production of playwright [[Horton Foote]]'s ''On Valentine's Day'', playing opposite his father, who was a friend of Foote's. This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:

<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|date=13 September 2004|title=Matthew Broderick: An Interview With The Star, And Sarah Jessica Parker|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matthew-broderick/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-11|website=CBS News|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

He followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.

His first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983).

Broderick then won the role of the charming, clever slacker in the [[1986 in film|1986]] film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).

In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.

In the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of adult [[Simba]] in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and he also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles: a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]], and a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].

He played Leopold "Leo" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail that turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his co-star Nathan Lane.

===Family ancestry===
In March 2010, Broderick was featured in the [[NBC]] program ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, was a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/>

===1987 car crash===
On August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]]. The driver, Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004215300/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, were both killed instantly. He was vacationing with [[Jennifer Grey]], whom he had begun dating in semi-secrecy during the filming of ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''; the crash publicly revealed their relationship. He had a fractured leg and ribs, a concussion, and a collapsed lung. Grey received minor injuries, including whiplash.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Broderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he had been in the wrong lane: "What I first remember is waking up in the hospital, with a very strange feeling going on in my leg." He was charged with [[causing death by dangerous driving]] and faced up to five years in prison, but was convicted of the lesser charge of [[careless driving]] and fined £100 (US$175).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Monaghan |first=Gabrielle |date=September 26, 2010 |title=Fermanagh car crash 'ended Dirty Dancing star's career' |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fermanagh-car-crash-endeddirty-dancing-stars-career-jjf7tdc60j7 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate=April 3, 2020 |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=People87>{{cite web|last=Hutchings|first=David|date=September 14, 1987|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097106,00.html|title=Jennifer Grey (Joel's Baby and Matthew Broderick's Lady) Turns Up the Heat in Dirty Dancing|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103183046/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097106,00.html|archive-date=November 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=NewYorkPost>{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Hoffmann|title=Broderick's Guilt|work=[[New York Post]]|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/broderick_guilt_actor_car_meet_with_AeAFxJ0tfIK0OzUmQteqYN|date=September 2, 2002|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622005811/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/broderick_guilt_actor_car_meet_with_AeAFxJ0tfIK0OzUmQteqYN|archive-date=June 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Matthew Broderick Injured in Car Crash|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/arts/matthew-broderick-injured-in-car-crash.html|date=August 7, 1987|accessdate=February 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102150354/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/arts/matthew-broderick-injured-in-car-crash.html|archive-date=January 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

The victims' son and brother, Martin Doherty, called the verdict "a travesty of justice". He later forgave Broderick, amid plans to meet him in 2003. In February 2012, when Broderick was featured in a multi-million-dollar [[Honda]] commercial that aired during the [[Super Bowl]], Doherty said the meeting had still not taken place and that Broderick "wasn't the greatest choice of drivers, knowing his past".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/02/09/395744-broderick-not-a-great-choice/|title=Broderick not a great choice|first=Sarah|last=Saunderson|date=February 9, 2012|work=Impartial Reporter|publisher=William Trimble Ltd|location=Ireland|accessdate=May 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002234/http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2012/02/09/395744-broderick-not-a-great-choice|archive-date=May 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>
