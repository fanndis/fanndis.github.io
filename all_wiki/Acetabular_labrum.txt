The '''acetabular labrum''' ('''glenoidal labrum of the hip joint''' or '''cotyloid ligament''' in older texts) is a ring of [[cartilage]] that surrounds the [[acetabulum]] of the hip. The anterior portion is most vulnerable when the labrum tears.

It provides an articulating surface for the [[acetabulum]], allowing the head of the [[femur]] to articulate with the pelvis.

===Mechanisms of Injury===
[[File:Figure 7. A complex labral tear. An arthroscopic probe is seen at the junction of the labrum and acetabular rim..png|thumb|A complex labral tear. An arthroscopic probe is seen at the junction of the labrum and acetabular rim.]]
It is estimated that 75% of acetabular labrum tears have an unknown cause.<ref name=Lewis/> Tears of the labrum have been credited to a variety of causes such as excessive force, [[hip dislocation]], capsular hip hypermobility, [[hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], and hip degeneration.<ref name=Lewis/> A tight [[iliopsoas]] tendon has also been attributed to labrum tears by causing compression or traction injuries that eventually lead to a labrum tear.<ref name=Smith>Smith, M., Panchal, H., Ruberte, R., & Sekiya, J. (2011). Effect of acetabular labrum tears on hip stability and labral strain in a joint compression model. The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 39, 103S-110S.</ref> Most labrum tears are thought to be from gradual tear due to repetitive [[microtrauma]].<ref name=Lewis/> Incidents of labrum tears increase with age, suggesting that they may also be caused by deterioration through the aging process.<ref name=Lewis/> Labrum tears in athletes can occur from a single event or recurring trauma.<ref name=Rylander>Rylander, L., Froelich, J., Novicoff, W., & Saleh, K. (2010). Femoroacetabular impingement and acetabular labral tears. Orthopedics, 33(5), 342-350</ref> Running can cause labrum tears due to the labrum being used more for weight bearing and taking excessive forces while at the end-range motion of the leg: hyperabduction, hyperextension, [[hyperflexion]], excessive [[external rotation]].<ref name=Rylander/> Sporting activities are likely causes, specifically those that require frequent lateral rotation or pivoting on a loaded femur as in [[hockey]] or [[ballet]].<ref name=Lewis/> Constant hip rotation places increased stress on the capsular tissue and damage to the [[iliofemoral ligament]]. This in turn causes hip rotational instability putting increased pressure on the labrum.<ref name=Rylander/>

Traumatic injuries are most commonly seen in athletes who participate in contact or high impact sports like football, soccer, or golf.<ref name=Groh>Groh, Megan M., and Joseph Herrera. "A Comprehensive Review of Hip Labral Tears." Curr Rev Musculoskeletal Med. 2.2 (2009): 105-117. Web. 16 Oct. 2013</ref>  The prevalence rate for traumatic hip injuries that causes a tear of the labrum is very low. Less than 25% of all patients can relate a specific incident to their torn labrum, however they are often a result of a dislocation or fracture.<ref>Mason, J. Bohannon MD. "Acetabular Labral Tears In The Athlete." Clinics In Sports Medicine. 20.4 (2001): 779-788. Web. 16 Oct. 2013.</ref> Falling on one's side causes a blunt trauma to the greater trochanter of the femur. Since there is very little soft tissue to diminish the force between the impact and the [[greater trochanter]], the entire blow is transferred to the surface of the hip joint.<ref name=Byrd>Byrd, J.W. Thomas. "Lateral Impact Injury." Clinics In Sports Medicine. 20.4 (2001): 801-815. Web. 16 Oct. 2013</ref> And since bone density does not reach its peak until the age of 30, hip traumas could result in a fracture.<ref name=Byrd/> Tears of the hip labrum can be classified in a variety of ways, including [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[etiology]], location, or severity.<ref name=Groh/>

Anatomical modifications of the femur and or hip socket cause a slow buildup of damage to the cartilage. Femur or acetabular dysplasia can lead to [[femoral acetabular impingement]] (FAI).<ref name=Rahman>Rahman, Abdel, Sathish Rajasekaran, and Haron Obaid. "MRI Morphometric Hip Comparison Analysis of Anterior Acetabular Labral Tears." Skeletal Radiol. (2013): 1246-1252. Web. 17 Oct. 2013</ref> Impingement occurs when the femoral head rubs abnormally or lacks a full range of motion in the acetabular socket.<ref name=Rahman/> There are three different forms of FAI. The first form is caused by a cam-deformity where extra bone is present on the [[femoral head]], which leads to the head being non-spherical.<ref name=Groh/> The second deformity is referred to as a pincer deformity and it is due to an excess growth of the acetabular socket.<ref name=Groh/> The third type of FAI is a combination of the first two deformities. When either abnormality is present, it changes the position that the femoral head occupies in the hip socket. The increased stresses that the femur and or acetabulum experience may lead to a fracture of the acetabular rim or a detachment of the overstressed labrum.<ref name=Groh/>

===Epidemiology===
In the United States acetabular labrum tears usually occur in the anterior or anterior-superior area, possibly due to a sudden change from labrum to acetabular cartilage.<ref name=Smith/> The most common labrum tears in Japan are in the posterior region, likely due to the customary practice of sitting on the floor.<ref name=Groh/> Posterior labrum tears in the Western world usually occur when a force drives the [[femoral head]] posteriorly which transfers shear and compressive forces to the posterior labrum.<ref name=Groh/>

===Rehabilitation===
With physical therapy, there is only a small amount of evidence on rehabilitation techniques for the acetabular labrum.<ref name=Garrison>Garrison, Craig J., Osler, Michael T., Singleton, Steven B. (2007). "Rehabilitation after Arthroscopy of an Acetabular Labral Tear". ''North American Journal of Sports Physical Therapy''. 2(4), 241–250.</ref> It is even thought that physical therapy could be controversial due to there not being any evidence of a specific effective therapy routine.<ref name=Groh/>
There are, however, some studies that report physical therapy could benefit the patient by bringing them back to “sports-ready” capabilities.<ref name=Lewis>Lewis, Cara L. & Sahrmann, Shirley A. (2006). "Acetabular Labral Tears". ''Journal of the American Physical Therapy Association''. 86, 110–121.</ref> It is advised that physical therapists keep up on the new findings and stay in close contact with the [[orthopaedic surgeon]] so they have the best idea of how to approach their patient's case.<ref name=Garrison/> Following surgery, crutches will be used for up to six weeks and there should be no expectation to return to activities such as running for at least a period of six months.<ref>Clohisy, John C. & McClure, Thomas (2005). "Treatment of Anterior Femoroacetabular
Impingement with Combined Hip Arthroscopy and Limited Anterior Decompression".
''Iowa Orthopaedic Journal''. 2, 164–171.</ref>

Some things to note when rehabilitation occurs is that it is important to know the size and placement of the tear. There are usually four phases in the rehabilitation process noted as: "Phase I: initial exercises (weeks 1–4), Phase II: intermediate exercises (weeks 5–7), Phase III: advanced exercises (weeks 8–12), and Phase IV: return to sports (weeks 12+)".<ref name=Garrison/>
All physical therapy regimens should be individualized from person to person based on all adequate criteria<ref>Hunt, Devyani, Clohisy, John, Prather, Heidi (2007). "Acetabular Labral Tears of the Hip in
Women". ''Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America''. 18(3), 497-520.</ref>

In phase I of the rehabilitation process the first objective is to minimize the pain and [[inflammation]]. It is important to begin conducting small motion exercises that have up to 50% weight bearing capacity by the patient. A symmetrical [[gait]] pattern is imperative as not to create an imbalance in the muscles of the hip. Aquatic therapy is highly encouraged and looked upon due to its ability to help the patient move more freely without the pressure of gravity. To progress to phase II of the rehabilitation process patients should be able to complete straight leg raises while lying on their side to strengthen the [[sartorius muscle|sartorius]] and tensor fasciate latae muscles to build support in the leg.

In phase II the physical therapist should be trying to promote more flexibility in the soft tissue. There should be more emphasis on the beginning aspects of [[strength training]] while adding some resistance over time. In order to progress to phase III, the patient should be able to demonstrate a normal gait pattern and minimal pain with exercises like the single leg bridging to help strengthen the hamstring muscles to help with leg equality.

In phase III the focus is to begin building functional strength. Movements should include single leg exercises to build the muscle and challenge the strength of the hip.

In order to progress to phase IV the flexibility of the patient should be adequate. Phase IV is the final stage in which the physical therapist would assess and prescribe any further exercise up until the patient is ready to return to the sport.<ref name=Garrison/> Usually the therapist would start using complex movements like [[squatting]], kicking, and running. The therapist would look for symmetrical movements on both sides of the body without pain. If the patient demonstrates the symmetrical movements without pain, the physical therapist would use their discretion for the patient's clearance. Some things to avoid from while rehabilitating are sitting with "knees lower than the hips, legs crossed where hip is rotated, and sitting on the edge of the seat and contracting the hip flexor muscles."<ref name=Lewis/>

===Prevention===
Hip labrum tear can occur in a variety of ways such as frequent twisting movement,
direct trauma, or degeneration.<ref name=Lewis/> Despite the many different possibilities, a large percentage
of hip labral tears are not directly related to any specific action,<ref name=Groh/> making it difficult to
prevent such an injury. But it may be possible to lower the risk by strengthening the [[gluteus]],
stretching before exercise, and discontinued use of repetitive twisting activities.

One way to prevent a hip labrum tear is to decrease the pressure on the anterior region.
The labrum is about 2 to 3&nbsp;mm thick but is wider and thinner in the anterior portion.<ref name=Lewis/> Studies have found that in the United States and European countries, hip labral tears are commonly found in the anterior region.<ref name=Lewis/> Muscular imbalance of the pelvis can develop lower crossed
syndrome. It is caused by tight [[hip flexors]] and erector spinae with inhibited weak gluteals and
[[abdominals]].<ref name=Garrison/> Imbalance of the muscles can lead to an anterior pelvic tilt, increased hip
flexion, and [[lumbar hyperlordosis]] of the lumbar spine. This increases the pressure in the anterior
labrum.<ref name=Groh/> Weak gluteals during hip extension has also shown increased joint pressure in the
anterior labrum.<ref>Lewis, Cara. Sahrmann, Shirley. Moran, Daniel."Anterior Hip Joint Force Increases
with Hip Extension, Decreased Gluteal Force, or Decreased Iliopsoas Force". Journal
of Biomechanics. Volume 40, Issue 16, 2007, Pages 3725–3731</ref> To prevent a hip labrum tear, you will have to strengthen muscles or
stretch tight muscles that might cause any muscular imbalance. A great exercise to strengthen
the gluteus is the side lying hip abduction. You will be lying on your side with your legs on top of each other. You will raise the top leg up while keeping the knee and hip straight. This exercise
targets the gluteus medius and is effective especially in those with an anterior pelvic tilt.<ref name=Garrison/> To stretch a tight hip flexor, you can do the kneeling hip flexor stretch that targets
the iliopsoas. These exercises are a great way to strengthen and stabilize the pelvis
and hip joint to prevent a hip labrum tear.

Stretching before exercise will affect the cartilage through "creep". It will place a
constant load on the labrum, allowing fluid the leak out and deform to the applied load. This is
significant for the [[viscoelasticity]] of the labrum.<ref>AF, Mark."The apparent viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage-- the
contributions from the intrinsic matrix viscoelasticity and interstitial fluid flows." J
Biomech Eng. 1986 May;108(2):123-30.</ref> The hip labrum acts as a shock absorber, joint
lubricator, stabilizer and pressure distributor.<ref name=Lewis/> With this essential warm up, it is possible for it
to be better prepared to prevent a hip labrum tear. Body weight squats are a great example of
stretching and warming up the body to induce creep before exercise.

You will want to lean forward for a good stretch and hold it for about 15 to 20 seconds. In '''B'''), this will be your starting position for the side lying hip abduction. You will want to be in a comfortable position. Slowly lift the top leg (right) straight up. Perform one set of 10 repetitions.

Like your cartilage, it will deform or strain, from constant stress. The strain deformation is slow, but eventually too much stress will increase it.
