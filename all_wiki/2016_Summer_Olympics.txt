The '''2016 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-pt|Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016}}),{{efn|The [[Brazilian Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|ˈʒɔɡuz oˈlĩpikus dʒi veˈɾɐ̃w dʒi ˈdojz ˈmiw i dʒizeˈsejs|}}, in Brazil's standard pronunciation.}} officially known as the '''Games of the XXXI Olympiad''' ({{lang-pt|Jogos da XXXI Olimpíada}}) and commonly known as '''Rio 2016''', was an international [[multi-sport event]] held from 5&nbsp;to 21&nbsp;August 2016 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], with preliminary events in some sports beginning on 3&nbsp;August. Rio was announced as the host city at the [[121st IOC Session]] in [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]], on 2&nbsp;October 2009.

More than 11,000 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants [[Kosovo at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Kosovo]], [[South Sudan at the 2016 Summer Olympics|South Sudan]], and the [[Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Refugee Olympic Team]].<ref name="Olympic Athletes">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/athletes |title=Olympic Athletes |website=Rio 2017 |accessdate=21 August 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821031645/https://www.rio2016.com/en/athletes |archivedate= 21 August 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name="Rio2016">{{cite web|url=http://rio2016olympicswiki.com/about-rio-2016-summer-olympics/|title=About Rio 2016 Summer Olympics|work=Rio 2016 Olympics Wiki|accessdate=31 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908075307/http://rio2016olympicswiki.com/about-rio-2016-summer-olympics/|archive-date=8 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 [[Olympic sports]], including [[rugby sevens]] and [[golf]], which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of [[São Paulo]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], and [[Manaus]].

These were the first [[Olympic Games]] to be held in [[South America]],<ref name="BBC Sport OC" /> as well as the first to be held in a [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|Portuguese-speaking country]], the first summer edition to be held entirely in the [[Climate of Brazil|host country's winter season]], the first since [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] to be held in [[Latin America]], and the first since [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to be held in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/43084-winter-olympics-northern-hemisphere.html|title=Why Winter Olympics Bypass the Southern Hemisphere|first=Laura Poppick 05|last=February 2014|website=livescience.com}}</ref> These were the first Summer Olympics to take place under the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) presidency of [[Thomas Bach]].<ref name="Rio2016"/>

{{Main|Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics}}

The process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16&nbsp;May 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/2016-bid-process-launched|title=2016 Bid Process Launched|website=olympic.org|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|date=16 May 2007}}</ref> The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13&nbsp;September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files, containing answers to a 25-question IOC form, were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14&nbsp;January 2008. On 4&nbsp;June 2008, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: [[Chicago]], [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Tokyo]], which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. Three cities—[[Baku]], [[Doha]], and [[Prague]]—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7435215.stm |title=Four on 2016 Olympics short-list |work=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829000719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/7435215.stm |archive-date=2008-08-29 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Nawal El Moutawakel]] of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the [[Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics bids]]. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2&nbsp;September, one month before the elections.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/the-international-olympic-committee-ioc-today-released-the-report-of-the-evaluation |title=The International Olympic Committee (IOC) today released the report of the Evaluation |website=olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] |date=2 September 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref>

Many safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with, or directly influencing, the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. Cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs in an attempt to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support, as well as backing from sports media and general international media.

{{Cquote|text=Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.|author=Jon Tibbs, a consultant on the [[Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Tokyo bid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=277:rings-around-the-world&catid=60:april-2009&Itemid=112 |title=Rings around the world |date=2009-05-06 |website=[[Communicate (magazine)|communicatemagazine.co.uk]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045246/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=277%3Arings-around-the-world&catid=60%3Aapril-2009&Itemid=112 |archive-date=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref>|source=}}

The final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2&nbsp;October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favourites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second. Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid heading into the final round; the lead held and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

===Urban renovation===

[[File:VLT Rio 09 2016 3355.jpg|thumb|left|Mauá Square, with the [[Museum of Tomorrow]], designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]], and the [[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail|light rail]]]]

Rio's historical [[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|downtown]] underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as ''[[Port of Rio de Janeiro|Porto Maravilha]]'', covering {{convert|5|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increasing the city center's attractiveness and enhancing Rio's competitive position in the global economy.<ref>[http://portomaravilha.com.br/ Porto Maravilha] Rio de Janeiro City Hall. Retrieved 10 August 2012. {{in lang|pt}}.</ref>

The urban renovation involved {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} of tunnels; {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads; {{convert|650|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of sidewalks; {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} of bike path; 15,000&nbsp;trees; three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/news/cs-america/single-view/view/rio-tram-starts-test-running.html|title = Rio tram starts test running|date = 26 November 2015|accessdate = 1 January 2016|website = Railway Gazette}}</ref>

The Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. A second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.<ref name="rio2016.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/8-400-shuttlecocks-250-golf-carts-and-54-boats-the-rio-2016-olympic-games-in-numbers |title=8,400 shuttlecocks, 250 golf carts, 54 boats... the mind-blowing numbers behind the Rio 2016 Games |first=Christina |last=Martins |date=2016-06-06 |website=Rio 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707110414/https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/8-400-shuttlecocks-250-golf-carts-and-54-boats-the-rio-2016-olympic-games-in-numbers |archivedate=7 July 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Medals===
[[File:Medalhas Rio 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics]]
The medals were produced by the [[Casa da Moeda do Brasil]] (the Brazilian [[Mint (facility)|mint]]). The medal design was unveiled on 15&nbsp;June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials, while the gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition the obverse features [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek goddess of victory. Each medal was accompanied by a wooden carrying box. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.<ref name="ioc-medaldesign">{{cite web|title=Innovative medal design unveiled for Rio 2016|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/innovative-medal-design-unveiled-for-rio-2016|date=2016-06-15 |website=olympic.org|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]|accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="yahoo-noflowers"/>

In May 2017, an [[Associated Press]] article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking or surface degrading.

===Volunteers===
Unpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.<ref>{{cite news|title=Volunteers set to make their mark at Rio 2016|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/volunteers-set-to-make-their-mark-at-rio-2016|accessdate=30 December 2016|website=olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]|date=2016-08-05}}</ref> Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thousands of Olympic volunteers quit over 'long hours and lack of food'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/rio-2016-thousands-of-olympic-volunteers-quit-over-long-hours-and-lack-of-food-a7194776.html|accessdate=30 December 2016|website=The Independent|date=17 August 2016|last=Sims|first=Alexandra}}</ref>

===Ticketing===
The ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in [[Brazilian real|Brazilian reais]] (BRL). A total of 7.5&nbsp;million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony.

===Sustainability===
As an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on [[sustainability]] and [[environmental protection]] as a theme of these Games, going on to dub them a "Green Games for a Blue Planet".<ref name="atlantic-greengames"/> As legacy projects, organisers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the [[favelas]] to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system in order to remediate the level of pollution in the [[Guanabara Bay]].<ref name="atlantic-greengames"/><ref name="guardian-fundingclean" /> and plant 24&nbsp;million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects were met with delays or faced with economic shortfalls, which led some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.<ref name="atlantic-greengames">{{cite web|title=Brazil Made Big Environmental Promises for Its Rio Olympics.

[[Image:Arena_do_Futuro_Rio_2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Future Arena]], a temporary venue designed to be reconstructed into schools.]]

The focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols: the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations in order to reduce emissions, and used a [[kinetic sculpture]] to enhance its appearance in lieu of a larger body of flames.<ref name="dezeen-cauldron">{{cite web|title=Diminutive Rio 2016 cauldron complemented by massive kinetic sculpture|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2016/08/08/rio-2016-cauldron-massive-kinetic-sculpture-anthony-howe/|website=Dezeen|accessdate=11 August 2016}}</ref> The bronze and silver medals, as well as ribbons on all medals, incorporate recycled materials.<ref name="ioc-medaldesign"/><ref name="yahoo-noflowers"/>

The athletes were not presented with flowers during medal ceremonies, as had been traditionally done at prior Olympics (although flowers were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). Organisers considered the practice to be wasteful since they were often thrown away, and "would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate" if kept.

====New sports====
{{See also|121st IOC Session}}

In April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme. Baseball and [[softball]] (which were both dropped in 2005), [[karate]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[golf]], [[roller sports]], and [[rugby union]] all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3366295 |title=Golf among seven sports seeking inclusion in 2016 Games |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=20 August 2008|date=25 April 2008}}</ref>

In August, the executive board initially gave its approval to [[rugby sevens]]—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9&nbsp;October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. A new voting system was in place at this session: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympic Leaders Approve Golf and Rugby for 2016 Summer Games|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539269,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919110257/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,539269,00.html|archive-date=19 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Olympics-2016-IOC-Approves-Golf-And-Rugby-Sevens-To-Be-Included-In-Rio-De-Janeiro-Games/Article/200910215402514?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_9&lid=ARTICLE_15402514_Olympics_2016%3A_IOC_Approves_Golf_And_Rugby_Sevens_To_Be_Included_In_Rio_De_Janeiro_Games |title=Olympics 2016: IOC Approves Golf And Rugby Sevens To Be Included In Rio De Janeiro Games. |publisher=Sky (United Kingdom) |accessdate=15 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522103938/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Olympics-2016-IOC-Approves-Golf-And-Rugby-Sevens-To-Be-Included-In-Rio-De-Janeiro-Games/Article/200910215402514?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Article_Teaser_Region_9&lid=ARTICLE_15402514_Olympics_2016%3A_IOC_Approves_Golf_And_Rugby_Sevens_To_Be_Included_In_Rio_De_Janeiro_Games |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Due to the [[European migrant crisis]] and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as [[Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games|Independent Olympians]] under the [[Olympic Flag]]. During [[2012 Summer Olympics|the previous Summer Olympic Games]], refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url = http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/13981364/refugees-eligible-compete-olympics-first-2016-rio-games-ioc-president-says|title = Refugees can compete for first time in 2016 Rio Olympics, IOC head says|date = 27 October 2015|website=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}</ref> On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific [[Refugee Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Refugee Olympic Team (ROT)]]; out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.<ref name="BBC-ROA">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/35710578 |title=Rio 2016: Refugee team to compete at Olympics |date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=3 March 2016 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref>

====Independent athletes====
{{Main|Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics}}
Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.

In November 2015, [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]] was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) following a [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) report into a [[Doping in Russia|doping program]] in the country.<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/34811896 |title=Athletics doping: Russia provisionally suspended by IAAF|work=BBC Sport |date=2015-11-13| accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref> The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for "exceptional eligibility" to participate in the Games as "neutral" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.<ref name="guardian-yuliya2">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/01/russian-whistleblower-yulia-stepanova-cleared-neutral-athlete-rio|title=Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova to compete as 'neutral athlete' in Rio|first=Sean |last=Ingle |date=2016-07-01|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

On 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the [[Olympic Charter]] "does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.<ref name=":322">{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/background-information-to-the-decision-of-the-ioc-executive-board-concerning-the-participation-of-russian-athletes-in-the-olympic-games-rio-2016|title=Background Information to the decision of the IOC Executive Board concerning the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Games Rio 2016|date=24 July 2016|website=olympic.org|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725144348/https://www.olympic.org/news/background-information-to-the-decision-of-the-ioc-executive-board-concerning-the-participation-of-russian-athletes-in-the-olympic-games-rio-2016|archivedate=25 July 2016|accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref> As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] following several developments with regard to the doping investigation.

====National houses====
During the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="nationalhouses">{{cite web|title=National Houses |url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/olympic-houses |website=Rio 2016 |accessdate=10 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806022149/https://www.rio2016.com/en/olympic-houses |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Event scheduling===
[[File:Candelária cauldron at 2016 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|The public cauldron, located outside the [[Candelária Church]].]]

A number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder [[NBC]], whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on May 7, 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75&nbsp;billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23&nbsp;billion for Rio 2016),<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympics on NBC through 2032|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2014/05/07/nbc-olympics-broadcast-rights-2032/8805989/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=May 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/sports/olympics/russia-olympics-us-business.html|title=Fewer Russians Could Be a Windfall for U.S. Olympic Business|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref> as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder [[Rede Globo]]. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. [[Eastern Time Zone]], certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. [[primetime]] hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. ET, 9:00&nbsp;p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being [[broadcast delay|delayed]]. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime [[telenovela]]s, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.<ref name="cbc-midnightmadness">{{cite web|title=Why all the midnight madness for some Olympians?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rio-olympics-nbc-late-races-1.3715538|website=CBC News|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="couriermail-latenight">{{cite web|title=Australia's Olympic swimmers can sleep easy at Rio despite late night meets thanks to recovery training|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/australias-olympic-swimmers-can-sleep-easy-at-rio-despite-late-night-meets-thanks-to-recovery-training/news-story/8d42ecd5305eecabd568e2446c8f964b|website=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="nyt-globonovelas">{{cite web|title=Greed, Passion, Lust, Betrayal, and the Olympics in Between|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/business/media/greed-passion-lust-betrayal-and-the-olympics-in-between.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2014/12/05/swimming-beach-volleyball-will-be-on-late-in-rio |title=Swimming, beach volleyball will be on late in Rio |work=US News & World Report |accessdate=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108195622/http://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2014/12/05/swimming-beach-volleyball-will-be-on-late-in-rio |archivedate=8 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The creative director for the ceremony was [[Rosa Magalhães]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://esporte.band.uol.com.br/rio-2016/noticia/100000772124/rio-2016-rosa-magalhaes-deve-comandar-encerramento.html?mobile=true|title=Rio 2016: Rosa Magalhães deve comandar encerramento|last=|first=|date=19 September 2015|website=Rio 2016|publisher=|language=Pt|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. [[Martinho da Vila]] then performed a rendition of "{{ill|Carinhoso (song)|lt=Carinhoso|pt|Carinhoso}}" by [[Pixinguinha]]. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer [[Roberta Sá]] channeled [[Carmen Miranda]], the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved [[Camp (style)|camp figure]]. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the [[states of Brazil]], sang the [[Brazilian National Anthem|Brazilian national anthem]].

=== Cost ===
[[File:Centro_Olímpico_de_Deodoro.jpg|thumb|[[Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium]]]]

The  Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6&nbsp;billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) ''operational costs'' incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) ''direct capital costs'' incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.<ref name="cost">{{Cite book|ssrn=2804554|title=The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games|last1=Flyvbjerg|first1=Bent|last2=Stewart|first2=Allison|last3=Budzier|first3=Alexander|publisher=Saïd Business School Working Papers (Oxford: University of Oxford)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=18–20|quote=|via=}}</ref>

Indirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6&nbsp;billion compares with costs of US$40–44&nbsp;billion for [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008]] and US$51&nbsp;billion for [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014]], the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2&nbsp;billion.<ref name="cost"/>

==Broadcasting==

[[File:Centro de Mídia Rio 2016.jpg|thumb|left|International Broadcast Centre, at [[Barra Olympic Park]]]]

[[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games. Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.<ref name="tvt-broadcasting">{{cite web|title=Olympic Broadcasting: Inside the Chief Executive's Office|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/olympic-broadcasting-inside-the-chief-executives-office/278970|website=TV Technology|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> [[NHK]] and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in [[8K resolution]] video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the [[2016 Winter Youth Olympics]], 85 hours of video content were originated in [[360-degree video|360-degree]] [[virtual reality]] formats.<ref name="variety-olympicsvr">{{cite web|title=Olympics in VR: NBC to Present 85 Hours of Virtual-Reality Content on Samsung Devices|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/olympics-vr-nbc-virtual-reality-samsung-1201806593/|website=Variety|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> In the United States, [[NBC]] offered [[4K resolution|4K]] content downconverted from the 8K footage and with [[HDR video|HDR]] and [[Dolby Atmos]] support, to participating television providers.<ref name="thr-4kolympics">{{cite web|title=Rio Olympics: NBC Plans 4K and High Dynamic Range for Opening Ceremony Coverage|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/rio-olympics-nbc-plans-4k-897717|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, [[Golf Channel on NBC|Golf Channel]] and [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky New Zealand]] staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.<ref name="tvt-broadcasting"/>

In August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to [[Grupo Globo]]. Replacing [[RecordTV|Record TV]], the deal covers free-to-air coverage on [[Rede Globo]], [[Globosat|pay TV]], and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with [[Rede Bandeirantes]]. IOC board member [[Richard Carrión]] described the agreement as "unprecedented", touting that "by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games."<ref>{{cite press release|title=IOC reaches agreement for 2014 & 2016 broadcast rights in Brazil|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-reaches-agreement-for-2014-2016-broadcast-rights-in-brazil|accessdate=14 February 2017|website=olympic.org|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]|date=27 August 2009}}</ref>

===Olympic Golden Rings Awards===

In November 2017, the [[International Olympic Committee]] announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was best Olympic feature, for which [[TV Globo|TV Globo's]] feature entitled ''Esporte Espetacular'' finished third, and [[China Central Television|China Central Television's]] feature ''A Sequel of Love'' came second. The winner was [[Olympics on NBC|NBC Olympics]] for their feature ''The Most Beautiful Thing''. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF Radio Télévision de la Communauté Française de Belgique collected the third place prize for their profile of [[Nafi Thiam]]. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of [[Izaquias Queiroz]]. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on [[Wayde van Niekerk]]. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the [[BBC Sport]] winning with NBC coming second this time and [[Bulgarian National Television]] finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF-German TV and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places.

===Emblem===
[[Image:Parque Olímpico Rio 2016 (28370259403).jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of the ''Rio 2016'' logo in [[Barra Olympic Park]]]]

The official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design, and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.<ref name=adweek>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Nudd|title=Hated the London 2012 Logo?

It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.<ref name="dezeen-16emblem">{{cite web|title=Rio 2016 motif is "first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics" says designer|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2016/08/11/rio-2016-motif-first-3d-logo-history-olympics-fred-gelli-designer/|website=Dezeen|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>

The logo has been noted as evoking [[Henri Matisse]]'s painting ''[[Dance (Matisse)|Dance]]''. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This is not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] celebrations in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was "an ancient reference" and "in the [[collective unconscious]]". Gelli cited ''Dance'' as an influence of the logo's concept, and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.<ref name="denverpost-telluride">{{cite web|title=Telluride Foundation says Brazil stole its logo for Olympics |url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_28493662/telluride-foundation-says-brazil-stole-its-logo-olympics |website=The Denver Post |accessdate=7 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510051642/http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_28493662/telluride-foundation-says-brazil-stole-its-logo-olympics |archivedate=10 May 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Concerns and controversies==
{{Main|Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics}}
The lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by a number of controversies, including: Brazil's [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|political]] and [[2014 Brazilian economic crisis|economic crisis]]; the [[2015–2016 Zika virus epidemic|Zika virus epidemic]]; the significant [[Guanabara Bay#Environment|pollution in the Guanabara Bay]]; and an ongoing [[Doping in Russia|doping scandal]] involving [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games.

In 2014, [[Operation Car Wash]], an investigation by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]], uncovered unprecedented [[money laundering]] and corruption at the state-controlled oil company [[Petrobras]]. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair.

On 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head [[Carlos Arthur Nuzman|Carlos Nuzman]] was arrested amid a money laundering investigation into a $2&nbsp;million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] president [[Lamine Diack]] and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor [[Sergio Cabral]] (who was already in prison for money laundering offences at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-41678338 |title=Rio Olympics head Carlos Nuzman charged with corruption |date=2017-10-19 |work=BBC News |access-date=26 December 2017}}</ref> On 4&nbsp;July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1U001L|title=Former Rio de Janeiro governor tells judge he paid $2 million bribe to host 2016 Olympics|last=Viga Gaier|first=Rodrigo|date=2019-07-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705030051/https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1U001L |archive-date=2019-07-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Rio mayor [[Eduardo Paes]] was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chade|first=Jamil|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/23/brazil-olympic-world-cup-corruption-bribery|title=Stadium deals, corruption and bribery: the questions at the heart of Brazil's Olympic and World Cup 'miracle'|date=2017-04-23|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-04-06|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1092568/paes-accused-of-corruption-rio-2016|title=Former Rio Mayor Paes accused of corruption during Olympic venue construction|date=29 March 2020|last=Gillen|first=Nancy|website=[[Inside the Games|insidethegames.biz]]|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

An [[2015–16 Zika virus epidemic|outbreak]] of the mosquito-borne [[Zika virus]] in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organisers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.<ref>{{cite news|title=Zika virus: Olympic venues to be inspected daily before and during Games|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/35444254|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=29 January 2016}}</ref> Zika virus transmission was also attributed to [[#Sanitation|inefficient sewage treatment]] in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.<ref name="atlantic 20160331">{{cite web | last=Khazan | first=Olga | title=What Happens When There's Poop in the Water | website=The Atlantic | date=31 March 2016 | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/03/what-happens-when-theres-sewage-in-the-water/476013/ | accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>

In May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author [[Arthur Caplan]], have "an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil".

The [[Guanabara Bay]], whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and [[slum]]s along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the [[Earth Summit]] in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient.

In December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to [[doping in East Germany]]. In November 2015, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) published a report and the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2016.06.15_russia_testing_update_final.pdf|title=Update on the status of Russia testing|website=wada-ama.org|publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency]]|date=June 2016}}</ref> After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by [[Richard McLaren (academic)|Richard McLaren]], which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Ministry of Sport]] and the FSB had operated a "state-directed failsafe system" using a "disappearing positive [test] methodology" (DPM) from "at least late 2011 to August 2015".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control-process/mclaren-independent-investigation-report-part-i|title=McLaren Independent Investigation Report – Part 1|format=PDF|website=wada-ama.org|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|date=2016-07-18}}</ref>
