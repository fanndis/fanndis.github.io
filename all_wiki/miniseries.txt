A '''miniseries''' (or '''mini-series''') is a [[television program]] that tells a story in a predetermined, limited number of [[episode]]s. The term "[[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]" is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, though its meaning does not necessarily equate to "miniseries" in its usage.

== History  ==
A miniseries is distinguished from an ongoing television series; the latter does not usually have a predetermined number of episodes and may continue for several years. Before the term was coined in the US in the early 1970s, the ongoing episodic form was always called a "[[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]", just as a novel appearing in episodes in successive editions of magazines or newspapers is called a serial. In Britain, miniseries are often still referred to as serials.

Several commentators have offered more precise definitions of the term. In ''Halliwell's Television Companion'', [[Leslie Halliwell]] and [[Philip Purser]] argue that miniseries tend to "appear in four to six episodes of various lengths",<ref name=MBC>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/miniseries.htm |publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communication |title=Miniseries |access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>Halliwell, Leslie, and Peter Purser, ''Halliwell's Television Companion'', London: Paladin, 1987</ref> while Stuart Cunningham in ''Textual Innovation in the Australian Historical Mini-series'' defines a miniseries as, "a limited run program of more than two and less than the 13-part season or half season block associated with serial or series programming."<ref name=MBC /><ref>Cunningham, Stuart.

== United Kingdom ==
The British television ''serial'' is rooted in dramatic radio productions developed between the [[World War I|First]] and the [[World War II|Second]] World Wars. In the 1920s the BBC pioneered dramatic readings of books. In 1925 it broadcast ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which has become a holiday favourite. Later, [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], wanting to use radio waves to "part the clouds of ignorance",<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert |last1=Giddings|first2=Keith |last2=Selby|title=The Classic Serial on Television and Radio|url={{Google books|WX6GDAAAQBAJ|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|page=1}}</ref> came up with the idea of a ''[[Classic Serial|classic serial]]'', based on a "classical" literary text.

In 1939 the BBC adapted the romantic novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' for radio broadcast. Its adapter, Jack Inglis, summed up his approach as follows: "The story is simple, with clear cut characters, and falls easily into episodes. It always seems to me, that it is the first duty of an adapter to reproduce in another medium the original flavour and atmosphere of the book". Inglis compressed several characters into one and simplified the plotline. The production struck a chord with listeners and served as a prototype for serials that followed it.

Post-war BBC television picked up the classic radio serial tradition by broadcasting ''[[The Warden (TV series)|The Warden]]'' by [[Anthony Trollope]] over six-episodes in 1951. ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' was serialised in 1952, ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in 1955. In 1953 the BBC broadcast the first serial written specifically for television: the six-part ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]''. Its success paved the way for two more six-part serials: ''Quatermass II'' in 1955 and ''Quatermass and the Pit'' in 1958. Early television technology considerably influenced the quality of the broadcast product: almost all productions were broadcast live from a small studio, with inserts shot on 35&nbsp;mm film at the beginning and end of episodes. After the invention of [[videotape]] the production could be recorded for re-runs. In November 1960 the BBC televised a thirteen-episode adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Barnaby Rudge (TV series)|Barnaby Rudge]]''. In December of that year it broadcast a four-episode dramatization of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert |last1=Giddings|first2=Keith |last2=Selby|title=The Classic Serial on Television and Radio|url={{Google books|WX6GDAAAQBAJ|page=20|plainurl=yes}}|page=20}}</ref>

To compete with commercial television, BBC launched [[BBC-2]] in 1964. It had a new time slot allocated for classic serial adaptations on Saturday evenings. The late-night broadcast allowed for more risky and sophisticated choices and for longer episodes. In 1967 ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' was broadcast in 26 50-minute episodes. Following its success in Britain, the series was shown in the United States on public television and broadcast all over the world, and became the first BBC television series to be sold to the Soviet Union.<ref name= pbs>''[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/forsyte/ei_saga.html The Forsyte Saga]'' at PBS [[Masterpiece Theatre]], URL accessed 12 October 2009</ref><ref name= televisionheaven>{{cite web |url = http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/forsyte.htm |title =The Forsyte Saga|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090709113212/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/forsyte.htm |archive-date=2009-07-09 |work= televisionheaven.co.uk}}</ref>

== North America ==
[[Anthology series]] dominated American dramatic programming during the [[Golden Age of Television]], when "every night was opening night; one never knew when a flick of the knob would spark the birth of great theatrical literature".<ref name="picthist">{{cite web|url= https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Bookshelf/History/A-Pictorial-History-of-Television-Settel-1969.pdf|title=A pictorial history of television|first1=Irving|last1=Settel|first2=William |last2=Laas|year=1969}}</ref> A different story and a different set of characters were presented in each episode. Very rarely the stories were split into several episodes, like 1955 ''Mr. Lincoln'' from [[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]] series, which was presented in two parts, or 1959 adaptation of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SCV31|title=For Whom the Bell Tolls (part 1)|access-date=August 30, 2018|year=1959}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SCV41|title=For Whom the Bell Tolls (part 2)|access-date=August 30, 2018|year=1959}}</ref> from ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' series, which was initially planned by the director [[John Frankenheimer]] to consist of three parts, but ultimately was broadcast as two 90-minute installments.<ref>{{cite web|website = Television Academy Interviews |url= https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/shows/playhouse-90-whom-bell-tolls |title=Playhouse 90: "For Whom the Bell Tolls" |last=Frankenheimer|first=John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/exhibits/golden-age-television/playhouse-90-and-end-golden-age/producing-playhouse-90-whom-bell|title=Producing Playhouse 90: 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' |publisher= The Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref> The high cost and technical difficulties of staging a new play every week, which would cost as much as—or more than—an episode of a filmed television series, led to the demise of anthology programming by the end of the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/exhibits/golden-age-television/playhouse-90-and-end-golden-age|title=Playhouse 90 and the end of the Golden Age |publisher= The Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref> The void was filled with less expensive series like ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' or ''[[Wagon Train]]'', which featured the same characters every week and had higher potential for lucrative rebroadcast and syndication rights. It was the American success in 1969–1970 of the British 26-episode serial ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1967) that made TV executives realize that finite multi-episode stories based on novels could be popular and could provide a boost to weekly viewing figures.<ref name=MBC /><ref name=Wheen />

The form began in earnest in the spring of 1974 with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s eight-part serial ''[[The National Dream (miniseries)|The National Dream]]'', based on [[Pierre Berton]]'s nonfiction book of the same name about the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s three-part ''[[QB VII]]'', based on the novel by [[Leon Uris]]. Following these initial forays, broadcasters used miniseries to bring other books to the screen. 

''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', based on the novel by [[Irwin Shaw]], was broadcast in 12 one-hour episodes in 1976 by ABC. It popularized the miniseries format and started a decade-long golden age of television miniseries versions of popular books featuring stars above television class.<ref name = "Minihistory"/> [[Alex Haley]]'s ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries) |Roots]]'' in 1977 can fairly be called the first [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] success of the format. Its success in the USA was partly due to its schedule: the 12-hour duration was split into eight episodes broadcast on consecutive nights, resulting in a finale with a 71 percent share of the audience and 130 million viewers, which at the time was the highest rated TV program of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' (April 11–17, 1987) called 1977's ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries) |Jesus of Nazareth]]'' "the best miniseries of all time" and "unparalleled television". ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'', the 1985 adaptation of a [[North and South (trilogy)|1982 novel]] by [[John Jakes]], remains one of the 10 highest rated miniseries in TV history.<ref name="TS 2007-08">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribstar.com/news/lifestyles/john-jakes-journey-to-new-york-times-bestseller-list-included/article_8a3877e1-8e78-593d-9de8-b878d396254a.html |title=John Jakes' journey to ''New York Times'' bestseller list included boyhood years in Terre Haute|last=Bennett|first=Mark|date=August 11, 2007|work=[[Tribune-Star]]}}</ref><ref name="P&C 2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=11968 |title=Bestselling novelist penning saga of fictional Charleston family|last=Thompson|first=Bill |date=March 18, 2002|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|publisher=Excerpted at DePauw.edu|access-date= January 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="JJCC">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Mary Ellen|title=John Jakes: A Critical Companion|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]]|date=November 30, 1996 |page= 3|chapter=The People's Author: The Life of John Jakes|isbn=0-313-29530-1 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pzmvCXfuoAC&q=highest+rated+miniseries+jakes&pg=PA3 |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>

The [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series|Emmy Award]] was taken three times by the British police procedural drama ''[[Prime Suspect]]''. A highlight of the 1990s was an HBO production ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', telling the story of the landmark [[Apollo program|Apollo]] expeditions to the [[Moon]] during the 1960s and early 1970s.

In the 21st century the format made a comeback on cable television and became popular on [[Comparison of video streaming aggregators|streaming services]]. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], for example, has had some of its greatest successes with miniseries such as ''[[America: The Story of Us]]'', ''[[Hatfields & McCoys (miniseries)|Hatfields & McCoys]]'' and ''[[The Bible (miniseries)|The Bible]]'',{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} ''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]]'' by [[USA Network]] was honored with a [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series]] award, while HBO's ''[[Big Little Lies (miniseries)|Big Little Lies]]'' won eight Emmy awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/big-little-lies|title=Television Academy: Big Little Lies|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

To designate one-season shows that are not intended for being renewed for additional seasons, the broadcast and television industry came up with terms like "limited series" or "event series". These terms also apply to multi-season shows which feature rotating casts and storylines each season, such as ''[[American Horror Story]]'', ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' and ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]''. This makes the self-contained season longer than a miniseries, but shorter than the entire run of the multi-season series. This terminology became relevant for the purpose of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series|categorization]] of programs for [[Primetime Emmy Award|industry awards]].<ref name=TVGuide>Schneider, Michael (March 9, 2015). "Inside the Emmys' New Rules". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp 8–9.</ref>

Several television executives interviewed by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that the term "miniseries" has negative connotations to the public, having become associated with [[melodrama]]-heavy works that were commonly produced under the format, while "limited series" or "event series" demand higher respect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/heroes-24-whats-difference-between-683563|title=''Heroes'', ''24'': What's the Difference Between a 'Miniseries,' 'Limited' or 'Event' Series?|author=Lacey Rose and Lesley Goldberg|date=February 28, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 25, 2015}}</ref> (Such was the cause of the parody miniseries ''[[The Spoils of Babylon]]'', which lampooned many of the negative stereotypes of miniseries.)<ref name="production">{{cite web|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=IFC's "The Spoils of Babylon" to feature Jessica Alba, Will Ferrell, Toby Maguire, Kristen Wiig, Tim Robbins and more|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/06/ifcs-the-spoils-of-babylon-to-feature-jessica-alba-will-ferrell-toby-maguire-kristen-wiig-tim-robbins-and-more|publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]]|date=June 3, 2013|access-date=June 3, 2013}}</ref>

[[Game show]]s have occasionally used the miniseries format. ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' began its American run as a two-week miniseries event, one that brought great success to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |title="ABC Hopes "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" Lightning Can Strike Twice" |last=Bauder |first=David |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=August 4, 2009 |access-date=August 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132904/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/05/abc-hopes-who-wants-to-be_n_251566.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Millionaire'' would continue to broadcast as a regular series under various formats until it ended in May 2019 after 20 seasons.

Most game shows that use the miniseries format (e.g. ''[[Duel (U.S. game show)|Duel]]'', ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', and ''[[It's Your Chance of a Lifetime]]'') do not last longer than one season; exceptions include ''[[The American Bible Challenge]]'' (which aired for three seasons on [[Game Show Network]]) and ''[[500 Questions]]'' (which aired for two seasons on ABC).

== Japan ==
Japanese serialized television production can be traced back to the ''Sunday Diary of My Home'' (''Waga Ya no Nichiyo Nikki''), which was aired by NTV in 1953 and consisted of 25 half-hour episodes. This "home drama" focused on generational differences and the contradictions of being a loving family in a confined space, outlining a style of drama that lives on to this day. In the same year NHK tried its own variation of the home drama format in the ''Ups and Downs Toward Happiness'' (''Kofuku e no Kifuku''), which comprised thirteen episodes. Its protagonists, the formerly wealthy but turned penniless family is forced to struggle for its own existence.<ref name=dorama-encyclopedia>{{cite book |last1=Clemens |first1=Jonathan |last2=Tamamuro |first2=Motoko |title=The Dorama Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese TV Drama Since 1953 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7I-VyCfZdQC&pg=xiii |access-date=September 22, 2017 |year=2003 |publisher=Asahi TV |isbn=978-1-880656-81-5 |page=XIII }}</ref> Since then, [[Japanese television drama]], also called {{nihongo|'''dorama'''|ドラマ}}, became a staple of [[Television in Japan|Japanese television]].

Evening doramas air weekly and usually comprise ten to fourteen one-hour long episodes. Typically, instead of being episodic there is one story running throughout the episodes. Since they are of a fixed length, doramas have a definite ending, and since they are relatively long, they can explore character, situation, and interesting dialog in a way not possible in movies. Doramas are never canceled mid-season, but they also do not continue into the next season even if extremely popular. Popular doramas do often give rise to "specials" made after the final episode, if the show has been a huge success.<ref name="renzoku">{{cite web

== South Korea ==
[[South Korea]] started to broadcast [[Korean drama|television series]] ({{ko-hhrm|드라마||'''deurama'''}}) in the 1960s. Since then, the shows became popular worldwide, partially due to the spread of the [[Korean Wave]], with streaming services that offer multiple language subtitles.

Korean dramas are usually helmed by one director and written by one screenwriter, thus having a distinct directing style and language, unlike American television series, where often several directors and writers work together.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200701/200701080003.html| title = Korean Vs.

Historical series (''[[Sageuk]]'') may be longer, with 50 to 200 episodes, and are either based on historical figures, incorporate historical events, or use a historical backdrop. While technically the word ''sageuk'' literally translates to "historical drama," the term is typically reserved for dramas taking place during Korean history.<ref>{{Cite web

Korean dramas are usually shot within a very tight schedule, often a few hours before actual broadcast. Screenplays are flexible and may change anytime during production, depending on viewers' feedback.

== Soviet Union/Russia ==
While the [[Soviet Union]] was among the first European countries to resume television broadcast after the [[Second World War]], early Soviet television did not indulge its viewers with a variety of programming. News, sports, concerts and movies were the main staples during the 1950s. With state control over television production and broadcast, television was intended not merely for entertainment, but also as the means of education and propaganda. Soap operas, quiz shows and games were considered too lowbrow.<ref name="sovtelefilm">{{Cite web

In the beginning of the 1960s television was expanding rapidly. The increase in the number of channels and the duration of daily broadcast caused shortage of content deemed suitable for broadcast. This led to production of [[television film]]s, in particular ''multiple-episode television films'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''многосерийный телевизионный фильм''' ''mnogoseriyny televizionny film'')—the official Soviet moniker for miniseries.<ref name="sovtelefilm" /> Despite that the Soviet Union started broadcasting in color in 1967, color TV sets did not become widespread until the end of the 1980s. This justified shooting made-for-TV movies on black-and-white film.

It is a period drama set in the Second World War depicting the Soviet guerrilla fighters infiltrating German compound and directing the fire of the regular Soviet Army to destroy the German airfield. During the 1970s the straightforward fervor gave way to a more nuanced interplay of patriotism, family and everyday life wrapped into traditional genres of crime drama, spy show or thriller.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Russian television saw a period of privatization and liberalization. The television programming of the 1990s-2000s included a great deal of crime dramas set both in contemporary times (''The Criminal Saint Petersburg'',<ref>{{Cite web

In [[Brazil]], the [[Rede Globo]] television network commenced the production of this type of television genre with the transmission of ''Lampião e Maria Bonita'',<ref>{{Cite web

[[Rede Manchete]], in the following year after its creation (1984), has produced and broadcast ''Marquesa de Santos''.

The [[:pt:Lista de minisséries da Rede Globo|Brazilian miniseries]] usually consist of several dozen chapters, occasionally having longer duration, like [[:pt:Aquarela do Brasil (minissérie)|Brazilian Aquarelle]]<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> that consists of 60 chapters, making it almost a "mini-[[telenovela]]".

Due to the fact that they are broadcast at a later time than telenovelas (usually after 22:00 or 10 p.m.), miniseries are more daring in terms of themes, scenes, dialogues and situations, a function previously played by the "novelas das dez"—a popular term referring to the telenovelas that were broadcast at 10 p.m. between 1969 and 1979.

Miniseries made by Rede Globo are released in the [[DVD]] format by the aforementioned television network, and a few of these miniseries are also released as a book, especially in the case of great successes such as ''[[Anos Rebeldes]]'' ("Rebel Years") and ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'' ("The House of the Seven Women"); the latter was based on the eponymous book written by [[Letícia Wierzchowski]], which became known due to the miniseries.
