She is a member of the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Indian parliament and a member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). She is the widow of Indian politician [[Sanjay Gandhi]]. She has been a minister in four governments, most recently in [[Narendra Modi's government]] from May 2014 to May 2019. Gandhi authored a number of books in the areas of [[etymology]], law and [[animal welfare]].

==Personal life==
Maneka Anand was born on 26 August 1956 in [[Delhi]], India into a [[Sikh]] family. Her father was [[Indian Army]] officer Lt. Col. Tarlochan Singh Anand and her mother was Amteshwar Anand. She went to Lawrence School and later Lady Shri Ram College for Women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/model-gandhi-bahu-modis-minister-manekas-big-fight-against-dynasty-1543137.html|title=Model, Gandhi bahu, Modi's minister: Maneka's fight against dynasty|website=Firstpost.com|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref name = "India Today">{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/exclusive-extract-from-khushwant-singhs-autobiography/1/289506.html|title=Exclusive extract from Khushwant Singhs autobiography}}</ref> She subsequently studied German at [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJ5eAAAAIBAJ&pg=5763,5470655|title=Mrs Gandhi's son to marry|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=St. Josephs News Press|date=29 July 1974}}</ref>

Maneka first met Sanjay Gandhi in 1973 at a cocktail party thrown by her uncle, Major-General Kapur, to celebrate the forthcoming marriage of his son. Maneka married Gandhi, the son of the Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], one year later on 23 September 1974.<ref name=Singh>{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Kushwant|title=Mrs. G, Maneka and the Anands|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020210/spectrum/book5.htm|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=The Tribune|date=10 February 2002}}</ref>

[[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]] of 1975-77 saw the rise of Sanjay into politics and Maneka was seen with him almost every time on his tours as she helped him in campaigns. It is often said that during the Emergency, Sanjay had total control over his mother (Indira) and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO ([[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister Office]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/26022710/Mystery-Called-Sanjay-Gandhi |title=Mystery Called Sanjay Gandhi|publisher=Scribd|date=21 November 2007|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Express News Service|title=Emergency 'propagandist' who banned Kishore Kumar songs|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/emergency-propagandist-who-banned-kishore-kumar-songs/1127804/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Indian Express|date=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="The Life of Indira Gandhi">{{cite journal|last=Dasgupta|first=Swapan|journal=Third World Quarterly|title=Sanjay Gandhi|date=July 1985|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1080/01436598508419863|pages=731–778}}<!--|accessdate=17 January 2014--></ref>

Maneka Gandhi founded the news magazine ''Surya'' which later played a key role in promotion of the Congress party after its defeat in the [[1977 Indian general election|1977 election]] following the Emergency.

Gandhi went to court to fight an attempt by the government in power at the time to confiscate her passport and won a landmark decision on personal liberty. In the case of ''Maneka Gandhi v Union of India'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India, 1978 AIR 597 |url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ |publisher=Supreme Court of India |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> the court found that "Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic setup."

In 1980 Gandhi gave birth to a son, Feroze, named after his paternal grandfather. Her mother-in-law added the name [[Varun Gandhi|Varun]]. Gandhi was just twenty-three years old, and her son just 100 days old, when her husband died in an air crash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050806/asp/weekend/story_5061896.asp |title=Art of commitment |last=Basu|first=Arundhati|location=Calcutta, India|work=The Telegraph|date=6 August 2005}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Maneka's relationship with Indira Gandhi gradually disintegrated after Sanjay's death and they would continually argue with one another. Maneka was eventually forced out of 1, [[Safdarjung Road]], the prime minister's  residence, after a fallout with Indira.<ref name = "India Today"/> She founded the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch along with [[Akbar Ahmad]]. The party primarily focused on youth empowerment and employment. It won four out of five seats in the [[Elections in Andhra Pradesh]].

Gandhi published ''The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi Names'', in recognition of her husband's [[Zoroastrian]] faith.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSdCL2ZfflIC|title=The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi Names|first1=Maneka|last1=Gandhi|first2=Ozair|last2=Husain|date=2 August 2017|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780143031840|accessdate=2 August 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name="Hinnells2005">{{citation|last=Hinnells|first=John|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfO4-5yh7VYC&pg=PA397|date=28 April 2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|pages=397–398}}</ref>

Gandhi has filed [[Public Interest Litigation]]s that have achieved the replacement of the municipal killing of homeless dogs with a sterilisation programme (Animal Birth Control programs, commonly abbreviated as ABCs), the unregulated sale of airguns and a ban on mobile or travelling zoos. She currently chairs  the Jury of International Energy Globe Foundation  which meets annually in Austria to award the best environmental innovations of the year.  She is a member of the [[Eurosolar]] Board and the [[Wuppertal Institute]], Germany.

Gandhi started the organisation ''[[People for Animals]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleforanimalsindia.org/ |title=PEOPLE FOR ANIMALS |website=peopleforanimalsindia.org}}</ref> in 1992 and it is the largest organisation for animal rights/welfare in India. Gandhi is also a patron of [[International Animal Rescue]]. While she is not a vegan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source=Page&Skin=TOINEW&BaseHref=TOIBG/2010/02/23&PageLabel=3&EntityId=Ar00300&ViewMode=HTML&GZ=T|title=Article Window|website=Epaper.timesofindia.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> she has advocated this lifestyle on ethical and health grounds.

She has also authored a book under the same title. Her other books were about Indian people names. She is a cast member for the documentary ''A Delicate Balance''.<ref name="adb"/>

==Criticism==
Gandhi has often been criticized for her comments. In June 2017, during a Facebook Live session, she commented that men do not commit suicide. She received negative responses to the comment and spent the rest of the chat answering questions related to this, with chatters pointing out that 68% of the suicide cases reported in India were committed by men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/men-do-not-commit-suicide-says-minister-maneka-gandhi-on-facebook-1718640|title=Men Do Not Commit Suicide, Says Minister Maneka Gandhi On Facebook|website=Ndtv.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> In March 2017, she said that an early curfew for girls in hostels helped young women control their "hormonal outbursts" and received a backlash for the comment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneka-gandhi-draws-twitterati-fire-for-hormonal-outbursts-comment/story-dwoWhtQ4MlqlJD8ogvh1pO.html|title=Maneka Gandhi under fire for 'hormonal outbursts' remark|date=7 March 2017|website=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Alleged Spread of hatred against muslims ===
Police in Kerala booked Maneka on the basis of complaints against her for promoting hatred by levelling accusations coated with communal overtones for a death of a pregnant elephant, against residents in the Muslim-majority district of [[Malappuram district|Malappuram]] on June 2020. While the elephant died in Mannarcad, [[Palakkad district]], nearly 90 km from Malappuram, BJP leaders including Maneka targeted the only Muslim-majority district of Kerala.<ref name="Telegraph2020">{{cite web | last=Rakesh | first=K.M. | title=Maneka Gandhi booked for jumbo hate drive | website=Telegraph India | date=2020-06-06 | url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/maneka-gandhi-booked-for-jumbo-hate-drive/cid/1778732 | access-date=2020-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/factually-speaking-why-maneka-gandhi-s-claims-on-kerala-elephants-malappuram-crime-rate-are-baseless-1685879-2020-06-05 |title=Factually speaking: Maneka Gandhi's claims on Kerala elephants, Malappuram crime rate are baseless - News Analysis News }}</ref> She said: “It’s a murder.
