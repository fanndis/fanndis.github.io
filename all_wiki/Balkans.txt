==Name==
===Etymology===
The origin of the word ''Balkan'' is obscure; it may be related to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''bālk'' 'mud', and the Turkish suffix ''an'' 'swampy forest'<ref>Current Trends in Altaic Linguistics; European Balkan(s), Turkic bal(yk) and the Problem of Their Original Meanings, Marek Stachowski, Jagiellonian University, p. 618.</ref> or Persian ''balā-khāna'' 'big high house'.<ref name="Todorova 1997 27" /> Related words are also found in other [[Turkic languages]].<ref name="oed">''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2013, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14891 ''s.v.'']</ref> The term was brought to Europe with [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] influence, where ''{{lang|tr|balkan}}'' means 'chain of wooded mountains' in [[Turkic languages]].<ref name="Balkan.">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/balkan.html |title=Balkan |work=Encarta World English Dictionary |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=31 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110000315/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/balkan.html |archivedate=10 January 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Büyük Türkçe Sözlük |title=balkan |publisher=Türk Dil Kurumu |url=http://www.tdkterim.gov.tr/bts/ |quote=Sarp ve ormanlık sıradağ |language=Turkish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825034714/http://www.tdkterim.gov.tr/bts/ |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref>

===Historical names and meaning===
====Classical antiquity and the early Middle Ages====
From [[classical antiquity]] through the [[Middle Ages]], the Balkan Mountains were called by the local [[Thracians|Thracian]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDoQAQAAMAAJ&q=hemus+thracian+name |title=Bulgaria |page=54 |work=Hemus – a Thracian name |publisher=Indiana University |year=1986}}</ref> name ''[[Haemus]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Balkan Studies|date=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEJpAAAAMAAJ&q=thracian+sama+greek+haemus}}</ref> According to Greek mythology, the [[Thrace|Thracian]] king [[Haemus]] was turned into a mountain by [[Zeus]] as a punishment and the mountain has remained with his name. A reverse name scheme has also been suggested. D. Dechev considers that Haemus (Αἷμος) is derived from a [[Thracian language|Thracian]] word ''*saimon'', 'mountain ridge'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Decev |first1=D |title=Balkan Studies |date=1986 |publisher=University of Michigan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEJpAAAAMAAJ&q=thracian+sama+greek+haemus |accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> A third possibility is that "Haemus" ({{lang|grc|Αἵμος}}) derives from the Greek word "haima" ({{lang|grc|αἷμα}}) meaning 'blood'. The myth relates to a fight between [[Zeus]] and the monster/titan [[Typhon]]. Zeus injured Typhon with a thunder bolt and Typhon's blood fell on the mountains, from which they got their name.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_2900870232069|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_2900870232069/page/20 20]|quote=Haemus bloody zeus typhon.|title=Gods and Heroes of the Greeks: The Library of Apollodorus|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|accessdate=12 September 2014|isbn=978-0870232060|last1=Apollodorus|year=1976}}</ref>

====Late Middle Ages and Ottoman period====
The earliest mention of the name appears in an early 14th-century Arab map, in which the [[Haemus Mons|Haemus mountains]] are referred to as ''Balkan''.<ref name="Dobrev 1989">{{cite book | title = Проиcхождение географического названия Балкан – Sixieme Congres international d'etudes du Sud-Est Europeen |language=French | first= Ivan | last = Dobrev | publisher = Ed.de l'Académie bulgare des Sciences | year = 1989 | location = Sofia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jxYZnQEACAAJ }}</ref> The first attested time the name "Balkan" was used in the West for the mountain range in [[Bulgaria]] was in a letter sent in 1490 to Pope [[Innocent VIII]] by [[Filippo Buonaccorsi|Buonaccorsi Callimaco]], an Italian humanist, writer and diplomat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Todorova|first=Maria|title=Imagining the Balkans|page=22|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-538786-5}}</ref> The [[Ottomans]] first mention it in a document dated from 1565.<ref name="Todorova 1997 27" /> There has been no other documented usage of the word to refer to the region before that, although other Turkic tribes had already settled in or were passing through the region.<ref name="Todorova 1997 27">{{cite book | title = Imagining the Balkans | first=Maria N. | last =Todorova | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | year = 1997 | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-EuFwLQhvYMC&pg=PA27 | page=27| isbn=9780195087512 }}</ref> There is also a claim about an earlier [[Bulgar languages|Bulgar]] Turkic origin of the word popular in Bulgaria, however it is only an unscholarly assertion.<ref name="Todorova 1997 27" /> The word was used by the Ottomans in [[Rumelia]] in its general meaning of mountain, as in ''Kod̲j̲a-Balkan'', ''Čatal-Balkan'', and ''Ungurus-Balkani̊'', but especially it was applied to the Haemus mountain.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Editors: P.

Among Russian travelers not so burdened by classical toponymy, Balkan was the preferred term".<ref>Maria Todorova Gutgsell, ''Imagining the Balkans'' (Oxford University Press, 2009; {{ISBN|0-19-972838-0}}), p. 24.</ref>

===Evolution of meaning in 19th and 20th century===
The term was not commonly used in geographical literature until the mid-19th century because already then scientists like [[Carl Ritter]] warned that only the part South of the Balkan Mountains can be considered as a peninsula and considered it to be renamed as "Greek peninsula". Other prominent geographers who didn't agree with Zeune were [[Hermann Wagner (geographer)|Hermann Wagner]], [[Theobald Fischer]], [[Marion Newbigin]], [[Albrecht Penck]], while Austrian diplomat [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] in 1869 for the same territory used the term ''Südostereuropäische Halbinsel'' ("Southeasterneuropean peninsula"). Another reason it was not commonly accepted as the definition of then [[East Thrace|European Turkey]] had a similar land extent. However, after the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878) there was a political need for a new term and gradually "the Balkans" was revitalized, but in the maps, the northern border was in Serbia and Montenegro without Greece (it only depicted the Ottoman occupied parts of Europe), while Yugoslavian maps also included Croatia and Bosnia. The term Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for European Turkey, the political borders of former Ottoman Empire provinces.<ref name="DaskalovMishkova2017"/><ref name="Altić11"/><ref name="VezenkovIWM06">{{cite journal |last=Vezenkov |first=Alexander |date=2006 |title=History against Geography: Should We Always Think of the Balkans As Part of Europe? |url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xxi/alexander-vezenkov/ |journal=Junior Visiting Fellows' Conferences |volume=XXI |issue=4 |access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref>

The usage of the term changed in the very end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century when was embraced by Serbian geographers, most prominently by [[Jovan Cvijić]].<ref name="Somek15"/> It was done with political reasoning as affirmation for [[Serbian nationalism]] on the whole territory of the [[South Slavs]], and also included anthropological and ethnological studies of the South Slavs through which were claimed various nationalistic and racialist theories.<ref name="Somek15"/> Through such policies and Yugoslavian maps the term was elevated to the modern status of a geographical region.<ref name="Altić11"/> The term acquired political nationalistic connotations far from its initial geographic meaning,<ref name="DaskalovMishkova2017"/> arising from political changes from the late 19th century to the creation of post–[[World War I]] [[Yugoslavia]] (initially the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918).<ref name="Altić11"/> After the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] beginning in June 1991, the term "Balkans" acquired a negative political meaning, especially in Croatia and Slovenia, as well in worldwide casual usage for war conflicts and fragmentation of territory (see [[Balkanization]]).<ref name="Somek15"/><ref name="Altić11"/>

===Southeast Europe===
{{Main|Southeast Europe}}
In part due to the historical and political connotations of the term "Balkans",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balkanize|title=Balkanize|publisher=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> especially since the military conflicts of the 1990s in [[Yugoslavia]] in the western half of the region, the term "[[Southeast Europe]]" is becoming increasingly popular.<ref name="Altić11"/><ref>{{cite book |title=A history of Eastern Europe |last=Bideleux |first=Robert |author2=Ian Jeffries |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-36627-4 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTB0gn_qwTcC}}</ref> A [[European Union]] initiative of 1999 is called the ''[[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]]'', and the online newspaper ''Balkan Times'' renamed itself ''[[Southeast European Times]]'' in 2003.

The current territory of Italy includes only the small area around [[Trieste]] inside the Balkan Peninsula. However, the regions of Trieste and Istria are not usually considered part of the Balkans by Italian geographers, due to their definition of the Balkans that limits its western border to the Kupa River.<ref name="Agostini, 2004, p.78">Istituto Geografico De Agostini, ''L'Enciclopedia Geografica – Vol. I – Italia'', 2004, Ed.

===Balkans===
The term "the Balkans" is used more generally for the region; it includes states in the region, which may extend beyond the peninsula, and is not defined by the geography of the peninsula itself.

Historians state the Balkans comprise [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].<ref>The standard scholarly histories of the Balkans include Romania.

Each of these countries aims to be part of the [[future enlargement of the European Union]] and reach democracy and transmission scores but, until then, they will be strongly connected with the pre-EU waiting program [[CEFTA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu/publications/books/Unfinished%20Business%20Pdf/ch01_Bieber.pdf |title=Perspectives on the Region |accessdate=19 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904001128/http://transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu/publications/books/Unfinished%20Business%20Pdf/ch01_Bieber.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Croatia, considered part of the Western Balkans, joined the EU in July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_6.5.2.html|title=Fact Sheets on the European Union:The Western Balkans|publisher=European Parliament|first=André|last=De Munter|date=December 2016|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>

===Criticism of the geographical definition===
The term is criticized for having a geopolitical, rather than a geographical meaning and definition, as a multiethnic and political area in the southeastern part of Europe.<ref name="Altić11"/> The geographical term of a [[peninsula]] defines that the water border must be longer than land, with the land side being the shortest in the triangle, but that is not the case with the Balkan Peninsula.<ref name="Somek15"/><ref name="Altić11"/> Both Eastern and Western water cathetus from [[Odessa]] to [[Cape Matapan]] (ca. 1230–1350&nbsp;km) and from [[Trieste]] to Cape Matapan (ca. 1270–1285&nbsp;km) are shorter than land cathetus from Trieste to Odessa (ca. 1330–1365&nbsp;km).<ref name="Somek15"/><ref name="Altić11"/> The land has a too wide line connected to the continent to be technically proclaimed as a peninsula - [[Szczecin]] (920&nbsp;km) and [[Rostock]] (950&nbsp;km) at the [[Baltic Sea]] are closer to Trieste than Odessa yet it is not considered as another European peninsula.<ref name="Somek15"/> Since the late 19th and early 20th-century literature is not known where is exactly the northern border between the peninsula and the continent,<ref name="Somek15"/><ref name="Altić11"/> with an issue, whether the rivers are suitable for its definition.<ref name="DaskalovMishkova2017"/> In the studies the Balkans natural borders, especially the northern border, are often avoided to be addressed, considered as a "fastidious problem" by André Blanc in ''Geography of the Balkans'' (1965), while John Lampe and Marvin Jackman in ''Balkan Economic History'' (1971) noted that "modern geographers seem agreed in rejecting the old idea of a Balkan Peninsula".<ref name="DaskalovMishkova2017"/> Another issue is the name because the [[Balkan Mountains]] which are mostly located in Northern Bulgaria are not dominating the region by length and area like the [[Dinaric Alps]].<ref name="Somek15"/> An eventual Balkan peninsula can be considered a territory South of the Balkan Mountains, with a possible name "Greek-Albanian Peninsula."<ref name="DaskalovMishkova2017"/><ref name="Altić11"/> The term influenced the meaning of [[Southeast Europe]] which again is not properly defined by geographical factors yet historical borders of the Balkans.<ref name="Altić11"/>

Croatian geographers and academics are highly critical of inclusion of Croatia within the broad geographical, social-political and historical context of the Balkans, while the neologism Western Balkans is perceived as a humiliation of Croatia by the European political powers.<ref name="Somek15">{{cite magazine |last=Somek |first=Petra |date=29 October 2015 |title=Hrvatska nije na "zapadnom Balkanu" |trans-title=Croatia is not on "Western Balkans" |url=http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/565/hrvatska-nije-na-zapadnom-balkanu-24991/ |language=Croatian |magazine=[[Vijenac]] |location=Zagreb |publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] |access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> According to M.

{{quote|This very alibi confronts us with the first of many paradoxes concerning Balkan: its geographic delimitation was never precise. It is as if one can never receive a definitive answer to the question, "Where does it begin?" For Serbs, it begins down there in Kosovo or Bosnia, and they defend the Christian civilization against this Europe's Other. For Croats, it begins with the Orthodox, despotic, Byzantine Serbia, against which Croatia defends the values of democratic Western civilization. For Slovenes, it begins with Croatia, and we Slovenes are the last outpost of the peaceful Mitteleuropa. For Italians and Austrians, it begins with Slovenia, where the reign of the Slavic hordes starts. For Germans, Austria itself, on account of its historic connections, is already tainted by the Balkanic corruption and inefficiency. For some arrogant Frenchmen, Germany is associated with the Balkanian Eastern savagery—up to the extreme case of some conservative anti-European-Union Englishmen for whom, in an implicit way, it is ultimately the whole of continental Europe itself that functions as a kind of Balkan Turkish global empire with Brussels as the new Constantinople, the capricious despotic center threatening English freedom and sovereignty. So Balkan is always the Other: it lies somewhere else, always a little bit more to the southeast, with the paradox that, when we reach the very bottom of the Balkan peninsula, we again magically escape Balkan. Greece is no longer Balkan proper, but the cradle of our Western civilization.}}

[[File:Lac de Shkodra.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Skadar]], the largest lake in the Balkan Peninsula]]

Most of the area is covered by mountain ranges running from the northwest to southeast. The main ranges are the [[Balkan mountains]] (Stara Planina in [[Bulgarian language]]), running from the [[Black Sea]] coast in [[Bulgaria]] to the border with [[Serbia]], the [[Rila|Rilo]]-[[Rhodope mountains|Rhodope]] [[massif]] in southern Bulgaria, northern [[Greece]] and southeastern [[North Macedonia]], the [[Dinaric Alps]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Montenegro]], the [[Šar Mountains|Šar]] massif which spreads from [[Albania]] to [[North Macedonia]], and the [[Pindus]] range, spanning from southern Albania into central Greece and the [[Albanian Alps]]. The highest mountain of the region is [[Rila]] in Bulgaria, with [[Musala]] at 2925&nbsp;m, [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]] in Greece, being second at 2917&nbsp;m and [[Vihren]] in Bulgaria being the third at 2914&nbsp;m. The [[karst]] field or [[polje]] is a common feature of the landscape.

On the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coasts the climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], on the Black Sea coast the climate is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] and [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]], and inland it is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]]. In the northern part of the peninsula and on the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. In the southern part winters are milder. The humid continental climate is predominant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern Croatia, Bulgaria, [[Kosovo]], northern Montenegro, the Republic of North Macedonia, the interior of Albania and [[Serbia]], while the other, less common climates, the humid subtropical and oceanic climates, are seen on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria and [[East Thrace|Balkan Turkey (European Turkey)]]; and the Mediterranean climate is seen on the coast of Albania, the coast of Croatia, Greece, southern Montenegro and the Aegean coast of [[East Thrace|Balkan Turkey (European Turkey)]].{{clarify|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Over the centuries forests have been cut down and replaced with [[Bush (plant)|bush]]. In the southern part and on the coast there is [[evergreen]] vegetation. Inland there are woods typical of Central Europe ([[oak]] and [[beech]], and in the mountains, [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[pine]]). The [[tree line]] in the mountains lies at the height of 1800–2300&nbsp;m. The land provides [[habitat]]s for numerous [[endemic]] species, including extraordinarily abundant insects and reptiles that serve as food for a variety of [[birds of prey]] and rare [[vulture]]s.

The soils are generally poor, except on the [[plain]]s, where areas with natural grass, fertile soils and warm summers provide an opportunity for tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is mostly unsuccessful because of the mountains, hot summers and poor soils, although certain cultures such as [[olive]] and grape flourish.

Resources of energy are scarce, except in [[Kosovo]], where considerable [[coal]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[chromium]] and [[silver]] deposits are located.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |work=BBC News |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214231712/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |archivedate=14 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other deposits of [[coal]], especially in Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia, also exist. [[Lignite]] deposits are widespread in Greece. [[Petroleum]] scarce reserves exist in Greece, Serbia and Albania. Natural gas deposits are scarce. [[Hydropower]] is in wide use, from over 1,000 dams. The often relentless [[bora wind]] is also being harnessed for power generation.

Metal ores are more usual than other raw materials. Iron ore is rare, but in some countries there is a considerable amount of copper, zinc, [[tin]], [[chromite]], [[manganese]], [[magnesite]] and [[bauxite]]. Some metals are exported.

===Antiquity===
The Balkan region was the first area in Europe to experience the arrival of farming cultures in the [[Neolithic]] era. The Balkans have been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]] and are the route by which farming from the [[Middle East]] spread to [[Europe]] during the [[Neolithic]] (7th millennium BC).<ref name="Borza">{{Citation | last = Borza | first = EN | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&q=petralona+cave+oldest&pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Perlès | first = Catherine | title = The Early Neolithic in Greece: The First Farming Communities in Europe | page = 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LQQ3tx5_t7QC&q=sesklo | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2001| isbn = 9780521000277 }}</ref> The practices of growing grain and raising livestock arrived in the Balkans from the [[Fertile Crescent]] by way of [[Anatolia]] and spread west and north into Central Europe, particularly through [[Pannonia]]. Two early culture-complexes have developed in the region, [[Starčevo culture]] and [[Vinča culture]]. The Balkans are also the location of the first advanced civilizations. Vinča culture developed a form of [[proto-writing]] before the [[Sumer]]ians and [[Minoans]], known as the [[Old European script]], while the bulk of the symbols had been created in the period between 4500 and 4000 BC, with the ones on the Tărtăria clay tablets even dating back to around 5300 BC.<ref name="GdS">{{cite book |last=Haarmann |first=Harald |title=Geschichte der Schrift |publisher=C.H.

The identity of the Balkans is dominated by its geographical position; historically the area was known as a crossroads of cultures. It has been a juncture between the [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] bodies of the [[Roman Empire]], the destination of a massive influx of pagan [[Bulgars]] and [[Slavs]], an area where [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christianity met,<ref>{{cite book |author=Goldstein, I. |title=Croatia: A History |url=https://archive.org/details/croatia00ivog |url-access=registration |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1999}}</ref> as well as the meeting point between [[Islam]] and Christianity.

In pre-classical and [[classical antiquity]], this region was home to [[Greeks]], [[Illyrians]], [[Paeonians]], [[Thracians]], [[Dacians]], and other ancient groups. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] incorporated parts of the Balkans comprising [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], [[Bulgaria]], and the [[Black Sea]] coastal region of [[Romania]] between the late 6th and the first half of the 5th-century BC into its territories.<ref>Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington [https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&pg=PA345#v=onepage ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia''] pp. 135–138, 342–345 John Wiley & Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-4443-5163-7}}</ref> Later the [[Roman Empire]] conquered most of the region and spread Roman culture and the [[Latin]] language, but significant parts still remained under [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] influence.

In the past several centuries, because of the frequent [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] fought in and around the Balkans and the comparative Ottoman isolation from the mainstream of economic advance (reflecting the shift of Europe's commercial and political centre of gravity towards the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]), the Balkans have been the least developed part of Europe. According to [[Halil İnalcık]], "The population of the Balkans, according to one estimate, [[Population decline|fell from a high of 8 million]] in the late 16th-century to only 3 million by the mid-eighteenth. This estimate is based on Ottoman documentary evidence."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c00jmTrjzAoC&pg=PA652 An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire]''.

Most of the Balkan nation-states emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries as they gained independence from the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian empire: Greece in 1821, Serbia, and Montenegro in 1878, Romania in 1881, Bulgaria in 1908 and Albania in 1912.

====World Wars====
[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb |Austro-Hungarian troops executing Serbian civilians, 1914. [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] lost about 850,000 people during the war, a quarter of its pre-war population.<ref>"[https://archive.org/stream/PAM550-99/PAM550-99_djvu.txt The Balkan Wars and World War I]". p. 28. ''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.</ref>]]
In 1912–1913 the [[First Balkan War]] broke out when the nation-states of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] united in an [[Balkan League|alliance]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As a result of the war, almost all remaining European territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were captured and partitioned among the allies. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an independent [[Albania]]n state. Bulgaria insisted on its status quo territorial integrity, divided and shared by the Great Powers next to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] in other boundaries and on the pre-war Bulgarian-Serbian agreement. Bulgaria was provoked by the backstage deals between its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on the allocation of the spoils at the end of the First Balkan War. At the time, Bulgaria was fighting at the main Thracian Front. Bulgaria marks the beginning of [[Second Balkan War]] when it attacked them. The Serbs and the Greeks repulsed single attacks, but when the Greek army invaded Bulgaria together with an unprovoked Romanian intervention in the back, Bulgaria collapsed. The Ottoman Empire used the opportunity to recapture [[Eastern Thrace]], establishing its new western borders that still stand today as part of modern Turkey.

The [[First World War]] was sparked in the Balkans in 1914 when members of [[Young Bosnia]], a revolutionary organization with predominantly Serb and pro-Yugoslav members, [[assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital, [[Sarajevo]]. That caused a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, which—through the existing [[Allies of World War I|chains of alliances]]—led to the First World War. The Ottoman Empire soon joined the [[Central Powers]] becoming one of the three empires participating in that alliance. The next year Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] attacking Serbia, which was successfully fighting Austro-Hungary to the north for a year. That led to Serbia's defeat and the intervention of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in the Balkans which sent an expeditionary force to establish a new [[Macedonian front|front]], the third one of that war, which soon also became static. The participation of Greece in the war three years later, in 1918, on the part of the Entente finally altered the balance between the opponents leading to the collapse of the common German-Bulgarian front there, which caused the exit of Bulgaria from the war, and in turn, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ending the First World War.<ref>''Encyclopedia of World War I'', Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, p. 242</ref>

With the start of the [[Second World War]], all Balkan countries, with the exception of Greece, were allies of [[Nazi Germany]], having bilateral military agreements or being part of the [[Axis Pact]]. [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] expanded the war in the Balkans by using its protectorate Albania to [[Greco-Italian War|invade Greece]]. After repelling the attack, the Greeks counterattacked, invading Italy-held Albania and causing Nazi Germany's intervention in the Balkans to help its ally.<ref>''Europe in Flames'', J. Klam, 2002, p. 41</ref> Days before the German invasion, a successful [[coup d'état]] in Belgrade by neutral military personnel seized power.<ref>Russia's life-saver, Albert Loren Weeks, 2004, p. 98</ref>

Although the new government reaffirmed Serbia's intentions to fulfil its obligations as a member of the Axis,{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=484}} Germany, with Bulgaria, invaded both Greece and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia immediately disintegrated when those loyal to the Serbian King and the Croatian units mutinied.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=521}} Greece resisted, but, after two months of fighting, collapsed and was occupied. The two countries were partitioned between the three Axis allies, Bulgaria, Germany and Italy, and the [[Independent State of Croatia]], a puppet state of Italy and Germany.

During the occupation, the population suffered considerable hardship due to repression and starvation, to which the population reacted by creating a mass resistance movement.<ref>''Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation'', Mark Mazower, 1993</ref> Together with the early and extremely heavy winter of that year (which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths among the poorly fed population), the German invasion had disastrous effects in the timetable of the [[Operation Barbarossa|planned invasion in Russia]] causing a significant delay,<ref>''Hermann Goring: Hitler's Second-In-Command,'' Fred Ramen, 2002, p. 61</ref> which had major consequences during the course of the war.<ref>The encyclopedia of codenames of World War II#Marita, Christopher Chant, 1986, pp. 125–126</ref>

Finally, at the end of 1944, the Soviets entered Romania and Bulgaria forcing the Germans out of the Balkans. They left behind a region largely ruined as a result of wartime exploitation.

====Cold War====
During the [[Cold War]], most of the countries on the Balkans were governed by communist governments. Greece became the first battleground of the emerging Cold War. The [[Truman Doctrine]] was the US response to the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]], which raged from 1944 to 1949. This civil war, unleashed by the [[Communist Party of Greece]], backed by communist volunteers from neighboring countries (Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia), led to massive American assistance for the non-communist Greek government. With this backing, Greece managed to defeat the partisans and, ultimately, remained the only non-communist country in the region.

However, despite being under communist governments, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1948) and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] (1892–1980), first propped up then rejected the idea of merging with [[Bulgaria]] and instead sought closer relations with the West, later even spearheaded, together with India and Egypt the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], later adopting an [[isolationism|isolationist]] position.

As the only non-communist countries, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] were (and still are) part of [[NATO]] composing the southeastern wing of the alliance.

====Post–Cold War====
In the 1990s, the transition of the regions' ex-Eastern bloc countries towards democratic free-market societies went peacefully. While in the non-aligned [[Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav Wars|Wars between the former Yugoslav republics]] broke out after Slovenia and Croatia held free elections and their people voted for independence on their respective countries' referenda. Serbia, in turn, declared the dissolution of the union as unconstitutional and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavian army]] unsuccessfully tried to maintain the status quo. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991, followed by the [[Ten-Day War]] in Slovenia. Till October 1991, the Army withdrew from Slovenia, and in Croatia, the [[Croatian War of Independence]] would continue [[Operation Storm|until 1995]]. In the ensuing 10 years armed confrontation, gradually all the other Republics declared independence, with [[Bosnian War|Bosnia being the most affected]] by the fighting. The long-lasting wars resulted in a United Nations intervention and [[NATO intervention in Bosnia|NATO]] ground and air forces [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|took action against Serb forces]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]].

[[File:Former Yugoslavia 2008.PNG|upright=1.15|thumb|State entities on the former territory of [[Yugoslavia]], 2008]]
From the dissolution of Yugoslavia six republics achieved international recognition as sovereign republics, but these are traditionally included in Balkans: [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. In 2008, while under UN administration, Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] (according to the official Serbian policy, Kosovo is still an internal autonomous region). In July 2010, the [[International Court of Justice]], ruled that the declaration of independence was legal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kosovo independence declaration deemed legal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/22/us-serbia-kosovo-idUSTRE66L01720100722|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=22 July 2010}}</ref> Most UN member states recognise Kosovo. After the end of the wars a [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|revolution]] broke in Serbia and [[Slobodan Milošević]], the Serbian communist leader (elected president between 1989 and 2000), was overthrown and handed for a trial to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal]] for crimes against the [[International Humanitarian Law]] during the Yugoslav wars. Milošević died of a heart attack in 2006 before a verdict could have been released. Ιn 2001 an [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian uprising]] in [[North Macedonia]] forced the country to give local autonomy to the [[Albanians in Macedonia|ethnic Albanians]] in the areas where they predominate.

With the dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]], an issue emerged over the name under which the former (federated) republic of Macedonia would internationally be recognized, between the new country and Greece. Being the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian part of Yugoslavia]] (see [[Vardar Macedonia]]), the federated Republic under the Yugoslav identity had the name [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]] on which it declared its sovereignty in 1991. Greece, having a large region (see [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]) also under the same name opposed to the usage of this name as an indication of a nationality. The [[Macedonia naming dispute|issue]] was resolved under UN mediation and the [[Prespa agreement]] was reached, which saw the country's renaming into North Macedonia.

Balkan countries control the direct [[European route|land routes]] between Western Europe and South-West Asia ([[Asia Minor]] and the Middle East). Since 2000, all Balkan countries are friendly towards the EU and the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/southeasterneurope/|title=UNODC South Eastern Europe|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref>

The [[Jewish]] communities of the Balkans were some of the oldest in Europe and date back to ancient times. These communities were [[Sephardi Jews]], except in [[Transylvania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]], where the Jewish communities were mainly [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the small and close-knit Jewish community is 90% [[Sephardic]], and [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] is still spoken among the elderly. The Sephardi Jewish cemetery in [[Sarajevo]] has tombstones of a unique shape and inscribed in ancient Ladino.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090126185330/http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=59 European Jewish Congress – Bosnia-Herzegovina], Accessed 15 July 2008.</ref> Sephardi Jews used to have a large presence in the city of [[Thessaloniki]], and by 1900, some 80,000, or more than half of the population, were Jews.<ref>"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Greece.html Greece]". [[Jewish Virtual Library]].</ref> The Jewish communities in the Balkans suffered immensely during [[World War II]], and the vast majority were killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. An exception was the [[Bulgarian Jews]], most of whom were saved by [[Boris III of Bulgaria]], who resisted [[Adolf Hitler]], opposing their deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Almost all of the few survivors have emigrated to the (then) newly founded state of [[Israel]] and elsewhere. Almost no Balkan country today has a significant Jewish minority.

The Balkan region today is a very diverse ethnolinguistic region, being home to multiple [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Romance languages]], as well as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkic languages|Turkish]], and others. [[Romani language|Romani]] is spoken by a large portion of the [[Romani people|Romanis]] living throughout the Balkan countries. Throughout history, many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Celts]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. All of the aforementioned languages from the present and from the past belong to the wider [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, with the exception of the Turkic languages (e.g., [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]]).
