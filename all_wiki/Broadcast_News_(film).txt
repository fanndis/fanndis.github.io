'''''Broadcast News''''' is a 1987 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film written, produced and directed by [[James L. Brooks]]. The film concerns a virtuoso television news producer ([[Holly Hunter]]), who has daily emotional breakdowns, a brilliant yet prickly reporter ([[Albert Brooks]]), and the latter's charismatic but far less seasoned rival ([[William Hurt]]). It also stars [[Robert Prosky]], [[Lois Chiles]], [[Joan Cusack]], and [[Jack Nicholson]] (billed only in the end credits) as the evening news anchor.

In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the-shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry|title='Jurassic Park,' 'The Shining,' And 23 Other Movies Added To National Film Registry|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=National Film Registry Turns 30|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-144/library-of-congress-national-film-registry-turns-30/2018-12-12/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

==Plot==
The film revolves around three characters who work in television news. Jane Craig ([[Holly Hunter]]) is a diminutive, talented, uptight, controlling, aggressive, and intelligent producer whose life revolves around her work. Jane's best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman ([[Albert Brooks]]), is a gifted writer and reporter, ambitious for on-camera exposure and secretly in love with Jane. Tom Grunick ([[William Hurt]]), a local news anchorman who was promoted from sports anchorman, is tall, handsome, likeable and telegenic, but lacks news experience, general knowledge, intelligence and language skills. He knows that he was hired for his good looks and charm. He is attracted to Jane, although he is also intimidated by her skills and intensity.

All three of them work in the Washington, D.C., office of a national television network. Jane is drawn to Tom, but resents his lack of qualifications for his new position as news anchor. Aaron and Jane go to [[Nicaragua]] to report on the [[Sandinista]] rebels there and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the [[contras]] but remain unscathed and bring home footage that wins the approval of their national anchorman. 

At an office party, one of Jane’s female friends asks Jane if she would mind if she made a pass at Tom. Jane is ambivalent about Tom, saying no, then yes, then no again. News arrives of a Libyan plane having bombed a U.S. base in Italy. The network chief decides to put on a news show on the spot, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Jane tells the network chief that Tom is in no way qualified for this job. The network chief disagrees with her and tells her sarcastically that it must feel great to always be right and more intelligent than everybody else in the room. Jane replies that it feels awful. Aaron is devastated that he has no role in the report as he had previously spent time overseas and knew a great deal about the subject matter. Watching the report from his home and noticing missing facts, Aaron calls Jane with the pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. The special report is a huge success due to their teamwork.

Aaron also is appalled by Tom's lack of experience and knowledge, but accepts his advice when finally given an opportunity to anchor a newscast himself. Unfortunately, he lacks Tom's poise and composure in that seat. Tom coaches him but when Aaron becomes an anchorman for the first time in his life, he breaks out in what he calls a “flop sweat” and his debut as an anchorman is a disaster. Aaron acknowledges to Jane that he is in love with her, while trying to dissuade her from pursuing a love relationship with Tom. As a massive layoff hits the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs, Aaron tenders his resignation and tells Jane he plans to take a job at a local television station in Portland, Oregon. However, before he leaves town he tells Jane of an interview Tom had conducted with a date rape victim in which Tom appeared to be weeping out of sympathy to his interviewee. Aaron says that Tom’s tears were fake and then leaves. Jane views the footage herself and realizes that Tom had staged his tears.

Meeting Tom at the airport for a planned week-long getaway, Jane angrily confronts him, saying that his actions in the date-rape-victim interview were a breach of [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic ethics]] and that she cannot in good conscience become personally involved with him. They separate. Jane has lost both Aaron and Tom. 

The three meet again seven years later. Tom has become a national network anchorman, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend who works in the Surgeon General’s Office and loves water skiing. The film ends with Tom walking away and Aaron and Jane sitting on a bench, contemplating their lives.

==Production==
The score was by [[Bill Conti]]. [[Emmy Award]]-winning composers [[Glen Roven]] and [[Marc Shaiman]] make cameo appearances as a dorky musician team who have composed a theme for the news program in the film.

The female lead was originally written for [[Debra Winger]], who worked with [[James L. Brooks]] in ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''. However, Winger became pregnant and was replaced by [[Holly Hunter]].<ref name="worrell">{{cite news | last = Worrell | first = Denise | title = Holly Hunter Takes Hollywood | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = December 21, 1987 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966298,00.html | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref>

===Critical response===
Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] or the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four out of four stars and praised the film for being as "knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves".<ref name="ebert">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Ebert | title = ''Broadcast News'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = December 16, 1987 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19871216/REVIEWS/712160302/1023 | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] wrote, "As the fast-talking Aaron, Albert Brooks comes very close to stealing ''Broadcast News''. Mr. Brooks ... is more or less the conscience of ''Broadcast News''".<ref name="canby">{{cite news | last = Canby | first = Vincent | author-link = Vincent Canby | title = ''Broadcast News'' | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 16, 1987 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE5DD113CF935A25751C1A961948260 | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], in his review for the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', praised Holly Hunter's performance as "something of a revelation: her short, feisty, socially gauche, aggressive-compulsive character may be the most intricately layered portrait of a career woman that contemporary Hollywood has given us".<ref name="rosenbaum">{{cite news | last = Rosenbaum | first = Jonathan | author-link = Jonathan Rosenbaum | title = ''Broadcast News'' | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | year = 1987 | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/1427_BROADCAST_NEWS | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref>

Hal Hinson, in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "[James] Brooks is excellent at taking us inside the world of television, but not terribly good at analyzing it. He has a facile, too-pat approach to dealing with issues; there's still too much of the sitcom mentality at work".<ref name="hinson">{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | title = ''Broadcast News'' | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = December 25, 1987 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/broadcastnewsrhinson_a0c913.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref> In his review for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Richard Corliss]] praised William Hurt's performance: "Hurt is neat too, never standing safely outside his character, always allowing Tom to find the humor in his too-rapid success, locating a dimness behind his eyes when Tom is asked a tough question -- and for Tom, poor soulless sensation-to-be, all questions are tough ones".<ref name="corliss">{{cite news | last = Corliss | first = Richard | author-link = Richard Corliss | title = A Season Of Flash And Greed | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = December 14, 1987 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966222,00.html | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref> The magazine also ranked ''Broadcast News'' as one of the best films of the year.<ref name="timebest">{{cite news | title = Best of '87 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = January 4, 1988 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966369,00.html | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}</ref> The film garnered a 98% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The site's consensus states: "Blockbuster dramatist James L. Brooks delivers with ''Broadcast News'', fully entertaining with deft, deep characterization."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/broadcast_news/ |title=Broadcast News |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The film has an 84/100 [[average]] score at [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/broadcast-news |title=Broadcast News Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>
