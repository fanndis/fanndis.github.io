The '''Republic of China''' ('''ROC'''), commonly known as '''China''', was a [[sovereign state]] based in [[mainland China]] between 1912 and 1949, prior to the [[Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan|relocation of its government to the island of Taiwan]]. At a population of 541 million in 1949, it was the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|world's most populous country]]. Covering 11.4&nbsp;million square kilometers (4.4&nbsp;million mi<sup>2</sup>),<ref name="Area">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329140535/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/94roc/context/Ch01/010202.htm|title=中華民國九十四年年鑑：第一篇 總論 第二章 土地 第二節 大陸地區|website=Government Information Office, Executive Yuan, Republic of China|access-date=5 December 2020}}</ref> it consisted of 35 [[provinces of China|provinces]], 1 [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]], 2 regions, 12 [[special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipalities]], 14 leagues, and 4 special banners. This period is sometimes referred to as the '''Republican Era'''<ref> https://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/06dat/bio.3rep.html</ref> or the '''Mainland Period'''.<ref> https://books.google.ca/books?id=6u18PtO0BoQC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=%22mainland+period%22+china+1912&source=bl&ots=6FvjCKwjff&sig=ACfU3U0a3lJz1C9uRryJD7UqC1ZlTRjtRg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3zoyW_5ftAhV1GVkFHdAECBU4ChDoATAFegQICRAB</ref>  

The Republic was declared on 1 January 1912 after the [[1911 Revolution|Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]], the last [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]], ending 5,000 years of monarchy in China. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founder and its president served only briefly before handing over the position to [[Yuan Shikai]], the leader of the [[Beiyang Army]]. Sun's party, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), then led by [[Song Jiaoren]], won the [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|parliamentary election]] held in December 1912. However, Song was assassinated on Yuan's orders shortly after and the Beiyang Army, led by Yuan, maintained full control of the [[Beiyang government]], who then proclaimed himself [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Emperor of China]] from 1915 before abdicating not long after due to [[National Protection War|popular unrest]]. After Yuan's death in 1916, the authority of the Beiyang government was further weakened by a brief [[Manchu Restoration|restoration of the Qing dynasty]]. Cliques in the Beiyang Army claimed individual autonomy and clashed with each other during the ensuing [[Warlord Era]].

In 1921, the KMT established the [[government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|national government]] in [[Guangzhou]], supported by the fledgling [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). The economy of Northern China, overtaxed to support warlord adventurism, collapsed between 1927 and 1928. General [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who became the [[Chairman of the Kuomintang]] after Sun's death in 1925, started the [[Northern Expedition]] in 1926 to overthrow the Beiyang government, which was accomplished in 1928. In April 1927, Chiang established a [[nationalist government]] in [[Nanjing]] and [[Shanghai massacre|massacred Communists in Shanghai]]. The latter event forced the CCP into armed rebellion, marking the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]].

China experienced some [[Nanjing decade|industrialization]] during the 1930s but suffered setbacks from conflicts between the Nationalist government in Nanjing, the CCP, remaining warlords, and the [[Empire of Japan]]. Nation-building efforts yielded to fight the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] launched an offensive against China in 1937 which turned into a full-scale invasion that lasted until the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 and regained control of the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] and [[Penghu Islands|the Pescadores]].

Shortly after, the Chinese Civil War between the KMT and CCP resumed, leading to the 1946 [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] replacing the 1928 [[Organic Law]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Organic Law of the National Government of the Republic of China | publisher = China |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Organic-National-Government-Republic-Chinese/dp/B000WTLU12 |date = 1 Jan 1928 }}</ref> as the Republic's fundamental law. Three years later, in 1949, nearing the end of the civil war after, the CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, with the nationalists moving their capital several times from Nanjing to Guangzhou, followed by [[Chongqing]], then [[Chengdu]] and lastly, [[Taipei]] though the government controls [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and other smaller islands]] from 1949 onwards, [[Hainan]] until 1950 and [[Tibet]] until 1951.

The ROC was a founding member of the [[League of Nations]] and later the [[United Nations]] (including its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] seat) where it maintained until 1971. It was also a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]].

==Names==
{{see also|Names of China}}
The official name of the state on the mainland was the "Republic of China", but it has been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, the government used the short form "China" (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}'' ({{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|中國}}}}}})) to refer to itself, "China" being derived from ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|zhōng}}'' ("central" or "middle") and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guó}}'' ("state, nation-state"),{{efn|Although this is the present meaning of ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|guó}}'', in [[Old Chinese]] (when its pronunciation was something like {{nowrap|/*qʷˤək/}})<ref name=bs>[[Reconstructions of Old Chinese|Baxter-Sagart]].</ref> it meant the walled city of the Chinese and the areas they could control from them.<ref name=wilx/>}} a term that developed under the [[Zhou dynasty]] in reference to its [[demesne|royal demesne]],{{efn|Its use is attested from the 6th-century [[Classic of History]], which states "[[Tian (god)|Huangtian]] bestowed the lands and the peoples of the central state to the ancestors" ({{lang|zh|皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王}}).<ref>{{lang|zh|[[:s:zh:尚書|《尚書》]], [[:s:zh:尚書/梓材|梓材]].}} {{in lang|zh}}</ref>}} and the name was then applied to the area around [[Luoyi]] (present-day Luoyang) during the [[Eastern Zhou]] and then to China's [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].<ref name=wilx>{{citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion |title=Chinese History: A Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC |date=2000 |location=[[Cambridge, Mass.|Cambridge]] |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |series=Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph No. 52 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&pg=PA132 132] |isbn=978-0-674-00249-4}}</ref>

===Overview===
[[File:Republic of China proclaimtion.png|thumb|left|Sun Yat-sen proclaiming the establishment of the ROC in 1912]]
A republic was formally established on 1 January 1912 following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which itself began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on 10 October 1911, successfully overthrowing the [[Qing dynasty]] and ending over two thousand years of [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial rule]] in China.<ref name=cuhk /> From its founding until 1949, the republic was based on mainland China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to [[warlord era|warlordism]] (1915–28), a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] (1937–45), and a [[Chinese Civil War|full-scale civil war]] (1927–49), with central authority strongest during the [[Nanjing Decade]] (1927–37), when most of China came under the control of the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[one-party state|one-party]] [[military dictatorship]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT).<ref>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Denny |title=Taiwan: A Political History |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2004 |location=Ithaca, New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/55 55], 56 |url=https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn|url-access=registration |isbn=0-8014-8805-2}}</ref>

In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan]] surrendered control of Taiwan and its [[List of islands of the Republic of China|island groups]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; and Taiwan was placed under the Republic of China's administrative control. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist takeover]] of [[mainland China]] in 1949, after the [[Chinese Civil War]], left the ruling Kuomintang with control over only [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other minor islands]]. With the loss of the mainland, the ROC government retreated to [[Taiwan]] and the KMT declared [[Taipei]] the [[provisional capital]].<ref name="bbctimeline-retreat">{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1949_1955.stm |title = Taiwan Timeline&nbsp;– Retreat to Taiwan |year=2000 |work=BBC News |access-date=2009-06-21}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Communist Party of China]] took over all of mainland China<ref name="temporary-capital">{{Cite book|title = China: U.S. policy since 1945|publisher = [[Congressional Quarterly]]|year = 1980|quote = the city of Taipei became the temporary capital of the Republic of China|isbn = 0-87187-188-2|url = https://archive.org/details/chinauspolicysin00cong}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url = http://www.taiwanbasic.com/edu/stanford-intro.htm|title=Introduction to Sovereignty: A Case Study of Taiwan |publisher=Stanford Program on International and Cross-Cultural Education |year=2004 |access-date=2010-02-25 }}</ref> and founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in [[Beijing]].

In 1912, after over two thousand years of [[Imperial China|imperial rule]], a republic was established to replace the [[Emperor of China|monarchy]].<ref name="cuhk">{{cite book |title=China, Fiver thousand years of History and Civilization|date=2007|publisher=City University Of Hong Kong Press|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&pg=PA116|access-date=9 September 2014|isbn=9789629371401}}</ref> The [[Qing dynasty]] that preceded the republic had experienced instability throughout the 19th century and suffered from both internal rebellion and foreign imperialism.<ref name="depstate-chineserev">{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/chinese-rev |title=The Chinese Revolution of 1911 |publisher=US Department of State |access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> The ongoing instability eventually led to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, whose attacks on foreigners resulted in the invasion by the [[Eight Nation Alliance]].

The Chinese Republic grew out of the [[Wuchang Uprising]] against the Qing government, on 10 October 1911, which is now celebrated annually as the ROC's [[national day]], also known as "[[Double Ten Day]]". On 29 December 1911, [[Sun Yat-sen]] was elected president by the Nanjing assembly, which consisted of representatives from seventeen provinces. On 1 January 1912, he was officially inaugurated and pledged "to overthrow the despotic government led by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]], consolidate the Republic of China and plan for the welfare of the people".<ref>{{cite web|title=孙中山任临时大总统誓词手迹|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shizheng/252/6534/6564/20010928/572420.html|website=people.com|language=zh}}</ref> Sun lacked the necessary military strength to defeat the Qing government by force. As a compromise, the new republic negotiated with [[Yuan Shikai]] the commander of the [[Beiyang Army]] , promising Yuan the presidency of the republic if he were to remove the Qing emperor by force. Yuan agreed to the deal, and the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, [[Puyi]], was forced to abdicate in 1912. [[Song Jiaoren]] led the Kuomintang Party to electoral victories by fashioning his party's program to appeal to the gentry, landowners, and merchants. Song was assassinated on March 20, 1913 at the behest of Yuan Shikai.<ref>Jonathan Fenby, "The silencing of Song." ''History Today'' (March 2013 (63#3 pp 5-7.</ref> 

Yuan was elected president of the ROC in 1913.<ref name="depstate-chineserev"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Fenby|2009|pp=123–125}}</ref> He ruled by military power and ignored the republican institutions established by his predecessor, threatening to execute Senate members who disagreed with his decisions. He soon dissolved the ruling [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party, banned "secret organizations" (which implicitly included the KMT), and ignored the provisional constitution. An attempt at a [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|democratic election]] in 1912 ended with the assassination of the elected candidate by a man recruited by Yuan. Ultimately, Yuan declared himself [[Empire of China (1915–16)|Emperor of China]] in 1915.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fenby|2009|p=131}}</ref> The new ruler of China tried to increase centralization by abolishing the provincial system; however, this move angered the gentry along with the provincial governors, who were usually military men. Many provinces [[National Protection War|declared independence]] and became [[Warlord Era|warlord]] states. Increasingly unpopular and deserted by his supporters, Yuan abdicated in 1916 and died of natural causes shortly thereafter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fenby|2009|pp=136–138}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Meyer|first=Kathryn|author2=James H Wittebols |author3=Terry Parssinen |title = Webs of Smoke |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2002|pages=54–56 |isbn = 0-7425-2003-X |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RNknjDjfH6AC&pg=PA54}}</ref> China then declined into a period of warlordism. Sun, having been forced into exile, returned to [[Guangdong]] province in the south with the help of warlords in 1917 and 1922, and set up successive rival governments to the [[Beiyang government]] in Beijing, re-establishing the KMT in October 1919. Sun's dream was to unify China by launching an expedition against the north. However, he lacked the military support and funding to turn it into a reality.<ref name="pak-chinesehist">{{Cite book |last=Pak |first=Edwin |author2=Wah Leung |title = Essentials of Modern Chinese History|publisher=Research & Education Assoc.|year=2005|pages=59–61 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BX04ZA8R9ugC&pg=PA59|isbn=978-0-87891-458-6}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Beiyang government struggled to hold onto power, and an open and wide-ranging debate evolved regarding how China should confront the West. In 1919, a student protest against the government's weak response to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], considered unfair by Chinese intellectuals, led to the [[May Fourth movement]], whose demonstrations were against the danger of spreading Western influence replacing Chinese culture. It was in this intellectual climate that the influence of [[Marxism]] spread and became popular, leading to the founding of the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1921.<ref>{{Cite book |title = A History of the Chinese Communist Party 1921–1949|publisher=Taylor & Francis |pages=22–23 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WVEOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA22 |author1=Guillermaz, Jacques |year=1972}}</ref>

After Sun's death in March 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] became the leader of the [[Kuomintang]]. In 1926, Chiang led the [[Northern Expedition]] with the intention of defeating the [[Beiyang Army|Beiyang]] warlords and unifying the country. Chiang received the help of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]]. However, he soon dismissed his Soviet advisers, being convinced that they wanted to get rid of the KMT and take control.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fenby|2009}}</ref> Chiang decided to [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|purge the Communists]], killing thousands of them. At the same time, other violent conflicts were taking place in China: in the South, where the Communists had superior numbers, Nationalist supporters were being massacred. Such events eventually led to the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the Nationalists and Communists. Chiang Kai-shek pushed the Communists into the interior and established a government, with [[Nanjing|Nanking]] as its capital, in 1927.<ref name="Nanking zh:南京市">{{cite web|title=民國十六年，國民政府宣言定為首都，今以臺北市為我國中央政府所在地。|url=http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/cbdic/gsweb.cgi?o=dcbdic&searchid=Z00000056983|access-date=2012-12-22|publisher=Ministry of Education, ROC|language=zh|ref=《重編國語辭典修訂本》}}</ref> By 1928, Chiang's army overthrew the [[Beiyang government]] and unified the entire nation, at least nominally, beginning the so-called [[Nanjing Decade]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

According to Sun Yat-sen's theory, the KMT was to rebuild China in three phases: a phase of military rule during which the KMT would take over power and reunite China by force; a phase of political tutelage; and finally a constitutional, democratic phase.<ref>Edmund S.

Among other things, it created the [[Academia Sinica]], the [[Central Bank of the Republic of China|Central Bank of China]], and other agencies. In 1932, China for the first time sent a team to the [[Republic of China at the 1932 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]. Campaigns were mounted and laws passed to promote the rights of women. The ease and speed of communication facilitated focusing on social problems, especially those of remote villages. The [[Rural Reconstruction Movement]] was one of many that took advantage of the new freedom to raise social consciousness.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The Nationalist government published a draft constitution on 5 May 1936.<ref>{{Cite book |author = Jing Zhiren (荆知仁) |script-title = zh:中华民国立宪史 |publisher = 联经出版公司 |language = zh}}</ref>

During this time a series of wars took place in western China, including the [[Kumul Rebellion]], the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], and the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Although the central government was nominally in control of the entire country during this period, large areas of China remained under the semi-autonomous rule of local warlords such as [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]], provincial military leaders, or warlord coalitions. Nationalist rule was strongest in the eastern regions around the capital Nanjing. The [[Central Plains War]] in 1930, the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese aggression]] in 1931, and the Red Army's [[Long March]] in 1934 led to more power for the central government, but there continued to be foot-dragging and even outright defiance, as in the [[Fujian People's Government|Fujian Rebellion]] of 1933–34.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Historians such as Edmund Fung argue that establishing a democracy in China at that time was not possible. The nation was at war and divided between Communists and Nationalists. Corruption and lack of direction within the government prevented any significant reforms from taking place. Chiang realized the lack of real work being done within his administration and told the State Council: "Our organization becomes worse and worse... many staff members just sit at their desks and gaze into space, others read newspapers and still others sleep."<ref>{{Harv|Fung|2000|p=5}} "Nationalist disunity, political instability, civil strife, the communist challenge, the autocracy of Chiang Kai-shek, the ascendancy of the military, the escalating Japanese threat, and the "crisis of democracy" in Italy, Germany, Poland, and Spain, all contributed to a freezing of democracy by the Nationalist leadership."</ref>

===Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
{{See also|Marco Polo Bridge Incident|Second United Front|New Fourth Army incident|Burma Campaign}}
[[File:"China-First to Fight - NARA - 513567.tif|thumb|left|China had been resisting the Japanese aggression since 1931.]]

Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese desires on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established the ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. The loss of Manchuria, and its potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of Japanese defiance.

The Japanese began to push south of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] into northern China and the coastal provinces. Chinese fury against Japan was predictable, but anger was also directed against Chiang and the Nanking government, which at the time was more preoccupied with anti-Communist extermination campaigns than with resisting the Japanese invaders. The importance of "internal unity before external danger" was forcefully brought home in December 1936, when [[Chiang Kai-shek]], in an event now known as the [[Xi'an Incident]], was kidnapped by [[Zhang Xueliang]] and forced to ally with the Communists against the Japanese in the [[Second United Front (China)|Second Kuomintang-CCP United Front]].

Chinese resistance stiffened after 7 July 1937, when a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops outside [[Beiping]] (Later [[Beijing]]) near the [[Marco Polo Bridge]]. This skirmish led to open, although undeclared, warfare between China and Japan. [[Shanghai]] fell after a [[Battle of Shanghai|three-month battle]] during which Japan suffered extensive casualties in both its army and navy. The capital, [[Nanjing|Nanking]], fell in December 1937, which was followed by mass murders and rapes known as the [[Nanjing Massacre|Nanking Massacre]]. The national capital was briefly at [[Wuhan]], then removed in an epic retreat to [[Chongqing]], the seat of government until 1945. In 1940, the Japanese set up the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] [[Wang Jingwei regime]], with its capital in Nanking, which proclaimed itself the legitimate "Republic of China" in opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's government, although its claims were significantly hampered due to its being a [[puppet state]] controlling limited amounts of territory.

The United Front between the Kuomintang and the CCP had salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP, despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions and the rich [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] Valley in central China. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants and, the spread of their organizational network, while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence. Meanwhile, northern China was infiltrated politically by Japanese [[Politics of Manchukuo|politicians in Manchukuo]] using facilities such as the [[Wei Huang Gong]].

After its entry into the [[Pacific War]] during World War II, the United States became increasingly involved in Chinese affairs. As an ally, it embarked in late 1941 on a program of massive military and financial aid to the hard-pressed [[Nationalist Government]]. In January 1943, both the United States and the United Kingdom led the way in revising their [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] with China from the past.<ref>Sino-U.S. [[Sino-American New Equal Treaty|Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China]]</ref><ref>[[Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China]]</ref> Within a few months a new agreement was signed between the United States and the Republic of China for the stationing of American troops in China as part of the common war effort against Japan. The United States sought unsuccessfully to reconcile the rival Kuomintang and Communists, to make for a more effective anti-Japanese war effort. In December 1943, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]s of the 1880s, and subsequent laws, enacted by the United States Congress to restrict Chinese immigration into the United States were repealed. The wartime policy of the United States was meant to help China become a strong ally and a stabilizing force in postwar East Asia. During the war, China was one of the Big Four [[Allies of World War II]] and later one of the [[Four Policemen]], which was a precursor to China having a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Urquhart|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Urquhart|title=Looking for the Sheriff|publisher=New York Review of Books, 16 July 1998}}</ref>

In August 1945, with American help, Nationalist troops moved to take the Japanese surrender in North China. The Soviet Union—encouraged to [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invade Manchuria]] to hasten the end of the war and allowed a Soviet sphere of influence there as agreed to at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945—dismantled and removed more than half the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese. Although the Chinese had not been present at Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to have the Soviets enter the war, in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Kuomintang government. However, the Soviet presence in northeast China enabled the Communists to arm themselves with equipment surrendered by the withdrawing Japanese army.

In 1945, after the end of the war, the [[Nationalist Government]] moved back to Nanjing. The Republic of China emerged from the war nominally a great military power but actually a nation economically prostrate and on the verge of all-out civil war. The problems of rehabilitating the formerly Japanese-occupied areas and of reconstructing the nation from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering. The economy deteriorated, sapped by the military demands of foreign war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by Nationalist profiteering, speculation, and hoarding. Starvation came in the wake of the war, and millions were rendered homeless by floods and unsettled conditions in many parts of the country.

On 25 October 1945, following the [[Surrender of Japan]], the administration of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu Islands]] were handed over from Japan to China.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brendan M. Howe|title=Post-Conflict Development in East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PA_tCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT71|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=71|isbn=9781317077404}}</ref> After the end of the war, [[United States Marines]] were used to hold [[Beiping]] (Beijing) and [[Tianjin]] against a possible Soviet incursion, and logistic support was given to Kuomintang forces in north and northeast China.

In January 1946, through the mediation of the United States, a military truce between the Kuomintang and the Communists was arranged, but battles soon resumed. Public opinion of the administrative incompetence of the Nationalist government was incited by the Communists during the nationwide student protest against the mishandling of the [[Shen Chong case|Shen Chong rape case]] in early 1947 and during another national protest against monetary reforms later that year. Realizing that no American efforts short of large-scale armed intervention could stop the coming war, in early 1947 the United States withdrew the [[Marshall Mission|American mission]], headed by Gen. [[George Marshall]]. The [[Chinese Civil War]] became more widespread; battles raged not only for territories but also for the allegiance of sections of the population. The United States aided the Nationalists with massive economic loans and weapons but no combat support.

[[File:Movement KMTretreat.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Nationalists' retreat to Taipei: after the Nationalists lost [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) they next moved to [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), then to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), [[Chengdu]] (Chengtu) and [[Xichang]] (Sichang) before arriving in [[Taipei]].]]

Belatedly, the Republic of China government sought to enlist popular support through internal reforms. However, the effort was in vain, because of rampant government corruption and the accompanying political and economic chaos. By late 1948 the Kuomintang position was bleak. The demoralized and undisciplined [[National Revolutionary Army]] proved to be no match for the Communists' motivated and disciplined [[People's Liberation Army]]. The Communists were well established in the north and northeast. Although the Kuomintang had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the long war with Japan and in-fighting among various generals. They were also losing the propaganda war to the Communists, with a population weary of Kuomintang corruption and yearning for peace.

In January 1949, Beiping was taken by the Communists without a fight, and its name changed back to Beijing. Following the capture of Nanjing on 23 April, major cities passed from Kuomintang to Communist control with minimal resistance, through November. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. Finally, on 1 October 1949, Communists led by [[Mao Zedong]] founded the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Chiang Kai-shek declared [[martial law]] in May 1949, whilst a few hundred thousand Nationalist troops and two million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from mainland China to [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]]. There remained in China itself only isolated pockets of resistance. On 7 December 1949, Chiang proclaimed [[Taipei]], Taiwan, the temporary capital of the [[Republic of China]].

During the Chinese Civil War both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides.<ref>Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government.</ref> Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the civil war resulted in the death of between 1.8&nbsp;million and 3.5&nbsp;million people between 1927 and 1949, including deaths from forced conscription and massacres.<ref>Valentino, Benjamin A.

==Government==
{{Main|Government of the Republic of China}}
{{See also|Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Beiyang government|Warlord era|Nationalist government|Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China}}

The first Republic of China national government was established on 1 January 1912, in [[Nanjing]], and was founded on the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution of the ROC]] and its [[Three Principles of the People]], which state that "[the ROC] shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people."<ref name="yb-2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ch4.html |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2008 / CHAPTER 4 Government |publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan)|year=2008 |access-date=2009-05-28}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

Sun Yat-sen was the provisional president. Delegates from the provinces sent to confirm the government's authority formed the first parliament in 1913. The power of this government was limited, with generals controlling both the central and northern [[Provinces of the Republic of China|provinces of China]], and short-lived. The number of acts passed by the government was few and included the formal abdication of the Qing dynasty and some economic initiatives. The parliament's authority soon became nominal: violations of the Constitution by Yuan were met with half-hearted motions of censure. Kuomintang members of parliament who gave up their membership in the KMT were offered 1,000 [[British pound|pounds]]. Yuan maintained power locally by sending generals to be provincial governors or by obtaining the allegiance of those already in power.

When Yuan died, the parliament of 1913 was reconvened to give legitimacy to a new government. However, the real power passed to military leaders, leading to the warlord period. The impotent government still had its use; when [[World War I]] began, several Western powers and Japan wanted China to declare war on Germany, in order to liquidate German holdings in China.

In February 1928, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 2nd Kuomintang National Congress, held in Nanjing, passed the Reorganization of the Nationalist Government Act. This act stipulated that the Nationalist Government was to be directed and regulated under the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, with the Committee of the Nationalist Government being elected by the KMT Central Committee. Under the Nationalist Government were seven ministries – Interior, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Transport, Justice, Agriculture and Mines, and Commerce, in addition to institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|
Supreme Court]], [[Control Yuan]], and the General Academy.

With the promulgation of the Organic Law of the Nationalist Government in October 1928, the government was reorganized into five different branches, or ''yuan'', namely the [[Executive Yuan]], [[Legislative Yuan]], [[Judicial Yuan]], [[Examination Yuan]] as well as the Control Yuan. The Chairman of the National Government was to be the head-of-state and commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army. Chiang Kai-shek was appointed as the first Chairman, a position he would retain until 1931. The Organic Law also stipulated that the Kuomintang, through its National Congress and Central Executive Committee, would exercise sovereign power during the period of "political tutelage", that the KMT's Political Council would guide and superintend the Nationalist Government in the execution of important national affairs, and that the Political Council has the power to interpret or amend the Organic Law.<ref>Wilbur, Clarence Martin. [https://archive.org/details/nationalistrevol00wilb_0/page/190 ''The Nationalist Revolution in China, 1923–1928'']. Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 190.</ref>

Shortly after the Second Sino-Japanese War, a long-delayed constitutional convention was summoned to meet in Nanking in May 1946. Amidst heated debate, this convention adopted many constitutional amendments demanded by several parties, including the KMT and the Communist Party, into the Constitution. This Constitution was promulgated on 25 December 1946 and came into effect on 25 December 1947. Under it, the Central Government was divided into the presidency and the five yuans, each responsible for a part of the government. None was responsible to the other except for certain obligations such as the president appointing the head of the Executive Yuan. Ultimately, the president and the yuans reported to the National Assembly, which represented the will of the citizens.

Under the new constitution the first elections for the National Assembly occurred in January 1948, and the Assembly was summoned to meet in March 1948. It elected the President of the Republic on 21 March 1948, formally bringing an end to the KMT party rule started in 1928, although the President was a member of the KMT. These elections, though praised by at least one US observer, were poorly received by the Communist Party, which would soon start an open, armed insurrection.

===Foreign relations===
{{see also|Foreign relations of China|Foreign relations of Taiwan}}

Before the Nationalist government was ousted from the mainland, the Republic of China had diplomatic relations with 59 countries, such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|Cuba]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Thailand|Siam]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Vatican City]].  Most of these relations continued at least until the 1970s, and the Republic of China remained a member of the United Nations until 1971.

===Nobility===
{{main|Chinese nobility}}

The Republic of China retained hereditary nobility like the Han Chinese nobles [[Duke Yansheng]] and [[List of Celestial Masters|Celestial Masters]] and [[Tusi]] chiefdoms like the [[Chiefdom of Mangshi]], [[Chiefdom of Yongning]], who continued possessing their titles in the Republic of China since the previous dynasties.

The military power of the Republic of China was inherited from the [[New Army]], mainly the [[Beiyang Army]], which later split into many [[List of warlords and military cliques in the Warlord Era|factions]] and [[Warlord Era|attacked each other]].<ref name="Schillinger2016">{{cite book |last1=Schillinger |first1=Nicolas |title=The Body and Military Masculinity in Late Qing and Early Republican China: The Art of Governing Soldiers |date=2016 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-1498531689 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moZwDQAAQBAJ&q=beiyang+army&pg=PA30}}</ref> The National Revolutionary Army was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with the goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. Originally organized with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid as a means for the KMT to unify China against warlordism, the National Revolutionary Army fought many major engagements: in the [[Northern Expedition]] against Beiyang Army [[Warlord era|warlords]], in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and in the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the [[People's Liberation Army]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the armed forces of the [[Communist Party of China]] were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army, while remaining under separate command, but broke away to form the People's Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war. With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947 and the formal end of the KMT party-state, the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]], with the bulk of its forces forming the [[Republic of China Army]], which retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.<ref>{{cite book | last = Westad | first = Odd | title = Decisive Encounters: The Chinese Civil War, 1946–1950 | year = 2003 | publisher = Stanford University Press | isbn = 978-0-8047-4484-3 | page = [https://archive.org/details/decisiveencounte00west/page/305 305] | url = https://archive.org/details/decisiveencounte00west | url-access = registration | quote = last major GMD stronghold. }}</ref>

==Economy==

In the early years of the Republic of China, the economy remained unstable as the country was marked by constant warfare between different regional warlord factions. The [[Beiyang government]] in Beijing experienced constant changes in leadership, and this political instability led to stagnation in economic development until Chinese reunification in 1928 under the Kuomintang.<ref>Sun Jian, pages 613–614 {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> After this reunification, China entered a period of relative stability—despite ongoing isolated military conflicts and in the face of Japanese aggression in [[Shandong]] and [[Manchuria]], in 1931—a period known as the "Nanjing Decade".

Chinese industries grew considerably from 1928 to 1931. While the economy was hit by the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and the Great Depression from 1931 to 1935, industrial output recovered to their earlier peak by 1936. This is reflected by the trends in Chinese GDP. In 1932, China's GDP peaked at 28.8&nbsp;billion, before falling to 21.3&nbsp;billion by 1934 and recovering to 23.7&nbsp;billion by 1935.<ref>Sun Jian, pg 1059–1071</ref> By 1930, foreign investment in China totaled 3.5&nbsp;billion, with Japan leading (1.4&nbsp;billion) followed by the United Kingdom (1&nbsp;billion). By 1948, however, the capital investment had halted and dropped to only 3&nbsp;billion, with the US and Britain being the leading investors.<ref>Sun Jian, pg 1353</ref>

However, the rural economy was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s, in which an overproduction of agricultural goods lead to falling prices for China as well as an increase in foreign imports (as agricultural goods produced in western countries were "dumped" in China). In 1931, Chinese imports of rice amounted to 21&nbsp;million [[bushel]]s compared with 12&nbsp;million in 1928. Other imports saw even more increases. In 1932, 15&nbsp;million bushels of grain were imported compared with 900,000 in 1928. This increased competition lead to a massive decline in Chinese agricultural prices and thus the income of rural farmers. In 1932, agricultural prices were at 41 percent of 1921 levels.<ref name="Sun Jian, page 1089">Sun Jian, page 1089</ref> By 1934, rural incomes had fallen to 57 percent of 1931 levels in some areas.<ref name="Sun Jian, page 1089"/>

In 1937, Japan invaded China and the resulting warfare laid waste to China. Most of the prosperous east coast was occupied by the Japanese, who committed atrocities such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. In one anti-guerilla sweep in 1942, the Japanese killed up to 200,000 civilians in a month. The war was estimated to have killed between 20 and 25&nbsp;million Chinese, and destroyed all that Chiang had built up in the preceding decade.<ref>Sun Jian, page 615-616</ref> Development of industries was severely hampered after the war by devastating civil conflict as well as the inflow of cheap American goods. By 1946, Chinese industries operated at 20% capacity and had 25% of the output of pre-war China.<ref>Sun Jian, page 1319</ref>

One effect of the war with Japan was a massive increase in government control of industries. In 1936, government-owned industries were only 15% of GDP. However, the ROC government took control of many industries in order to fight the war. In 1938, the ROC established a commission for industries and mines to supervise and control firms, as well as instilling price controls. By 1942, 70% of Chinese industry was owned by the government.<ref>Sun Jian, pg 1237–1240</ref>

Following the war with Japan, Chiang acquired Taiwan from Japan and renewed his struggle with the communists. However, the corruption of the KMT, as well as hyperinflation as a result of trying to fight the civil war, resulted in mass unrest throughout the Republic<ref>Sun Jian, page 617-618</ref> and sympathy for the communists. In addition, the communists' promise to redistribute land gained them support among the large rural population. In 1949, the communists captured Beijing and later Nanjing. The People's Republic of China was proclaimed on 1 October 1949. The Republic of China relocated to Taiwan where Japan had laid an educational groundwork.<ref>{{cite book
