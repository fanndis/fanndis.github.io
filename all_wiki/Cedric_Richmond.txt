==Early life and education==
Richmond was born in New Orleans in 1973 and raised in [[New Orleans East]], where he attended public schools. His father died when he was seven years old. His mother was a public school teacher and small business owner. Richmond graduated from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Benjamin Franklin High School]].  He received a B.A. from [[Morehouse College]], and a J.D. from [[Tulane School of Law]].  He also completed an executive program at the [[Harvard University]] [[John F.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2010, Richmond was elected to the US House of Representatives from [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] for the first time. He took office in 2011. He was reelected in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.

On June 9, 2014, Richmond introduced the [[Honor Flight Act (H.R. 4812; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) to establish a process for providing expedited and dignified [[Transportation Security Administration#Screening processes and regulations|passenger screening services]] for [[veterans]] traveling on an [[Honor Flight]] to visit [[war memorials]] that had been built to honor their service.<ref name=4812sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4812 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4812|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 9, 2014|archive-date=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714215601/https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4812|url-status=live}}</ref>

That year Richmond defended his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] colleague [[Vance McAllister]], who had become embroiled in an alleged adultery scandal. It was a rare across-the-aisle gesture. Richmond said that he associated the controversy around McAllister with "gotcha moments" in which the "two parties in this country have gone overboard...and taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/post_557.html|title=Richmond reaches out to McAllister: He admonishes both parties|date=April 11, 2014|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=Times-Picayune|page=A3|location=New Orleans|first=Bruce|last=Alpert|archive-date=April 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130025/http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/post_557.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 30, 2016, he was elected chair of the caucus for the [[115th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rainey|first=Richard|title=Cedric Richmond elected chair of Congressional Black Caucus|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=November 30, 2016|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/cedric_richmond_elected_chair.html|accessdate=November 30, 2016|archive-date=September 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902234146/http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/cedric_richmond_elected_chair.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2008

Richmond came in third place in the seven-candidate primary election for the Democratic nomination for [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]], behind U.S. Representative [[William J. Jefferson]] and television newscaster [[Helena Moreno]]. During a primary debate, Richmond accused Moreno of drug use, and she attacked him based on his disqualification from the 2005 New Orleans City Council "D" district election.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=Moreno, Richmond trade barbs at 2nd District talk|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=September 26, 2008|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/moreno_richmond_trade_barbs_at.html|accessdate=October 12, 2010|archive-date=June 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605105951/http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/moreno_richmond_trade_barbs_at.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later in 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court suspended Richmond's law license for six months in a 5–2 decision. It found that he had falsified a sworn statement claiming more than two years of residency in New Orleans's "D" district in order to be eligible for the district's city council seat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=State Rep.

Richmond challenged Republican incumbent [[Joseph Cao|Anh “Joseph” Cao]] for {{ushr|LA|2}}.

Most analysts considered Richmond a strong favorite to retake this seat for the Democrats, even in what was forecast to be a Republican year nationally. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+25, the 2nd was the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. In 2008 Obama had carried it with 74% of the vote, his fifth-best performance in a Southern district and his 35th best nationally.

Richmond won the November 2 election with 65% of the vote.<ref name="Krupa">{{cite news|last1=Krupa|first1=Michelle|last2=Donze|first2=Frank|title=Cedric Richmond wins 2nd District House race; Joseph Cao concedes|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=November 2, 2010|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/cedric_richmond_wins_anh_josep.html|accessdate=November 3, 2010|archive-date=November 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105022739/http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/cedric_richmond_wins_anh_josep.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Controversies===
In January 2017 Richmond became involved in an argument with Republican lawmakers over whether a particular painting should continue to hang in the Capitol. The painting in question shows police officers apprehending suspects, and the police are depicted as pigs. It was painted by someone from Richmond's district who had won a local award, and Republicans objected to it.<ref name="painting1">{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/313506-dem-lawmaker-re-hangs-painting-depicting-cops-as-pigs-in-capitol |title=Democrat re-hangs painting depicting cops as pigs |last=Marcos |first=Cristina |date=January 13, 2017 |newspaper=The Hill |access-date=January 13, 2017 |quote=The painting has inflamed tensions on Capitol Hill between the two parties.

In March 2017 Richmond was criticized for making a crude joke about a controversial photograph of [[Kellyanne Conway]] kneeling on the Oval Office couch. Richmond appeared to compare Conway to [[Monica Lewinsky]], saying, "I really just want to know what was going on there, because she really looked kind of familiar there in that position there. But don't answer. And I don't want you to refer back to the ’90s.” Richmond later said the joke was not meant to be sexual.<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news |last=Heil |first=Emily |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/03/02/rep-cedric-richmond-made-an-awkward-joke-about-kellyanne-conway-but-he-says-it-wasnt-meant-to-be-sexual/ |title=Rep.

Richmond plays in the annual [[Congressional Baseball Game]]. He was the starting Democratic pitcher for each of the five years since his election and the Democrats won each game. He had a 2.85 [[earned run average]], 1.67 [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] and 45 [[strikeouts]] in his 27 innings pitched in that span.
