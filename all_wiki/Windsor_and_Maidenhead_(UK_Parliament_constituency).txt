'''Windsor and Maidenhead''' was a [[county constituency]] in the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]] in Berkshire. It returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

The constituency was created at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] and abolished at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], when it was replaced by the new separate constituencies of [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]] and [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]].

==History==
The constituency was formed to replace the existing County Constituency of [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]], with no changes to its composition.

For the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], the boundaries were adjusted to reflect the changes to local authorities under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The constituency gained the small town comprising the former Urban District of [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] which had been transferred from Buckinghamshire to the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire by the Local Government Act and was previously part of the abolished Borough Constituency of [[Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Eton and Slough]].  The area comprising the former Rural District of Windsor, including [[Old Windsor]] and [[Sunninghill, Berkshire|Sunninghill]], was transferred to the new County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire.]]

In order to effect an increase in Berkshire's representation from 7 to 8 MPs in accordance with the Fourth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies, the Windsor and Maidenhead constituency was abolished in 1997 and two separate constituencies of Maidenhead and Windsor were created. The majority of the electorate in the abolished constituency, including Maidenhead, Bisham and Cookham was transferred to the Maidenhead constituency, with Windsor, Eton and [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]] added to the recreated Windsor constituency.
