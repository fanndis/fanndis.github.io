Hacı Ömer Sabancı, the progenitor of the Sabancı family, moved from his native Kayseri to Adana in the early 1920s. His business grew, in part, due to reduced business competition as a result of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ungor|first1=Ugur|last2=Polatel|first2=Mehmet|title=Confiscation and Destruction: The Young Turk Seizure of Armenian Property|date=2011|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=1441130551|page=132}}</ref> Some second and third generation members of the family today control a group of companies under [[Sabanci Holding]].
