===Prehistory and ancient history===
[[File:Lia sites.JPG|thumb|left|[[Late Iron Age]] sites in Oman.]]
At Aybut Al Auwal, in the [[Dhofar Governorate]] of Oman, a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools, belonging to a regionally specific African [[lithic industry]]—the late [[Nubia]]n Complex—known previously only from the northeast and [[Horn of Africa]]. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This supports the proposition that early human populations moved from Africa into Arabia during the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0028239| pmid = 22140561| title = The Nubian Complex of Dhofar, Oman: An African Middle Stone Age Industry in Southern Arabia| journal = PLOS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 11| pages = e28239| year = 2011| last1 = Rose | first1 = J.

During the 8th century BC, it is believed that the Yaarub, the descendant of [[Qahtanite|Kahtan]], ruled the entire region of Yemen, including Oman. Wathil bin Himyar bin [[Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf|Abd-Shams-Saba]] bin Jashjub bin Yaarub later ruled Oman.<ref name=YWTATss/> It is thus believed that the Yaarubah were the first settlers in Oman from Yemen.<ref name=MIIDN/>

===Arab settlement===
Over centuries tribes from western Arabia settled in Oman, making a living by fishing, farming, herding or stock breeding, and many present day Omani families trace their ancestral roots to other parts of Arabia. Arab migration to Oman started from northern-western and south-western Arabia and those who chose to settle had to compete with the indigenous population for the best arable land. When Arab tribes started to migrate to Oman, there were two distinct groups. One group, a segment of the [[Azd]] tribe migrated from the southwest of Arabia in A.D. 120<ref name=YWTAT/>/200 following the collapse of [[Marib Dam]], while the other group migrated a few centuries before the birth of Islam from central and northern Arabia, named [[Nizari]] (Nejdi). Other historians believe that the Yaarubah, like the Azd, from Qahtan but belong to an older branch, were the first settlers of Oman from Yemen, and then came the Azd.<ref name=MIIDN/> 
[[File:Ruins6.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Ruins of [[Khor Rori]], built between 100 [[Before Common Era|BCE]] & 100 [[Common Era|CE]].]]
The Azd settlers in Oman are descendants of Nasr bin Azd, a branch of Yaarub bin [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]], and were later known as "the Al-Azd of Oman".<ref name=YWTAT/> Seventy years after the first Azd migration, another branch of [[Azd|Alazdi]] under Malik bin Fahm, the founder of Kingdom of [[Tanukhids|Tanukhites]] on the west of [[Euphrates]], is believed to have settled in Oman.<ref name=YWTAT>Salîl-ibn-Razîk.

===Imamate of Oman===
Omani [[Azd]] used to travel to [[Basra]] for trade, which was a centre of Islam during the [[Umayyad]] empire. Omani [[Azd]] were granted a section of Basra, where they could settle and attend their needs. Many of the Omani Azd who settled in Basra became wealthy merchants and under their leader [[Al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra|Muhallab bin Abi Sufrah]] started to expand their influence of power eastwards towards [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Ibadhi]] Islam originated in Basra by its founder [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh|Abdullah ibn Ibada]] around the year 650 CE, which the Omani [[Azd]] in Iraq followed. Later, [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|Alhajjaj]], the governor of Iraq, came into conflict with the Ibadhis, which forced them out to Oman. Among those who returned to Oman was the scholar [[Jābir ibn Zayd|Jaber bin Zaid]]. His return and the return of many other scholars greatly enhanced the Ibadhi movement in Oman.<ref name=OmanForeignPolicy/> Alhajjaj, also made an attempt to subjugate Oman, which was ruled by Suleiman and Said, the sons of Abbad bin Julanda. Alhajjaj dispatched Mujjaah bin Shiwah who was confronted by Said bin Abbad. The confrontation devastated Said's army. Thus, Said and his forces resorted to the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]]. Mujjaah and his forces went after Said and his forces and succeeded in besieging them from a position in "Wade Mastall". Mujjaah later moved towards the coast where he confronted Suleiman bin Abbad. The battle was won by Suleiman's forces. Alhajjaj, however, sent another force under Abdulrahman bin Suleiman and eventually won the war and took over the governance of Oman.<ref name=HRIS>Salîl-ibn-Razîk.

====Dhofar Rebellion====
{{further|Dhofar Rebellion}}
Oil reserves in [[Dhofar]] were discovered in 1964 and extraction began in 1967. In the [[Dhofar Rebellion]], which began in 1965, pro-Soviet forces were pitted against government troops. As the rebellion threatened the Sultan's control of Dhofar, Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed in a [[1970 Omani coup d'état|bloodless coup (1970)]] by his son [[Qaboos bin Said]], who expanded the [[Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces]], modernised the state's administration and introduced social reforms. The uprising was finally put down in 1975 with the help of forces from Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and the British [[Royal Air Force]], army and [[Special Air Service]].

===Reign of Sultan Qaboos (1970–2020)===
[[File:Omani_Qaboos_bin_Said_Al_Said_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said]] ruled from 1970 until his death in 2020.]]
After deposing his father in 1970, [[Sultan Qaboos]] opened up the country, embarked on economic reforms, and followed a policy of modernisation marked by increased spending on health, education and welfare.<ref name=econhrot>{{cite news|title=Happy and rich in an Omani toytown|url=http://www.economist.com/node/354276?zid=308&ah=e21d923f9b263c5548d5615da3d30f4d|work=The Economist|date=31 August 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121042946/https://www.economist.com/international/2000/08/31/happy-and-rich-in-an-omani-toytown?zid=308&ah=e21d923f9b263c5548d5615da3d30f4d|archivedate=21 November 2018}}</ref> [[Arab slave trade|Slavery]], once a cornerstone of the country's trade and development, was outlawed in 1970.<ref name=plackett/>

In 1981, Oman became a founding member of the six-nation [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. Political reforms were eventually introduced. Historically, voters had been chosen from among tribal leaders, intellectuals and businessmen. In 1997, Sultan Qaboos decreed that women could vote for, and stand for election to, the Majlis al-Shura, the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman]]. Two women were duly elected to the body.

In 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and the first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held in 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed Oman's first female minister with portfolio, [[Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel|Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-Sayabiyah]]. She was appointed to the post of National Authority for Industrial Craftsmanship, an office that attempts to preserve and promote Oman's traditional crafts and stimulate industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2818553.stm|title=Oman appoints first female minister|website=BBC News|date=4 March 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190917115643/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2818553.stm|archivedate=17 September 2019}}</ref> Despite these changes, there was little change to the actual political makeup of the government. The Sultan continued to rule by decree. Nearly 100 suspected Islamists were arrested in 2005 and 31 people were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. They were ultimately pardoned in June of the same year.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings that were taking place throughout the region, [[2011 Omani protests|protests occurred in Oman]] during the early months of 2011. While they did not call for the ousting of the regime, demonstrators demanded political reforms, improved living conditions and the creation of more jobs. They were dispersed by riot police in February 2011. Sultan Qaboos reacted by promising jobs and benefits. In October 2011, elections were held to the Consultative Assembly, to which Sultan Qaboos promised greater powers. The following year, the government began a crackdown on internet criticism. In September 2012, trials began of 'activists' accused of posting "abusive and provocative" criticism of the government online. Six were given jail terms of 12–18 months and fines of around $2,500 each.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14654492 |title=Oman profile – Timeline |work=BBC News |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=18 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510071946/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14654492|archivedate=10 May 2019}}</ref>

[[Desert shrub]] and desert grass, common to southern Arabia, are found in Oman, but vegetation is sparse in the interior plateau, which is largely [[gravel]] desert. The greater monsoon rainfall in Dhofar and the mountains makes the growth there more luxuriant during summer; [[coconut palm]]s grow plentifully on the coastal plains of Dhofar and [[frankincense]] is produced in the hills, with abundant [[oleander]] and varieties of [[acacia]]. The [[Al Hajar Mountains]] are a distinct [[ecoregion]], the highest points in eastern Arabia with [[wildlife]] including the [[Arabian tahr]].

[[Indigenous (ecology)|Indigenous]] [[mammal]]s include the [[leopard]], [[hyena]], fox, [[wolf]], hare, oryx and [[ibex]]. Birds include the vulture, eagle, stork, bustard, Arabian partridge, bee eater, falcon and sunbird.

===Environmental issues===
Drought and limited rainfall contribute to shortages in the nation's water supply. Maintaining an adequate supply of water for agricultural and domestic use is one of Oman's most pressing environmental problems, with limited renewable [[water resources]]. 94% of available water is used in farming and 2% for industrial activity, with the majority sourced from [[fossil water]] in the desert areas and spring water in hills and mountains.

In terms of climate action, major challenges remain to be solved, per the United Nations Sustainable Development 2019 index. The {{CO2}} emissions from energy (t{{CO2}}/capita) and {{CO2}} emissions embodied in fossil fuel exports (kg per capita) rates are very high, while imported {{CO2}} emissions (t{{CO2}}/capita) and people affected by climate-related disasters (per 100,000 people) rates are low.<ref name=UNSD3/>

Drinking water is available throughout Oman, either piped or delivered. The soil in coastal plains, such as Salalah, have shown increased levels of salinity, due to over exploitation of ground water and encroachment by seawater on the water table. Pollution of beaches and other coastal areas by oil tanker traffic through the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and [[Gulf of Oman]] is also a persistent concern.<ref>The Oman National Spatial Strategy (ONSS) deals with these issues at a national scale, and its under development by Consatt limited with the participation of IE Professor and economist, [[Hermenegildo Seisdedos]].

Local and national entities have noted unethical treatment of animals in Oman. In particular, stray dogs (and to a lesser extent, stray cats) are often the victims of torture, abuse or neglect.<ref>[http://www.y-oman.com/2013/06/animal-tragedy Animal Tragedy]. y-oman.com. 27 June 2013.</ref> The only approved method of decreasing the stray dog population is shooting by police officers. The Oman government has refused to implement a spay and neuter programme or create any animal shelters in the country. Cats, while seen as more acceptable than dogs, are viewed as pests and frequently die of starvation or illness.<ref>Macdonald, Sarah (22 March 2014) [http://www.timesofoman.com/News/31423/Article-Strays-on-streets-a-growing-issue-for-Oman Strays on streets a growing issue for Oman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112124040/http://www.timesofoman.com/News/31423/Article-Strays-on-streets-a-growing-issue-for-Oman |date=12 January 2015 }}.

In 2019, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) ranked Oman as the least polluted country in the [[Arab world]], with a score of 37.7 in the [[Air Pollution Index|pollution index]].

Oman is a [[unitary state]] and an [[absolute monarchy]],<ref name=oman-abs>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Elections to Oman's Consultative Council|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15288960|work=BBC News}}</ref> in which all legislative, executive and judiciary power ultimately rests in the hands of the hereditary Sultan. Consequently, [[Freedom House]] has routinely rated the country "Not Free".<ref>{{cite web|title=Oman|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/oman|work=Freedom House|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref>

The sultan is the head of state and directly controls the foreign affairs and defence portfolios.<ref>{{cite web|title=OMAN Majles A'Shura (Consultative Council)|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2378_E.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref> He has absolute power and issues [[Rule by decree|laws by decree]].<ref name=fh12>{{cite web|title=Oman|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/oman|work=Freedom in the World 2012|publisher=Freedom House|date=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=econwut>{{cite news|title=Waking up too|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21557354|work=The Economist|date=23 June 2012}}</ref>

===Legal system===
Oman is an [[absolute monarchy]], with the Sultan's word having the force of law. The judiciary branch is subordinate to the Sultan. According to Oman's constitution, [[Sharia law]] is one of the sources of legislation. Sharia court departments within the civil court system are responsible for family-law matters, such as divorce and inheritance.

Oman does not have [[separation of powers]].<ref name=rule>{{cite web |title=Country Report: Oman|url=http://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/OMN/|year=2016|publisher=BTI Project|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref> All power is concentrated in the Sultan,<ref name="rule"/> who is also chief of staff of the armed forces, Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs and chairman of the Central Bank.<ref name="rule"/> All legislation since 1970 has been promulgated through royal decrees, including the 1996 Basic Law.<ref name="rule"/> The Sultan appoints judges, and can grant pardons and commute sentences.<ref name="rule"/> The Sultan's authority is inviolable and the Sultan expects total subordination to his will.<ref name="rule"/>

The administration of justice is highly personalized, with limited due process protections, especially in political and security-related cases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stork|first=Joe|title=Human rights in the smaller Persian Gulf states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and UAE|date=19 December 2012|url=http://www.peacebuilding.no/Regions/Middle-East-and-North-Africa/The-Gulf/Publications/Human-rights-in-the-smaller-Gulf-states-Bahrain-Kuwait-Oman-Qatar-and-UAE|work=NOREF|accessdate=18 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308194615/http://www.peacebuilding.no/Regions/Middle-East-and-North-Africa/The-Gulf/Publications/Human-rights-in-the-smaller-Gulf-states-Bahrain-Kuwait-Oman-Qatar-and-UAE|archivedate=8 March 2014}}</ref> The [[Basic Statute of Oman|Basic Statute of the State]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Statute of the State |url=http://mola.gov.om/Nen.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723131521/http://mola.gov.om/Nen.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013 |work=Royal Decree 101/96 |publisher=[[Ministry of Legal Affairs]] |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> is supposedly the cornerstone of the Omani legal system and it operates as a constitution for the country.

Oman's military manpower totalled 44,100 in 2006, including 25,000 men in the army, 4,200 sailors in the navy, and an air force with 4,100 personnel. The [[Royal Household]] maintained 5,000 Guards, 1,000 in Special Forces, 150 sailors in the Royal Yacht fleet, and 250 pilots and ground personnel in the Royal Flight squadrons. Oman also maintains a modestly sized paramilitary force of 4,400 men.<ref name=cordesman>{{cite web|title=The Gulf Military Forces in an Era of Asymmetric War|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/060728_gulf_oman.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|author1=Anthony H.

The [[Royal Army of Oman]] had 25,000 active personnel in 2006, plus a small contingent of Royal Household troops. Despite a comparative large military spending, it has been relatively slow to modernise its forces. Oman has a relatively limited number of tanks, including 6 [[M60A1]], 73 [[M60A3]] and 38 [[Challenger 2]] main battle tanks, as well as 37 aging [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion]] light tanks.<ref name=cordesman/>

The [[Royal Air Force of Oman]] has approximately 4,100 men, with only 36 combat aircraft and no armed helicopters. Combat aircraft include 20 aging [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguars]], 12 [[BAE Systems Hawk|Hawk]] Mk 203s, 4 Hawk Mk 103s and 12 [[PC-9]] turboprop trainers with a limited combat capability. It has one squadron of 12 [[F-16]]C/D aircraft. Oman also has 4 [[FFA AS-202 Bravo|A202-18 Bravos]] and 8 [[PAC MFI-17 Mushshak|MFI-17B Mushshaqs]].<ref name=cordesman/>

The [[Royal Navy of Oman]] had 4,200 men in 2000, and is headquartered at [[Seeb]]. It has bases at Ahwi, Ghanam Island, [[Mussandam]] and [[Salalah]]. In 2006, Oman had 10 surface combat vessels. These included two 1,450-ton [[Qahir-class corvette|''Qahir'' class]] [[corvette]]s, and 8 ocean-going [[patrol boat]]s. The Omani Navy had one 2,500-ton [[Nasr al Bahr (L2)|''Nasr al Bahr'' class]] LSL (240 troops, 7 tanks) with a helicopter deck. Oman also had at least four [[landing craft]].<ref name=cordesman/> Oman ordered three [[Khareef-class corvette|''Khareef'' class]] corvettes from the [[VT Group]] for £400&nbsp;million in 2007.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Oman}}
[[File:Oman Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.35|A proportional representation of Oman's exports]]

Oman's Basic Statute of the State expresses in Article 11 that the "national economy is based on justice and the principles of a [[Market economy|free economy]]."<ref name=molabs /> By regional standards, Oman has a relatively diversified economy, but remains dependent on oil exports. In terms of monetary value, mineral fuels accounted for 82.2 percent of total product exports in 2018.<ref name=wteio>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/omans-top-10-exports/|title=Oman's Top 10 Exports|date=10 July 2019|website=World's Top Exports}}</ref> Tourism is the fastest-growing industry in Oman. Other sources of income, agriculture and industry, are small in comparison and account for less than 1% of the country's exports, but diversification is seen as a priority by the government. Agriculture, often [[subsistence]] in its character, produces [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], [[Cereal|grains]] and vegetables, but with less than 1% of the country under [[Tillage|cultivation]], Oman is likely to remain a net importer of food.

Oman's socio-economic structure is described as being hyper-centralized [[Rentier state|rentier]] welfare state.<ref name=bti1/> The largest 10 percent of corporations in Oman are the employers of almost 80 percent of Omani nationals in the private sector. Half of the private sector jobs are classified as elementary. One third of employed Omanis are in the private sector, while the remaining majority are in the public sector.<ref name=RSIO>Elusive Employment: Development Planning and Labour Market Trends in Oman.

September 2014.</ref> A hyper-centralized structure produces a monopoly-like economy, which hinders having a healthy competitive environment between businesses.<ref name=bti1/>

Since a slump in oil prices in 1998, Oman has made active plans to diversify its economy and is placing a greater emphasis on other areas of industry, namely tourism and infrastructure. Oman had a 2020 Vision to diversify the economy established in 1995, which targeted a decrease in oil's share to less than 10 percent of GDP by 2020, but it was rendered obsolete in 2011. Oman then established 2040 Vision.<ref name=bti1>Oman Country Report.

Oman is also expanding its downstream operations by constructing a refinery and petrochemical plant in Duqm with a 230,000 barrels per day capacity projected for completion by 2021.<ref name=eoopaon>Oman – Market Overview. [https://www.export.gov/article?id=Oman-Market-Overview Oman – Market Overview (US Export.gov) 2018] export.gov. 2018.</ref> The majority of industrial activity in Oman takes place in 8 industrial states and 4 free-zones. The industrial activity is mainly focused on mining-and-services, petrochemicals and construction materials.<ref name=unedp/> The largest employers in the private-sector are the construction, wholesale-and-retail and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Construction accounts for nearly 48 percent of the total labour force, followed by wholesale-and-retail, which accounts for around 15 percent of total employment and manufacturing, which accounts for around 12 percent of employment in the private sector. The percentage of Omanis employed in the construction and manufacturing sectors is nevertheless low, as of 2011 statistics.<ref name=RSIO/>

Oman, as per Global Innovation Index (2019) report, scores "below expectations" in innovation relative to countries classified under high income.<ref name=OBEII>[https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/Home Global Innovation Index Organization 2019] Global Innovation Index Organization. 2019.</ref> Oman in 2019 ranked 80 out of 129 countries in innovation index, which takes into consideration factors, such as, political environment, education, infrastructure and business sophistication.<ref name=romigi>[http://statisticstimes.com/ranking/global-innovation-index.php 2019 Global Innovation Index Rankings] Global Innovation Index Rankings. 2019.</ref> Innovation, technology-based growth and economic diversification are hindered by an economic growth that relies on infrastructure expansion, which heavily depends on a high percentage of 'low-skilled' and 'low-wage' foreign labour. Another challenge to innovation is the [[dutch disease]] phenomenon, which creates an oil and gas investment lock-in, while relying heavily on imported products and services in other sectors. Such a locked-in system hinders local business growth and global competitiveness in other sectors, and thus impedes economic diversification.<ref name=unedp/> The inefficiences and bottlenecks in business operations that are a result of heavy dependence on natural resources and 'addiction' to imports in Oman suggest a 'factor-driven economy'.<ref name=RSIO/> A third hindrance to innovation in Oman is an economic structure that is heavily dependent on few large firms, while granting few opportunities for SMEs to enter the market, which impedes healthy market-share competition between firms.<ref name=unedp>Science, Technology and Innovation 2014 Review.

===Agriculture and fishing===
Oman's fishing industry contributed 0.78 percent to the GDP in 2016. Fish exports between 2000 and 2016 grew from US$144&nbsp;million to US$172&nbsp;million (+19.4 percent). The main importer of Omani fish in 2016 was Vietnam, which imported almost US$80&nbsp;million (46.5 percent) in value, and the second biggest importer was the United Arab Emirates, which imported around US$26&nbsp;million (15 percent). The other main importers are Saudi Arabia, Brazil and China. Oman's consumption of fish is almost two times the world's average. The ratio of exported fish to total fish captured in tons fluctuated between 49 and 61 percent between 2006 and 2016. Omani strengths in the fishing industry comes from having a good market system, a long coastline (3,165&nbsp;km) and wide water area. Oman, on the other hand, lacks sufficient infrastructure, research and development, quality and safety monitoring, together with a limited contribution by the fishing industry to GDP.<ref name=OFIAA/>

[[Date (fruit)|Dates]] represent 80 percent of all fruit crop production. Further, date farms employ 50 percent of the total agricultural area in the country. Oman's estimated production of dates in 2016 is 350,000 tons, making it the 9th largest producer of dates. The vast majority of date production (75 percent) comes from only 10 cultivars. Oman's total export of dates was US$12.6&nbsp;million in 2016, almost equivalent to Oman's total imported value of dates, which was US$11.3&nbsp;million in 2016. The main importer is India (around 60 percent of all imports). Oman's date exports remained steady between 2006 and 2016. Oman is considered to have good infrastructure for date production and support provision to cultivation and marketing, but lacks innovation in farming and cultivation, industrial coordination in the supply chain and encounter high losses of unused dates.<ref name=OFIAA/>

Virtually all non-Muslims in Oman are foreign workers. Non-Muslim religious communities include various groups of [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], Jews, [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Christians. Christian communities are centred in the major urban areas of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Sohar]] and [[Salalah]]. These include [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and various [[Protestant]] congregations, organising along linguistic and ethnic lines. More than 50 different Christian groups, fellowships and assemblies are active in the Muscat metropolitan area, formed by migrant workers from Southeast Asia.

There are also communities of ethnic Indian [[Hindus]] and Christians.

Oman scored high as of 2019 on the percentage of students who complete lower secondary school and on the literacy rate between the age of 15 and 24, 99.7 percent and 98.7 percent, respectively. However, Oman's net primary school enrollment rate in 2019, which is 94.1 percent, is rated as "challenges remain" by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) standard. Oman's overall evaluation in quality of education, according to UNSDG, is 94.8 ("challenges remain") as of 2019.<ref name=UNSD3>Sustainable Development Report Dashboards 2019 Oman.

Oman's higher education produces a surplus in humanities and liberal arts, while it produces an insufficient number in technical and scientific fields and required skill-sets to meet the market demand.<ref name=unedp/> Further, sufficient human capital creates a business environment that can compete with, partner or attract foreign firms. Accreditation standards and mechanisms with a quality control that focuses on input assessments, rather than output, are areas of improvement in Oman, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2014 report.<ref name=unedp/> The transformation Index BTI 2018 report on Oman recommends that the education curriculum should focus more on the "promotion of personal initiative and critical perspective".<ref name=bti1/>

Since Sultan Qaboos' ascension to power in 1970, the government has given high priority to education to develop a domestic work force, which the government considers a vital factor in the country's economic and social progress. Today, there are over 1,000 state schools and about 650,000 students.

Oman's first university, [[Sultan Qaboos University]], opened in 1986. The [[University of Nizwa]] is one of the fastest growing universities in Oman. Other post-secondary institutions in Oman include the [[Higher College of Technology]] and its six branches, six colleges of applied sciences (including a teachers' training college), a college of banking and financial studies, an institute of Sharia sciences, and several nursing institutes. Some 200 scholarships are awarded each year for study abroad.

According to the [[Webometrics Ranking of World Universities]], the top-ranking universities in the country are [[Sultan Qaboos University]] (1678th worldwide), the Dhofar University (6011th) and the [[University of Nizwa]] (6093rd).<ref>{{cite web|title=Oman |url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw/Oman |publisher=Ranking Web of Universities |accessdate=26 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221185619/http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw/Oman |archivedate=21 February 2014 }}</ref>

Outwardly, Oman shares many of the cultural characteristics of its Arab neighbours, particularly those in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].<ref name=kcom/> Despite these similarities, important factors make Oman unique in the Middle East.<ref name=kcom/> These result as much from geography and history as from culture and economics.<ref name=kcom>{{cite web|last=Common|first=Richard K.|title=Barriers To Developing 'Leadership' In The Sultanate Of Oman|url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss2/3_Common_pp215-229_jm.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Leadership Studies}}</ref> The relatively recent and artificial nature of the [[state (polity)|state]] in Oman makes it difficult to describe a national culture;<ref name=kcom/> however, sufficient cultural heterogeneity exists within its national boundaries to make Oman distinct from other Arab States of the Persian Gulf.<ref name=kcom/> Oman's cultural diversity is greater than that of its Arab neighbours, given its historical expansion to the Swahili Coast and the Indian Ocean.<ref name=kcom/>

Oman has a long tradition of shipbuilding, as maritime travel played a major role in the Omanis' ability to stay in contact with the civilisations of the ancient world. [[Sur, Oman|Sur]] was one of the most famous shipbuilding cities of the Indian Ocean. The Al Ghanja ship takes one whole year to build. Other types of Omani ship include As Sunbouq and Al Badan.<ref>

In March 2016 archaeologists working off Al Hallaniyah Island identified a shipwreck believed to be that of the ''Esmeralda'' from [[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1502–1503 fleet. The wreck was initially discovered in 1998. Later underwater excavations took place between 2013 and 2015 through a partnership between the Oman Ministry of Heritage and Culture and [[Blue Water Recoveries]] Ltd., a shipwreck recovery company. The vessel was identified through such artifacts as a "Portuguese coin minted for trade with India (one of only two coins of this type known to exist) and stone cannonballs engraved with what appear to be the initials of Vincente Sodré, da Gama's maternal uncle and the commander of the ''Esmeralda''."<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Romey|first1=Kristin|title=Shipwreck Discovered from Explorer Vasco da Gama's Fleet|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/20160314-oman-shipwreck-explorer-vasco-da-gama-age-of-exploration-india-route/|accessdate=15 March 2016|magazine=National Geographic|date=14 March 2016}}</ref>

===Dress===
[[File:Khanjar.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[khanjar]], the traditional [[dagger]] of Oman ([[Circa|c.]]&nbsp;1924)]]

The male [[national dress]] in Oman consists of the ''[[dishdasha]]'', a simple, ankle-length, collarless gown with long sleeves.<ref name=cgso/> Most frequently white in colour, the dishdasha may also appear in a variety of other colours. Its main adornment, a [[tassel]] (''furakha'') sewn into the neckline, can be impregnated with perfume.<ref name=ossc>
{{cite web|title=Culture|url=http://www.omanistudents.org/oman/culture/|publisher=Omani Students Society}}</ref> Underneath the dishdasha, men wear a plain, wide strip of cloth wrapped around the body from the waist down. The most noted regional differences in dishdasha designs are the style with which they are embroidered, which varies according to age group.<ref name=cgso/> On formal occasions a black or beige cloak called a [[Bisht (clothing)|''bisht'']] may cover the dishdasha. The embroidery edging the cloak is often in silver or gold thread and it is intricate in detail.<ref name=ossc/>

Omani men wear two types of headdress:
* the ''ghutra'', also called "Musar" a square piece of woven wool or cotton fabric of a single colour, decorated with various embroidered patterns. 
* the ''kummah'', a cap that is the head dress worn during leisure hours.<ref name=cgso/>

Some men carry the ''assa'', a stick, which can have practical uses or is simply used as an accessory during formal events. Omani men, on the whole, wear sandals on their feet.<ref name=ossc/>

The ''[[khanjar]]'' (dagger) forms part of the national dress and men wear the khanjar on all formal public occasions and festivals.<ref name=cgso/> It is traditionally worn at the waist. Sheaths may vary from simple covers to ornate silver or gold-decorated pieces.<ref name=ossc/> It is a symbol of a man's origin, his manhood and courage. A depiction of a khanjar appears on the national flag.<ref name="cgso">{{cite web|title = Human rights|url = https://www.amnesty.org/ar/documents/mde20/2192/2015/en|publisher = Amnesty International}}
</ref>

Omani women wear eye-catching national costumes, with distinctive regional variations. All costumes incorporate vivid colours and vibrant embroidery and decorations. In the past, the choice of colours reflected a tribe's tradition. The Omani women's traditional costume comprises several garments: the ''kandoorah'', which is a long tunic whose sleeves or ''radoon'' are adorned with hand-stitched embroidery of various designs. The ''dishdasha'' is worn over a pair of loose fitting trousers, tight at the ankles, known as a ''[[sirwal]]''. Women also wear a head shawl most commonly referred to as the ''lihaf''.<ref name=ocde/>

{{As of | 2014}} women reserve wearing their traditional dress for special occasions, and instead wear a loose black cloak called an ''[[abaya]]'' over their personal choice of clothing, whilst in some regions, particularly amongst the Bedouin, the ''[[burqa]]'' is still worn.<ref name=ocde>

===Media===
The government has continuously held a monopoly on television in Oman. [[Sultanate of Oman Television|Oman TV]] is the only state-owned national television channel broadcaster in Oman. It began broadcasting for the first time from Muscat on 17 November 1974 and separately from [[Salalah]] on 25 November 1975. On 1 June 1979, the two stations at Muscat and Salalah linked by satellite to form a unified broadcasting service. Oman TV broadcasts four HD channels, including Oman TV General, Oman TV Sport, Oman TV Live and Oman TV Cultural.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://part.gov.om/part/english/|title=Public Authority For Radio And Television Oman|website=}}</ref>

Although private ownership of radio and television stations is permitted, Oman has only one privately owned television channel.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14654265|title=Oman profile – Media|date=13 January 2015|work=BBC}}</ref> Majan TV is the first private TV channel in Oman.

=== Art ===
Traditional art in Oman stems from its long heritage of material culture. Art movements in the 20th century reveal that the art scene in Oman began with early practices that included a range of tribal handicrafts and self-portraiture in painting since the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mazin|first=Aisha|date=16 June 2016|title=Contemporary Art in Oman: Spaces And Places|url=https://journal.collectionair.com/city-guides/contemporary-art-oman-spaces-places/|journal=The Collectionair's Journal}}</ref> However, since the inclusion of several Omani artists in international collections, art exhibitions, and events, such Alia Al Farsi, the first Omani artist to show at the last [[Venice Biennale]] and Radhika Khimji, the first Omani artist to exhibit at both the [[Arts in Marrakech (AiM) International Biennale|Marrakesh]] and [[Ghetto Biennale|Haiti Ghetto biennale]], Oman's position as a newcomer to the contemporary art scene in recent years has been more important for Oman's international exposure.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Choudhry|first=Sudipta|year=2017|title=Oman|journal=ArtAsiaPacific|volume=12|id={{ProQuest|1853304328}}}}</ref>

Bait Muzna Gallery is the first art gallery in Oman. Established in 2000 by Sayyida Susan Al Said, Bait Muzna has served as a platform for emerging Omani artists to showcase their talent and place themselves on the wider art scene. In 2016, Bait Muzna opened a second space in [[Salalah]] to branch out and support [[art film]] and the [[digital art]] scene. The gallery has been primarily active as an art consultancy.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baitmuznagallery.com/our-story|title=baitmuzna {{!}} Our Story|website=baitmuzna|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref>

The Sultanate's flagship cultural institution, the [[National Museum (Oman)|National Museum of Oman]], opened on 30 July 2016 with 14 permanent galleries. It showcases national heritage from the earliest human settlement in Oman two million years ago through to the present day. The museum takes a further step by presenting information on the material in [[Arabic Braille]] script for the visually impaired, the first museum to do this in the Gulf region.<ref name=":1" />

The Omani Society for Fine Arts, established in 1993, offers educational programmes, workshops and artist grants for practitioners across varied disciplines. In 2016, the organisation opened its first exhibition on graphic design. It also hosted the "Paint for Peace" competition with 46 artists in honour of the country's 46th [[National Day of Oman|National Day]], where Mazin al-Mamari won the top prize. The organisation has additional branches in [[Sohar]], [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi]] and [[Salalah]].<ref name=":1" />

[[Bait Al Zubair|Bait Al- Zubair Museum]] is a private, family-funded museum that opened its doors to the public in 1998. In 1999, the museum received [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Sultan Qaboos]]’ Award for Architectural Excellence. Bait Al Zubair displays the family's collection of Omani artifacts that spans a number of centuries and reflect inherited skills that define Oman's society in the past and present. Located within Bait Al-Zubair, Gallery Sarah, which opened in October 2013, offers an array of paintings and photographs by established local and international artists. The gallery also occasionally holds lectures and workshops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baitalzubair.com/?page_id=107&lang=en|title=Bait Al Zubair {{!}} Bait Al Zubair|website=www.baitalzubair.com|access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref>

===Food===
{{main|Omani cuisine}}
[[File:Traditional Omani Food.jpg|thumb|Traditional Omani food]]
Omani cuisine is diverse and has been influenced by many cultures. Omanis usually eat their main daily meal at midday, while the evening meal is lighter. During [[Ramadan]], dinner is served after the [[Taraweeh]] prayers, sometimes as late as 11&nbsp;pm. However, these dinner timings differ according to each family; for instance, some families would choose to eat right after [[maghrib]] prayers and have dessert after taraweeh.

Arsia, a festival meal served during celebrations, consists of mashed rice and meat (sometimes chicken). Another popular festival meal, shuwa, consists of meat cooked very slowly (sometimes for up to 2 days) in an underground clay oven. The meat becomes extremely tender and it is infused with spices and herbs before cooking to give it a very distinct taste. Fish is often used in main dishes too, and the [[Giant trevally|kingfish]] is a popular ingredient. Mashuai is a meal consisting of a whole spit-roasted kingfish served with lemon rice.

Rukhal bread is a thin, round bread originally baked over a fire made from palm leaves. It is eaten at any meal, typically served with Omani honey for breakfast or crumbled over curry for dinner. Chicken, fish, and lamb or mutton are regularly used in dishes. The Omani [[Halva|halwa]] is a very popular sweet, basically consisting of cooked raw sugar with nuts. There are many different flavors, the most popular ones being black halwa (original) and saffron halwa. Halwa is considered as a symbol of Omani hospitality, and is traditionally served with coffee. As is the case with most [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], alcohol is only available over-the-counter to non-Muslims. Muslims can still purchase alcoholic drinks. Alcohol is served in many hotels and a few restaurants.
