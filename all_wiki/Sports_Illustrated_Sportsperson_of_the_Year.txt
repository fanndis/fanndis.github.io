{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Sports Illustrated'' Sportsperson of the Year}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}

Since its inception in 1954, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' American magazine has annually presented the '''Sportsman of the Year''' award to "the athlete or team whose performance that year most embodies the spirit of [[sportsmanship]] and achievement." Both Americans and non-Americans are eligible, though in the past the vast majority of winners have been from the United States. Both men and women have won the award, originally called "Sportsman of the Year" and renamed "Sportswoman of the Year" or "Sportswomen of the Year" when applicable.

[[Tiger Woods]] and [[LeBron James]] are the only individuals who have received the award more than once. Woods received his first award in 1996 as an amateur golfer, and in 2000 as a professional golfer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/tiger-woods-40-biggest-moments-no-19-1996-sports-illustrated-sportsman-year |title=Tiger Woods 40 Biggest Moments: No. 19 - 1996 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of Year |last=Sens |first=Josh |website=Golf.com |date=December 12, 2015 |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> James received his first award in 2012 and his second in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/12/01/lebron-james-si-sportsperson-of-year/94728794/ |title=LeBron James named SI's Sportsperson of the Year for second time |newspaper=USA Today |first=AJ |last=Neuharth-Keusch |date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

The trophy is a ceramic replica of an ancient Greek [[Panathenaic amphora|amphora]] (''circa'' 510 BCE) which depicts nude male [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] athletes engaged in a variety of [[Sport of athletics|athletic]] activities—running, discus, and javelin.  It measures 8" in diameter and stands 18.5" high (20.32 x 47&nbsp;cm). The original amphora was acquired by ''Sports Illustrated'' magazine in 1954 and was donated to the "Sports" collection of the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of American History]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19790619&id=zRwOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Tn0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4768,658615&hl=en |title=Sports Legends Donate To Smithsonian |newspaper=Evening Independent |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |agency=Associated Press |page=7C |date=June 19, 1979 |access-date=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Winners of the award are now presented with a copy of the amphora made in silver by [[Tiffany & Co.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth/2009/11/03/how-much-is-tha/ |title=How much is that trophy in the window? |publisher=Farther Off The Wall |date=November 3, 2009 |first=Tom |last=Hoffarth |access-date=June 29, 2015}}</ref>
