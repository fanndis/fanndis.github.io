==History==
===Monoline credit card company (1994–2004)===
[[File:Capital One footprint 2010-01.png|thumb|right|150px|Capital One retail footprint]]
On July 21, 1994, [[Richmond, Virginia]]-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the [[corporate spin-off]] of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming [[Richard Fairbank]] as CEO.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/business/company-news-signet-banking-to-spin-off-credit-card-business.html | title=COMPANY NEWS; SIGNET BANKING TO SPIN OFF CREDIT CARD BUSINESS | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 28, 1994}}</ref> Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-10-12-1994285071-story.html | title=Signet renames credit card subsidiary Capital One | first=David | last=Conn | work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] | date=October 12, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bankdirector.com/magazine/archives/2nd-quarter-2006/capital-one-charts-a-new-course/ | title=Capital One Charts a New Course | first=Jack | last=Milligan | work=Bank Director | date=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

At that time, Capital One was a ''monoline'' bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.<ref name=realist>{{cite web | url=https://articles.marketrealist.com/2015/03/capital-ones-history-credit-cards-diversified-bank/ | title=Capital One’s history: From credit cards to a diversified bank | first=Saul | last=Perez | publisher=Market Realist | date=March 5, 2015}}</ref> This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.<ref name=realist/> Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build [[demographic profile]]s, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit directly to consumers.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cio.com/article/2441173/capital-one-builds-entire-business-on-savvy-use-of-it.html | title=Capital One Builds Entire Business on Savvy Use of IT | first=Malcolm | last=Wheatley | work=[[CIO magazine]] | date=November 1, 2001}}</ref>

===Expansion into auto loans (1998–present)===

During the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]], Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/20363414 | title=Capital One Closes Wholesale Mortgage Unit | agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[CNBC]] | date=August 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118764159728403271 | title=Capital One to Close Its GreenPoint Unit | first=Valerie | last=Bauerlein | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=August 21, 2007 |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/20363414 | title=Capital One Financial Closes Wholesale Mortgage Unit | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[CNBC]] | date=August 20, 2007}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that they understated auto loan losses during the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/capital-one-settles-accusations-it-understated-loan-losses/ |title=DEALBOOK; Capital One Settles Charges It Understated Loan Losses | first=Ben | last=Protess | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups argued that the acquisition was a test of the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head [[Thomas M. Hoenig]] was also skeptical of the deal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-hoening-idUSTRE77O5P420110825 | title=Fed's Hoenig Says Doesn't See Recession Looming | first=Mark | last=Felsenthal | work=[[Reuters]] | date=August 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/steven-pearlstein-time-to-say-no-to-bank-consolidation/2011/08/20/gIQA8Q5LjJ_story.html | title=Steven Pearlstein: Time to say no to bank consolidation | last=Pearlstein | first=Steven | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=August 28, 2011}}</ref> In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/capital-one-completes-acquisition-of-ing-direct-139515678.html | title=Capital One Completes Acquisition of ING Direct | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=February 17, 2012}}</ref> Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/memos-advisory-letters/2012/capitalone_ing_101712.pdf | title=Conditional Merger Approval | publisher=Office of the Comptroller of Currency | date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2012/11/ing-direct-rebranded-as-capital-one-360.html | title=ING Direct rebranded as Capital One 360 | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | first=Bryant | last=Ruiz Switzky | date= November 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Automated dialing to customers' phones===
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Dale | first1=Margaret A. | title=Capital One to Pay Largest TCPA Settlement on Record | journal=The [[National Law Review]] | url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/capital-one-to-pay-largest-tcpa-settlement-record-0 | publisher=[[Proskauer Rose]] | date=August 19, 2014 | issn=2161-3362}}</ref> It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Slawe | first1=Meredith C. | last2=Madway | first2=Brynne S. | title=Capital One Agrees to $75 Million Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) Settlement | url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/capital-one-agrees-to-75-million-telephone-consumer-protection-act-tcpa-settlement | work=[[The National Law Review]] | date=August 11, 2014}}</ref>

===2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits===
In 2014, Capital One amended its [[terms of use]] to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."<ref name=latimes>{{cite news | authorlink=David Lazarus | first=David | last=Lazarus | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/17/business/la-fi-lazarus-20140218 | title=Capital One says it can show up at cardholders' homes, workplaces | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 17, 2014}}</ref> The company stated that it would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".<ref name=latimes/> Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "[[Caller ID spoofing|spoof]]" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".<ref>{{cite news | first=Amanda | last=Alix | url=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/19/capital-one-to-customers-you-cant-hide-from-us.aspx | title=Capital One to Customers: You Can't Hide From Us", | work=[[The Motley Fool]] | date=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

===July 2019 security breach===
Capital One publicly acknowledged on July 29, 2019 that they had found unauthorized access had occurred ten days earlier by an individual who had breached the account and identity security of 106 million people in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Capital One |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730125041/https://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/ |archivedate=July 30, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019 }}</ref> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrested Paige Thompson, who had previously worked as a [[software]] [[engineer]] for [[Amazon Web Services]], Capital One's [[Cloud computing|cloud hosting]] company. Capital One declared that Thompson had accessed about 140,000 [[Social Security numbers]], a million Canadian [[Social Insurance Number|social insurance numbers]]; 80,000 bank account numbers, and an unknown number of names and addresses of customers. Capital One began offering free [[Credit report monitoring|credit monitoring services]] to those affected by the breach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach/index.html|title=A hacker gained access to 100 million Capital One credit card applications and accounts|last=Business|first=Rob McLean, CNN|website=CNN|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capital-one-data-breach-compromises-tens-of-millions-of-credit-card-applications-fbi-says/2019/07/29/|title=404 Not Found|website=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

Thompson's employment at Amazon appears to have ended in September 2016. Amazon stated that the security vulnerability she used to access Capital One could have been discovered by anyone, the information that facilitated her activity was not gained from work at Amazon, and that she gained access via "a misconfiguration of the (Capital One-designed) web application and not the underlying (Amazon-designed) cloud-based infrastructure".<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capital-one-hacker-amazon-employee-paige-thompson/ What we know about accused Capital One hacker Paige Thompson.</ref>

====Details of the breach====
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2020}}
Forensic analysis{{vague|date=February 2020}} determined Thompson's actual hacking activity occurred in March 2019, then she posted the information to different outlets over the next three months. In April she posted what came to be known{{by whom|date=February 2020}} as the "April 21 Files",  a trove of leaked data along with instructions on how to access the company's credentials for more data extraction. In July a [[white hat (computer security)|white-hat]] alerted Capital One to Thompson's hacking activity. Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and computer fraud and abuse. During the investigations and subsequent data freeze, millions of Capital One accounts were locked; their owners were unable to process financial transactions, meet payments, or gain access to their financial records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6226401-Capital-One-Data-Breach-Stamped-Complaint.html|title=Capital One Data Breach Stamped Complaint|last=Journalist)|first=AJ Dellinger (AJ Dellinger, Independent|website=documentcloud.org|language=en|access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref>

==== Capital One Response ====
Critics lambasted the bank's effort to downplay the hack while investigations were ongoing, and described the bank as more concerned about its image than the needs of its clients. Several Capital One customers stated that the first time they heard about the hack was through the media and the bank did not disclose the breach or explain its implications to affected customers.<ref>https://slate.com/technology/2019/07/capital-one-hack-no-customer-notification.html</ref> On [[social media]] and in the mainstream press, Capital One's contradictory July 2019 press statement was mocked<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/capital-one-hack-press-release-slammed-on-social-media-2019-7|title=Capital One was hacked and people on social media are slamming the bank’s response|last=Villas-Boas|first=Antonio|website=Business Insider|access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajdellinger/2019/07/30/capital-one-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-following-massive-data-breach/|title=Capital One Hit With Class-Action Lawsuit Following Massive Data Breach|last=Dellinger|first=A.

==== Federal Reserve Action ====
On August 6, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced a [[cease and desist order]] against Capital One resulting from the breach.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20200806a1.pdf | title=United States of America Before the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | publisher=Federal Reserve Board | date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> The order mandated, among other things, significant improvements in Capital One's [[governance, risk management and compliance]] (GRC) practices.

==== Lawsuits ====
Lawsuits were filed against Capital One and its employees in federal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/privacy/data-breach/911181-capital-one-class-action-filed-over-data-breach/|title=Capital One Class Action Filed Over Data Breach|date=August 1, 2019|website=Top Class Actions|language=en-US|access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref> and circuit courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colson.com/colson-hicks-eidson-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-capital-one-for-negligence-in-massive-data-breach/|title=Colson Hicks Eidson Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Capital One For Negligence In Massive Data Breach|date=August 16, 2019|website=Colson Hicks Eidson|language=en-US|access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref>

=== Government Investigations ===
Relative to other large banks, Capital One has received fewer sanctions or default judgments against it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} But some{{Who|date=February 2020}} allude this is a result of its close proximity to Washington DC and possible relations with federal regulators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 2015 the bank disclosed that it was under federal investigation for bank fraud, [[money laundering]], and possible racketeering charges. No further information was given and government investigators would only confirm that it was under scrutiny for "unspecified charges".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Andriotis|first=AnnaMaria|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-discloses-probe-into-anti-money-laundering-program-1487891834|title=Capital One Discloses Probe Into Anti-Money Laundering Program|date=February 24, 2017|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=February 28, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

In 2018, Capital One was fined $100 million for failure to monitor, detect, and prevent money laundering.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-capital-one-bank-moneylaundering-idUSKCN1MX2LN|title=Capital One Bank fined $100 million over money-laundering controls|date=October 23, 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=February 28, 2020|language=en}}</ref> Charging documents <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2018/nr-occ-2018-112.html|title=OCC Assesses $100 Million Civil Money Penalty Against Capital One|date=October 23, 2018|website=occ.treas.gov|language=en-US|access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref> specified Capital One failed to file suspicious activity reports, had deficiencies in its risk assessment, remote deposit capture and generally had weaknesses that compromised  national bank security controls. The bank was the subject of a larger investigation that alleged funds were siphoned out of US jurisdiction to safe havens.
