'''Joyce McCartan''' MBE (26 November 1929 – 8 January 1996) was a Northern Irish community worker.<ref name=Lynn>{{cite book|last1=Lynn|first1=Brendan|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=[[Dictionary of Irish Biography]]|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=McCartan, Joyce|chapter-url=https://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a5574}}</ref>

==Early life and family==
Joyce McCartan was born Joyce Buchanan on 26 November 1929 in [[Banbridge]], County Down.<ref name="A Century Of Women">{{cite web |title=Joyce McCartan |url=https://www.acenturyofwomen.com/joyce-mccartan/ |website=A Century Of Women |accessdate=4 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Her father was Hugh Buchanan, whose family originally came from [[Scotland]]. She had three brothers. Her mother died when she was around 7 years old, which left her with the responsibility of looking after her father and brothers. She attended school in Banbridge, but left at age 14 to work in a cloth factory in [[Seaforde]]. She worked there for 2 years, but due to her unhappiness at home, she ran away to [[Belfast]] at age 16. There she found work as an assistant in a draper's shop. She met her husband, Seamus McCartan, at a dance hall. They lived in Bagot Street, just off the Ormeau Road. McCartan had been raised [[Protestantism|Protestant]], but her husband was [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and they raised their 8 children as Catholics.<ref name="Lynn" /><ref name="McCann">{{cite web |last1=Froggatt |first1=Richard |title=Joyce McCartan (1929 - 1996): Community worker; peace campaigner |url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1828 |website=The Dictionary of Ulster Biography |publisher=Ulster History Circle |accessdate=4 July 2020}}</ref>

==Activism==
From the early 1970s, McCartan was involved in local protests along the [[Ormeau Road]] organised by women. These protests were on a wide range of issues including the ending of free milk for primary school children and the increasingly high cost of public transport. McCartan later described herself as a "family feminist". To help provide a support network to groups involved in this sort of action, McCartan was involved with the [[Women's Information Group]], which allowed women to lead on local community issues. The services ranged from advice centres to children's facilities to action groups to pressure government bodies. The movement spread across Belfast, and despite the sectarian tension of the time, was a cross community initiative.<ref name="Lynn" /><ref name="McCann" />

Buoyed by the success of the network, McCartan established the [[Women's Information Drop-In Centre]] (WIDIC) on the Lower Ormeau Road. This area was badly affected by [[the Troubles]], which led to poor infrastructure and very few public amenities. The WIDIC provided a safe meeting place for women's groups, but also started homework classes for the local children. They grew and sold vegetables and flowers to fund the activities, taking over a derelict chip shop and opening it as the Lamplighter Fish and Chip Restaurant, providing employment and a local, safe meeting place. A youth training operation, Mornington Enterprises, was launched with government support, which trained teenagers in a range of skills including catering, computing, gardening, woodwork and painting and decorating.<ref name="Lynn" /><ref name="Lion">{{cite news |last1=Lion |first1=Ed |title=Mother Who Lost Kin in Ulster Strife Sets Up Women's Group |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-11-27-vw-16723-story.html |accessdate=4 July 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=27 November 1987}}</ref>

McCartan suffered personal loss during this time, with 17 members of her immediate family members dying during the sectarian violence.<ref name="A Century Of Women" /> In May 1987 her youngest son, Gary who was 17, was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in the family home. At the time of the attack, she was meeting women in the WIDIC offices, and heard the gunfire and screams from her home. Despite this, she continued her community work, receiving a number of awards including the Irish Pensioner of the Year in 1991, an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1992, and an honorary doctorate from [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1995. During the visit of US president, [[Bill Clinton]], to Ireland in 1995, McCartan received [[Hillary Clinton]] at the [[Lamplighter Café]] in November 1995.<ref name="Lynn" /><ref name="Clinton Digital Library">{{cite web |title=First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in South Belfast · "Days Like This": President Clinton's Public Diplomacy in Northern Ireland |url=https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/exhibits/show/northern-ireland/south-belfast |website=Clinton Digital Library |accessdate=4 July 2020}}</ref> Hillary Clinton later recalled that McCartan "gave me an old battered aluminium teapot - which kept the tea very warm, which is what I first noticed about it - that I took with me to the [[White House]] where I used it every single day in the second floor private kitchen."<ref name="McCann" />

McCartan died on 8 January 1996 in hospital,<ref name="Lynn" /> and is buried at Milltown cemetery, Belfast.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moriarty |first1=Gerry |title=Community activist Joyce McCartan buried in Belfast |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/community-activist-joyce-mccartan-buried-in-belfast-1.21056 |accessdate=4 July 2020 |work=The Irish Times |date=12 January 1996 |language=en}}</ref> The [[Ulster University|University of Ulster]] established a professorial chair in her honour, and the inaugural Joyce McCartan lecture in October 1997 was given by Hillary Clinton.<ref name="Lynn" /><ref name="McCann" />
