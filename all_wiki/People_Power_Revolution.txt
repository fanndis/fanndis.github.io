{{History of the Philippines}}
{{RegchangePH}}

The '''People Power Revolution''' (also known as the '''EDSA Revolution''', the '''Philippine Revolution of 1986''', '''EDSA 1986''', '''EDSA I''' (pronounced as ''EDSA One'' or ''EDSA Uno'') and '''EDSA People Power''') was a series of popular [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s in the [[Philippines]], mostly in [[Metro Manila]], from February 22–25, 1986. There was a sustained campaign of [[civil resistance]] against regime violence and electoral fraud. The [[nonviolent revolution]] led to the departure of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], the end of his 20-year presidential term and the restoration of [[democracy]] in the Philippines.

It is also referred to as the '''Yellow Revolution''' due to the presence of yellow ribbons during demonstrations (in reference to the [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]] song "[[Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree]]")  following the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|assassination of Filipino senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]]<ref name="QUARTET p. 77">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayFour.html|title=The Original People Power Revolution|publisher=QUARTET p. 77|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215175737/http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayFour.html|archive-date=February 15, 2008|access-date=February 28, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> in August 1983 upon his return to the Philippines from exile.

The majority of the demonstrations took place on a long stretch of [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]], more commonly known by its acronym ''EDSA'', in [[Metro Manila]] from February 22–25, 1986. They involved over two million Filipino civilians, as well as several political and military groups, and religious groups led by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jaime Sin]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], along with [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] President Cardinal [[Ricardo Vidal]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu|Archbishop of Cebu]]. The protests, fueled by the resistance and opposition from years of governance by President Marcos and his cronies, culminated with the absolute ruler and his family fleeing [[Malacañang Palace]] to exile in [[Hawaii]]. Ninoy Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], was immediately installed as the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|eleventh]] President as a result of the revolution.<ref>

Though sometimes described as a peaceful revolution, the People Power Revolution coincided with more militant and violent revolutionary movements that had formed during the Marcos dictatorship, namely the communist [[CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion]]<ref name="NPAStanford">{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149|title=New People's Army|date=August 22, 2012|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=February 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230081441/http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149|archive-date=December 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=This article discusses the events of the People Power Revolution of February 22-25, 2020.

==Background and history==
{{Main|Ferdinand Marcos}}
[[Image:Ferdinand Marcos.JPEG|thumb|President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] served for slightly over 20 years, the longest tenure in Philippine history.]]
President Ferdinand E. Marcos was [[1965 Philippine presidential election|elected president in 1965]], defeating incumbent [[Diosdado Macapagal|President Diosdado Macapagal]] by a margin of 52 to 43 percent. During this time, Marcos was very active in the initiation of public works projects and the intensification of tax collections. Marcos and his government claimed that they "built more roads than all his predecessors combined and more schools than any previous administration".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lacsamana|1990|p=187}}</ref> Amidst charges from the opposition party of vote-buying and a fraudulent election, President Marcos was reelected in the [[1969 Philippine presidential election]], this time defeating [[Sergio Osmeña Jr.|Sergio Osmeña, Jr.]] by 61 to 39 percent.

President Marcos' second term for the presidency was marred by allegations by the opposition [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] of widespread graft and corruption. According to [[leftists]] who rioted during the [[First Quarter Storm]], the increasing disparity of wealth between the very wealthy and the very poor that made up the majority of the Philippines' population led to a rise in crime and civil unrest around the country.

In March 1969, the [[New People's Army]] (NPA) was formed as the military wing of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]], initiating the still-ongoing CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion. Marcos quickly denounced the movement, hoping to gain monetary and political support from anti-Communist administrators in the United States.<ref name="RebellionRepressionPh">{{Cite book |title=Rebellion and repression in the Philippines |last=Kessler |first=Richard John |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300044065 |location=New Haven |oclc=19266663 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rebellionrepress0000kess |page=43}}</ref>

In 1972 the [[Moro National Liberation Front]], a militant Muslim separatist group, formed in the southern island of Mindanao.<ref name="MoroStanford" />

Marcos soon used the rise of militant and civil unrest as justification for declaring martial law.

=== Proclamation of Martial Law ===
{{Main|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos}}
Barred from running for a third term as president in 1973, Marcos announced [[Proclamation No. 1081]] on September 23, 1972, declaring [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] with rising civil disobedience as a justification. Through this decree and after obtaining voters consent through the plebiscite, President Marcos seized emergency powers giving him full control of the Philippines' military and the authority to suppress and abolish the [[freedom of speech]], the [[freedom of the press]], and many other [[civil liberties]]. President Marcos also dissolved the [[Philippine Congress]] and shut down media establishments critical of the Marcos Administration.<ref name="Celoza"/>

President Marcos also ordered the immediate arrest of his political opponents and critics. Among those arrested were Senate President [[Jovito Salonga]], Senator [[Jose Diokno]], and Senator [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], whom Marcos linked with the [[Communists]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Ninoy linked up with the Left to aid presidential ambition|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/198820/news/specialreports/ninoy-networked-with-everyone-reds-included|work=GMA News|date=August 18, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207014355/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/198820/news/specialreports/ninoy-networked-with-everyone-reds-included|archive-date=February 7, 2015}}</ref> and the man who was groomed by the opposition to succeed President Marcos after the 1973 elections.<ref name="Celoza"/> On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with his two co-accused, [[New People's Army|NPA]] leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Max Soliven recalls Ninoy Aquino: Unbroken|url=http://asianjournalusa.com/max-soliven-recalls-ninoy-aquino-unbroken-p5828-87.htm|access-date=August 30, 2013|newspaper=Philippines Star|date=October 10, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016015855/http://asianjournalusa.com/max-soliven-recalls-ninoy-aquino-unbroken-p5828-87.htm|archive-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref>

A [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], which had been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth-era [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and allowing President Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973. The constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the [[1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|Philippine constitutional plebiscite]].

In 1978, while still in prison, Aquino founded his [[political party]], ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (abbreviated "LABAN"; English: ''People's Power'') to run for office in the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (Parliament). All LABAN candidates lost, including Ninoy himself.

With practically all of his political opponents were arrested and in exile, President Marcos' pre-emptive declaration of martial law in 1972 and the [[1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|ratification]] of his new constitution by more than 95% of voters enabled Marcos to effectively legitimize his government and hold on to power for another 14 years beyond his first two terms as president. In a [[Cold War]] context, Marcos retained the support of the United States through Marcos' promise to stamp out communism in the Philippines and by assuring the United States of its continued use of military and naval bases in the Philippines.<ref name="Celoza">{{Citation|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: the political economy of authoritarianism |first=Albert |last=Celoza |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1997}}</ref>

===Assassination of Ninoy Aquino===
{{main|Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.}}
Despite warnings from the military and First Lady Imelda R. Marcos, Ninoy Aquino was determined to return to the Philippines. Asked what he thought of the death threats, Ninoy Aquino responded, "The Filipino is worth dying for."<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquino, Corazon Cojuangco • The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation • Honoring greatness of spirit and transformative leadership in Asia|url=http://rmaward.asia/awardees/aquino-corazon-cojuangco/|website=rmaward.asia|url-status=dead |

On August 21, 1983, after a three-year exile in the [[United States]], Aquino was [[assassination|assassinated]] by [[Rolando Galman]] as he disembarked from a [[Taiwan]]ese commercial flight at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]] (which was later renamed in Aquino's honor).<ref>{{Citation |editor-last1=Javate-De Dios |editor-first1=Aurora |editor-first2=Petronilo |editor-last2=Bn Daroy |editor-first3=Lorna |editor-last3=Kalaw-Tirol |title=Dictatorship and Revolution: Roots of People's Power |publisher=Conspectus Foundation Incorporated |date=1988 |oclc=19609244 |page=132 |isbn=9789919108014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz1yAAAAMAAJ&q=Dictatorship+and+Revolution%3A+Roots+of+People%27s+Power |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017232007/https://books.google.com/books?ei=_6RFU_T8JYrIyAHwhIDgBA&id=Nz1yAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dictatorship+and+Revolution%3A+Roots+of+People%27s+Power |archive-date=October 17, 2015  }}.</ref> His assassination shocked and outraged many Filipinos, most of whom had lost confidence in the Marcos administration.

The assassination of Ninoy Aquino caused the Philippines economy to deteriorate even further, and the government plunged further into debt. By the end of 1983, the Philippines was in an economic recession, with the economy contracting by 6.8%.<ref>

In 1984, Marcos appointed a commission, led by Chief Justice [[Enrique Fernando]], to launch an investigation into Aquino's assassination. Despite the commission's conclusions, Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], the Archbishop of Manila, declined an offer to join the commission and rejected the government's views on the assassination.

The growing opposition movement encouraged Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, to run for the presidency. United Opposition (UNIDO) leader, [[Salvador Laurel]], who earlier filed his candidacy as an official UNIDO candidate for the presidency, gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged by Cory after the election. [[Salvador Laurel]] eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party.

This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results, culminating in the walkout of 30 COMELEC computer technicians to protest the deliberate manipulation of the official election results to favor Ferdinand Marcos.  The walkout was considered as one of the early "sparks" of the People Power Revolution. The walkout also served as an affirmation to allegations of vote-buying, fraud, and tampering of election results by the KBL.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pcij.org/i-report/edsa20/william-torres.html| title = iReport EDSA 20th Anniversary Special Issue &#124; Dr. William Castro| access-date = January 16, 2008| publisher = Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, February 2006| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120161749/http://pcij.org/i-report/edsa20/william-torres.html| archive-date = January 20, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections-2013/22582-1986-comelec-walkout-not-about-cory-or-marcos | title = 1986 Comelec walkout not about Cory or Marcos | access-date = January 12, 2016 |work=Rappler| first = Reynaldo | last = Santos, Jr. | date = February 26, 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160228042402/http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections-2013/22582-1986-comelec-walkout-not-about-cory-or-marcos | archive-date = February 28, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Because of reports of alleged fraud, the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) through Cardinal [[Ricardo Vidal]] issued a statement condemning the elections. The United States Senate also passed a resolution stating the same condemnation.<ref name="NSM"/> [[US president]] [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a statement calling the fraud reports as "disturbing" but he said that there was fraud "on both sides" of the Philippine election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/02/26/in-crucial-call-laxalt-told-marcos-cut-cleanly/9329b85d-f7b0-4021-884d-5e5e659a4cb0/|title=In Crucial Call, Laxalt Told Marcos: 'Cut Cleanly'|last1=Hoffman|first1=David|last2=Cannon|first2=Lou|last3=Coleman|first3=Milton|last4=Dewar|first4=Helen|last5=Goshko|first5=John M.|last6=Oberdorfer|first6=Don|last7=W|first7=George C.|work=The Washington Post|date=February 26, 1986|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822084009/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/02/26/in-crucial-call-laxalt-told-marcos-cut-cleanly/9329b85d-f7b0-4021-884d-5e5e659a4cb0/|archive-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v86/ai_4188363| title = PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT, FEB. 11, 1986| access-date = December 3, 2007| publisher = US Department of State Bulletin, April 1986| year=1986}}</ref> In response to the protests, COMELEC claimed that Marcos with 53 percent won over Aquino.

On February 15, Marcos was proclaimed by COMELEC and Batasang Pambansa as the winner amidst the controversy. All 50 opposition members of the Parliament walked out in protest.  The Filipino people repudiated the results, asserting that Aquino was the real victor. Both "winners" took their oath of office in two different places, with Aquino gaining greater mass support. Aquino also called for coordinated strikes and mass boycott of the media and businesses owned by Marcos' cronies. As a result, the crony banks, corporations, and media were hit hard, and their shares in the stock market plummeted to record levels.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

===Vidal's declaration===
Cardinal Vidal, after the result of the snap election, issued a declaration in lieu of the Philippine Church hierarchy stating that when "a government does not of itself freely correct the evil it has inflicted on the people then it is our serious moral obligation as a people to make it do so." The declaration also asked "every loyal member of the Church, every community of the faithful, to form their judgment about the February 7 polls" and told all the Filipinos, "Now is the time to speak up.  Now is the time to repair the wrong.  The wrong was systematically organized.  So must its correction be.  But as in the election itself, that depends fully on the people; on what they are willing and ready to do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcponline.net/documents/1980s/1986-post_election.html|title=POST-ELECTION STATEMENT|access-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201056/http://www.cbcponline.net/documents/1980s/1986-post_election.html|archive-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Aborted military coup===
Appalled by the bold and apparent election irregularities, the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] set into motion a coup attempt against Marcos. The initial plan was for a team to assault Malacañan Palace and arrest Ferdinand Marcos. Other military units would take over key strategic facilities, such as the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|airport]], military bases,  the GHQAFP in [[Camp Aguinaldo]], and major highway junctions to restrict counteroffensive by Marcos-loyal troops.

However, after Marcos learned about the plot, he ordered their leaders' arrest,<ref>{{Citation |last=West |first=Lois A. |publication-date=1997
|title=Militant Labor in the Philippines |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-491-8 |pages=19–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcaOhzm8gAQC&q=Philippine+People+power+revolution&pg=PA20 |access-date= December 3, 2007 |year=1997}}.</ref> and presented to the international and local press some of the captured plotters, Maj. Saulito Aromin and Maj. Edgardo Doromal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayOne.html|title=Day One (EDSA: The Original People Power Revolution by Angela Stuart-Santiago)|access-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807094913/http://www.stuartxchange.org/DayOne.html|archive-date=August 7, 2015}}</ref>

Threatened with their impending imprisonment, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and his fellow coup plotters decided to ask for help from then-AFP Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen [[Fidel Ramos]], who was also the chief of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (now the Philippine National Police). Ramos agreed to resign from his position and support the plotters. Enrile also contacted the highly influential Cardinal Archbishop of Manila [[Jaime Sin]] for his support.

At about 6:30&nbsp;p.m. on February 22, Enrile and Ramos held a press conference at the Ministry of National Defense building in Camp Aguinaldo, where they announced that they had resigned from their positions in Marcos' cabinet and were withdrawing support from his government. Marcos himself later conducted a news conference calling on Enrile and Ramos to surrender, urging them to "stop this stupidity".<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness">{{Citation |last1=Paul Sagmayao |first1=Mercado |first2=Francisco S.|last2=Tatad |title=People Power: The Philippine Revolution of 1986: An Eyewitness History |publisher=The James B.

===Sin's appeal===
After Cardinal Vidal's condemnation of the snap election's fraudulent result, a message was aired over [[Radio Veritas]] at around 9 p.m., Cardinal Sin exhorted Filipinos in the capital to aid rebel leaders by going to the section of EDSA between [[Camp Crame]] and [[Camp Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] and giving emotional support, food and other supplies. For many, this seemed an unwise decision since civilians would not stand a chance against a dispersal by government troops. Many people, especially priests and nuns, still trooped to EDSA.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />
{{cquote|''My Dear People, I wish you to pray, because it's only through prayer that we may solve this problem. This is Cardinal Sin speaking to the people, especially in Metro Manila. I am indeed concerned about the situation of Minister Enrile and General Ramos, I am calling our people to support our two good friends at the camp. If any of you could be around at Camp Aguinaldo to show your solidarity and your support in this very crucial period, when our two good friends have shown their idealism, I would be very happy if you support them now. I would only wish that violence and bloodshed be avoided. Let us pray to our blessed lady to help us in order that we can solve this problem peacefully|author=[[Jaime Cardinal Sin]]}}
Radio Veritas played a critical role during the mass uprising. Former [[University of the Philippines]] president Francisco Nemenzo stated that: "''Without Radio Veritas, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to mobilize millions of people in a matter of hours.''" Similarly, a certain account in the event said that: "''Radio Veritas, in fact, was our umbilical cord to whatever else was going on''."<ref name="McCargo">{{Citation |last=McCargo |first=Duncan |publication-date=2003|title=Media and Politics in Pacific Asia |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-23375-0 |page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuGJ575iLLAC&q=Radio+Veritas+1986+Philippine+revolution&pg=PA20 |access-date= December 3, 2007 |year=2003}}</ref>

===Rising mass support===
At dawn, Sunday, government troops arrived to knock down the main 50-killowatt transmitter of Radio Veritas, cutting off broadcasts to people in the provinces. The station switched to a 10-kilowatt standby transmitter with a limited range of broadcast.<ref name="McCargo"/> The station was targeted because it had proven to be a valuable communications tool for the people supporting the rebels, keeping them informed of government troop movements and relaying requests for food, medicine, and supplies.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

Still, people came to EDSA until it swelled to hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians. The mood in the street was very festive, with many bringing whole families. Performers entertained the crowds, nuns and priests led prayer vigils, and people set up barricades and makeshift sandbags, trees, and vehicles in several places along EDSA and intersecting streets such as Santolan and Ortigas Avenue. Everywhere, people listened to Radio Veritas on their radios. A photo taken by Pete Reyes of Srs. Porferia Ocariza and Teresita Burias leading the rosary in front of soldiers has since become an iconic picture of the revolution.<ref>{{cite news|title=Be a Keeper of the EDSA Flame|url=https://www.inquirer.net/edsa/contest-winners|access-date=November 8, 2020|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|Inquirer.net]]|publisher=INQUIRER.net|date=2016}}</ref> Several groups sang ''[[Bayan Ko]]'' (My Homeland),<ref>{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Robert H.|publication-date=2002|title=The Idea of Freedom in Asia and Africa|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4514-7|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfbSlkGP8TEC&q=Bayan+Ko+in+1986+Philippine+revolution&pg=PA210|access-date=December 3, 2007|year=2002}}.</ref> which, since 1980, had become a patriotic anthem of the opposition.

'laban' is the Filipino word for 'fight', but also the abbreviation of [[Lakas ng Bayan]], Ninoy Aquino's party.

After lunch on February 23, Enrile and Ramos decided to consolidate their positions. Enrile crossed EDSA from [[Camp Aguinaldo]] to [[Camp Crame]] amidst cheers from the crowd.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

In the mid-afternoon, [[Radio Veritas]] relayed reports of [[Philippine Marine Corps|Marines]] massing near the camps in the east and [[LVT-5]] tanks approaching from the north and south. A contingent of Marines with tanks and armored vans, led by Brigadier General Artemio Tadiar, was stopped along Ortigas Avenue, about two kilometers from the camps, by tens of thousands of people.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lizano |first=Lolita |publication-date=1988|title=Flower in a Gun Barrel: The Untold Story of the Edsa Revolution |publisher= L.R.

In the end, the troops retreated with no shots fired.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

By evening, the standby transmitter of Radio Veritas failed. Shortly after midnight, the staff was able to go to another station to begin broadcasting from a secret location under the moniker [[DZRJ-AM|"Radyo Bandido"]] (Outlaw Radio, which is now known as [[DZRJ-AM]]). June Keithley, with her husband [[Angelo Castro, Jr.]], was the radio broadcaster who continued Radio Veritas' program throughout the night and in the remaining days.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness"/>

===More military defections===
At dawn on Monday, February 24, the first serious encounter with government troops occurred. Marines marching from Libis, in the east, lobbed tear gas at the demonstrators, who quickly dispersed. Some 3,000 Marines then entered and held the east side of Camp Aguinaldo.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

Later, helicopters manned by the 15th Strike Wing of the [[Philippine Air Force]], led by Colonel Antonio Sotelo, were ordered from Sangley Point in Cavite (South of Manila) to head to Camp Crame.<ref name="Crisostomo">{{Citation |last=Crisostomo |first=Isabelo T. |publication-date=1987

A [[Bell 214]] helicopter piloted by Major Deo Cruz of the 205th Helicopter Wing and [[Sikorsky S-76]] gunships piloted by Colonel Charles Hotchkiss of the 20th Air Commando Squadron joined the rebel squadron earlier in the air. The presence of the helicopters boosted the morale of Enrile and Ramos who had been continually encouraging their fellow soldiers to join the opposition movement.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" /> In the afternoon, Aquino arrived at the base where Enrile, Ramos, RAM officers and a throng were waiting.<ref name="Crisostomo"/>

===The capture of MBS-4===
At around that time, [[June Keithley]] received reports that Marcos had left Malacañang Palace and broadcast this to the people at EDSA. The crowd celebrated and even Ramos and Enrile came out from Crame to appear to the crowds. The jubilation was however short-lived as Marcos later appeared on television on the government-controlled [[People's Television Network|MBS-4]],<ref>{{Citation |last=Maramba |first=Asuncion David |publication-date=1987
|title=On the Scene: The Philippine Press Coverage of the 1986 Revolution |publisher=Solar publishing Corp. |isbn= 978-971-17-0628-9|page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QAeAAAAMAAJ&q=Channel+4 |access-date= December 3, 2007 |year=1987}}.</ref> (using the foreclosed [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] facilities, transmitter, and compound in [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|Broadcast Plaza]]) declaring that he would not step down. It was thereafter speculated that the false report was a calculated move against Marcos to encourage more defections.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

During this broadcast, MBS-4 suddenly went off the air. A contingent of rebels, under Colonel Mariano Santiago, had captured the station.  MBS-4 was put back on the air shortly after noon, with [[Orly Punzalan]] announcing on live television, "Channel 4 is on the air again to serve the people." By this time, the crowds at EDSA had swollen to over a million. (Some estimates placed them at two million.)<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

This broadcast was considered the "return" of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] on air because this was the time when former employees of the network were inside the complex after 14 years of closure since Marcos took it over during the Martial Law of 1972. [[DZRJ-AM|"Radyo Bandido"]] ended broadcasting that afternoon, while Radio Veritas resumed transmissions, this time from the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|Broadcast Plaza]]'s radio studios.

In the late afternoon, rebel helicopters attacked [[Villamor Airbase]], destroying presidential air assets. Another helicopter went to [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang]], fired a rocket, and caused minor damage. Later, most of the officers who had graduated from the [[Philippine Military Academy]] (PMA) defected. The majority of the Armed Forces had already changed sides.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

===Marcos orders not to shoot===
{{listen| filename=Marcos_-_ver.ogg|title="My order is not to attack" | description=[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and General [[Fabian Ver]] during a press conference in Malacañang Palace. | format= [[Ogg]]}}

Prior dialogues to stop the revolution had not succeeded with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which was led by General Fabian Ver. AFP was ready to mount an airstrike on the day but Marcos ordered them to halt.

The actual dialogue on TV between Marcos and then AFP Chief of Staff General Fabian Ver went as follows:

{{quote|Fabian Ver: The Ambush there is aiming to mount there in the top. Very quickly, you must immediately leave to conquer them, immediately, Mr. President.<br /> 
Ferdinand Marcos: Just wait, come here.<br />
Ver: Please, Your Honor, so we can immediately strike them. We have to immobilize the helicopters that they've got. We have two fighter planes flying now to strike at any time, sir.<br />
Marcos: My order is not to attack. No, no, no! Hold on. My order is not to attack.<br />
Ver: They are massing civilians near our troops and we cannot keep on withdrawing. You asked me to withdraw yesterday–<br />
Marcos (interrupting): Uh yes, but ah... My order is to disperse without shooting them.<br />
Ver: We cannot withdraw all the time...<br /> 
Marcos: No! No! No! Hold on! You disperse the crowd without shooting them.}}

===Two inaugurations===
[[File:Corazon Aquino inauguration.jpg|thumb|300px|Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as the 11th president of the Philippines on February 25, 1986 at Sampaguita Hall (Now Kalayaan Hall).]]
On the morning of Tuesday, February 25, at around 7 a.m., a minor clash occurred between loyal government troops and the reformists. Snipers stationed atop the crony-owned [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] transmitter in Panay Avenue, near MBS-4, began shooting at the reformists. Many rebel soldiers surged to the station,<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" /> and a rebel S-76 helicopter later shot the snipers at the broadcast tower. The troops later left after a V-150 was blocked by the crowd assembled.

Later in the morning, [[Corazon Aquino]] was inaugurated as President of the Philippines in a simple ceremony at [[Club Filipino]]<ref>{{Citation |last=Crisostomo |first=Isabelo T. |title=Cory, Profile of a President: The Historic Rise to Power of Corazon |publisher= Branden Books|isbn= 978-0-8283-1913-3|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iW_ddLowBYkC&q=Cory+Aquino+in+Club+Filipino&pg=PA257 |access-date= December 3, 2007 |date=April 1, 1987}}.</ref> in Greenhills, about a kilometer from Camp Crame. She was sworn in as President by Senior Associate Justice [[Claudio Teehankee]], and Laurel as Vice-President by Justice Vicente Abad Santos. The Bible on which Aquino swore her oath was held by her mother-in-law Aurora Aquino, the mother of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]]. Attending the ceremonies were Ramos, who was then promoted to General, Enrile, and many politicians.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

Outside Club Filipino, all the way to EDSA, hundreds of people cheered and celebrated. ''[[Bayan Ko]]'' (''My Country'', a popular folk song and the unofficial National Anthem of protest) was sung after Aquino's oath-taking. Many people wore yellow, the color of Aquino's presidential campaign.

An hour later, Marcos held the inauguration at [[Malacañang Palace]]. Loyalist civilians attended the ceremony, shouting "''Marcos, Marcos, Marcos pa rin!'' (Marcos, Marcos, still Marcos!)". On the Palace balcony, Marcos took the Oath of Office, aired on [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]] and [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] (RPN-9 was going off-the-air during the broadcast of the inauguration, as its transmitter was captured by reformist soldiers).<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" /> None of the invited foreign dignitaries attended the ceremony, for security reasons.

<blockquote>
Because of you, I became happy<br />
Loving I shall offer you<br />
If it is true I shall be enslaved by you<br />
All of this because of you.<ref name="Ellison"/>
</blockquote>

The broadcast of the event was interrupted as rebel troops successfully captured the other stations.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

By this time, hundreds of people had amassed at the barricades along [[Mendiola]], only a hundred meters away from Malacañang. They were prevented from storming the Palace by loyal government troops securing the area. The angry demonstrators were pacified by priests who warned them not to be violent.<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness" />

===Marcos' departure===
At 3:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]) on Monday, President Marcos phoned [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Paul Laxalt]],<ref name="Ellison"/> asking for advice from the [[White House]]. Laxalt advised him to "cut and cut clean",<ref>{{Cite book|title = Reagan: the life|last = Brands|first = H W|publisher = Doubleday|year = 2015|isbn = 9780385536400|location = New York|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wHd5BAAAQBAJ&q=laxalt+marcos+cut+and+cut+clean&pg=PT617|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105160957/https://books.google.com/books?id=wHd5BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT617&vq=laxalt%20marcos%20cut%20and%20cut%20clean&dq=laxalt%20marcos%20cut%20and%20cut%20clean&pg=PT617#v=onepage&q=laxalt%20marcos%20cut%20and%20cut%20clean&f=false|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause. In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Minister Enrile, asking for safe passage for him, his family, and close allies such as General Ver.

At midnight [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]], the Marcos family boarded a [[United States Air Force]] HH-3E Rescue [[helicopter]]<ref name="Halperin">{{Citation|last=Halperin|first=Jonathan J.|title=The Other Side: How Soviets and Americans Perceive Each Other|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1so7Od--csC&q=Marcos+departure&pg=PA63|page=63|publication-date=1987|year=1987|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-687-9|access-date=December 3, 2007}}.</ref> and flew to [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]] 83 kilometers north of Manila.

At Clark Air Base, Marcos asked to spend a couple of days with his family in Ilocos Norte, his native province. Aquino vetoed the request. President Reagan privately derided Cory Aquino for denying Marcos a last look at his home province.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/magazine/reagan-and-the-philippines-setting-marcos-adrift.html?pagewanted=all |title=REAGAN AND THE PHILIPPINES: Setting Marcos Adrift |access-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111001104/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/magazine/reagan-and-the-philippines-setting-marcos-adrift.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=January 11, 2017  |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 19, 1989 |last1=Karnow |first1=Stanley }}</ref>

The deposed First Family and their servants then rode US Air Force [[DC9|DC-9 Medivac]] and [[C-141 Starlifter|C-141B]] planes to [[Andersen Air Force Base]] in the north of the United States territory of [[Guam]], then flying to Hickam Air Force Base in [[Hawaii]] where Marcos finally arrived on February 26. The United States Government documented that they entered the United States with millions of dollars in jewelry, gold, stocks, and cash.<ref name="Gandhi"/><ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness"/>

When news of the Marcos family's departure reached civilians, many rejoiced and danced in the streets. Over at [[Mendiola]], the demonstrators stormed the Palace, which was closed to ordinary people for around a decade. Despite looting by some angry protesters, the majority wandered about inside through rooms where national history was shaped, looking at objects extravagant and mundane that the Marcos clan and its court had abandoned in their flight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In other countries, people also rejoiced and congratulated Filipinos they knew. [[CBS]] anchorman [[Bob Simon]] reported: "We Americans like to think we taught the Filipinos democracy. Well, tonight they are teaching the world."<ref name="peoplepower_eyewitness"/>

Some authors say that Marcos prevented civil war similar to the [[Syrian Civil War]] by refusing to use guns notwithstanding the insistence of his top general, and by agreeing to step down during the EDSA revolution.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Manila Times]]|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/level-duterte-drop-scourge-syrian-civil-war/291350/ |title=Level up on Duterte or drop into the scourge of the Syrian civil war |access-date=January 10, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112181957/http://www.manilatimes.net/level-duterte-drop-scourge-syrian-civil-war/291350/ |archive-date=January 12, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thestandard.com.ph/opinion/columns/hail-to-the-chair-by-victor-avecilla/226306/why-the-reds-hate-marcos-20170110.html |title=Why the Reds hate Marcos - Manila Standard |access-date=February 24, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112181419/http://thestandard.com.ph/opinion/columns/hail-to-the-chair-by-victor-avecilla/226306/why-the-reds-hate-marcos-20170110.html |archive-date=January 12, 2017  }}</ref> The White House said, "By leaving the Philippines at a critical juncture in his nation's history, Mr. Marcos permitted the peaceful transition to popular, democratic rule."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/29/obituaries/ferdinand-marcos-ousted-leader-of-philippines-dies-at-72-in-exile.html |title=Ferdinand Marcos, Ousted Leader of Philippines, Dies at 72 in Exile |access-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112181330/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/29/obituaries/ferdinand-marcos-ousted-leader-of-philippines-dies-at-72-in-exile.html |archive-date=January 12, 2017  |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 29, 1989 |last1=Gross |first1=Jane }}</ref>

==Aftermath==

{{wikisource|Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)|Proclamation № 3: Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)}}

Immediately after her accession, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, a [[provisional constitution]] which established a [[Revolutionary government in the Philippines|revolutionary government]]. The edict promulgated the 1986 Freedom Constitution, which retained or superseded various provisions of the 1973 Constitution that were in force up to that point. This allowed Aquino to wield both executive and legislative powers; among her first acts was to unilaterally abolish the [[Batasang Pambansa]] (the unicameral legislature [[1984 Philippine parliamentary election|duly elected in 1984]]), pending a plebiscite for a more permanent Constitution and the establishment of a new Congress by 1987.<ref>{{cite book |author=Joaquin G. Bernas |title=The Intent of the 1986 Constitution Writers|publisher=Rex Book Store|location=Manila, Philippines|year=1995|pages=2–4 |author-link=Joaquin G. Bernas}}</ref>

The revolution had an effect on [[democratization]] movements in such countries as [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]]; other effects include the restoration of the freedom of the press, abolition of repressive laws enforced by the previous regime, the adoption of the [[1987 Constitution]], and the subordination of the military to civilian rule, despite several coup attempts during Aquino's rule.<ref name="aftermath">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12567320 |title=People Power at 25: Long road to Philippine democracy |first=Kate |last=McGeown |work=BBC.co.uk |date=February 25, 2011 |access-date=February 25, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226073508/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12567320 |archive-date=February 26, 2011  }}</ref>

Rampant corruption during the term of President [[Joseph Estrada]] led to the similar [[2001 EDSA Revolution]] leading to his resignation from the presidency.

In 2003, the ''Radio Broadcast of the Philippine People Power Revolution'' was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]], the official documentary heritage list of the [[United Nations]]' educational and scientific body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/radio-broadcast-of-the-philippine-people-power-revolution/#c188230|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824190648/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/radio-broadcast-of-the-philippine-people-power-revolution/|url-status=dead|title=Radio Broadcast of the Philippine People Power Revolution &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|archive-date=August 24, 2015|website=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref>
