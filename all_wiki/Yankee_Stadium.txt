'''Yankee Stadium''' is a [[baseball park]] located in [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]], [[the Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York City]]. It is the home field for the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), as well as being the host stadium for the annual [[Pinstripe Bowl]] game. The $2.3 billion stadium, built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies,<ref name="fieldofschemes.com" /> replaced the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|original Yankee Stadium]] in 2009. It is located one block north of the original, on the {{convert|24|acre|adj=on}} former site of [[Macombs Dam Park]]; the {{convert|8|acre|adj=on}} site of the original stadium is now a public park called [[Heritage Field]].

The stadium incorporates replicas of some design elements from the original Yankee Stadium, and like its predecessor, it has hosted additional events, including college football games, soccer matches, two outdoor NHL games, and concerts. Although Yankee Stadium's construction began in August 2006, the project spanned many years and faced many controversies, including the high public cost and the loss of public parkland. The $1.5 billion price tag makes the new Yankee Stadium [[List of most expensive stadiums|one of the most expensive stadiums ever built]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2009/01/14/1987/nyc-baseball-stadium-subsidies-do-i-hear-1-8b/|title=NYC baseball stadium subsidies: Do I hear $1.8B?|work=Field of Schemes|accessdate=May 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321165155/http://www.fieldofschemes.com/2009/01/14/1987/nyc-baseball-stadium-subsidies-do-i-hear-1-8b/|archive-date=March 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==

===Planning===
New York Yankees owner [[George Steinbrenner]] began campaigning for a new stadium in the early 1980s, just a few years after the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened. Steinbrenner at the time was reportedly considering a move to the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor [[Thomas Kean]] in 1984 authorized the use of land for a new baseball stadium in the Meadowlands, but the state legislature did not provide financing for the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |title=Controlled Pitch |first=Iver |last=Peterson |date=September 16, 1995 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/16/nyregion/controlled-pitch.html }}</ref> In a statewide referendum in 1987, New Jersey taxpayers rejected $185 million in public financing for a baseball stadium for the Yankees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yankees Say They Would Have Left Bronx if Pushed |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |date=October 24, 2008 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/sports/baseball/25yankees.html }}</ref> Despite the rejection from New Jersey, Steinbrenner frequently used a threatened move there as leverage in negotiations with New York City.

In 1988, Mayor [[Ed Koch]] agreed to have city taxpayers spend $90 million on a second renovation of Yankee Stadium that included luxury boxes and restaurants inside the stadium and parking garages and traffic improvements outside. Steinbrenner agreed in principle, but then backed out of the deal. In 1993, Mayor [[David Dinkins]] expanded on Koch's proposal by offering his Bronx Center vision for the neighborhood, including new housing, a new courthouse, and relocating the Police Academy nearby.<ref>{{cite news |title=Let Him Walk : Why George Steinbrenner should just take his ball and go play somewhere else—and why he probably won't |first=Eric |last=Pooley |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=February 13, 1995 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuMCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82 }}</ref>

In 1993, New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] proposed using the [[West Side Yard]], a {{convert|30|acre|adj=on}} rail yard along the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] and owned by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], as the location for a new stadium for the Yankees. However, Cuomo lost his re-election bid a few months later. By 1995, Steinbrenner had rejected 13 proposals to keep the Yankees in the Bronx.<ref>{{cite news |title=13 Stadium Renovation Plans Later, Yankees Are Still Dissatisfied |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |date=March 9, 1995 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/nyregion/13-stadium-renovation-plans-later-yankees-are-still-dissatisfied.html }}</ref>

In 1998, Bronx [[Borough President]] [[Fernando Ferrer]] proposed spending $600 million in public money to add dozens of luxury boxes to the stadium, to improve highway and public transportation access, and to create a Yankee Village, with shops, restaurants, and a museum. Steinbrenner rejected this as well. That same year, Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] unveiled a plan to relocate the Yankees to the [[West Side Yard]] for a [[West Side Stadium|$1 billion stadium]]. However, with most of the funding coming from taxpayers, Giuliani tabled the proposal, fearing rejection in a citywide referendum. The West Side Stadium plan resurfaced in December 2001, and by January 2002, months after the [[September 11 attacks]], Giuliani announced "tentative agreements" for both the [[New York Yankees]] and [[New York Mets]] to build new stadiums. He estimated that both stadiums would cost $2 billion, with city and state taxpayers contributing $1.2 billion.<ref name="bballeditorial">{{cite news |title=Bonus Season for Baseball|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/17/opinion/bonus-season-for-baseball.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 17, 2002|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

[[Michael Bloomberg]], who succeeded Giuliani as mayor in 2002, called the former mayor's agreements "[[corporate welfare]]" and exercised the [[escape clause]] in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets. Bloomberg said that Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal which loosened the teams' leases with the city and would allow the Yankees and Mets to leave the city on 60 days' notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement. At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Bloomberg's blueprint for the stadium was unveiled in 2004, at the same time as the plan for the Mets' new stadium, [[Citi Field]]. The final cost for the two stadiums was more than $3.1 billion; taxpayer subsidies accounted for $1.8 billion.<ref name="fieldofschemes.com"/>

[[Groundbreaking]] ceremonies for the stadium took place on August 16, 2006, the 58th anniversary of [[Babe Ruth]]'s death, with Steinbrenner, Bloomberg, and then-[[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] among the notables donning Yankees hard hats and wielding ceremonial shovels to mark the occasion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yankees break ground on new $1 billion home|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2551175&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=August 16, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New Yankee Stadium|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/new_stadium.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=August 16, 2006}}</ref> The Yankees continued to play in the previous Yankee Stadium during the 2007 and 2008 seasons while their new home stadium was built across the street. The community was left without parkland for five years.

During construction of the new stadium, a construction worker and avid [[Red Sox Nation|Boston Red Sox fan]] buried a replica jersey of Red Sox player [[David Ortiz]] underneath the visitors' dugout with the objective of placing a "[[curse|hex]]" on the Yankees, much like the "[[Curse of the Bambino]]" that had allegedly plagued the Red Sox long after trading Ruth to the Yankees. After the worker was exposed by co-workers, he was forced to help exhume the jersey.<ref name="ortizjersey">{{cite news |title=Yankees Dig Deep to Rid New Stadium of Curse|first=David|last=Lengel|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/04/17/yankees_dig_deep_to_rid_new_st.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> The Yankees organization then donated the retrieved jersey to the [[Jimmy Fund]], a charity started in 1948 by the Red Sox' [[National League]] rivals, the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], but long championed by the Red Sox and particularly associated with [[Ted Williams]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jimmy Fund Auctions Buried Red Sox Jersey On eBay|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://wbztv.com/local/david.ortiz.jersey.2.701441.html|work=[[WBZ-TV|WBZ]]|location=Boston|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=July 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427012730/http://wbztv.com/local/david.ortiz.jersey.2.701441.html|archive-date=April 27, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Jimmy Fund|url=http://www.jimmyfund.org/abo/history/default.html|publisher=Jimmy Fund|accessdate=July 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615020459/http://www.jimmyfund.org/abo/history/default.html|archive-date=June 15, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The worker has since claimed to have buried a [[2004 American League Championship Series]] program/scorecard, but has not said where he placed it.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yanks May Be Scratching Surface of Sox Items at New Stadium|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/sports/baseball/20scorecard.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 20, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref> These attempts didn't have much effect upon the home team, though: the Yankees went on to win the [[2009 World Series]] at the end of their first [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] season in the new stadium.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Papi Jinx for Yankees|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/attempted_papi_jinx_failed_LN1xRNW8XDW4eXQ7RA5ZDK|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=November 10, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref>

==Features==
The new stadium is meant to evoke elements of the original Yankee Stadium, both in its original 1923 state and its post-renovation state in 1976. The exterior resembles the original look of the 1923 Yankee Stadium. The interior, a modern ballpark with greater space and increased amenities, features a playing field that closely mimics the 1988–2008 dimensions of the old stadium. The current stadium features 4,300 club seats and 68 luxury suites.

===Design and layout===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Front of Yankee Stadium, with Rivera Avenue visible in front, July 2018.jpg|image2=New Yankee Stadium.JPG|width=200|caption2=The Indiana limestone exterior, shown in both pictures, at Gate 6 and 4, mirrors that used on the original Yankee Stadium in 1923}}

The stadium was designed by the architectural firm [[Populous (company)|Populous]]. The exterior was made from 11,000 pieces of [[Indiana limestone]], along with [[granite]] and pre-cast concrete.<ref name="story" /> It features the building's name V-cut and gold-leaf lettered above each gate.<ref name="story" />  The interior of the stadium is adorned with hundreds of photographs capturing the history of the Yankees. The ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' newspaper partnered with the Yankees for the exhibition "The Glory of the Yankees Photo Collection", which was selected from the ''Daily News''{{'}} collection of over 2,000 photographs.<ref name="dailynews">{{cite news |title=Tour the New House – The Daily News on Display|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankeestadium/index.html#dnphotos|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=April 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403080938/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankeestadium/index.html|archivedate=April 3, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sports & The Arts was hired by the Yankees to curate the nearly 1,300 photographs that adorn the building from sources including the ''Daily News'', Getty Images, the Baseball Hall of Fame and Major League Baseball.

The seats are laid out similar to the original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)]]'s stands, with [[grandstand]] seating that stretches beyond the foul poles, as well as bleacher seats beyond the outfield fences. The Field Level and Main Level comprise the lower bowl, with suites on the [[H&R Block]] Level, and the Upper Level and Grandstand Level comprising the upper bowl.<ref name="field" /> Approximately {{frac|2|3}} of the stadium's seating is in the lower bowl, the inverse from the original Yankee Stadium.<ref name="field" /> 50,287 fans can be seated, with a standing room capacity of 52,325.<ref name="Yank compare" /> The new stadium's seating is spaced outward in a bowl, unlike the stacked-tiers design at the old stadium. This design places most fans farther back but lower to the field, by about an average of {{convert|30|ft|m}}. Over 56 suites are located within the ballpark, triple the amount from the previous stadium.<ref name="story" /> Seats are {{convert|19|-|24|in|cm}} wide, up from the previous stadium's {{convert|18|-|22|in|cm|adj=on}} wide seats, while there is {{convert|33|-|39|in|cm}} of leg room, up from {{convert|29.5|in|cm}} of leg room in the previous stadium.<ref name="field" /> Many lower-level seats are cushioned, while all seats are equipped with cupholders.<ref name="field" /> To allow for the extra seating space, the stadium's capacity is reduced by more than 4,000 seats in comparison to the previous stadium.<ref name="field" />

[[File:Yankee-stadium-frieze.jpg|thumb|left|The iconic frieze that lined the roof of the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 is replicated on the current stadium's roof]]

Many design elements of the ballpark's interior are inspired by the original Yankee Stadium. The roof of the new facility features a replica of the [[frieze]] that was a trademark of the previous ballpark.<ref name="field" /> In the original Yankee Stadium, a copper frieze originally lined the roof of the upper deck stands, but it was torn down during the 1974–75 renovations and replicated atop the wall beyond the bleachers.<ref name="field" /> The new stadium replicates the frieze in its original location along the upper deck stands.<ref name="field" /> Made of steel coated with [[zinc]] for [[rust]] protection, it is part of the support system for the [[cantilever]]s holding up the top deck and the [[lighting]] on the roof.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Distinctive Facade Is Recreated at New Yankee Stadium|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/sports/baseball/15facade.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> The wall beyond the bleacher seats is "cut out" to reveal the {{NYCS Jerome}} subway trains as they pass by, like they were in the original facility.

===Opening and public perception===
[[File:Yankee Stadium upper deck 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The stadium, as seen from the upper deck in 2010]]
Although Yankee Stadium has been praised for its amenities, it also has been widely criticized for high ticket prices.<ref name="strikeout">{{cite news |title=New Yankee Stadium Strikes Out With Customers|first=Sarah|last=Green|url=http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/cs/2009/05/new_yankee_stadium_is_customer.html|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref><ref name="nytblog">{{cite news |title=New Home, New Atmosphere|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/new-home-new-atmosphere/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref> Seats within the first eight rows in the lower bowl, called the "Legends Suite", are among the highest-priced tickets in professional sports. Tickets cost $510 on average; the most expensive tickets cost $2,600 each.<ref name="strikeout" /> Legends Suite Seats have been regularly empty, with many ticket holders in this section having given up their tickets, and others remaining unsold, despite most other seats in the ballpark selling out. This has created an embarrassing image on television of the seats behind home plate being almost completely vacant.<ref name="strikeout" /> Consequently, a surplus of tickets for Legends Seats have emerged in the secondary market, and with supply exceeding demand, [[Ticket resale|resale]] prices have dropped. Empty seats in the Legends Suite could even be seen during the 2009 playoffs, including World Series games. Even though all playoff games were sellouts, Legends Suite ticket holders were in the lounges and the restaurant underneath instead of their seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yankees Create No Excitement, and Now Pressure's On|first=Scott|last=Miller|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/12436398|work=[[CBS Sports]]|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Empty Seats at Yankee Stadium Not What They Seem|first=Neil|last=Best|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/empty-seats-at-yankee-stadium-not-what-they-seem-1.1557579|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> Overall, the average ticket price is $63, the highest in baseball.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/33/baseball-valuations-11_New-York-Yankees_334613.html | work=Forbes | title=#1 New York Yankees | date=March 23, 2011}}</ref>

Legends Suite seats are also separate from the other lower bowl seating and are vigorously patrolled by stadium security, with the divider being described as a "concrete moat."<ref name="strikeout" /><ref name="nytblog" /> Fans who do not have tickets within this premium section in the front rows are not allowed in the section. This includes standing behind the dugouts during batting practice and to seek autographs.<ref name="strikeout" /><ref name="nytblog" /> The least expensive seats, the bleachers, initially left many fans disappointed, as the indoor club seating area in center field obstructed the views from bleacher seats on both sides in sections 201 and 239. These severely obstructed sections would ultimately be removed during the 2016–2017 off-season in favor of outdoor bars and patio called Franks Red Hot Terrace in left center and Toyota Terrace in right center. These new areas are complete with standing terraces accessible to all ticket holders, in addition to replacing the seating on top of the center field club with standing terraces, drastically reducing the number of obstructed views from center field in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/enhancements/|title=Yankee Stadium Enhancements|work=New York Yankees|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}</ref>

Late in the stadium's first season, cracks were seen on the concrete ramps of the Stadium. The Yankees are trying to determine whether there was something wrong with the concrete, or the ramps' installation or design. The company involved in inspecting the concrete was indicted on charges that its employees either faked or failed to perform some required tests and falsified the results of others.<ref name="concrete">{{cite news |title=Cracks Emerge in Ramps at New Yankee Stadium|first1=William K.|last1=Rashbaum|first2=Ken|last2=Belson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/nyregion/24stadium.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}</ref>

The stadium has also been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' telecast in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in the old and new stadiums saying that "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait to get back in the dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent.<ref>{{cite news |title=ESPN critiques of new Yankee Stadium keeps building on broadcasts|first=Bob|last=Raissman|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/espn-critiques-new-yankee-stadium-building-article-1.1125302?localLinksEnabled=false|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref> The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the [[2012 American League Division Series|ALDS]] and Games 1 and 2 of the [[2012 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better.

[[File:Yankee Stadium 2012.jpg|thumb|Yankee Stadium in 2012, from the left field upper deck]]

In its first season, Yankee Stadium quickly acquired a reputation as a "bandbox" and a "launching pad" because of the high number of home runs hit at the new ballpark.<ref name="olney">{{cite web |title=New Yankee Stadium on Steroids?|first=Buster|last=Olney|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4080195|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name="matthews">{{cite news|title=Home Runs a Cheap Thrill at Yankee Stadium |first=Wallace |last=Matthews |url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/ny-spwally2112790416may20,0,518613.column |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525150045/http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/ny-spwally2112790416may20,0,518613.column |archivedate=May 25, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="gammons">{{cite news |title=Yankee Stadium: Biggest Joke in Baseball|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05222009/sports/yankees/gammons_rips_new_yankee_stadium_170550.htm|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=May 22, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Trouble at the House that George Built|first=Tim|last=Keown|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=keown/090428|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 28, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ruthian Blasts Now a Common Sight|first=Jeff|last=Roberts|url=http://www.northjersey.com/sports/yankees/45886242.html|publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]]|date=May 23, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bronx Launching Pad Awaits Phils|first=Don|last=McKee|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20090521_Morning_Report__Bronx_launching_pad_awaits_Phils.html|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Through its first 23 games, 87 home runs were hit at the venue, easily besting [[Minute Maid Park|Enron Field]]'s (now called Minute Maid Park) previous record set in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phillies' Ruiz Finishes Yanks in 11th, Takes Lidge Off Hook|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290524110|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2009}}</ref>  Early in the season, Yankee Stadium was on pace to break [[Coors Field]]'s 1999 single-season record of 303 home runs allowed, and the hometown ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' (using the back-page headline "[[Homer's Odyssey|HOMERS ODYSSEY]]") started publishing a daily graphic comparing each stadium's home run totals through a similar number of games.

[[ESPN]] commentator [[Peter Gammons]] denounced the new facility as "one of the biggest jokes in baseball" during an appearance on ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'', and concluded that "[it] was not a very well-planned ballpark".<ref name="gammons" />  Likewise, Gammons' ESPN colleague [[Buster Olney]] described the stadium as "a veritable wind tunnel"<ref name="olney" /> and likened it to his childhood [[Wiffleball|Wiffle-ball]] park.<ref>{{cite web |title=Too Many Homers to Right?

He suggested that [[Babe Ruth]] could have potentially hit 120 or more homers if he played in the new Stadium.  For his column, Matthews interviewed former Yankee [[Reggie Jackson]], who termed the park "too small" to contain current player [[Alex Rodriguez]].  Jackson estimated that the park might enable the third baseman to hit 75 home runs in a season.<ref name="matthews" />

A variety of theories have been posited to account for the dramatic increase in home runs at the new Yankee Stadium over the original stadium, foremost among these the sharper angles of the outfield walls<ref name="wall" /> and the speculated presence of a [[wind tunnel]].<ref name="olney" />  During construction of the new ballpark, engineers commissioned a wind study, the results of which indicated there would be no noticeable difference between the two stadiums.<ref name="homers">{{cite news |title=Homer's Odyssey: News Tries to Solve New Yankee Stadium's Quandary|first=Mark|last=Feinsand|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/04/20/2009-04-20_why_are_there_many_home_runs_at_new_yankee_stadium_answer_is_blowing_in_wind.html|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref>  The franchise planned a second study, but Major League rules prohibit a team from making any changes to the playing field until the off-season.<ref name="homers" />

An independent study by the weather service provider [[AccuWeather]] in June 2009 concluded that the shape and height of the right field wall, rather than the wind, is responsible for the proliferation of home runs at the stadium.<ref name="design">{{cite web |title=Study: Design Cause of Stadium Homers|first=Bobbie|last=Dittmeier|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090610&content_id=5247554&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=June 10, 2009|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref>  AccuWeather's analysis found that roughly 20% of the home runs hit at the new ballpark would not have been home runs at the old ballpark due to the gentle curve of its right field corner, and its {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} wall height.<ref name="design" />  Nothing was observed in wind speeds and patterns that would account for the increase.<ref name="design" />

The number of home runs hit at the new stadium slowed significantly as the season progressed,<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Stadium's a Bandbox|first=Steve|last=Sciacco|url=http://www.yankeeanalysts.com/2009/08/the-new-stadiums-a-bandbox-6467|work=Yankee Analysts|date=August 11, 2009|accessdate=March 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404013022/http://www.yankeeanalysts.com/2009/08/the-new-stadiums-a-bandbox-6467|archive-date=April 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> but a new single-season record for most home runs hit at a Yankee home ballpark was nonetheless set in the Yankees' 73rd home game of 2009 when [[Vladimir Guerrero]] of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] hit the 216th home run of the season at the venue, surpassing the previous record of 215 set at the original Yankee Stadium in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guerrero's Homer Sets Yankee Stadium Mark|first=Bryan|last=Hoch|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090914&content_id=6965980&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2009}}</ref> However, the Yankees offense, as in previous years, had employed many home run hitters in 2009.

In 2010, the early rate of home runs were markedly less through May 15, 2010, with 35 home runs hit in 14 games for 2.5 per game (a projection of 205—in 2009, the stadium finished at 2.93 per game for a total of 237). Even though the stadium's home run rate decreased slightly for the 2010 season to 2.73 per game, it was still the highest figure in the majors.<ref name="Hit Tracker Online">{{cite web |title=Ballpark Detail|url=http://www.hittrackeronline.com/stadiums.php|publisher=Hit Tracker Online|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> However, the prolific home run rate of April and May 2009 that drew criticism has not sustained itself over any season thus far, and while through the first two months of the 2011 season the Yankees hit far more homers than any other team in the majors,<ref name="2011 MLB teams sorted by home runs">{{cite web |title=2011 Major League Baseball Season Summary|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2011.shtml#teams_standard_batting::11|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> Yankee Stadium was not the top home run park.<ref name="Hit Tracker Online" />

[[Russell Branyan]], while playing for the [[Seattle Mariners]], was the first player to hit a home run off of the Mohegan Sun Restaurant in center field.

Like its predecessor, the new Yankee Stadium hosted the World Series in its very first season; in the [[2009 World Series]], the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2. It also became the latest stadium to host a World Series-clinching victory by its home team in the venue's first season (after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series at [[Busch Stadium]] in 2006), when, on November 4, 2009, the Yankees won their 27th World Series championship against the Phillies. The Yankees are the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the [[Big Red Machine]] in four straight. On October 6, 2011 [[Detroit Tigers]] in game five of the [[ALDS]] were the first team to eliminate the Yankees at the new Yankee Stadium in the postseason.

===Ice hockey===
The first [[National Hockey League]] event took place on January 26, 2014, between the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] as part of the [[2014 NHL Stadium Series]]. The Rangers also faced off against the [[New York Islanders]] on January 29, 2014, under the deep cold outdoor weather. The Rangers won both games, 7–3 and 2–1 respectively. Both games drew a little more than 50,000 spectators, almost the full capacity of the stadium. Despite playing in both fixtures and traditionally being seen as "NYC's team", the Rangers were officially the away team in both games. This is due to a clause in an agreement between the city and [[Madison Square Garden]]: if either the Rangers or the [[New York Knicks]] "cease playing" home games at the Garden, the venue would lose its tax exemption and be subject to penalties. The Devils and Islanders never played an outdoor game before this series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Jeff Z.|title=At Yankee Stadium, Rangers Will Share Glamour with Rivals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/sports/hockey/at-yankee-stadium-rangers-will-share-glamour-with-rivals.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Boxing===
The promotional tour for the [[Manny Pacquiao]]–[[Miguel Cotto]] [[Manny Pacquiao vs. Miguel Cotto|fight]] began with an event at Yankee Stadium on September 10, 2009.

On June 5, 2010, [[Yuri Foreman]] fought Cotto in the first boxing match in The Bronx since 1976. The fight was referred to as the "[[Miguel Cotto vs. Yuri Foreman|Stadium Slugfest]]". Cotto defeated Foreman with a TKO in the ninth round. Cotto captured the WBA super welterweight title and his fourth world title, before a crowd of 20,272.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yankee Stadium Slugfest: Miguel Cotto Beats Junior Middleweight Champ Yuri Foreman|first1=Simone|last1=Weichselbaum|first2=Rich|last2=Schapiro|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/06/06/2010-06-06_boxers_rock_the_stadium.html|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=June 6, 2010|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref>

===Other events===
The first non-baseball event at the current version of Yankee Stadium took place on the evening of Saturday, April 25, 2009, when Senior Pastor [[Joel Osteen]] of [[Lakewood Church]] held what was dubbed as a "Historic Night of Hope" [[Christianity|Christian]] prayer service.<ref>{{cite journal |title=God's Will in Hard Times|first=David|last=Gibson|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/56161/|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]|date=April 19, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref>

A [[New York University]] graduation ceremony took place on May 13, 2009, with the address being delivered by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] and former New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]].

In 2014, Yankee Stadium became the home of the Double A and Triple A New York City High School [[Public School Athletic League]] Championship. In 2011, it became home to the PSAL Football City Conference Championship.

== Ticket policy ==
Effective 2016, printed [[electronic ticket]]s cannot be used at New York Yankees and New York City FC matches at Yankee Stadium. Only traditional hard-stock tickets, and those issued via a mobile ticketing system, are accepted. The team justified the decision by stating that it was meant to combat fraud associated with printed digital tickets. However, it was also believed that the team was trying to specifically hinder the [[ticket resale]] service [[StubHub]], which competed against an official resale service run by [[TicketMaster]] known as the Yankees Ticket Exchange. The YTE is subject to a price flooring policy, meaning that tickets may only be discounted up to a certain amount. Although StubHub is the official ticket resale partner of Major League Baseball, the Yankees, as well as the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs, had opted out of this agreement.<ref name="wp-printathome">{{cite news|title=Here's why the Yankees are getting rid of print-at-home tickets|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/17/heres-why-the-yankees-are-getting-rid-of-print-at-home-tickets/|accessdate=March 17, 2016|work=Washington Post}}</ref>

Owing to the Yankees' ownership of the team, New York City FC announced on March 11, 2016 that its matches would also be subject to this policy. At the team's March 13, 2016 home opener, although the team stated that they would be phasing in mobile ticketing by introducing additional verification steps for printed tickets before the policy takes full effect in April, reports indicated that the stadium was turning away fans with printed tickets, leading to long queue lines, as well as few attendees inside the stadium itself.<ref name="espn-ticketfarce">{{cite news|title=New York City fans left stranded over ticket farce in Toronto draw|url=http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/story/2829169/new-york-city-fans-slam-ticket-farce-during-toronto-game|accessdate=March 17, 2016|work=ESPN FC|publisher=ESPN}}</ref><ref name="deadspin-stupidticketpolicies">{{cite web|title=Nobody Could Get Into The NYCFC Game At Yankee Stadium Because Of The Yankees' Stupid Ticket Policies|url=http://screamer.deadspin.com/nobody-can-get-into-the-nycfc-game-at-yankee-stadium-be-1764653202|website=Deadspin|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[WFAN]] radio, Yankees COO Lonn Trost explained that the measures were to help combat ticket resale, arguing that the team did not want fans to purchase "premium" seats at bargain prices, because they would be filled by "someone who has never sat in a premium location [before]".<ref name="yahoo-snobby">{{cite web|title=Yankees exec gets snobby when defending new ticket policy|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/yankees-exec-gets-snobby-when-defending-new-ticket-policy-235122871.html|website=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}</ref>

On April 3, 2016 episode of the [[HBO]] news-comedy series ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'', host [[John Oliver]] responded to Trost's remarks, arguing that he was "saying that rich people couldn't bear to sit next to people who aren't as rich." As a further satire of Trost's arguments against discounted resale, Oliver then announced a contest in which viewers were invited to send photos of themselves dressed as if they had "never sat in a premium location before", with winners offered the ability to purchase a pair of Legends Seats from one of the first three home games of the season for 25 cents. The stunt was successful, leading to the presence of several costumed attendees in Legends Seats during the opening games. Team president [[Randy Levine]] responded positively to the stunt, thanking Oliver for having bought tickets to begin with, and remarked that everyone was welcome at Yankee Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yankees glad John Oliver is a paying customer|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/91639/yankees-glad-john-oliver-is-a-paying-customer|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="wsj-johnolivertickets">{{cite web|title=John Oliver Offers Premium Yankees Seats for 25 Cents Apiece on ‘Last Week Tonight’|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/04/04/john-oliver-offers-premium-yankees-seats-for-25-cents-apiece-on-last-week-tonight/|website=Speakeasy (The Wall Street Journal)|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="wp-riffraff">{{cite web|title=John Oliver sent ‘riff-raff’ dressed as unicorns and ‘left sharks’ to the Yankees game|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/04/07/john-oliver-sent-riff-raff-dressed-as-unicorns-and-left-sharks-to-the-yankees-game/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>

On June 27, 2016, the Yankees announced that it had reached a deal with StubHub for it to become its new official ticket resale partner beginning on July 7, 2016, and allow season ticket holders to sell electronic tickets, rather than mail physical tickets to the buyer. The service will still be subject to a price flooring policy, but the team stated that the new arrangement would provide a "superior, more secure, [and] better experience".<ref name="nyt-stubhubyankees">{{cite web|title=StubHub Will Serve as Yankees’ Ticket Reseller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/sports/baseball/yankees-and-stubhub-announce-a-ticket-partnership.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="cnnmoney-yankeessh">{{cite web|last1=Isidore|first1=Chris|title=Yankees reach deal with StubHub|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/27/news/companies/yankees-stubhub-deal/|accessdate=June 28, 2016|work=CNN Money|date=June 27, 2016}}</ref>
