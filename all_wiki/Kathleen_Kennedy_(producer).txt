Kennedy graduated from [[Shasta High School]] in [[Redding, California]], in 1971. She continued her education at [[San Diego State University]] where she majored in telecommunications and film. In her final year, Kennedy gained employment at a local [[San Diego]] TV station, KCST (now [[KNSD]]), taking on various roles including [[camera operator]], [[video editor]], [[floor director]] and finally as KCST news [[production coordinator]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/alumni/Honorary-Degrees/Pages/kathleen-kennedy.aspx|title=Kathleen Kennedy {{!}} CSU|website=www2.calstate.edu|access-date=July 29, 2019}}</ref>

After her employment with KCST, she produced a local [[talk show]] entitled ''You're On'' for the station for four years before moving to [[Los Angeles]].
