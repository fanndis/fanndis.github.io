==Career==

===Media career and advocacy===
In her book ''[[Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World]]'' (2000), Shriver says that she became passionate about [[broadcast journalism]] after being sent to the back of the campaign plane with the [[press corps]] while volunteering for her father's [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 U.S. vice presidential race]], calling these orders "the best thing that ever happened to me". After her journalism career began with [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, she co-anchored ''[[The Early Show|The CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Forrest Sawyer]] from August 1985 until August 1986, co-anchored [[NBC News]]'s ''[[Weekend Today|Sunday Today]]'' from 1987 until 1990. Shriver also served as Saturday anchor 1989 & Sunday 1990 of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''. She was a contributing anchor on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' from 1992 until 2004. In August 2003, Shriver took an unpaid leave of absence from NBC News when her husband became a candidate in the [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|2003 California gubernatorial recall election]].

Following her husband's November 17, 2003, inauguration as the 38th Governor of California, she became the First Lady of California. She then returned to reporting, making two more appearances for ''Dateline NBC''.

On February 3, 2004, Shriver asked to be "relieved of [her] duties at NBC News," citing concerns the network had over the conflict of interest between her role as a journalist and her status as the First Lady of California and her increasing role as an advocate of her husband's administration.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,587213,00.html |title=Terminated |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 4, 2004 |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |author=Susman, Gary |archive-date=June 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627073801/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,587213,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

She appeared as herself in the film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993). She also played a minor role as herself in "Be Prepared", a 2006 episode of the television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' promoting a "Preparedness Plan". On March 23, 2007, Shriver returned to television news as substitute host of panel-discussion talk show ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on CNN with musician [[Sheryl Crow]] and other guests.

Shriver announced that she would not return to the news media after the excessive media coverage of the death of [[Anna Nicole Smith]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-10-24-shriver-NBC_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Maria Shriver won't return to NBC News |date=October 24, 2007 |work=USA Today |accessdate=April 28, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |archive-date=April 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419020730/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-10-24-shriver-NBC_N.htm?csp=34 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Tanner |date=May 16, 2007 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1546390720070516 |title=Shriver says Anna Nicole frenzy ended her TV return |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 28, 2008 |archive-date=January 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107185701/http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1546390720070516 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===First Lady of California===
After Arnold took office, Shriver took on several key initiatives as First Lady, which included raising awareness of the contributions of women to the state, working on practical solutions to end [[Cycle of poverty|cycles of poverty]], and encouraging all Californians to engage in acts of service to their communities. Once Schwarzenegger was elected, Shriver had to cut back on her news reporting to avoid conflicts of interest.<ref name="parade">{{cite news|title=In Step With: Maria Shriver |publisher=Parade Magazine |date=April 10, 2005 |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_04-10-2005/in_step_with_1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605162809/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_04-10-2005/in_step_with_1 |archive-date=June 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Shriver began leading the [[California Governor & First Lady's Conference on Women]] when Schwarzenegger took office in 2003. Under her leadership, The Women's Conference event grew into the nation's premier forum for women and, in 2010, attracted more than 30,000 attendees and 150 world opinion leaders over three full days.

In 2005, Shriver launched her WE Connect Program, which connects working families in need with money-saving programs and support services. WE Connect brings together community organizations and businesses, government agencies and state leaders, congregations and schools as partners in responding to the needs of the millions of individuals and families who are struggling to make ends meet. Through a partnership with ''[[La Opinion]]'', the nation's largest Spanish-language newspaper, WE Connect has developed three editions of a 24-page, full-color, bilingual supplement that has been circulated to over 20 million Californians in need. In December 2009, Shriver, in partnership with The Women's Conference, created the WE Connect–Million Meals Initiative.<ref>[http://www.ebcf.org/press-room/217-one-million-meals-for-families-in-need One Million Meals for Families in Need] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514104431/http://www.ebcf.org/press-room/217-one-million-meals-for-families-in-need |date=May 14, 2010 }}</ref> Through this initiative, The Women's Conference made a donation to The California Association of Food Banks to provide more than one million meals to California families in need.<ref>{{cite web |author=Thadeus Greenson |url=http://www.times-standard.com/ci_13975658 |title=California first family hosts Betty Chinn, encourages outreach |publisher=Times-Standard Online |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506001817/http://www.times-standard.com/ci_13975658 |archive-date=May 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The donation was allocated to the food bank's 44 member organizations who then distributed the food to California families through its more than 5,000 community-based organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&id=7164016 |title=Gov. visits Bay Area in effort to feed the hungry |work=ABC7 San Francisco |accessdate=October 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311150009/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Flocal%2Feast_bay&id=7164016 |archive-date=March 11, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In March 2010, Shriver held a three-day Community Resources Fair in Fresno and Los Angeles through WE Connect.

As First Lady, Shriver worked to promote service and volunteerism. As Honorary Chair of [[CaliforniaVolunteers]], Shriver conceived of and launched the largest statewide volunteer matching network at CaliforniaVolunteers.org. Shriver was instrumental in inspiring Governor Schwarzenegger to establish the nation's first state cabinet-level Department of Service and Volunteering.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/us/26calif.html|title=California Creates Cabinet Post to Manage Volunteers|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|date=February 26, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-date=January 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103003827/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/us/26calif.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She also pioneered and promoted a statewide disaster preparedness program called WE Prepare that encourages and educates Californians to be ready for an emergency or natural disaster. In addition, Shriver established WE Build and WE Garden, a children's playground and community garden-building initiative. “Try growing Tomatoes, I’ beans don’t grow,” she exclaimed.  Through CaliforniaVolunteers, Shriver has built 31 playgrounds with gardens in lower-income communities around the state in partnership with [[KaBOOM!
