The '''2016 United States presidential election ''' was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the [[2016 United States elections|2016 General Election]] in which all 50 states plus the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] participated. [[South Carolina]] voters chose electors to represent them in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] via a popular vote pitting the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s nominee, businessman [[Donald Trump]], and running mate [[Governor of Indiana|Indiana Governor]] [[Mike Pence]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee, former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] and her running mate, Virginia [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tim Kaine]].

On February 20 and 27, 2016, in the [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]], [[South Carolina]] voters expressed their preferences for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party could only vote in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated could choose any one primary in which to vote.

Out of 3.12 million registered voters, 2.10 million voted, a turnout of 67.86%.<ref name="scvotes"/>

Donald Trump continued the Republican tradition in South Carolina, carrying the state with 54.9% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 40.7% of the vote, underperforming Obama by about 4%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/south-carolina |title=South Carolina Results |website=New York Times |accessdate=30 September 2020}}</ref>

Republicans have only lost South Carolina once since the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], in 1976 (by a double-digit percentage margin). 

Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]] since [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]].

=== Political landscape in South Carolina ===
{{main article|Political party strength in South Carolina}}
The Republican party's ticket has carried South Carolina in every election since [[1980 United States presidential election in South Carolina|1980]], and with the exception of [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Walter Mondale|Walter Mondale's]] carrying the state in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], the Republicans have carried the state since [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. In the [[2012 United States presidential election in South Carolina|2012 election]], [[Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign|Mitt Romney]] and [[Paul Ryan]] defeated Democrats [[Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign|Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] by a margin of 54% to 44%. The state has not had a Democratic [[United States Senate|Senator]] since [[Fritz Hollings|Ernest Hollings]] retired in 2005. The state has had a Republican majority in the [[United States House of Representatives]] since the so-called "[[Republican Revolution]]" of [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]]. However, some have suggested that South Carolina may become a battleground state in this election cycle because of Clinton's lead in the national polling.<ref name="PPP">{{cite web|title=Clinton/Trump Race Tight in South Carolina|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/08/clintontrump-race-tight-in-south-carolina.html|website=Public Policy Polling|publisher=Public Policy Polling|accessdate=24 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815062335/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/08/clintontrump-race-tight-in-south-carolina.html|archive-date=15 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> A poll released on August 10 by [[Public Policy Polling]] had Trump leading Clinton by a margin of only 2 points,<ref name="PPP"/> and an internal poll commissioned for the [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] had the race tied.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Master|first1=Cyra|title=Poll: Clinton tied with Trump in SC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292432-poll-clinton-tied-with-trump-in-sc|website=The Hill|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> This led [[Larry Sabato]]'s political prediction website [[Sabato's Crystal Ball]] to move the rating of the South Carolina contest from "Safe Republican" to "Likely Republican" on August 18.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondik|first1=Kyle|last2=Sabato|first2=Larry|last3=Skelley|first3=Geoffrey|title=Clinton Rises to 348 Electoral Votes, Trump Drops to 190|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/clinton-rises-to-348-electoral-votes-trump-drops-to-190/|website=Sabato's Crystal Ball|publisher=University of Virginia Center for Politics|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref>

==Electors==
{{Main|List of 2016 United States presidential electors}}

Technically the voters of South Carolina cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. South Carolina is allocated 9 electors because it has 7 [[South Carolina's congressional districts|congressional districts]] and 2 [[List of United States senators from South Carolina|senators]]. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 9 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 9 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a [[faithless elector]].

The electors of each state and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] met on December 19, 2016, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. 

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 9 were pledged for Trump/Pence.
