===Installed capacity===
At the end of 2016, the total installed capacity of electricity in Taiwan was 49.06 GW, which came from coal-based thermal (34.73%), gas-based thermal (32.32%), nuclear (10.49%), renewable energy (9.10%), fuel-based thermal (8.06%) and pumped storage hydro (5.3%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emcsg.com/f1671,123955/3_-_Dr_Chuan-Neng_Lin_Bureau_of_Energy_Taiwan.pdf|date=1 August 2017|title=Developments in Taiwan's Electricity Market|page=4|website=Energy Market Company|accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="taipower1">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipower.com.tw/e_content/content/report/..%5C..%5C..%5CUpFile%5CCompanyENFile%5C2013Taipower_English_EBook.pdf|date=20 December 2013|title=Taiwan Power Company Sustainability Report|accessdate=2014-08-23|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517054834/http://www.taipower.com.tw/e_content/content/report/..%5C..%5C..%5CUpFile%5CCompanyENFile%5C2013Taipower_English_EBook.pdf|archive-date=17 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="world-nuclear1">{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Others/Nuclear-Power-in-Taiwan/ |title=Taiwan Nuclear Power |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref><ref name="digitimes">{{cite web|author=Adam Hwang, DIGITIMES, Taipei&nbsp;[Wednesday 7 May 2014] |url=http://www.digitimes.com:8080/news/a20140507VL201.html |title=Taiwan generates 213,400GWh of power in 2013, says Taipower |publisher=Digitimes.com:8080 |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>

===Power generation===
Total power generation in 2017 was 270,279 GWh – which was supplied from coal (46.6%), natural gas (34.6%), nuclear (8.3%), renewables (4.6%), oil (4.7%), and pumped-storage hydro (1.2%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moeaboe.gov.tw/ECW/main/content/wHandMenuFile.ashx?file_id=3997|title=Power Generation in Taiwan (Taiwan Bureau of Energy)|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref> 

In 2012, Taipower purchased electricity from nine Independent Power Producers with a total capacity of 7,652.1&nbsp;MW.<ref name="taipower1" /> Taiwan has seen an annual growth of 4.4% in terms of electricity generation in 1992–2012.

In terms of price to produce electricity, the average generation cost of electricity in Taiwan was US$7.0 cent/kWh, which consists of US$1.9 cent/kWh for nuclear, US$5.8 cent/kWh for coal and US$11.25 cent/kWh for natural gas.<ref name="world-nuclear1"/>

Taipower operates three types of power plant based on the generation characteristics, which are [[peaking power plant]], [[load following power plant]] and [[base load power plant]].<ref name="digitimes"/>

In 2012, the base load power source constituted for 42.4% of the total power generation in Taiwan, below the expected level of 55-65%. Over the past decade, the capacity of peak load energy sources was between 10.3–14.8%, slightly lower than the expected 10-15% value.<ref name="taipower1"/>

===Power plants===
{{Main|List of power stations in Taiwan}}
[[File:Taichung Thermal Power Plant.JPG|thumb|[[Taichung Power Plant]] in [[Taichung]].]]

As of 2007, Taiwan had a total of 78 [[power plants]], which are 39 [[Hydroelectricity|hydro power plants]], 27 [[Thermal power station|thermal power plants]], 9 [[wind farm]]s and 3 [[nuclear power plants]].

====World records====
Taiwan is home to [[Taichung Power Plant]], the world second largest [[coal-fired power plant]] with a 5,500 MW installed capacity, with additional 324 MW from its [[gas turbine]] and [[wind power]] generated electricity. The power plant is located in [[Longjing District]], [[Taichung]].

The [[Tatan Power Plant]] in [[Guanyin District|Guanyin]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] is the world's largest [[gas turbine]] [[combined cycle]] power plant at the capacity of 4,419 MW.

====Efficiency====
In 2013, for steam turbine-based power plants, the plants have 31.89% for oil-fired plants, 35.71% for coal-fired plants and 30.93% for gas-fired plants of efficiency. The power plants also have efficiency of 37.17% for diesel engine plants, 25.08% for gas turbine plants and 44.78% for combined cycle plants.<ref name="moeaboe.gov.tw">{{cite web|url=http://web3.moeaboe.gov.tw/ECW/english/content/ContentLink.aspx?menu_id=1540|title=Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C. - Energy Statistical annual Reports|publisher=}}</ref>

===Electricity consumption===
In 2013, the total annual electricity consumption in Taiwan was 202 TWh, ranging from industrial (55.5%), residential (20.2%), commercial (15.6%) and others (8.7%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipower.com.tw/e_content/content/wwd/wwd01-1.aspx?sid=5|title=Taiwan power company-What We Do|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="taipower1"/> The per capita electricity consumption in 2012 was 10,424 kWh.<ref name="world-nuclear1"/> As of 2015, the growth of electricity consumption is projected to grow by 1.9% annually. Northern Taiwan consumes 40% of the total power generated in Taiwan, and it relies on Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan for additional power source.
<ref name="chinapost.com.tw"/>

===Customers===
In 2012, there were a total of almost 13&nbsp;millions of electricity customers in Taiwan, ranging from residential (89.4%), commercials (7.6%), industrial (1.6%) and others (1.4%).<ref name="taipower1"/>

===Electricity metering===
[[File:Taiwan Power electricity meters 5258-62 - 5258-65.jpg|thumb|Taipower customer [[Electricity meter|kWh meters]]]]
Taiwan implements the usage of [[Smart meter|advanced metering infrastructure]] (AMI) as one of the [[Energy demand management|demand side management strategy]] to cut down energy consumption and upgrade energy usage efficiency with a total investment of US$2.74&nbsp;billion.<ref name="greentechmedia1"/> The [[Bureau of Energy]] of the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]] instructed Taipower to do AMI installations to 23,600 [[high voltage]] customers and 10,000 [[low voltage]] customers in 2012. As of the end of 2011, Taipower has completed the 1,200 AMI installations for 1,200 high voltage customers.<ref name="taipower2"/>

===Electricity saving===
To encourage the public for energy and electricity saving, Taipower continued to launch the ''Power-Saving Initiative Measures'' and ''Energy Conservation Competitions'' to encourage the public to save electricity. After the measures were taken in 2012, a total amount of 4.833 TWh of electricity was saved in that year with carbon dioxide reduction reaching 2.59&nbsp;million tons.<ref name="taipower1"/>

In October 2016, due to the reduced reserve capacity of Taipower because of the continuing hot weather, the [[Executive Yuan]] ordered government offices around Taiwan to do power saving between 12.00-02.00 p.m., especially air conditioners and lights.<ref>http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201610190009.aspx</ref>

Taipower listed five color scales to indicate the level of electricity reserve during a day. ''Green'' color indicates reserve margin of more than 10% of total power generation, ''yellow'' indicates margin between 6-10%, ''orange'' indicates margin below 6%, ''red'' indicates margin of less than 900 MW and ''black'' indicates margin of less than 500 MW thus Taipower shall initiate [[Energy rationing|electricity rationing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201708070026.aspx|date=7 August 2017|first1=Chuan|last1=Ku|first2=Y.F.|last2=Low|title=No plans to ration electricity: Cabinet|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201708070018.aspx|date=7 August 2017|first1=Yu-yang|last1=Liao|first2=Evelyn|last2=Kao|title=Power supply flashes red as mercury hits year's high in Taipei|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref> Since 1988, Taiwan has experienced 57 rationing with the latest one happened in 2002.

Rationing would be increased to 10-15% if the reserve continues to drop. If problem still continues, rationing would be imposed to business and households with loads less than 1 MW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/08/08/2003676120|date=8 August 2017|first1=Lauly|last1=Li|title=Power supply hits crucial ‘red’ alert|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>
