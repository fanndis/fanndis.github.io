'''Barnes & Noble, Inc.''', is an American [[Bookselling|bookseller]]. It is a [[Fortune 1000]] company and the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States. As of March 7, 2019, the company operates 627 retail stores in all 50 [[U.S. states]].<ref name="fiscal2019-3rdqtr" /> In August 2019, [[Elliott Management Corporation]] acquired the company.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190807005399/en/Elliott-Completes-Acquisition-Barnes-Noble | title=Elliott Completes Acquisition of Barnes & Noble | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

The company was also one of the nation's largest manager of college textbook stores located on or near many college campuses when that division was spun off as a separate public company called [[#Barnes & Noble Education|Barnes & Noble Education]] in 2015.

The company is known by its customers for large retail outlets, many of which contain a [[café]] serving [[Starbucks]] [[coffee]] and other consumables. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and [[Barnes & Noble Nook|Nook]]&nbsp;[[e-reader|e&#8209;reader]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]].

In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.<ref>''The Noble Legacy: The Story of Gilbert Clifford Noble, Cofounder of the Barnes & Noble and Noble & Noble Book Companies'' by Betty N. Turner. iUniverse: 2006 {{ISBN|0595374786}}, 9780595374786 page 101</ref> 

===20th century: Expansion===
====1900–1919====
In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.<ref>"Barnes & Noble to Move." ''The Bookseller and Stationer'', January 1. 1922 p. 13</ref>

In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles Barnes; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble soon after.<ref>''The Noble Legacy: The Story of Gilbert Clifford Noble, Cofounder of the Barnes & Noble and Noble & Noble Book Companies'' by Betty N.

M. Barnes-Wilcox Company; William Barnes, however, divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's business shortly before his partnership with Noble. (His father's company would go on to become the [[Follett Corporation]].) Although the flagship store once featured the motto "Founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection with Barnes & Noble, save for the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.

They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.<ref name=hist />

In November 1974, editors of the British-produced ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', claimed on the [[BBC One]] television program [[Record Breakers]] that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes & Noble had overtaken that of London's [[Foyles]] bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.<ref>''Record Breakers''.

Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily [[shopping mall]]-based [[B.

Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early [[videotex]] service called "[[Prodigy (online service)|Trintex]]," a joint venture between [[Sears]] and [[IBM]], but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.<ref name=BNSiteHistory /> BarnesandNoble.com went public in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/05/24/technology/barnesandnoble/|title=Barnesandnoble sets IPO at $18 – May 24, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

===21st century: Operating in an electronic environment===
====2000s====
In 2004, it was reported that the reading of books was on the decline in America, with the number of non-reading adults increasing by 17 million between 1992 and 2002. Despite this, Barnes & Noble claimed that its retail store business was expanding in the book market.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/huge-decline-in-book-reading/|title=Huge Decline In Book Reading|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}</ref> Beginning in 1999, Barnes & Noble owned [[GameStop]], a video game and electronics retail outlet.

CEO Leonard Riggio stepped down in 2002, naming his younger brother and former acting chief executive of BarnesandNoble.com, Stephen Riggio, to succeed him. Some corporate governance experts noted that this appointment could potentially cause conflict of interest, but the company board noted that Riggio's experience at the company made him the right person for the job.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/business/shifting-leadership-bookseller-barnes-noble-chief-steps-aside-for-brother.html|title=A Shifting Of Leadership At Bookseller; Barnes & Noble Chief Steps Aside for Brother|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}</ref> Stephen Riggio stepped down from the position in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/18/barnes-nobles-ceo-steps-down-bn-com-president-william-lynch-takes-over/|title=Barnes & Noble CEO Steps Down, BN.com President William Lynch Takes Over|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2010, website president William Lynch was named CEO.

Barnes & Noble maintains a separate publishing business in addition to its retail stores and other entities. Barnes & Noble's publishing company got its start by reissuing inexpensive versions of out-of-print books, and made a push to expand the unit in 2003. The company saw success the following year; in September 2004, its book, "Hippie," reached [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/books/huge-book-retailer-expands-its-publishing-role.html?mtrref=www.google.com|title=Huge Book Retailer Expands Its Publishing Role|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}</ref> 

Barnes & Noble often publishes and sells books at a lower cost than competitors, and sells lines of inexpensive books like Barnes & Noble Classics<ref name=":0" /> and the leather-bound Barnes & Noble Collectible Classics collection which has it has published since 1992.

== ''The Barnes & Noble Review'' ==
'''''The Barnes & Noble Review''''' is an [[online magazine]], hosted on Barnes & Noble's website, that publishes evaluations of both fiction and nonfiction works, along with essays, interviews, and pieces on other topics. It was launched in October 2007 by Barnes & Noble CEO Steve Riggio and [[James Mustich, Jr.]], publisher of the book catalog [[A Common Reader]]. Regular contributors to the magazine have included book critics [[Michael Dirda]], Brooke Allen, Laura Miller, and [[Adam Kirsch]], as well as prominent writers in fields outside of literary criticism, such as political journalists [[Chris Hayes]] and [[Ezra Klein]], philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]], music critic [[Robert Christgau]], and cartoonist [[Ward Sutton]]. Miller, who has written for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and Mustich's Common Reader, said, "The reviews [at ''BNR''] are the same as anywhere else", adding that the tone and length of the pieces evoke ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' rather than the less formal ''Salon''. The magazine's [[web traffic]] flourished during its first few years. According to [[Compete.com]], it amassed 50,000 [[unique user|unique visitors]] in December 2009.<ref name="CJR">{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Jordan Michael|date=April 2010|url=https://archives.cjr.org/review/critical_condition.php|title=Critical Condition|magazine=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

Some critics were originally skeptical of ''The Barnes & Noble Review''. Art Winslow, former literary editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', said that because Barnes & Noble is a [[brand name]], ''BNR''{{'}}s contributors are effectively endorsing the corporation, and that the motives behind the publication undermine its integrity: "Criticism's content should be free of any commercialism. Barnes & Noble has found another way to sell books, and that's the ''Review''. ... I wouldn't write there." Mustich disputed the idea that the magazine serves as a corporate tactic: "We counter that skepticism with quality. If people read the site, they can determine that we are doing what we purport to do. They have never tried to influence my judgment. The first attempt would have been the last."<ref name="CJR"/>

The Nook competes with the [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Kobo eReader]], and other e-reader offerings and color tablets with reading apps, such as Apple's [[Apple Books|iBooks]] for [[iOS]] devices.
