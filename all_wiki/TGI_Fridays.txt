Alan Stillman opened the first TGI Fridays restaurant in 1965,<!-- both sources confirm 1965 --> in New York. He lived in a neighborhood with many airline [[stewardesses]], [[fashion model]]s, secretaries, and other young, single people on the [[East Side of Manhattan]] near the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and hoped that opening a bar would help him meet women. At the time, Stillman's choices for socializing were non-public [[cocktail parties]] or "guys' beer-drinking hangout" bars that women usually did not visit; he recalled that "there was no public place for people between, say, twenty-three to thirty-seven years old, to meet." He sought to recreate the comfortable cocktail party atmosphere in public despite having no experience in the restaurant business.{{r|patton199412}}{{r|twilley20101115}}

It benefited from the near-simultaneous availability of the [[birth-control pill]] and [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'':{{r|prewitt19930329}}{{r|patton199412}}{{r|twilley20101115}}

{{quote|I don’t think there was anything else like it at the time. Before TGI Fridays, four single twenty-five year-old girls were not going out on Friday nights, in public and with each other, to have a good time. They went to people’s apartments for cocktail parties or they might go to a real restaurant for a date or for somebody’s birthday, but they weren’t going out with each other to a bar for a casual dinner and drinks because there was no such place for them to go.{{r|twilley20101115}}}}

TGI Fridays was one of the first to use promotions such as [[ladies' night]],{{r|prewitt19930329}} and Stillman achieved his hopes of meeting women; "Have you seen the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''? [[Tom Cruise]] played me!...Why do girls want to date the bartender? To this day, I’m not sure that I get it."{{r|twilley20101115}} He and the restaurant benefited from its location—according to Stillman, 480 stewardesses lived in the apartment building next door{{r|patton199412}}—and received publicity in national magazines. TGI Fridays became so popular that it had to install ropes to create an area for those [[waiting in line]], also unusual at the time for a restaurant. A competitor, [[Maxwell's Plum]], opened across the street, and others soon followed.{{r|twilley20101115}}

With fellow Bucknell graduate Ben Benson,<ref name="witchel20081230" /> Stillman opened other restaurants, including Tuesday's, Thursday's, Wednesday's, and Ice Cream Sunday's. [[Franchising]] of TGI Fridays began two years after the Manhattan location opened, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]'s {{r|twilley20101115}} Overton Square district; that location has since closed. In 1971, [[Daniel R. Scoggin]] acquired the rights to eight major midwest cities. In 1972, he opened with the first of a new prototype in Dallas.  The raised square bar and multilevel dining became the company standard. Dallas doubled the sales and tripled profits of TGI Fridays previous best.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Families began visiting the new suburban locations during the day for casual food; "it took six or seven years, but T.G.I. Fridays became a very different animal", Stillman said.{{r|twilley20101115}} Attracted by this performance, he merged into the Dallas franchise forming TGI Fridays, Inc., and Scoggin was the CEO for the next 15 years. Scoggin is credited with the then-new 200 seat prototype as well as many of the TGI Fridays innovations including a large from scratch menu, potato skins, bartender Olympics, and frozen drinks.

The company was sold to Carlson Companies in 1975. With this sale, Stillman and the original investors departed. Stillman kept the original location, and now married, founded [[Smith & Wollensky]] in 1977 with Benson. Scoggin continued as CEO on an earn-out contract and finalized his sale in 1980.<ref name="nrn19860901">{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v20/ai_4468081/ | title=Granddaddy of singles bars: a look at T.G.I.

When the sale was finalized, Scoggin signed a new contract to continue as the company's CEO. When the company was passing through the 100-store mark, it issued an [[initial public offering]] in 1983 with [[Goldman Sachs]]. Scoggin developed the first international franchise and the template for future international development. The first restaurant was opened in the UK with [[Whitbread|Whitbread PLC]]. Prior to Scoggin's departure in 1986, the company was positioned to appeal to a broader consumer profile. Alcohol consumption was de-emphasized, and quality was emphasized over quantity.

The company became [[private company|privately held]] again in 1989.{{r|prewitt19930329}} The focus was then switched from singles to families.

A [[brand extension]], which features the TGI Fridays concept combined with the atmosphere of a [[sports bar]], called "Fridays Front Row Sports Grill", is found at two [[Major League Baseball]] stadiums which each overlook the playing field: [[Chase Field]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in [[Milwaukee]].

Historically, the chain's highest grossing location is at Haymarket [[Leicester Square]], which opened in 1992 in Central London. The Haymarket branch is also regarded as the "most popular" branch as well as the most successful financially. In October 2009, Haymarket broke the world record for biggest profit made in any week, throughout TGI Fridays' history, and it has been home to several past winners from the bartenders Olympics, a contest started by Scoggin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-15135623/tgi-friday-forges-ahead-unfriendly-territory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192041/http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-15135623/tgi-friday-forges-ahead-unfriendly-territory |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2014 |title=TGI Fridays forges ahead in 'unfriendly' territory – Europe |work=Nation's Restaurant News |first=Richard | last=Martin |date=April 18, 1994}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In 2013, as part of "Operation Swill", investigators in [[New Jersey]] raided 17 TGI Fridays franchised restaurants owned by [[The Briad Group]]. They found that the bars were replacing premium brand [[alcoholic beverages]] with lower-cost brands yet charging patrons for the more expensive liquor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morley |first=Hugh |title=N.J. raids restaurants in Bergen, Passaic counties in liquor scam probe |url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/208510021_NJ_raids_Bergen__Passaic_restaurants_in_liquor_scam.html |accessdate=23 May 2013 |newspaper=NorthJersey.com |date=22 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gingras |first=Brynn |title=13 TGI Fridays in New Jersey Accused of Faking Premium Liquor |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/TGI-Fridays-Premium-Liquor-Well-Brand-New-Jersey-Operation-Swill-208516231.html |accessdate=23 May 2013 |newspaper=NBC 4 New York |date=23 May 2013}}</ref>

==Franchisees==
{{Update section|date=June 2020|cat=|reason=The Briad Group has sold the Fridays business}}
TGI Fridays is a [[franchising]] operation, with franchisees owning most of the outlets. The largest franchisee is [[The Briad Group]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.hoovers.com/company/The_Briad_Group/rrfkryi-1.html The Briad Group], ''Hoovers'' – accessed January 10, 2010</ref> Whitbread PLC was a major international franchisee. Up until 2007, Whitbread had 45 locations in the UK. On January 17, 2007, Whitbread sold operating rights of all 45 restaurants back to T.G.I. Fridays UK Limited (a consortium consisting of Carlson Restaurants Worldwide Inc. and [[ABN AMRO|ABN Amro Capital]]) thus exiting a partnership formed in 1986.<ref>[http://www.whitbread.co.uk/media.cfm?id=press_releases_archive&view=215 Media > Press Releases > Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> TGI Fridays has also been used as a restaurant for hotels run by [[Country Inns & Suites by Carlson]] brand.{{fact|date=February 2019}}

[[File:TGI Fridays in Easton, PA.jpg|thumb|left|A TGI Fridays in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] that uses the new design, seen in February 2019.]] [[File:TGI Fridays Goodlettsville TN USA.JPG|thumb|TGI Fridays in [[Goodlettsville, Tennessee]] in July 2009 (closed in 2019).]]
The newer TGI Fridays franchises (as well as redesigned restaurants) are more contemporary, with wallpaper, granite exteriors, and red-and-white striped lamps instead of Tiffany. The exteriors have stucco, the entrance doors have "F"-shaped handles, and a metal cup above the door has a stripe saying "In Here, It's always Friday". The logo design was evolved in 2013 by Jane MacDowall and her creative team in Scotland. Most TGI Fridays have a [[propeller]] and a rowing [[scull]] on display as part of their antiques, which are actually a part of a story told to all TGI Fridays employees; the scull always contains a pair of [[saddle shoes]] and a bottle of champagne to remind employees of the value of teamwork, leadership, and celebrating success. The propeller is always above or near the bar. The thought is that the bar "propels" the restaurant.

== Menu ==
Fridays has a large menu with an emphasis on [[alcoholic beverage]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodmenuguru.com/tgi-fridays-menu-prices/|title=TGI FRIDAYS MENU PRICES {{!}} TGIF Menu|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref>

TGI Fridays formerly served [[Atkins Nutritional Approach|Atkins]]-approved appetizers, entrées, and desserts. In 2006, the Atkins name was removed from the menu, but the restaurant continues to offer both [[Low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]] and low-fat menu items. The UK and US menus offer [[Gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] items.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Global operations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}

TGI Fridays currently has over 870 restaurants in around 60 countries (excluding the United States).{{ciation needed|date=March 2020}}
