The '''''Arkansas Gazette''''' was a [[newspaper]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], that was published from 1819 to 1991. It was known as the oldest newspaper west of the [[Mississippi River]]. It was located from 1908 until its closing at the now historic [[Gazette Building (Little Rock, Arkansas)|Gazette Building]]. For many years it was the newspaper of record for Little Rock and the State of [[Arkansas]]. It was Arkansas' first newspaper.

==History==
The ''Arkansas Gazette'' began publication at [[Arkansas Post]], the first capital of [[Arkansas Territory]], on November 20, 1819. The ''Arkansas Gazette'' was established seventeen years before Arkansas became a state. When the capital was moved to Little Rock in 1821, publisher [[William E. Woodruff]] also relocated the ''Arkansas Gazette''.  The newspaper was the first to report Arkansas' statehood in 1836.<ref name=OldStateHouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=216&issue_id=20&page=2 |work=History of Newspapers in Arkansas |title= Gazette and Democrat Wage Newspaper War |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102012054/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=216&issue_id=20&page=2 |year=1998 |archivedate=November 2, 2006 |publisher=Old Statehouse Museum}}</ref>

Over the decades the paper was bought and sold many times. During the Civil War the paper was even shut down from the September on 1863 to the May of 1865. After the war the Gazette became the first newspaper to have telegraphic services from which they began to receive news from places like New Orleans, Louisiana, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri. In 1908 the "Gazette" even added colored comics. During the Little Rock Nine Crisis the "Gazette" promoted the integration of schools which lost them millions of dollars. But in the aftermath the "Gazette" regained its status. In 1958, the "Arkansas Gazette" was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and Harry Ashmore of the "Gazette" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing for their coverage of the school integration crisis in Little Rock. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1958/|title=1958 Pulitzer Prizes|website=pulitzer.org|access-date=November 8, 2016}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2344|title= Arkansas Gazette|website=encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=November 30, 2018|author=Donna Lampkin Stephens}}</ref> 

Through much of its history, the ''Gazette'' was in competition with the ''[[Arkansas Democrat]]''. Competition became more intense in 1979 when the ''Democrat'' changed from publishing in the evening to publishing in the morning. After 12 years of bitter competition in the morning, the ''Arkansas Gazette'' published its final edition on October 18, 1991.  The assets of the newspaper were sold to [[Walter E. Hussman, Jr.]], owner and publisher of the competing ''Arkansas Democrat''.   Hussman renamed the surviving paper the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]].''<ref name=OldStateHouse/> The surviving newspaper proclaims itself a descendant of the ''Arkansas Gazette'', but this viewpoint is disputed by the 726 full-time and 1,200 part-time employees of the ''Arkansas Gazette'' who lost their jobs with the demise of their newspaper, as well as by readers of the "Gazette" who preferred the quality of journalism found in the "Gazette" to that found in the "Arkansas Democrat," even holding a vigil for its demise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2344/|title=The Arkansas Gazette|website=encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=November 8, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aetn.org/programs/oldgraylady/| title=The Old Gray Lady: Arkansas' First Newspaper| date=2016| website=aetn.org| publisher=AETN| access-date=November 8, 2016}}</ref>
