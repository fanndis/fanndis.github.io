The '''Brazilian Army''' ({{lang-pt|Exército Brasileiro}}) is the land arm of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. The Brazilian Army has fought in several international conflicts, mostly in [[South America]] during the 19th century. In the 20th century, it fought on the Allied side in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref>Donato, 1996. Sumário (Summary sections)</ref> Aligned with the [[Western Bloc]], during the time of [[military dictatorship]] in Brazil from 1964 to 1985, it also had active participation in the [[Cold War]], in Latin America and Southern Portuguese Africa,<ref>Teixeira, 2013.

Page 76</ref>

Domestically, besides having faced several rebellions throughout these two centuries, with support of local political and economic [[elite]]s, it also ended the monarchy and imposed on the rest of society its political views and [[economic development]] projects during the periods that it ruled the country: 1889–94, 1930–50 ([[Vargas Era|First Vargas period]] and [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra|Dutra]] years), and 1964–85.<ref>Smallman, 2002.

==History==

=== Origins (16th To 18th Centuries) ===
:''Main Articles'': [[France Antarctique#Portuguese intervention|1st French-Portuguese colonial war]], [[Equinoctial France|2nd French-Portuguese colonial war]], [[Dutch-Portuguese War#Sugar War - Government-General Vs. the WIC|Sugar War]], [[Battle of Rio de Janeiro|French raids (1710–11)]], [[Invasion of Cayenne (1809)|Napoleonic Wars in South America]] and [[Luso-Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental (1816)|Possession Conflicts for Banda Oriental]]
Although the Brazilian Army was created during the process of the independence of Brazil from Portugal, in 1822, with the units of the [[Portuguese Army]] in Brazil that have remained loyal to Prince [[Peter I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], its origins can date back to Land Forces used by Portuguese in the colonial wars against the [[Battle of Rio de Janeiro (1558)|French]] and [[First Battle of Guararapes|Dutch]], fought in 16th and 17th centuries.<ref name="Castro, 2002. Pages 71 to 76">Castro, 2002. Pages 71 to 76.</ref><ref name="Christiane Mello, 2009">Christiane Mello, 2009.</ref>

In the colonial period, [[Manuel I of Portugal|King D. Manuel I]] ordered military expeditions with the purpose of protecting the Portuguese dominions in America, then newly discovered. As colonization advanced in Pernambuco and São Vicente, the native military authorities and bases of the colony's defensive organization began to be built to meet the ambitions of the French, English, and Dutch.

First major interventions were the expulsion of the [[Battle of Rio de Janeiro|French from Rio de Janeiro]] in the 16th century and the Maranhao in 1615.  As internalization progressed through the broad territorial expansion movement in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, forcing the organization of the defense of the newly conquered territory.

The war against the Dutch, in the 17th century, for the first time mobilized large numbers in the country, and gave rise to a sense of national defense, regardless of the influence of the crown. The [[first Battle of Guararapes]] (1648) marks the beginning of the organization of the army as a genuinely Brazilian force formed by local whites, led by [[André Vidal de Negreiros]], Indians, led by [[Felipe Camarão]], and blacks / mulattos, led by [[Henrique Dias]]. This date is celebrated as the anniversary of the Brazilian Army.<ref name="Castro, 2002. Pages 71 to 76"/><ref name="Christiane Mello, 2009"/>

At this time, following the model of organization of the [[Portuguese Army]], implemented during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] starting in 1640, the ground forces in Brazil adopted three lines of organization which were maintained until the 19th century, which includes:

* 1st line - Paid troops
* 2nd line - Auxiliary troops (called "militias" from the end of the 18th century)
* 3rd line - ''[[Ordenanças]]''

Throughout 18th century Brazil Colony had serious border problems mainly in the far south. At that time, there were frequent clashes between Luso-Brazilians and Hispano-Platinos, in addition, the land force faced the threat of rebellions of Indians and blacks.<ref name="Castro, 2002. Pages 71 to 76"/><ref name="Christiane Mello, 2009"/>

During the Independence process, the Army was initially composed of Brazilians, Portuguese and foreign mercenaries. Trained in Guerrilla Warfare From then To current Day. Most of its commanders were mercenaries and Portuguese officers loyal to Dom Pedro.<ref>Hendrik, 2001. Introduction & Chapter 5.</ref> Along 1822 and 1823, the Brazilian Army was able to defeat the Portuguese resistance, especially in the North of country and in [[Cisplatina]], having also avoid a fragmentation of the then new Brazilian Empire after its independence war.<ref>Donato, 1996. Pages 105–106.</ref>

After won the Independence War, the Army supported by the ''National Guard'' (a [[paramilitary]] [[militia]] created in 1831 by the big owners of slave and land, known as "Colonels"), destroyed any separatist tendencies of the early years, enforcing central authority of the empire, during the [[Regency (government)|Regency]] period in the country, repressing across Brazil a host of popular movements for political autonomy or against slavery and the colonels' power.<ref>Faoro, 1957. Chapters VIII & IX</ref>
[[File:Joca Tavares Chico Diabo and others.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brazilian Imperial Army after Paraguayan War, 1870.]] 
The [[National Guard (Brazil)|National Guard]] was a military force organized in Brazil in August 1831, during the regency period, and demobilized in September 1922. Its creation occurred by means of law of 18 of August 1831 that "Creates the National Guards and extinguishes the bodies of militias, city guards and ordinances. " According to the aforementioned law, in its article 1, "The National Guards are created to defend the Constitution, Liberty, Independence, and Integrity of the Empire, to maintain obedience and public tranquility, and to assist the Line Army in defense of borders and coasts ", based on art. 145 of the Constitution of 1824: "All Brazilians are obliged to take up arms to support the independence and integrity of the Empire, and defend it from its external or internal enemies." In September 1850, through Law No. 602, the National Guard was reorganized and retained its powers subordinated to the Minister of Justice and the provincial presidents.<ref>[http://legis.senado.gov.br/legislacao/ListaTextoIntegral.action?id=64284&norma=80189 Lei nº 602, de 19/09/1850 - Dá nova organisação á Guarda Nacional do Imperio.] [...] Art. 6º A Guarda Nacional será subordinada ao Ministro da Justiça, e aos Presidentes de Provincia.</ref>
[[File:Count of Eu and Deodoro da Fonseca.jpg|thumb|270px|left|[[Prince Gaston, Count of Eu]] and the high command of the Brazilian Imperial Army in 1885.]]	
During the 1850s and early 1860s, the Army along with Navy, entered in action against Argentinian and Uruguayan forces, which opposed to Brazilian empire's interests. The Brazilian success with such ''"Gun Diplomacy"'', eventually lead to a shock of interests with another country with similar aspirations, the Paraguay in December, 1864. <br />
On May 1, 1865, [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]] signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] to defend themselves against aggression from [[Paraguay]], which was ruled by the dictator [[Francisco Solano López (politician)|Francisco López]]. López troops, after invading Brazilian territory through the state of Mato Grosso and the north of Argentina, were heading for the South of Brazil and North of Uruguay. Many slaves had been incorporated into the Brazilian forces to face the increasingly serious situation. As a result of their solid performance during the conflict, the Armed Forces developed a strong sense against slavery. After five years of a terrible warfare (the largest in South American history), the Alliance led by Brazil defeated Lopez.<ref>Kraay, 2004. Intro</ref><ref>Donato, 1996. Pages 129–132.</ref>

During this war, one of the biggest in history and the largest one occurred in South America, the Brazilian Imperial Army mobilized 200,000 men for the war, divided into the following categories: 18,000 Army personnel who were in Uruguay in 1864; 2,047 in the province of Mato Grosso; 56,000 Fatherland Volunteers; 62,000 National Guardsmen; 11,900 ex-slaves; and an additional 22,000 National Guardsmen who remained in Brazil to defend their homeland.<ref>Salles (2003), p.38</ref>

In November 1889, after a long attrition with the monarchical regime deepened by the abolition of slavery, the army led a [[coup d'état]], that resulted in the end of the empire and the founding of a republic. The implementation of the 1st Brazilian military dictatorship (that ended only in 1894), was followed by [[Encilhamento|a severe economic crisis]] that deepened into [[Revolta da Armada|an institutional one with Congress and the navy]], which degenerates into [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution (Brazil)|a restricted civil war at southern region]].<ref>Smallman, 2002.  Chapter 1 "Officers versus Politicians, 1889–1930".</ref>

Between 1893 and 1927, in the first Republican Period, the Army had to deal with various movements: some were derived from Navy and Army corps who were unsatisfied with the regime and clamoring for democratic changes, while others had popular origins without conventional political intentions guided by messianic leaders, like in Canudos and Contestado Wars.<ref name="Ibidem, Smallman 2002">Ibidem, Smallman 2002.</ref>

The Canudos War, which took place in the northeastern sertão and covered several cities and many sertanejos in Bahia led by Antônio Conselheiro, the Contestado War that developed by dispute of territories of currency of the states of Paraná and Santa Catarina, led by Jose Maria
[[File:Brazilian_Soldiers_First_War.jpg|thumb|left|Brazilian Army officers in World War I, 1918.]]
These revolts were serious threats to the stability of the new republican nascent regime and was related to the discontent of the population of the regions more distant of the sertão northeastern and regions of recent colonization like Paraná and West of Santa Catarina with the Republic, since this population was predominantly Catholic and did not accept a Republic that appeared totally dominated by Masonic ideals like the separation of Church of the State.
[[File:Intentona Comunista de 1935 (4).jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian Army soldiers in 1935.]]
After years of fighting and many deaths both on the side of the federal government soldiers and the rebels, these movements were defeated and the Republic consolidated.<ref name="Ibidem, Smallman 2002"/>

During World War I the Brazilian government sent three small military groups to Europe soon after declaring war upon [[Central Powers]] in October 1917. The first two units were from the army; one consisted of medical staff and the other of a sergeants-officers group, and both were attached to the [[French Army]] in the Western Front in 1918.<ref>Donato, 1996. P.153</ref><ref>McCann, 2004. P.181, 2nd §.</ref>

From October 1930 to 1945 the army and elites linked to it, by the second time took the control over the country, having the landowner and opposition political leader, [[Getúlio Vargas]], ahead of movement. In this period, the Army defeated the [[Constitutionalist Revolution|Constitutionalist Revolt]] in 1932 and two separate [[coup d'état]] attempts: by [[Brazilian Communist Party|Communists]] in November 1935 and by [[Brazilian Integralism|Fascists]] in May 1938. The Army also helped to formalize the dictatorship in 1937.<ref>Smallman, 2002.  Chapters 2 & 3.</ref><ref>McCann, 2004. Chapters 7 to 11.</ref><ref>Skidmore, 1967. Chapters I & II.</ref>
[[File:Soldados da Força Expedicionária Brasileira na Itália durante a II Guerra Mundial.tif|thumb|left|220px|Soldiers of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force in Italy during World War II, 1944.]]

In August 1942, after German and Italian [[U-Boat|submarines]] sank Brazilian merchant ships, popular mobilization forced the Brazilian government to declare war on [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. In July 1944, after almost two years of public pressure and negotiations with US authorities, an [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] was sent to join the Allied forces in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]. The army's contribution was composed of a full [[Infantry Division]] (about 25,000 men, replacements included), commanded by [[Major-General]] (later [[Marshal]]) [[Mascarenhas de Morais|João Baptista Mascarenhas de Morais]], which in Italy was attached to the [[IV Corps (United States)#World War II|US IV Corps]] at the [[United States Army North#World War II|US Fifth Army]], into the [[15th Army Group|15th Allied Army Group]].<ref>Lochery, 2014. Parts 3 to 5.</ref><br />
[[File:Brazilian Artillery, Gothic Line WWII.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Brazilian Artillery on [[Gothic Line]], World War II, Sep. 1944.]]
With the defeat of totalitarian regimes in World War II, Vargas is removed by the head of the army, [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra|General Dutra]], who in 1946 won the [[Election]] dispute against [[Air Marshall]], [[Eduardo Gomes]]. After the Vargas suicide (who succeeded Dutra in 1950), due to an institutional crisis, army sectors led by [[Henrique Teixeira Lott|Marshal Lott]], ensured the inauguration of [[Juscelino Kubitschek]]'s [[Term of office|Term]], elected in 1955.<ref>Skidmore, 1967. Chapters II to V.</ref>

With the resignation of [[Jânio Quadros]], who succeeded Kubitschek, a new institutional crisis opens up, exacerbated by the [[Cold War]] context, and in late March-early April 1964, the Brazilian Army (then led by General [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco]]) seized power through its [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|third coup d'état]], inaugurating another dictatorial period, which lasted 21 years.<ref>Skidmore, 1967. Chapters VI to VIII.</ref> <br />
This coup was the first of a series of coups d'état in South America that replaced democratically elected governments with military regimes. These dictatorships dominated South America until the 1980s. In this period the Brazilian Army employed harsh means to suppress militant dissident groups: changing the law, restricting political rights, after harassing and pursuing dissidents; and militarily, with support of police forces and militias, proceeding with methods of [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] and [[counter-insurgency]] warfare to defeat the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movements that tried to combat the regime by force. The [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrilla]]s were active in Brazil between 1968 and 1971 while in the [[rural]] areas the 2 main movements subdued by the Army were respectively, one in the region where are today the [[Caparaó National Park]] (1967) and [[Araguaia guerrilla|the other one]] in the region of [[Araguaya]] River (1972–74).<ref>Skidmore, 1988. Chapters II to V.</ref><ref>Gaspari, 2002. "The Armed Illusions" Vol. II.</ref>

Internationally, in 1965 the Brazilian Army joined forces with [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] intervening in the [[Dominican Republic]], in [[Operation Powerpack]]. During the 1970s strengthened interchange and cooperative ties with armies from other South American countries giving and receiving advisement about counter-guerrilla and counter-insurgency methods, as for example in the [[Operation Condor]], a procedural coordination to find, capture and eliminate political [[dissident]]s in mainland. From [[Ernesto Geisel|Geisel]] period, the third Brazilian dictatorship sought greater independence in its foreign policy, leaving of automatically align with the US interests, especially in relation to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Middle East]].<ref>Ibidem Teixeira, 2013.</ref><ref>Ibidem Guerra, 2012.</ref><ref>Ibidem Dávila, 2010.</ref><ref>Skidmore, 1988. Chapter VI.</ref>


In the mid 1970s, despite the dissent annulled (by elimination, detention or exile), the leftist guerrillas defeated and the legal opposition tamed, repression was not reduced.  This added to the vices and the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power, plus the effects of the then [[1970s energy crisis|oil/energy crisis]] and the [[Latin American debt crisis|Latin American default]], during the late 1970s and early 1980s, led to increasing social pressures for democracy, which slowly but steadily forced the army to return to its professional activities.<ref>Skidmore, 1988.

Since the late 1950s it has taken part in some [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions as for example: in [[Suez]] 1956–67, [[East Timor]] 1999–2004, [[Angola]] 1995–1997 and [[Haiti]] since 2004, being the latest, the most recent outside intervention in that nation, as well as the longest length operation in the history of Brazilian military outside the country.

In the destructive earthquake that occurred in Haiti on January 12, 2010, eighteen Brazilian soldiers died. The Brazilian Army deployed about 2,150 troops to Haiti to help in the country's reconstruction.

The Brazilian Army is trying to renew its equipment and making a redistribution of its barracks in all the Brazilian Regions, prioritizing the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. After the promulgation of Brazilian National Defense Strategy, in December 2008, the [[Brazilian Government]] appears to be interested in the Armed Forces modernization.

In 2010, during the [[2010 Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis|Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis]], the Brazilian Army sent 800 paratroopers to combat drug trafficking in Rio de Janeiro. Following the invasion, approximately 2,000 Army soldiers were sent to occupy the [[Complexo do Alemão]].

===Conscription===
[[File:Jovens se apresentam para a fase de seleção do Serviço Militar (11967061054).jpg|thumb|left|230px|Young men presenting to the Brazilian Army for recruitment, in 2014.]]
According to Article 143 of the 1988 Brazilian Constitution, military service is mandatory for men, but conscientious objection is allowed. Women and clergymen are exempt from compulsory military service. At the year that they complete age eighteen, men are required to register for the draft and are expected to serve when they reach age nineteen. About 95 percent of those registering receive deferments. A growing number of recruits are volunteers, accounting for about two-thirds of the total. Those who serve generally spend one year of regular enlistment at an army garrison near their home. Some are allowed nine-month service terms but are expected to complete high school at the same time. These are called "Tiros de Guerra" or "shooting schools", which are for high school boys in medium-sized interior towns, run by army senior NCO, first sergeants or sublieutenants, and rarely a second lieutenant. In Brazilian Armed Forces, first sergeants may be promoted to the officers rank, as second lieutenant, first lieutenant and captain, becoming part of the Auxiliary Officers Corps. The army is the only service with a large number of conscripts; the navy and air force have very few.

The conscript system is primarily a means of providing basic military training to a sizable group of young men who then return to civilian life and are retained on the reserve rolls until age forty-five. The army recognizes that it provides a public service by teaching large numbers of conscripts basic skills that can be valuable to the overall economy when the young men return to civilian life.

===Officer Recruitment===
[[File:Campo periodo básico.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Field basic period of training sergeants.]]
Because the only entry into the regular officer corps is the [[Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras]] – Military Academy of the Black Needles (AMAN), its records provide an accurate picture of the officer corps. In the decades following World War II, cadets from middle-class families increased, while those from upper-class and unskilled lower-class families declined. The total number of applicants also declined as a result of economic development diversification, which gave high school graduates more attractive options than entering the military. Increasingly, AMAN cadets came from among the graduates of the army-supported Military Schools, which sons of military personnel attended tuition free. Many of these students were sons of NCOs whose own origins were not middle class, so a form of intra-institutional, upward mobility existed.

The trend in the 1960s to recruit from civilian sources has abated. The mental, health, and physical aptitude tests excluded large numbers of civilian school graduates: in 1977 of 1,145 civilians attempting the tests, only thirty-four, or 3 percent, were admitted. In 1985 only 174, or 11 percent, of the AMAN's 1,555 cadets were graduates of civilian schools; the rest were from the army's Military School system, the [[Preparatory School of the Brazilian Army (Escola Preparatória de Cadetes do Exército)|Cadet Preparatory School (Escola Preparatória de Cadetes—EPC)]], or air force or navy secondary schools. In the early 1990s, AMAN cadets were drawn exclusively from those who had completed the EPC. By the mid-1990s, the AMAN's cadet population was about 3,000.

In the twentieth century, the officer corps has been composed predominantly of men from the Southeast and South of Brazil, where military units and greater educational opportunities have been concentrated. In 1901–02 the Northeast contributed 38 percent of students at the army's preparatory school in Realengo, whereas in 1982 it provided only 13 percent to the preparatory school in Campinas. In the same years, the Southeast supplied 40.4 percent and 77 percent, while the South gave 8.6 percent and 6.3 percent. Although São Paulo, according to Alfred Stepan and other observers, has not been noted for sending its young men into the officer corps, its contribution increased from 4.3 percent of students in 1901–02 to 33.5 percent in 1982. Regional origins of cadets at the AMAN were fairly consistent in the 1964–85 period. By far the largest contingent came from the state and city of Rio de Janeiro.

Although social theorists might be pleased with indications that the army is serving as a vehicle for social mobility, army leaders are concerned. Officers have remarked on the trend toward lower-class recruitment in the Training Center for Reserve Officers (Centro de Preparação de Oficiais da Reserva—CPOR) and the problems associated with such officers. In a 1986 interview, the former minister of army, General Leônidas Pires Gonçalves, observed that he did not want officers who would give only five or ten years to the army; he wanted individuals with a military vocation, who would stay for a full thirty-plus-year career. Many officers have expressed concern that those seeking to use the army to improve their status are not sufficiently dedicated to the institution. Indeed, some officers seek the earliest possible retirement in order to get a second job (second salary) to make ends meet.

===Indigenous people in the Army===

The genesis of the current Army in the fight against the foreign invader, in the 17th century, counted on the decisive participation of [[Felipe Camarão]], named by the Portuguese court as Captain-Mor among the native indigenous peoples of Brazil. Along with [[Francisco Barreto de Meneses]], [[André Vidal de Negreiros]], Henrique Dias and João Fernandes Vieira, he was one of the patriarchs of the Brazilian Army.

In that sense, in the early 20th century, Marshal Cândido Mariano Rondon, a descendant of the Bororó, Terena and Guará ethnic groups, served in the Army. A pioneer of the Brazilian West and Amazonian frontiers, Rondon was noted for his respect for the indigenous peoples found in his exploratory missions. He is the Patron of the Signals Corps. Today's Army counts a number of ethnic community personnel among its ranks, especially in the western borders and the tough jungles of the Amazon.

===Women in the Army===
[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26634111151).jpg|thumb|right|120px|Female soldier of the Brazilian Army in the 72nd Motorized Infantry Battalion.]]
Women's participation in the Army is not without precedent. In 1823, Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought alongside other soldiers for Brazilian independence; during World War II (1939-1945), 73 Brazilian nurses served in various U.S. Army hospitals; and in 1992, the Brazilian Army Leadership Academy enrolled its first class of 49 women, admitting them into that institution's Auxiliary Officer Corps.  Female service members were limited to support duties such as administration, health care, and teaching. The innovation is women's entry into combat career paths.

To begin a career with the army as officers, women must have completed a bachelor's degree in areas such as law, computer science, economics, or accounting. The competition is national in scope, and no applicant may be more than thirty-six years of age. Those accepted into the program study at the Army's School of Complementary Formation (former Army's School of Administration) in Salvador, beginning as first lieutenants (reserve). The School of Complementary Formation is also open to men. At the end of the one-year course, the graduate is promoted to first lieutenant in the permanent ranks. If starting a career in the enlisted ranks, any woman enlistee would be required to at least be a secondary school graduate.

=== Military Regions ===

The Brazilian territory is further divided into twelve military regions. Each military region provides logistical support to operational units within its area of responsibility. Therefore, Military Regions are usually composed of units responsible for providing administration, logistics, transport, health and education. Military Regions are Division-sized units, commanded by [[Lieutenant General]]s (Generais de Divisão). The current military regions are:

The 12th Aeromobile Brigade is a major elite unit of the Brazilian Army. Headquartered in [[Caçapava]] in São Paulo. Its operation area covers the whole country. It is under the 2nd Army Division / [[Southeastern Military Command]], based in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].

It is organized, equipped and trained for rapid-response missions at any point of the country. They can move by air using business jets and civilian aircraft, but their primary means of transportation are the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s rotorcraft, from the [[Brazilian Army Aviation Command|Command Army Aviation]], usually based near their barracks. By performing their main function, the airborne assault, the Airmobile Brigade constitutes an effective, permanently available instrument of strategic reach, being an integral unit of the Strategic Task Force (Força de Ação Rápida Estratégica) of the Brazilian Army.<ref name="eb.mil.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.eb.mil.br/web/guest;jsessionid=126DB3C72C16DB4F9E961D0EDEC17535.lr1|title=Exército Brasileiro|website=Exército Brasileiro}}</ref>

The [[Brazilian Army Aviation Command|Army Aviation Command]], also known as '''Ricardo Kirk Brigade''', is a brigade of the Brazilian Army, located in [[Taubaté]] and linked to the Land Operations Command and the [[Southeastern Military Command]]. Its historical name is a reference to Captain [[Ricardo Kirk]], pioneer of military aviation in Brazil, killed in battle in the [[Contestado War]].

The task of the Brazilian Army Aviation Command is to provide organic airmobility and support the ground forces by providing tactical air support, close air support and reconnaissance.<ref name="eb.mil.br"/>

===Law and Order Operations Brigade===
[[File:Chefe do EMCFA General José Carlos De Nardi visita a Força de Pacificação do Complexo da Maré (16660223918).jpg|thumb|left|Law and order troops]]

The '''11th Infantry Brigade''' is one of the brigades operating in the Brazilian Army. Its headquarters is located in [[Campinas]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].

This infantry brigade is specialized in operations in urban terrain, being able to act in cases of severe instability or danger to public order. The brigade is used in Brazil often in actions against organized crime and drug trafficking, especially in large urban centers.

It also has a Law Enforcement Operations Instruction Center and the Order is a School Subunit. Peculiar Employment Unit of the Brazilian Army in Law Enforcement and Order Operations and Military Operations in Urban Environments.

It is trained to operate both in case of riots and in the fight against organized crime and drug trafficking, when the local law enforcement agencies are unable to do so by themselves. Recently it has operated alongside other elite Army forces in the pacification of communities that were previously under control of drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="eb.mil.br"/>

The [[Jungle Warfare]] Training Centre – Centro de Instrução de Guerra na Selva (CIGS), also known as the Colonel Jorge Teixeira Centre, is a military organisation based in [[Manaus]], intended to qualify military leaders of small groups, as wilderness warriors, fighters able to accomplish military nature missions in the most inhospitable areas of the Brazilian rainforest.

Courses are taught in jungle operations scenery in different categories – Senior Officers, Officers, Senior Non-Commissioned Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, Medical and Health Care Personnel, and small courses for the military, police forces and civilians. Its symbol is the [[jaguar]].
[[File:Guereiro de Selva (26673369176).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Facial camouflage jungle warrior.]]
The Jungle Warfare Training Center (CIGS) is structured as Department of Education, a Department of Doctrine and Research, a Student Division, a Department of Veterinary Medicine, a Department of Administration and a Support Company.<ref>[http://www.cigs.ensino.eb.br/ Jungle Warfare Training Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604013506/http://www.cigs.ensino.eb.br/ |date=2007-06-04 }} ''Brazilian Army'', accessed on May 8, 2008. (in Portuguese)</ref>

Although officers and NCOs from all over Brazil can apply to take courses at CIGS, most of the troopers that support training are locals, natives from the area that are mainly privates and corporals. Because they are adapted to the conditions of the life inside the forest, they are more capable of performing a vast array of activities, such as hunting, hiding and moving through the forest with ease. Many foreigners and Brazilian military personnel that underwent training at CIGS have described the impressive abilities shown by these soldiers during operations. Their experience and skills in jungle survival certainly help shaping the Brazilian Jungle Warfare Brigades into deadliest units of its kind in the world.

The Brigades also have experience in combat. Engaged in protecting the northern borders of Brazil, the troops are constantly exposed to attacks from border countries' guerrillas, drug dealers, and criminals of all kinds. The Brazilian Army commonly acts along with other law enforcement organisations in order to fight not only the drugs trafficking, but also animals, weapons, people and several other illegal deeds.

===Paratroopers Brigade===

The Paratroopers Brigade is a major elite unit of the Brazilian Army. Its headquarters is located in Vila Militar, in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Subordinate to the [[Eastern Military Command]], based in Rio de Janeiro, in conjunction with the Land Operations Command, based in [[Brasilia]].

The brigade is one of the elite forces of the Brazilian Army prepared to act on within 48 hours anywhere in the country, is in the jungle, savanna, marsh and mountain, and remain without logistical support for up to 72 hours, being able to parachute jump quickly to the frontlines or behind enemy lines. After completion of the mission, handing territory to another conventional unit to maintain the position gained, according to the doctrine of the Brazilian Army training, usually a unit or a brigade of armoured Infantry will be responsible for replacing the Paratrooper Brigade field after the transfer of the territory to another unit of the Ground Force. The Paratrooper Brigade is then thrown back behind enemy lines once more to make way for the Allied troops.

The Brigade is a fundamental part of the Strategic Task Force (Força de Ação Rápida Estratégica), by being able to quickly operate in any part of the national territory in case of war or invasion.

Due to the deadly and dangerous nature of this brigade's missions, the Brazilian paratroopers have a unique ethos. For instance, while regular infantry troops use black boots and green berets, the paratroopers use brown boots and red berets. They consider themselves superior to the "Pé pretos" (black foots), which are the regular infantrymen. The Brazilian Army's motto, "Brasil acima de tudo!" (Brazil, above everything else) was originally the paratroopers' war cry before it was popularized (nowadays, it's a common greeting between the military to say this motto). The paratroopers are very proud of themselves, and they always stand out when they are among other troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eb.mil.br/|title=Exército Brasileiro|website=Exército Brasileiro}}</ref>

The [[Brazilian Special Operations Brigade|Special Operations Brigade]] is Brazil's [[Special forces|special operations force]]. Although administratively assigned to the Plateau Military Command, the brigade's operations are under the direct control of the Land Operations Command.<ref>[http://www.coter.eb.mil.br Land Operations Command] ''Brazilian Army'', accessed on May 8, 2008. (in Portuguese)</ref>
The Special Forces were initially formed in 1957 as a parachute trained rescue unit, which specialized in conducting deep jungle rescues along the [[Amazon basin]]. After conducting its initial selection, a [[US Army]] Special Forces Mobile Training Team (MTT) conducted the unit's first training course.<ref>[http://www.bdaopesp.eb.mil.br/ Special Operations Brigade] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923015650/http://www.bdaopesp.eb.mil.br/ |date=September 23, 2013 }} ''Brazilian Army'', accessed on May 8, 2008. (in Portuguese)</ref>

Nowadays, it is specialized in non conventional warfare, performing psychological operations and harassing bigger enemy units, such as Brigades and Divisions. Acting in smalls cells and detachments (usually no more than 20 men), the Special Forces act deep behind enemy lines, and are capable of fighting in extremely unfavorable situations.
[[File:Forças especiais, Comandos (26712378835).jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian Special Force counter-terrorism unit]]
For its creation, the Army Command issued decrees organizing the core of the Brigade (Nu Bda Op Esp), reporting initially to the Brigade Parachute Infantry. Most of its subordinate organizations were stationed in the area of Camboatá (West Zone of Rio de Janeiro), where he was the 1st BFEsp, whose commander served, cumulatively, in the initial phase, the command of Nu Bda Op Esp and management of project deployment.

Its motto "any mission, in any place, at any time, by every way" tells all. Related Commandos troops, a battalion the size of Special Operations Brigade, has an analogous motto: "The maximum confusion, death and destruction in the deep rear of the enemy".
[[File:Forças especiais, Comandos (26646206631).jpg|thumb|left|Special command unit, elite troops to operate behind enemy lines]]
It is also capable of performing other types of missions, such as counter-terrorism, strategic scouting, finding and attacking high-value targets and stealing, extracting and evading. Due to the extremely high level of danger of those missions, this unit is composed of only a few members, who must have completed the Comandos and Paraquedista (Commandos and Paratroopers). They are highly specialized and ready to operate anywhere in the world in less than 45 hours. Because of this, they are recognized as one of the most prestigious units in the Brazilian Army.

The unit's baptism of fire took place in the 1970s during operations against the force of the [[Araguaia Guerrilla]], when the hitherto Detachment Special Forces, with their effective command and special forces, was the only unit that fought almost uninterruptedly throughout the campaign, whether in combat actions, or espionage, without the engagement of the controls and special forces of the army, the defeat of the guerrillas would have been more difficult, since such military are experts in counter-guerrilla of the Brazilian Army.

In 1991, guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, entered the Brazilian territory and attacked a small Brazilian Army border contingent, the response was immediate, and the then Special Forces Battalion held in conjunction with other units, retaliation operation, [[Operation Traira]], and the result was 12 dead guerrillas, captured numerous, most of the weapons and equipment recovered.

Recently under the aegis of the United Nations, the Special Operations Brigade played a decisive role in combating the paramilitary groups that plagued the Haitian territory and caused great political instability in the country, and the 1st Special Forces Battalion, 1st Command Action Battalion and the 1st Psychological operations Battalion the only army units that send military in all contingent to MINUSTAH since the beginning of the mission, and special operations performed by these units were fundamental to the pacification of Port-au-Prince.<ref>[[Brazilian Special Operations Command]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}}

===Mountain Operations Brigade===
[[File:Montanha (6124948247).jpg|thumb|right|Mountain light infantry]]
[[File:EB (14981932930).jpg|thumb|left|Mountain soldiers.]]
It's a specialized infantry brigade of the Brazilian Army. Its headquarters is located in [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Minas Gerais]]. Its catchment area covers the state of Minas Gerais and [[Petropolis]]. It is administered by the 1st Army Division / [[Eastern Military Command]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

4th Mountain Infantry Brigade, a unit of the Brazilian Army specializing in mountain combat operation, improving and developing special techniques of mountain operations, and using equipment and weapons specific to this theater of operations, has established itself over the years as an elite troop, even multiplying their special techniques to other Brazilian military units, which will attend their courses and internships, assisting the training of the members of the Strategic Task Force (Força de Ação Rápida Estratégica) of the Brazilian Army.

During [[World War II]], the Brazilian infantry had a major highlight in the conquest of the town of Montese situated in mountainous terrain and heavily defended by the Germans as the last bastion to stop the advancing allied troops toward the [[Po Valley]]. On April 14, 1945, the massive Montese became the scene of the most arduous and bloody battle of Brazilian arms in Italy, in the words of their own Commander [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] Marechal Mascarenhas de Morais. Having eleven main effort of the attack as fighting in dense minefields and under heavy fire from German machine guns, they were finally able to conquer [[Montese]].

}}
The 3rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade, also known as the Viscount of Porto Seguro's Own Brigade, is one of the Brigades of the Brazilian Army. Its headquarters is located in Crystal, in [[Goiás]] State. It is subject to the [[Planalto Military Command]], with headquarters in [[Brasilia]]. Its subordinate military organizations are located in the Federal District and the states of Goiás, [[Tocantins]] and [[Minas Gerais]] region known as Triangulo Mineiro. Its historic name is a tribute to the Viscount of Porto Seguro, Francisco Adolfo Varnhagem.

The 3rd Brigade is part of the strategic reserve of the Brazilian Army, but should be able to be employed at any time and in any part of Brazil. Being a mechanized formation, it can be deployed fast enough anywhere nationwide either for conventional operations or to reinforce the military police in keeping public order, and can still perform promptly any motorized, airmobile or airborne action.

The 1st Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defesne Battalion, raised in 2012 by the redesignation of the Army CBRN Defense Company, is the only one of its kind in the Brazilian Army, and its members are trained for combat in chemical, biological and nuclear warfare (as the name suggests), mainly in control and decontamination of weapons, local and military equipment.

The battalion's origin dates back to 1953, when the Chemical Warfare Company, originally subject to the Reverse Split Units-School (RSUS) was set up on the premises of the Special Education School (SES)

On December 31, 1987, the Chemical Warfare School was extinguished and, in its place, the CBRN Company was created, based in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and subordinated to the Board of Specialization and Extension.

The Caatinga Operations Instructions Center, covering an area of approximately 28,000&nbsp;km², is within the territory of the battalion.

The facilities of the [[Caatinga]] Operations Instructions Center are comprised in an area which belongs to the Ministry of Defence, named the Field Instruction Iron Tank Farm, responsible for the formation of the Caatinga battle combatant in this environment. The vegetation is aggressive and thorny, the sun is very harsh for most of the daytime and water is sparse. The conditions of this area are very difficult to withstand and soldiers who finish this course are acknowledged as Caatinga Warriors of the Brazilian Army, as described by the Brazilian Army in its website (in Portuguese).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cporr.ensino.eb.br/index.php/atividades/144-estagio-de-adaptacao-a-caatinga |title=Estágio de Adaptação à Caatinga |accessdate=2014-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034743/http://www.cporr.ensino.eb.br/index.php/atividades/144-estagio-de-adaptacao-a-caatinga |archive-date=2014-11-29}}</ref>

The Center for Ships of the Military Command of the Amazon is a unique unit within the Brazilian Army, but that very well represents the peculiarities existing in the military organization of the Military Command of the Amazon. Coming from the 1st Special Transport Company, created on October 1, 1969, the  Vessel Center is responsible for tactical and logistical river transport within the scope of the 12th Military Region, a mission that has a constant in overcoming them more varied challenges. In addition to being operational.

The inexistence of cartographic references, lack of signaling of critical points, the regime of the rivers, the isolation, the difficulties in communications, the differentiated maintenance of the means used and the primordial need to have specialized and qualified personnel to safely guide the employed boats, these are just a few examples of the obstacles faced in this peculiar type of transport. In order to meet not only the needs, but also those of the other military organization that have vessels, the Command Boat Center minister under the supervision of the DEE, the River Navigation Course, which lasts 16 weeks, is intended for the training of future vessel commanders.

The Amazon Military Command Vessel Center consists of the Command, 3 Company and 1 Teaching Division.<ref>http://www.cecma.eb.mil.br/</ref>

===Presidential Guard===
[[File:Troca da bandeira na Praça dos Três Poderes, 5 de agosto de 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Presidential Guard Battalion]] during a flag ceremony at the [[Praça dos Três Poderes|Plaza of the Three Powers]]]]

The '''Presidential Guard Battalion''' is a unit of the Brazilian Army and honor guard to the President of Brazil. Two other units, the '''1st Guards Cavalry Regiment''' and the '''Cayenne Battery''', are also part of the presidential honor guard unit, and they all report to Army HQ.

The PGB had its origins in the Emperor's Battalion, organized in 1823 during the peace campaigns that followed the Declaration of Independence as the guards unit for the Imperial Family of Brazil, and as such wears its 19th-century uniforms. Disbanded in 1827, it was reformed in 1933.

[[File:Cavalaria_(28698695514).jpg|thumb|right|200px|1st Guards Cavalry Regiment.]]

The '''1st Guards Cavalry Regiment''', also known as the "Dragões da Independência" (Independence Dragoons), is the squadron-sized horse guards regiment of the Army. The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the Prince Royal of Portugal, Pedro VI, at the time when he declared Brazilian independence from Portugal, on September 7, 1822. The Independence Dragoons wear 19th century uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by Debret, in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the Brazilian Empress Consort was also an Austrian Archduchess.  The color of the plumes varies according to rank. The Independence Dragoons are armed with lances and sabres, the latter only for the officers and the colour guard.
[[File:Cerimônia de comemoração dos 71 anos da Tomada de Monte Castelo (25087385016).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Presidential Guard Battalion]] anti-riot suit.]]

The regiment was established in 1808 by the Prince Regent and future king of Portugal, John VI, with the duty of protecting the Portuguese royal family, which had sought refuge in Brazil during the Napoleonic wars. However, dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century, and in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the Viceroy who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment – Vice-Roy's Horse Guard Squadron). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family. The guard was later disbanded by Emperor Pedro II and would be recreated only later in the republican era, this time as the horse guards unit mandated to defend and protect the [[President of Brazil]] and his First Family, the [[Vice President of Brazil]] and all offices of the national government. At the time of the Republic proclamation in 1889, horse #6 of the Imperial Honor Guard was ridden by the officer making the declaration, Second Lieutenant Eduardo José Barbosa, with the permission of Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca. This is commemorated by the custom under which the horse having this number is used only by the commander of the modern regiment, usually a superior officer with the rank of a lieutenant colonel.

The regiment maintains its own band, which also serves as the official presidential band.

==Ranks, uniforms, and insignia==
{{main|Military ranks of Brazil}}
The senior-most commissioned rank in the Brazilian Army is the "General de Exército" ({{lang-en|[[Army General]]}}), a [[Four-star rank|"four-star" general]]. In times of war, or in exceptional circumstances, a fifth star may be worn by the highest-ranking officer in the army, who is then promoted to "Marechal", ({{lang-en|[[Marshal|Marshal of the Army]]}}). Brazilian Army officers wear rank insignia on shoulder boards and the army has ten officer ranks, also known as "grades", excluding that of an officer candidate.

}}
Brazilian Army officer ranks from second lieutenant to colonel equate directly with counterparts in the United States Army, but thereafter the systems diverge. A Brazilian "General de Brigada" ({{lang-en|[[brigade general]]}}) wears two stars, with duties equivalent to a U.S. Army [[Two-star rank|major general]], the next higher rank, "General de Divisão" ({{lang-en|[[divisional general]]}}), equivalent to an American [[Three-star rank|lieutenant general]], wears three; their United States counterparts have only two and three stars, respectively. The next higher rank, designated by four stars, is "General de Exército" ({{lang-en|Army General}}).  The Marshal wears five stars, but that rank is rarely attained on active duty. This rank is corresponds to an American [[Five-star rank|general of the army]]. The last Marshal of Brazilian Army was [[Waldemar Levy Cardoso]], that died in 2009, with 108 years old.

Brazil's army has strict up-or-out retirement rules, which were developed in the mid-1960s by President Castelo Branco. The internal command structure determines all promotions through the rank of colonel. The president is involved in the promotions to general and chooses one candidate from a list of three names presented to him by the High Command. Once passed over at the Presidential Promotion Board, the non-promotable colonel must retire. All colonels must retire at age fifty-nine and all four-star generals must retire at age sixty-six, or after twelve years as general.
[[File:Quepe do 5A1 de Sargento do Exercito Brasileiro.png|thumb|left|150px|Army sergeant cap.]]
Despite the up-or-out system, under [[President of Brazil|President]] [[José Sarney]] the army became top-heavy as generals began to occupy many positions that previously had been reserved for colonels. In 1991 there were fifteen four-stars, forty three-stars, and 110 two-stars generals. The figure for four-stars generals did not include four who were Ministers in the Superior Military Court (Superior Tribunal Militar—STM). Thus, in the mid-1990s the army sought to reduce the number of active-duty generals. In 2014, there are fifteen four-stars, forty five three-stars, and eighty nine two-stars generals in active service.

The highest Brazilian Army enlisted rank is "Sub Tenente", which is the equivalent of an American [[command sergeant major]] and [[sergeant major]] ranks. The other NCOs are Primeiro Sargento equivalent of an American [[first sergeant]] or [[master sergeant]], "Segundo Sargento" ({{lang-en|second sergeant}}) equivalent to a [[sergeant first class]] and [[staff sergeant]], Terceiro Sargento equivalent to [[sergeant]]. Then there is the Cabo [[corporal]] with the same duties as a sergeant in a regular Army Infantry Platoon, acting as the Squad Leader. The Brazilian Army has no corresponding equivalent to the U.S. Army's [[Specialist (rank)|specialist]] rank. The "Soldado" is equivalent to a [[private first class]] or to a [[Private (rank)|private]] depending on the length of service time.
