The '''''Montreal Gazette''''', formerly titled '''''The Gazette''''', is the only English-language daily newspaper published in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Three other daily English-language newspapers shuttered at various times during the second half of the 20th century. It is one of the French-speaking province's last two English-language dailies; the other is the ''[[Sherbrooke Record]]'', which serves the anglophone community in the Eastern Townships southeast of Montreal.

Founded in 1778 by [[Fleury Mesplet]], ''The Gazette'' is Quebec's oldest daily newspaper and Canada's oldest daily newspaper still in publication.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/about-montreal-gazette/aboutus.html|title=About Us|work=The Gazette|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2016}} The oldest newspaper overall is the English-language ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph]]'', which was established in 1764 and is published weekly.

==History==
[[File:Gazette Montreal.png|thumb|left|upright|Offices of ''The Gazette'' in the [[Dominion Square Building]] on [[Saint Catherine Street]] in [[Montreal]]]]

[[Fleury Mesplet]] founded a French-language weekly newspaper called ''La Gazette du commerce et littéraire, pour la ville et district de Montréal'' on June 3, 1778.<ref name=biographi>{{cite journal|last=Galarneau|first=Claude|title=MESPLET, FLEURY|journal=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|year=1979|volume=4|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mesplet_fleury_4E.html|accessdate=16 October 2013|publisher=[[University of Toronto]] / [[Université Laval]]}}</ref> It was the first entirely French-language newspaper in Canada.<ref name=biographi /> The paper did not accept advertising aside for the various books that Mesplet also published. The articles were meant to promote discussion, and it focused on [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], as well as various anecdotal articles, [[poetry|poems]] and letters.<ref name=biographi /> [[Benjamin Franklin]] encouraged Mesplet to found the newspaper to persuade Canadians to join the [[American Revolution]];<ref name="dougherty20170128">{{Cite news |url=https://ipolitics.ca/2017/01/28/meet-the-man-trying-to-pull-quebec-into-trumps-america/ |title=Meet the man trying to pull Quebec into Trump's America - iPolitics |last=Dougherty |first=Kevin |date=2017-01-28 |work=iPolitics |access-date=2018-02-16 |language=en-US}}</ref> Mesplet, an immigrant from France, had previously lived in [[Philadelphia]] and supported the Americans when they occupied Montreal during the war. The newspaper was shut down in 1779 when Mesplet and the editor, [[Valentin Jautard]], were arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned for three years.

Mesplet began a second weekly, ''The Montreal Gazette / La Gazette de Montréal'', on August 25, 1785, which had a dual French-English bilingual format similar to that used by the ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]''.<ref name=biographi /> Its offices were located in the house of Joseph Lemoyne de Longueuil on rue de la Capitale.<ref name=Vieux>{{cite web|title=Montreal Gazette / La Gazette de Montréal en 1785|url=http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/inventaire/fiches/fiche_gro.php?id=34|publisher=Vieux-Montréal|accessdate=17 October 2013|language=French|date=22 April 2002}}</ref>  French columns were in the left-hand column and English columns in the right-hand column. The columns were originally written in French and translated to English by Valentin Jautard, who served as editor until his death in 1787.<ref name=biographi /> The columns were mostly on education, religion, and literature, and after 1788 on politics.<ref name=biographi /> Foreign and local news made up the rest of the paper. The paper took a [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] and [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] stance, wanted Quebec to have its own [[legislative assembly]] and sought to import the principles of the [[French Revolution]] to Quebec.<ref name=biographi /> The newspaper also introduced advertising and announcements, taking up half of four pages. It is the direct ancestor of the current newspaper. The newspaper did well, and Mesplet's operation moved to [[Notre-Dame Street]] in 1787. Mesplet continued to operate the newspaper until his death in 1794.<ref name=biographi />

Following Mesplet's death, his widow published the newspaper for several issues, but the paper ceased publication soon after. Two rivals, Louis Roy and Edward Edwards fought over the right to publish the newspaper over the course of two years.<ref name=Vieux /> Edwards eventually won the printing press and newspaper and continued operations until his assets were seized in 1808.<ref name=Vieux /> The newspaper was then the property of James Brown for fourteen years. In 1822, it was sold to businessman Thomas Andrew Turner who converted into an English-only paper in 1822.<ref name=about /><ref name=Vieux /> Under Turner, ''The Gazette'' identified with the interests of anglophone business leaders in their fight with the [[Patriote movement]].<ref name=Vieux />

On April 25, 1849, ''The Gazette'' published a special edition in which its editor-in-chief, [[James Moir Ferres]], called the "[[Anglo-Saxon]]" residents to arms after Royal Assent of a compensation law for Lower Canada.<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Disgrace_of_Great_Britain_accomplished!?match=fr|title=The Disgrace of Great Britain accomplished!|last=Moir Ferres|first=James|date=April 25, 1849|publisher=Wikisource|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref> This was among the main events leading to the [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burning of the Parliament Buildings]]. Ferres was subsequently arrested, though soon released on bail and set free without trial.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ste-Croix |first1=Lorne |title=Ferres James Moir |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ferres_james_moir_9E.html |website=Dictionary Of Canadian Biography |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref>

In 1968, ''The Gazette'' was acquired by the [[Southam Inc.|Southam]] newspaper chain, which owned major dailies across Canada.<ref name="about"/>

For many years, ''The Gazette'' was caught in a three-way fight for the English newspaper audience in Montreal with the tabloid ''[[Montreal Herald]]'' and the broadsheet ''[[Montreal Star]]''.<ref name=TCE>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Porter|first=Jessica|title=Montreal Gazette|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/montreal-gazette|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>  ''The Gazette'' was second in circulation to the ''Montreal Star'', which sold more newspapers in the city and had a significant national reputation in the first half of the 20th century. The ''Montreal Herald'' closed in 1957, after publishing for 146 years. The ''Montreal Star'', part of the FP Publications chain (which owned the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' and, at the time, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''), endured a long strike and ceased publication in 1979, less than a year after the strike was settled.
[[File:Gazette reader.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue in [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] of man reading ''The Gazette'']]
In 1988, a competing English-language daily, the ''[[Montreal Daily News]]'', was launched. The ''Montreal Daily News'' adopted a tabloid format and introduced a Sunday edition, forcing ''The Gazette'' to respond. After the ''Montreal Daily News'' closed in 1989, after less than two years in operation, ''The Gazette'' kept its Sunday edition going until August 2010.

In 1996, the Southam papers were bought by [[Conrad Black]]'s [[Hollinger Inc.]] Then in August 2000, Hollinger sold the Southam newspapers, including ''The Gazette'', to [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications Corp.]], controlled by the Winnipeg-based Asper family. In 2010, a new media group, [[Postmedia]], bought the Gazette and other papers from the financially troubled Canwest.<ref name=TCE />

To celebrate its 150th anniversary, ''The Gazette'' published a [[facsimile]] of one of its earliest issues. Much effort was made to use a type of paper that imitated 18th century paper, with fake chainlines and laidlines to make the paper look old.<ref>"Document Doubles" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/forgery/002035-500-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001063539/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/forgery/002035-500-e.html |date=October 1, 2007 }}, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

==Today==
Today, ''The Gazette''{{'}}s audience is primarily Quebec's English-speaking community. ''The Gazette'' is one of the three dailies published in Montreal, the other two being French-language newspapers: ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'' and ''[[Le Devoir]]''. (''[[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]'' is only published digitally since 2018.)

In recent years, ''The Gazette'' has stepped up efforts to reach bilingual francophone professionals and adjusted its coverage accordingly. The current editor-in-chief is Lucinda Chodan and the associate managing editors are James Bassil and Jeff Blond.<ref name=Contact />

On April 30, 2013, [[Postmedia Network]] announced that it would be eliminating the role of publisher at each of its newspapers, including ''The Gazette''. Instead, the company's 10 newspapers was overseen by regional publishers, one each for the Pacific, the Prairies and eastern Canada. Alan Allnutt, who was the publisher of ''The Gazette'' at the time, became the regional publisher of Postmedia's [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] papers. Gerry Nott, publisher of the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', now also oversees ''The Gazette'', the ''[[Windsor Star]]'' and Postmedia's flagship title, the ''[[National Post]]''.<ref name=FinancialPost>{{cite news|last=Dobby|first=Christine|title=Postmedia eliminates publisher positions as part of wider restructuring|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/30/postmedia-publisher-positions-eliminated/?__lsa=c562-1756|accessdate=17 October 2013|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=2013-04-30}}</ref> On May 5, 2014, it was announced that printing of ''The Gazette'' would be contracted out to [[Transcontinental Media]] in August 2014 and that the existing Notre-Dame-de-Grâce facility would be closed, resulting in a loss of 54 full-time and 61 part-time positions at the paper. The August 16, 2014 issue was the final issue printed by the Postmedia-owned facility.<ref name=global-tcprinting>{{cite web|title=Postmedia outsourcing Gazette printing to Transcontinental|url=http://www.postmedia.com/2014/05/05/postmedia-network-to-outsource-montreal-printing/|website=Global News|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=ctv-closed>{{cite news|title=Montreal Gazette outsources printing, closes NDG plant|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-gazette-outsources-printing-closes-ndg-plant-1.1962741|accessdate=25 August 2014|work=CTV Montreal}}</ref>

On October 21, 2014, ''The Gazette'' was relaunched as part of the Postmedia Reimagined project, adopting a similar look, and a similar suite of digital platforms, to its sister paper, the ''Ottawa Citizen'', which had relaunched earlier in the year. As part of the relaunch, the paper was officially renamed the ''Montreal Gazette'', reflecting its longstanding common name outside its city of publication (as well as its Web domain, ''montrealgazette.com'').  The paper had not included Montreal in its masthead in several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2014/10/21/the-gazette-reimagined/|title=Montreal Gazette redesigns paper, launches new website and iPad and smartphone apps|first=Steve|last=Faguy|work=Fagstein|date=2014-10-21|accessdate=2014-10-26}}</ref> The new typeface and style introduced with the rename has been criticized as being "sub-par".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_montreal_gazette_by_winkreative.php |title= New Logo for Montreal Gazette by Winkreative – It Gazucks |publisher= Brand New |work= Noted |date= 30 October 2014 }}</ref>
