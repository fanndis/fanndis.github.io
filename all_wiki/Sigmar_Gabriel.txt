He was [[chairman|Leader]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from 2009 to 2017,<ref name="auto2">Holger Hansen and Madeline Chambers (January 5, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-spd-idUSKBN14P27A SPD leader Gabriel expected to challenge Merkel in German: sources] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> which made him the party's longest-serving leader since [[Willy Brandt]].<ref name="auto2"/> He was the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister of the Environment]] from 2005 to 2009 and the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany)|Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy]] from 2013 to 2017. From 1999 to 2003 Gabriel was [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Minister-President of Lower Saxony]].

Gabriel is a member of the [[Seeheimer Kreis]], an official internal grouping of the party with [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] positions.

==Early life and education==
Gabriel was born in [[Goslar]], [[West Germany]], the son of Walter Gabriel (1921–2012), a municipal civil servant, and Antonie Gabriel (1922–2014), a nurse. Gabriel's parents divorced in 1962, and for the next six years he lived with his father and grandmother Lina Gabriel, while his sister lived with their mother. After a lengthy custody battle his mother was awarded custody for both children in 1969.

Gabriel's father was a [[Lutheran]] originally from [[Jelenia Góra|Hirschberg im Riesengebirge]] in [[Silesia]] (now [[Poland]]), while his mother was a [[Catholic]] originally from [[Lidzbark Warmiński|Heilsberg]] in the [[Warmia|Ermland (Warmia)]] region of [[East Prussia]] who had most recently lived in [[Königsberg]]; both parents came as refugees to West Germany during the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|flight and expulsion of Germans]] at the end of the Second World War. 
Sigmar Gabriel has described his family history as a "wild story of flight and expulsion" and noted that his parents dealt with the trauma of expulsion in different ways. According to Gabriel, his father was physically and emotionally abusive to him<ref name="irishtimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/spd-leader-praised-for-speaking-of-nazi-father-1.957281|title=SPD leader praised for speaking of Nazi father}}</ref> and was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[national socialism|national socialist]] ideology "until his dying breath;"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/06/12/vicekanselier-trekt-vergelijking-tussen-afd-en-nazi-ideologie|title=Vicekanselier vergelijkt AfD met nazi-ideologie}}</ref> However, Walter Gabriel never saw active service during the war due to suffering from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taz.de/!5075647/|title=Sigmar Gabriel spricht über seine Familie: Mein Vater, der Fulltime-Nazi|first=Stefan|last=Reinecke|via=taz.de|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung: Taz|date=2013-01-10}}</ref> His mother was involved in relief and solidarity work for Poland during the period of [[martial law in Poland]].<ref name="rhein-zeitung">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.deregion_artikel,-sigmar-gabriel-ganz-privat-in-zell-an-der-mosel-verbrachte-er-die-gluecklichsten-tage-seiner-kindheit-_arid,1389811.html|title=Sigmar Gabriel ganz privat: In Zell an der Mosel verbrachte er die glücklichsten Tage seiner Kindheit - Region - Rhein-Zeitung}}</ref>

==Political career==
===Early beginnings===
Gabriel joined the SPD in 1977 and soon held a number of positions in local politics. In 1990, he was first elected to the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|State Parliament]] of [[Lower Saxony]], where he led the SPD parliamentary group from 1998 until 1999.<ref>Armin Fuhrer (November 29, 1999), [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article560313/Der-Enkel-des-Kanzlers.html Der Enkel des Kanzlers] ''[[Die Welt]]''.</ref>

===Minister-President of Lower Saxony, 1999–2003===
On 15 December 1999, after the resignation of [[Gerhard Glogowski]], who had succeeded [[Gerhard Schröder]] in office, Gabriel became [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]]. He had previously won an internal party vote against [[Wolfgang Jüttner]] and [[Thomas Oppermann]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glogowski-ruecktritt-sigmar-gabriel-soll-neuer-ministerpraesident-werden-a-54239.html Sigmar Gabriel soll neuer Ministerpräsident werden] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', November 27, 1999.</ref> He served until 4 March 2003. During these years, he was widely presented as a protégé of Schröder, and even as a possible successor as chancellor.<ref>Richard Bernstein (January 31, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/world/elections-in-2-german-states-may-be-setback-to-schroder.html Elections in 2 German States May Be Setback to Schröder] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

After being voted out of office in 2003, Gabriel became the SPD's "Representative for Pop Culture and Pop Discourse" from 2003 to 2005, for which he was bestowed the nickname ''Siggi Pop''.<ref name="zeitde2010-02">[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-02/gabriel-opposition Wir sind nicht aus Versehen Opposition?], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 02/07/2010; ''>2003 wurde Gabriel SPD-Beauftragter für "Popkultur und Popdiskurs" – was ihm den Spitznamen "Siggi Pop" eintrug<''</ref>

===Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2005–2009===
From 2005 to 2009 Gabriel was the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany)|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] in the [[First Merkel cabinet|first cabinet]] of [[Angela Merkel]] (CDU).

During his time in office, Gabriel promoted the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]]. He also led the German delegation to the [[2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Nairobi]].<ref>Andrew Beatty, Judith Crosbie, Stewart Fleming, Emily Smith and Simon Taylor (December 13, 2006), [http://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-movers-and-shakers-2/ Germany’s movers and shakers] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref> In 2007, when Germany held the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], he led the negotiations between European Union environment ministers on an ambitious effort to cut [[greenhouse gases|greenhouse gas emissions]] to 20 percent below 1990 levels.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/21/world/fg-eu21 EU may aim for 20% cut in greenhouse gases] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 21, 2007.</ref> That same year, he accompanied Merkel on a two-day visit to [[Greenland]] to see the [[Ilulissat Icefjord]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO world heritage site]], and the [[Jakobshavn Glacier|Sermeq Kujalleq]] glacier in order to get a firsthand look at the effects of global warming.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/arctic-thaw-merkel-inspects-a-changing-climate-in-greenland-a-500486.html Arctic Thaw: Merkel Inspects a Changing Climate in Greenland] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', August 17, 2007.</ref>

===Opposition leader, 2009–2013===
Following the SPD's defeat in the [[2009 German federal election|federal election of 2009]], [[Franz Müntefering]] resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Gabriel was nominated as his successor and was elected on 13 November 2009.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,661227,00.html ''Spiegel Online'' 11/13/2009].</ref> He was re-elected as party chairman for a further two years at the SPD party conference in Berlin on 5 December 2011, receiving 91.6 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gabriel-als-spd-chef-wiedergewaehlt-wind-unter-den-fluegeln-der-sozialdemokratie-1.1226716|access-date=2011-12-06|title=Wind unter den Flügeln der Sozialdemokratie}}</ref>

During his early years as chairman, Gabriel pushed through internal party reforms. He abolished the party steering committee in favor of an expanded executive committee and led the regular party conventions, the most important meetings for the party.<ref>Bettina Marx (December 14, 2013), [http://www.dw.de/sigmar-gabriel-losing-his-way-to-the-top/a-17296572 Sigmar Gabriel: Losing his way to the top] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref> He also played a critical role in founding the [[Progressive Alliance (political international)|Progressive Alliance]] in 2013 by canceling the SPD payment of its £100,000 yearly membership fee to the [[Socialist International]] in January 2012. Gabriel had been critical of the Socialist International's admittance and continuing inclusion of undemocratic "despotic" political movements into the organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/a-810543.html |title=SPD will Sozialistischer Internationale den Geldhahn zudrehen und den Mitgliedsbeitrag nicht zahlen|publisher=Spiegel.de [[Spiegel Online]] |date=2012-01-22 |access-date=2013-05-23|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sigmar Gabriel |url=http://www.fr-online.de/meinung/keine-kumpanei-mit-despoten,1472602,7705378.html |title=Gastbeitrag: Keine Kumpanei mit Despoten &#124; Meinung – Frankfurter Rundschau |language=de |publisher=Fr-online.de |date=2011-02-03 |access-date=2013-05-23}}</ref>

For the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], Gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] but deemed too “unpopular and undisciplined” at the time.<ref>Noah Barkin (September 3, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/business/global/merkels-opponents-struggle-to-find-relevant-issues.html Merkel's Opponents Struggle to Find Relevant Issues] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> As a consequence, he and the other members of the party's leadership agreed to nominate [[Peer Steinbrück]] after [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], the party's parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.<ref>Melissa Eddy (September 28, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/europe/merkels-former-finance-minister-set-to-run-against-her.html Merkel’s Ex-Finance Minister to Oppose Her] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

During the election campaign, Gabriel became the first SPD leader to address a party convention of [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]; in his speech, he called for a [[red–green alliance]] to defeat Merkel in the elections.<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (April 27, 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/27/germany-greens-idUSL6N0DE09S20130427 German SPD leader woos Greens for anti-Merkel alliance] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2013, Gabriel turned the Social Democrats’ third successive defeat to [[Angela Merkel]] in the [[2013 German federal election|federal election]] into a share of government, after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members, who endorsed the accord.<ref name="bloomberg.com">Patrick Donahue (December 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-15/merkel-s-third-term-cabinet-social-democratic-party-ministers.html Merkel’s Third-Term Cabinet: Social Democratic Party Ministers] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.</ref> At the time, he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully, particularly considering the relative weakness of his party, which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections, against more than 41 percent for Merkel's conservative bloc.<ref>Alison Smale (December 14, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/europe/social-democrats-secure-a-third-term-for-merkel.html Social Democrats Secure a Third Term for Merkel] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

At an SPD convention shortly after the elections, however, Gabriel and the other members of the party's leadership were punished by delegates who re-elected them to their posts with reduced majorities; he received 83.6 percent of members’ ballots after 91.6 percent at the previous vote in 2011.<ref>Brian Parkin and Birgit Jennen (November 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/german-spd-chief-set-to-sell-party-on-merkel-coalition.html German SPD Chief Set to Sell Party on Merkel Coalition] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

Gabriel, who serves as vice-chancellor in the [[third Merkel cabinet]], took on responsibility for [[Energy transition in Germany|Germany's energy overhaul]] as part of a newly configured Economy Ministry.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/> Since late 2016, he has been a member of the German government's cabinet committee on [[Brexit]] at which ministers discuss organizational and structural issues related to the [[United Kingdom]]'s departure from the [[European Union]].<ref>Joseph Nasr (January 13, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-germany-idUSKBN14X15Y Merkel to chair first Brexit committee meeting next week] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Gabriel also announced that he will succeed [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].

As Foreign Minister Gabriel has said Germany's "arms will remain outstretched" to the US to continue the trans-Atlantic alliance between the two countries. However he has said that Germany will step into global markets the US abandons and take on a bigger role on the international stage if Donald Trump continues his protectionist and isolationist policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/germany-to-enter-areas-where-us-retreats-top-envoy-says-20170127-gu0gfv.html|title=Germany to enter areas where US retreats, top envoy says|first=Patrick|last=Donahue|date=28 January 2017}}</ref>

===Life after politics, 2018-present===
Since leaving public office, Gabriel has taken on various paid and unpaid positions. 

In 2018, Gabriel was among six of 11 candidates nominated by [[Siemens]] to join the board of directors of Siemens Alstom, a planned merger of two railway companies;<ref>Douglas Busvine (May 15, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alstom-siemens/germanys-ex-foreign-minister-to-join-board-of-franco-german-rail-venture-idUSKCN1IG35V Germany's ex-foreign minister to join board of Franco-German rail venture] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> he ended up not taking the office when the merger was prohibited by the [[European Commission]] amid competition concerns. Also in 2018, the German government's ethics committee rejected his request to join the supervisory board of [[Kulczyk Investments]], citing potential [[conflict of interest]].<ref>[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gabriel-bundesregierung-103.html Arbeit für polnischen Konzern: Regierung verbot Gabriel Aufsichtsratsposten] ''[[Tagesschau (German TV series)|Tagesschau]]'', August 16, 2019.</ref><ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/germany-bars-ex-foreign-minister-from-job-with-polish-firm/a-50058646 Germany bars ex-foreign minister from job with Polish firm] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 16, 2019.</ref> In 2019, he rejected an offer to become the head of the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|German Association of the Automotive Industry]] (VDA) after media reports that he was in line for the post caused a public outcry and prompted accusations of nepotism.<ref>Michael Nienaber (November 5, 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-autos/ex-foreign-minister-gabriel-rejects-offer-to-head-german-auto-lobby-idUSKBN1XF2AN Ex-foreign minister Gabriel rejects offer to head German auto lobby] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> More recently, he said Donald Trump is right to criticize China and to negotiate with North Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-center-left-spds-ex-leader-gabriel-gives-trump-praise/a-49046966|title=German center-left SPD's ex-leader Gabriel gives Trump praise|date=4 June 2019|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref>

Gabriel has been staunchly against German soldiers remaining in [[Afghanistan]]. In 2010, he called for an independent assessment that would determine whether the U.S. [[Counterinsurgency in Northern Afghanistan|counter-insurgency strategy]] would succeed.<ref>Judy Dempsey (April 22, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/world/europe/23iht-germany.html Merkel Tries to Beat Back Opposition to Afghanistan] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> However, he voted in favor of extending German participation in the [[NATO]]-led security mission [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/bilateral/pages/bilateral%20agreements%20reached%20at%20first%20israeli-german%20intergovernmental%20consultations%2017-mar-2008.aspx Bilateral agreements reached at first Israeli-German intergovernmental consultations] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], press release of March 17, 2008.</ref> In 2012, after having visited [[Hebron]] and the [[Palestinian territories]], he said the Palestinians in those areas were systematically discriminated against and called Israel an "[[Apartheid|Apartheid Regime]]".<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=261998 ''Jerusalem Post'' 15/03/2012].</ref>

In one of the strongest comments by Germany to push for a federal solution for [[Ukraine]], Gabriel told German weekly ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'' in August 2014 that a federal structure was the only option to resolve [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest]] in the country. He added that Germany's priority was to prevent direct conflict between Russia and its southern neighbour.<ref>Roman Olearchyk and Jeevan Vasagar (August 23, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b0b440c-2ac8-11e4-811d-00144feabdc0.html Germany urges Ukraine to accept federal solution with separatists] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Commenting on the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|international sanctions regime]] against Russia, Gabriel stated in early 2015 that “we want to help resolve the conflict in Ukraine but don’t want to force Russia to its knees.”<ref>Henry Meyer and Volodymyr Verbyany (January 4, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-04/ukraine-in-talks-with-separatists-on-prisoner-exchangeria-says.html Ukraine in Talks With Rebels on Prisoner Exchange, RIA Says] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> He later suggested that Europe consider easing sanctions in exchange for cooperation in [[Syria]].<ref>Noah Barkin (November 22, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/22/us-mideast-crisis-russia-germany-idUSKBN0TB0QQ20151122 Russia serious about solution in Syria, German minister says] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Ukrainian-American historian [[Alexander J.

[[File:Meeting with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel 6.jpg|thumb|left|Gabriel with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], 9 March 2017]]

In September 2015, amid the [[European migrant crisis]], Gabriel visited the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] in [[Jordan]] to learn more about the plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrians]] fleeing the violence in the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] that erupted in 2011.<ref>Annekarin Lammers (September 22, 2015), [https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/gabriel-jordanien-101.html Gabriel in Flüchtlingslager in Jordanien: "Demütig wird man hier"] ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]''.</ref> Gabriel publicly urged [[Saudi Arabia]] to stop supporting [[religious]] radicals, amid growing concern among about the country's funding of [[Wahhabi]] mosques in Germany which are accused of breeding dangerous [[Islamists]].<ref>Madeline Chambers (December 6, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-germany-idUSKBN0TP0H720151206 German Vice Chancellor warns Saudi Arabia over Islamist funding] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

[[File:Secretary Tillerson Meets With German Foreign Minister Gabriel (33913288223).jpg|thumb|Gabriel and U.S. Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] in Washington, D.C., 17 May 2017]]
In January 2016, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and [[Turkey]] in Berlin.<ref>[https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2016/01/2015-01-15-deu-tuerk-regierungskonsultationen-breg.html Erste Deutsch-Türkische Regierungskonsultationen in Berlin] [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government of Germany]], press release of January 15, 2016.</ref> Later that year, he called any [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] in the near term an "illusion."<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/turkish-eu-accession-far-off-says-gabriel/a-19455171 Turkish EU accession far off, says Gabriel] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 8, 2016.</ref>

After the [[G7]] summit in 2017, Gabriel stated that the United States, with [[Donald Trump]] as president, has "weakened" the West and that the balance of power has now shifted. The remark comes days after Merkel stated, in an apparent policy shift, that "Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands".<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump's actions have 'weakened' the West, German foreign minister says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/europe/angela-merkel-uk-amber-rudd/|agency=CNN|date=29 May 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017, Gabriel criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against [[Russia]] that target EU–Russia energy projects, including [[Nord Stream|Nord Stream 2]] gas pipeline. In a joint statement Gabriel and Austria's Chancellor [[Christian Kern]] said that "Europe's energy supply is a matter for Europe, and not for the United States of America."<ref>"[https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2017-06-15/germany-austria-slam-us-sanctions-against-russia Germany, Austria Slam US Sanctions Against Russia]".

''[[Politico]]''. June 15, 2017.</ref>
[[File:Sigmar Gabriel MSC 2018.jpg|thumb|Gabriel during the [[Munich Security Conference|MSC]] 2018]]
Gabriel is a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. He argued the U.N. needed to be made "more effective, transparent, and democratic through a reform of its structures and decision-making procedures".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/statements/page/3/|title=Statements|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

In February 2018, Gabriel accused [[Russia]] and [[China]] of trying to "undermine" the liberal Western world order. He said that "Nobody should attempt to divide the European Union: not Russia, not China and also not the United States."<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's Gabriel: 'We need a European moment' |url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-gabriel-we-need-a-european-moment/a-42624573 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=17 February 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, Gabriel said that "Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians experienced unfathomable suffering in [[World War II]].

In March 2018, after his departure as German foreign minister, Gabriel published an opinion piece about the future of the relations between [[Turkey]] (under [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] rule) and the West, where he advocated for an inclusive stance towards Turkey and criticized the policy of the United States in that regard.<ref>[https://causa.tagesspiegel.de/politik/nach-afrin-welches-verhaeltnis-hat-der-westen-zur-tuerkei/afrin-ist-eine-botschaft-an-die-usa.html ''Die Türkei und der Westen nach Afrin: Afrin ist eine Botschaft an die USA''] (in German, ''"Turkey and the West after Afrin: Afrin is a message for the USA"''), causa.tagesspiegel.de, 24 March 2018</ref> In February 2020, he joined around fifty former European prime ministers and foreign ministers in signing an open letter published by British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' to condemn [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]]’s [[Trump peace plan|Middle East peace plan]], saying it would create an [[apartheid]]-like situation in occupied Palestinian territory.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/grave-concern-about-us-plan-to-resolve-israel-palestine-conflict Grave concern about US plan to resolve Israel-Palestine conflict] ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 27, 2020.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Howcroft (February 27, 2020), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-plan-letter/former-european-leaders-say-trumps-middle-east-peace-plan-akin-to-apartheid-idUSKCN20L27A Former European leaders say Trump's Middle East peace plan akin to apartheid] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Economic policy===
On the occasion of the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit|G20 summit in 2011]], Gabriel joined [[Ed Miliband]], the leader of the UK's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and [[Håkan Juholt]], the chairman of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], in suggesting a “new deal” for economic growth. They also said G20 leaders should commit to the introduction of a [[financial transaction tax]] for all major financial centers and an agreement to separate consumer and [[investment banking]].<ref>Angela Cullen (November 3, 2011), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-03/german-u-k-swedish-left-calls-for-g20-deal-handelsblatt-says.html German, U.K., Swedish Left Calls for G20 Deal, Handelsblatt Says] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.</ref>

In a letter to the [[European Commissioner for Trade]], [[Karel De Gucht]], Gabriel stated in March 2014 that “special investment-protection provisions are not required in an agreement between the E.U. and the U.S” on a [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP).<ref>James Kanter (March 27, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/business/international/eu-tries-to-assuage-fears-over-us-trade-deal.html E.U. Tries to Assuage Fears Over U.S. Trade Deal] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Instead, he later called for a public trade and investment court to replace the current system of private arbitration, and to enable appeals against arbitration rulings.<ref>Benjamin Fox (May 6, 2015), [https://euobserver.com/news/128588 EU unveils plans for global investor court] ''[[EUobserver]]''.</ref> Meanwhile, he has continuously warned against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from TTIP but maintained that the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers.<ref>Madeline Chambers (April 11, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/11/us-eu-usa-germany-idUSKBN0N20C020150411 German economy minister plays down boost from EU-U.S. trade deal: magazine] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> By August 2016, Gabriel said talks on TTIP had "de facto" failed.<ref name="Caroline Copley 2016">Caroline Copley (September 16, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-trade-germany-gabriel-idUSKCN11M0ZU Germany's Gabriel faces crunch vote over EU-Canada trade deal] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In September 2014, Gabriel rejected the inclusion of an [[investor-state dispute settlement]] clause in the [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (CETA) between [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]], prompting a renegotiation that delayed the entry into force of the agreement.<ref>Jonathan Stearns (September 29, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-29/malmstroem-warns-germany-against-altering-eu-canada-pact Malmstroem Warns Germany Against Altering EU-Canada Pact] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.</ref> Following the renegotiations, he championed CETA to demonstrate the center-left party's business credentials.<ref name="Caroline Copley 2016"/>

In a 2014 meeting with French economist [[Thomas Piketty]], whose best-selling work ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' calls for a [[wealth tax]], Gabriel rejected such a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] levy on capital as “crazy” for business. He also argued that a wealth tax would generate no more than 8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) a year.<ref>Patrick Donahue (November 7, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-11-07/merkel-deputy-tells-piketty-wealth-tax-is-dead-in-germany Merkel Deputy Tells Piketty Wealth Tax Is Dead in Germany] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.</ref>

Together with his French counterpart [[Emmanuel Macron]], Gabriel presented a joint proposal in 2015 to set up a common [[eurozone]] budget.<ref>Michel Rose (November 25, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/25/us-france-shooting-fund-idUSKBN0TE0FA20151125 Franco-German risk fund could be set up in weeks if political will: source] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Energy policy===
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011, Gabriel harshly criticized the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], saying it had promoted “the construction of nuclear plants in all parts of the world, even in war and crisis regions. That needs to stop.”<ref>Judy Dempsey (March 13, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/europe/14atom.html Japan's Nuclear Crisis Stokes Fear in Europe] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In 2015, Gabriel opposed a [[European Commission]] proposal for regional power-capacity markets, according to which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]], such as the sun and wind, cannot supply the grid. A free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets, Gabriel told ''[[Handelsblatt]]''.<ref>Stefan Nicola, Tino Andresen and Weixin Zha (January 20, 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-20/germany-s-eon-facing-off-with-merkel-over-capacity-market Germany’s EON Facing Off With Merkel Over Capacity Market] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> He later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation, concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022.<ref>Vera Eckert, Tom Kaeckenhoff, Christoph Steitz and Caroline Copley (January 19, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/articlerwe-coal-idUSL8N1531X2 Germany warns against rushed exit from coal power]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Arms exports===
Early in his tenure as Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, Gabriel vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports, unnerving the sizeable defense industry and signaling a change in policy from the [[Second Merkel cabinet|previous coalition government]] under which sales rose.<ref>Alexandra Hudson and Thorsten Severin (May 18, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/18/us-germany-defence-exports-idUSBREA4H06220140518 German economy minister pledges to restrict arms exports] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In August 2014, he withdrew permission for [[Rheinmetall]] to build a military training center east of Moscow.<ref>Rainer Buergin and Richard Weiss (August 4, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-04/germany-blocks-combat-training-center-for-russia.html Germany Blocks Rheinmetall Sale of Russian Combat Center] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.</ref>

Gabriel was bound by pledges to his SPD to reduce arms sales to states that abuse human rights and the rule of law or where such sales may contribute to political instability. He stated that controls over the final destination of small arms sold to such nations are still insufficient.<ref>Brian Parkin (October 15, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-15/german-arms-exports-permit-crackdown-hits-airbus-heckler-and-koch German Arms-Exports Permit Crackdown Hits Airbus, Heckler & Koch] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.</ref> However, he also indicated that the government would not universally block deals with countries outside of Germany's traditional alliances. Deals with such countries could be approved because of "special foreign-policy or security interests."<ref>Anton Troianovski (June 11, 2014), [https://online.wsj.com/articles/german-arms-exports-to-non-allies-soar-1402508012 German Arms Exports to Non-Allies Soar] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> In late 2015, his ministry approved a merger of German tank maker [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]] (KMW) with the French armoured vehicle maker [[Nexter]].<ref>Michael Nienaber (December 4, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nexter-m-a-kmw-idUSKBN0TN12O20151204 Germany approves merger of tank maker KMW with French Nexter] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Gabriel has been criticized by opposition leaders and the press for failing to prevent several deals that resulted in a significant rise in German arms exports during his tenure,<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-weapons-exports-reach-highest-level-ever-in-2015-1467817067 German Weapons Exports Reached Highest Level on Record in 2015] in: ''wsj.com'', updated July 6, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-cabinet-approved-record-breaking-arms-exports/a-42282068 Germany's cabinet approved record-breaking arms exports] in: ''dw.com'', 24 January 2018</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nordbayern.de/politik/rustungsexporte-wie-gabriel-seine-glaubwurdigkeit-verspielt-1.7142814|title=Rüstungsexporte: Wie Gabriel seine Glaubwürdigkeit verspielt|last=Germany|first=nordbayern.de, Nürnberg|access-date=2018-03-08|language=de-DE}}</ref> although a paradigm shift (lifting of the prohibition against arms exports in zones of war and crisis) already occurred before that.<ref>[http://www.fr.de/politik/waffenexporte-die-merkel-doktrin-a-831219 Waffenexporte: Die Merkel-Doktrin], (in German) fr.de, 1.

===Digital policy===
In May 2014, Gabriel and France's economy and digital minister [[Arnaud Montebourg]] sent the [[European Commissioner for Competition]], [[Joaquín Almunia]], a letter criticizing the settlement of a three-year antitrust probe into [[Google]];<ref>Aoife White (May 23, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-23/google-settlement-is-defended-by-eu-s-almunia-after-criticism.html Google Settlement Is Defended by EU’s Almunia After Criticism] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.]]''.</ref> Gabriel later “warmly welcomed” the launch of EU antitrust charges against Google in April 2015.<ref>Jeevan Vasagar (April 15, 2015), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1485980a-e377-11e4-aa97-00144feab7de.html Google’s foes in Germany and France cheer antitrust charges] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In September 2014, Gabriel called [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Apple Inc.]] “anti-social” for skirting appropriate taxation.<ref>Cornelius Rahn, Brian Parkin and Stephanie Bodoni (October 14, 2014), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-10-14/google-s-schmidt-heads-to-berlin-talks-to-sootherattled-germans Google’s Schmidt to Soothe Rattled Germans in Berlin Talks] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''.</ref> In early 2015, Gabriel and his French counterpart [[Emmanuel Macron]] wrote in a joint letter to [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] [[Andrus Ansip]] that the growing power of some online giants “warrants a policy consultation with the aim of establishing an appropriate general regulatory framework for ‘essential digital platforms.’”<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21650558-eus-digital-master-plan-all-right-far-it-goes-disconnected-continent Disconnected Continent] ''[[The Economist]]'', May 9, 2015.</ref>

In 2016, during a series of Chinese bids for German engineering firms, Gabriel publicly called for a European-wide safeguard clause which could stop foreign takeovers of firms whose technology is deemed strategic for the future economic success of the region.<ref>Caroline Copley (June 9, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuka-m-a-mideagroup-germany-idUSKCN0YV147 Germany's Gabriel seeks EU rule to block foreign takeover of key technologies] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Human rights===
In April 2014, human rights lawyer [[Mo Shaoping]] was blocked from meeting Gabriel during his visit to China, despite the minister saying ahead of the meeting that he wanted to meet critical voices.<ref>Clifford Coonan (April 24, 2014), [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-blocked-from-meeting-german-vice-chancellor-1.1771476 Chinese human rights lawyer blocked from meeting German vice-chancellor] ''[[The Irish Times]]''.</ref>

During a 2015 visit to [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman of Saudi Arabia]], Gabriel launched an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer [[Raif Badawi]] and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past.<ref name="auto1">Anton Troianovski and Ahmed Al Omran (March 8, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-vice-chancellor-presses-saudis-over-bloggers-sentence-1425810401 German Vice Chancellor Presses Saudis Over Blogger’s Sentence] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31786564 Blogger lashing: Saudi rejects criticism of Badawi case] ''[[BBC News]]'', March 8, 2015.</ref> His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State militants]], particularly given Germany’s status as [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports]].<ref name="auto1"/> While the [[U.S. State Department]] had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] did not talk about the case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.<ref name="auto1"/>

During a subsequent trip to Qatar, Gabriel called on the [[List of emirs of Qatar|emir of Qatar]], [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani]] and other senior officials to do better in protecting foreign household workers who face abuse from their employers.<ref>Anton Troianovski (March 10, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-minister-criticizes-qatars-labor-policies-1426023496 German Minister Criticizes Qatar’s Labor Policies] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

==Controversy==

===Thilo Sarrazin===
In 2010, Gabriel called the speeches of [[Thilo Sarrazin]], his party colleague who wrote critically about immigration by accusing Muslims of refusing to integrate and of “dumbing down” German society,<ref name="German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry">Michal Slackman (September 9, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/world/europe/10germany.html German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> "verbal violence". He stated that although Sarrazin described many things that were accurate, his conclusions did not fit into the egalitarian “ideals” of Social Democracy anymore.<ref name="German Banker Resigns Amid Outcry"/>

===Kaiser’s takeover===
In 2016, a German court nullified Gabriel's controversial decision to grant a special permission for the country's biggest supermarket chain [[Edeka]] to buy grocery store chain Kaiser's, owned by [[Tengelmann Group]]. The judges raised questions about the minister's "bias and a lack of neutrality" in the case, saying he had held secret discussion during the decision making process.<ref name="ft.com"/><ref>Tina Bellon (July 12, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-tengelmann-edeka-idUSF9N19801Q German court halts Edeka takeover of Kaiser's chain] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>
