==Government chief peace negotiator (2010–2012)==
In July 2010, Leonen was named by [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] as the [[Philippine government]]'s chief negotiator with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]].<ref>{{cite news |title=UP Law dean Leonen to head GRP panel in talks with MILF |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/196127/up-law-dean-leonen-to-head-grp-panel-in-talks-with-milf |author=Jam L. Sisante |publisher=GMA News |date=2010-07-15 }}</ref> Under his leadership, the government successfully sealed a framework agreement with the MILF for the establishment of the Bangsamoro political entity to replace the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao. His performance was hailed by different sectors in society, bringing new hopes for an everlasting peace in the war-torn Mindanao.

==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (2012–present)==
On 21 November 2012, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] named Leonen as the 172nd Associate Justice of the [[Philippine Supreme Court]] at the age of 49. Leonen is the youngest justice named to the Court since 1938.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Patricia Denise Chiu|first=|last2=Mark Merueñas|date=2012-11-21|title=Peace negotiator Leonen named to Supreme Court; youngest justice since '38|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/283213/news/nation/peace-negotiator-leonen-named-to-supreme-court-youngest-justice-since-38/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-07|website=GMA News Online|language=en-US}}</ref>

In oral arguments, Leonen frequently challenges the arguer's position with his stringent lines of questioning. He frequently uses the [[Socratic method]] in order to test positions and arguments of counsel appearing in Court.

In the landmark case ''Belgica v Executive Secretary'', where the Court declared the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund]] unconstitutional, Leonen wrote a separate concurring opinion where he displayed great command of logic and the law{{Promotion inline|date=June 2020}} in order to arrive with conclusions regarding the unconstitutionality of pork barrel. He said, "A member of the House of Representatives or a Senator is not an automated teller machine from which the public can withdraw funds for sundry private purposes."

===Dissents===

Leonen is known for his frequent dissents in a Court where unanimity is the norm.
