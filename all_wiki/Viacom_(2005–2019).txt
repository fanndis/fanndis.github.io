It was one of two companies which succeeded the first Viacom, alongside [[CBS Corporation]]; both were owned by [[National Amusements]], a theater company controlled by businessman [[Sumner Redstone]].

==History==
{{ViacomCBS evolution}}

===Early years===
In March 2005, the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first Viacom]] announced plans of exploring the option of splitting the company into two publicly traded companies because of a stagnating stock price<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/06/14/viacom.split/index.html|title=CNN.com – Viacom board opts to split company – Jun 14, 2005|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> and the rivalry between [[Les Moonves]] and [[Tom Freston]], longtime heads of [[CBS]] and [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]], respectively. Also, the company was facing issues after [[MTV]] was banned from producing any more [[Super Bowl]] halftime shows after the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl Halftime Show controversy]] in 2004.

After the departure of [[Mel Karmazin]] in 2004,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2004/06/01/news/fortune500/karmazin/index.htm|title=Karmazin out at Viacom; Redstone plans departure – Jun. 1, 2004|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> [[Sumner Redstone]], who served as chairman and chief executive officer, decided to split the offices of president and chief operating officer between Moonves and Freston.<ref name=":0" /> Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split was seen as a creative solution to the matter of replacing him.<ref name=":0" /> It was also intended to provide alternative investments that would be more appealing to investors: one a high cash flow, lower growth company that could afford to pay a substantial dividend and the other a growing company that would have greater investment opportunities and therefore would not be expected to pay a dividend.

The second Viacom, was created and headed by Freston. It consists [[BET|BET Networks]], MTV Networks, and [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0588ekqiqQAC&q=viacom+comprises+BET+Networks%2C+MTV+Networks%2C+and+Paramount+Pictures+Corporation.&pg=RA1-PA479|title=Strategic Management: An Integrated Approach|last1=Hill|first1=Charles|last2=Jones|first2=Gareth|date=2007-10-22|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0618894697|language=en}}</ref>

===2000s===
In June 2005, Viacom announced its purchase of [[Neopets]], a virtual pet website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-21-fi-neopets21-story.html|title=Viacom Buys Neopets, Adds to Web Assets|date=2005-06-21|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> along with [[GameTrailers]], GoCityKids, and [[iFilm]]. That December, Paramount announced it would acquire [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. All indications were that the whole of DreamWorks—both live-comedy film and TV studios, albeit not the DreamWorks archive (which was sold to a group led by [[George Soros]] in March 2006) nor the [[DreamWorks Animation|animated unit]] (which was not part of the deal)—would remain owned by Viacom, even though CBS acquired Paramount's television studio.

In February 2006, Paramount completed the acquisition of DreamWorks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tough-deal-come-spielberg-119563|title=Tough deal to come for Spielberg|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> On April 24, Viacom obtained [[Xfire]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/technology/viacom-to-pay-102-million-for-an-online-game-service.html|title=Viacom to Pay $102 Million for an Online Game Service|last=Hansell|first=Saul|date=2006-04-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In August, Viacom announced that it had acquired [[Atom Entertainment]] for $200&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2006/08/10/viacoms-mtv-unit-buys-atom-entertainment-for-its-film-gaming-web-sites/9ee20b7c-da10-4441-9a8a-ba84396167da/|title=Viacom's MTV Unit Buys Atom Entertainment for Its Film, Gaming Web Sites|last=Ahrens|first=Frank|date=10 August 2006|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref> In September, Viacom acquired game developer [[Harmonix]] for $175&nbsp;million.

In February 2007, Viacom ordered leaked copyrighted video clips be taken off the video-sharing service [[YouTube]] for copyright reasons.<ref name=DMCA /> On February 21, Viacom publicly announced they would be offering free online access to their material through Silicon Valley's distributor [[Joost]].

On May 21, 2007, Viacom entered into a 50–50 joint venture with Indian media company [[Network 18]] to form [[Viacom 18]] which will house Viacom's existing channels in India: MTV, [[VH1]] and [[Nickelodeon]] as well as Network 18's [[Bollywood]] movie business. All future Viacom content for India and new ventures such as a [[Hindi]] entertainment channel and a Hindi movie channel would be housed in this joint venture.

On December 19, 2007, Viacom signed a five-year, $500&nbsp;million contract with [[Microsoft]] that included content sharing and advertisement. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on [[Xbox Live]] and [[MSN]]. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned websites. Also, Microsoft purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks. Finally, Microsoft would also collaborate on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom-owned cable networks.

On December 4, 2008, Viacom announced layoffs of 850 personnel, or 7% of their workforce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5101825/the-dreaded-viacom-layoffs-850-people |title=The Dreaded Viacom Layoffs: 850 People}}</ref> At the end of the year, [[Time Warner Cable]] (along with partner [[Bright House Networks]]) and Viacom's MTV Networks could not come to terms for the renewal of any Viacom channel beyond the end of year.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fixmer, Andy|date=2008-12-31|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20670001&refer=us&sid=algojFpM7.Ho|title=Viacom May Pull Channels Off Time Warner Cable in Contract Spat|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2011-07-13|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721154418/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&refer=us&sid=algojFpM7.Ho|archive-date=July 21, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28440958/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111224134/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28440958|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-01-11|title=Time Warner may cut 'Colbert,' 'Spongebob'|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref> Time Warner Cable's operations include New York City and Los Angeles, with Bright House including the Tampa Bay and Orlando markets, both top-20 markets.

On December 7, 2009, Viacom sold its stake in [[MTV Brasil]] to [[Grupo Abril]] along with rights to the brand. Details on the deal were not disclosed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uol.com.br/canalexecutivo/notasemp09/emp081220093.htm|title=Abril compra ações da Viacom na MTV Brasil|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=May 30, 2010|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211414/http://www2.uol.com.br/canalexecutivo/notasemp09/emp081220093.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===2010s===
In February 2011, [[Hulu]] and Viacom announced the return of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' to Hulu, along with shows from the Viacom library. [[Nickelodeon]]'s shows are not part of this deal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erwich|first1=Craig|title=More Episodes from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, and more coming to Hulu|url=http://blog.hulu.com/2014/10/28/hulu-viacom-expansion/|website=Hulu.com}}</ref> Also that month, Viacom became a co-owner of [[Rainbow S.r.l.]], an Italian television studio best known for the ''[[Winx Club]]'' franchise.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vivarelli |first1=Nick |title=Viacom takes stake in Rainbow |url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/news/viacom-takes-stake-in-rainbow-1118031575/ |accessdate=July 31, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Since the purchase, Viacom's Nickelodeon networks have broadcast Rainbow's shows worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/visioni/societa/2011/02/24/news/winx-le-fatine-fanno-il-botto-1.29024|title=Winx, le fatine fanno il botto|work=[[L'espresso]]|date=24 February 2011|last=Minardi|first=Sabina|language=it}}</ref> Nickelodeon's American studios have also collaborated with Rainbow on multiple productions, including ''Winx Club'' and ''[[Club 57 (TV series)|Club 57]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.produ.com/noticias/iginio-straffi-de-rainbow-tuvimos-una-influencia-muy-importante-en-la-historia-de-club-57|title=Iginio Straffi de Rainbow: Tuvimos una influencia muy importante en la historia de Club 57 para garantizar su atractivo en Europa|work=Produ.com|date=20 November 2018|last=Ramos-Weiner|first=Maribel|language=es}}</ref>

Later, in October 2011, Viacom purchased a majority stake in [[Bellator MMA|Bellator Fighting Championships]].

On December 1, 2011, the company stopped trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and began listing its securities on [[Nasdaq]] instead.

On July 10, 2012, during contract negotiations over raising carrier rates the U.S. satellite TV provider, [[DirecTV]]'s executives approached Viacom with a new proposal and a request to continue broadcasting 17 of Viacom's television networks (including Nickelodeon, MTV, [[Logo TV|Logo]], and [[Comedy Central]]) during talks, but received no response and thus Viacom ceased transmission to DirecTV's 20&nbsp;million subscribers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hollister|first1=Sean|title=DirecTV loses 26 Viacom channels after contract dispute|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/11/3150838/directv-loses-17-viacom-channels-after-contract-dispute|work=The Verge|date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> On July 11, in a counter response to DirecTV advising its subscribers to view original programming from the affected networks online, Viacom scaled back access to recent episodes of Viacom-owned program content available to the websites of its networks. Viacom described this as a "temporary slimdown" until a new carriage deal with DirecTV was reached.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/259162/viacom_pulls_online_videos_over_directv_dispute.html Viacom Pulls Online Videos Over DirecTV Dispute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413010315/http://www.pcworld.com/article/259162/viacom_pulls_online_videos_over_directv_dispute.html |date=April 13, 2013 }}, ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PC World]]'', July 12, 2012.</ref> Viacom and DirecTV reached an agreement on July 20 to return the interrupted programming.<ref name=wsjViacom>{{cite news|last1=Ramachandran|first1=Shalini|last2=Jannarone|first2=John|title=Viacom to Restore DirecTV Channels|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444464304577538492034772130.html|accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 20, 2012}}</ref>

On April 1, 2014, [[Cable One]] removed 15 channels owned by Viacom (MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and [[TV Land]]) off after the two companies failed to reach an agreement.

The change has been deemed permanent.

On May 1, 2014, Viacom announced it had agreed to take over the British broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] from [[Northern & Shell]], the media group owned by the British newspaper publisher [[Richard Desmond]].

In November 2017, Viacom announced the opening of a new digital content division named Viacom Digital Studios.

====Re-merger deal with CBS====

On January 12, 2018, [[CNBC]] reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation after the [[AT&T]]-[[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] merger was planned, as well as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|proposed acquisition]] of most [[21st Century Fox]] assets and heavy competition from companies such as [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/viacom-shares-jump-9-percent-percent-on-wrap-report-that-its-looking-to-merge-with-cbs.html|title=Viacom, CBS shares surge after report Shari Redstone pursuing merge of companies|last=Wang|first=Christine|date=2018-01-12|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-12}}</ref> Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/lionsgate-talks-amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-1202244991/|title=Lionsgate Ripe For Takeover As Amazon, Verizon and CBS-Viacom Emerge As Potential Suitors|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref> Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring [[The Weinstein Company]] in the wake of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein]].<ref name="thewrap.com"/> Viacom was listed as one of 22 potential buyers that were interested in acquiring TWC.<ref name="thewrap.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/weinstein-co-talking-22-buyers-300-million-expected-price-bob-weinstein-must-exit|title=Weinstein Co Talking to 22 Buyers, $300 Million Expected Price, Bob Weinstein Must Exit|date=October 26, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> They lost the bid, and on March 1, 2018, it was announced that [[Maria Contreras-Sweet]] would acquire all of TWC's assets for $500&nbsp;million.<ref name="latimes20180301">{{cite news |title=Former Obama administration official has reached a deal to buy Weinstein Co. assets |author=Ryan Faughnder |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-weinstein-company-sale-20180301-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 1, 2018 |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="deadline1202307564">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/weinstein-company-deal-board-of-directors-maria-contreras-sweet-harvey-weinstein-1202307564/|title=TWC Board, New York AG Confirm Maria Contreras-Sweet Group Has Acquired Weinstein Company Assets|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|date=2018-03-02|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

On March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom's market value and insisted that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO Les Moonves, oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as being too low, requesting an increase of $2.8&nbsp;billion, and requesting that Bob Bakish be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. It was reported that these conflicts had resulted from Shari Redstone seeking more control over CBS and its leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moonves-redstone-inside-poisonous-war-control-cbs-viacom-1101570|title=Moonves vs. Redstone: Inside the Poisonous War for Control of CBS and Viacom|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/cbs-viacom-leslie-moonves-2-1202749787/|title=Could CBS-Viacom Strife Cause Leslie Moonves to Walk Away?|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2018-04-11|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

Eventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom's parent company National Amusements and accused Redstone of abusing her voting power in the company and [[Hostile takeover|forcing a merger that was not supported by CBS or Viacom]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-14/cbs-sues-redstone-s-nai-to-let-board-meeting-on-dividend-happen|title=CBS Sues Redstones' Firm in Escalation of Longstanding Fight|date=2018-05-14|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/shari-redstones-national-amusements-outraged-cbs-suit-1202390493/|title=National Amusements Fires Back At CBS Suit, Says It's "Outraged" By Allegations|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|date=2018-05-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}</ref> CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging [[Verizon Communications]] from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2018/05/verizon-expressed-interest-acquiring-cbs-before-viacom-talks-heated-up-1202390751/amp/|title=Verizon Expressed Interest In Acquiring CBS Before Viacom Talks Heated Up

On May 23, 2018, Les Moonves stated that he considered the Viacom channels to be an "albatross," and while he favored more content for [[CBS All Access]], he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], Lionsgate or [[Sony Pictures]]. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat because he did not want an ally of Redstone as a board member of the combined company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/behind-leslie-moonves-crusade-save-cbs-viacom-1114203|title=Behind Leslie Moonves' Crusade to Save CBS From Viacom|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=2018-05-23|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

On September 9, 2018, Moonves left CBS after being accused by twelve women of sexual assault. National Amusements agreed to not propose a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-moonves-accused-sex-crimes-violence-by-more-women-1141436|title=Leslie Moonves Exits CBS After Being Accused of Sex Crimes, Violence by More Women|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=September 9, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en-US}}</ref>

On May 30, 2019, CNBC reported that CBS and Viacom would explore merger discussions in mid-June 2019. CBS's board of directors was revamped with people who were open to a merger.

On August 2, 2019, it was reported that CBS and Viacom agreed to merge back into one entity.

==Copyright complaints against YouTube==
{{Main|Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.}}
In February 2007, Viacom sent upwards of 100,000 [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] takedown notices to the video-sharing site [[YouTube]]. Of the 100,000 notices, approximately 60–70 non-infringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement.<ref name="DMCA">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252798,00.html Media Companies Blast YouTube for Anti-Piracy Policy]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103205816/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C252798%2C00.html |date=November 3, 2012 }}.

On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a US$1&nbsp;billion legal claim (''[[Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.]]'') against [[Google]] and YouTube alleging massive [[copyright infringement]], alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to YouTube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for Viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for YouTube.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/ViacomYouTubeComplaint3-12-07.pdf |title=United States District Court for the Southern District of New York – ''Viacom International Inc. v.

In July 2008, the case generated controversy when District Judge [[Louis Stanton]] ruled that YouTube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site.<ref name=privacy_bbc>{{Cite news | title = Google Must Divulge YouTube Log | date = July 3, 2008 |publisher=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7488009.stm}}</ref> Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request for YouTube to hand over the [[source code]] of its [[search engine (computing)|search engine]] system, saying that the code was a [[trade secret]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube |last=Helft |first=Miguel |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref>

On June 23, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in Google's favor in a motion for [[summary judgment]], holding that Google was protected by provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement.

[[Eric Goldman]], a professor at the [[Santa Clara University School of Law]], expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect [[Startup company|startup]]s, by making them "more hair-trigger on taking down news or content, for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers".<ref name=stempel>{{cite news |title=Viacom wins reversal in landmark YouTube case |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/05/net-us-google-viacom-idUSBRE8340RY20120405 |newspaper=Reuters|date=5 April 2012 |author=Jonathan Stempel |author2=Yinka Adegoke |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>
