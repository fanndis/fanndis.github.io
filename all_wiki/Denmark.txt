The [[History of Denmark|unified kingdom of Denmark]] emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for [[Dominium maris baltici|control of the Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=31}} Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were ruled together under one sovereign ruler in the [[Kalmar Union]], established in 1397 and ending with [[Swedish War of Liberation|Swedish secession]] in 1523. The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark–Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[History of Denmark#The 19th century|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Denmark in World War II#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].

The [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[Capital city|capital]], [[List of cities and towns in Denmark|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[Devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands
in 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]]. It is among the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]]; it is also part of the [[Schengen Area]]. Denmark has close ties to its Scandinavian neighbours also linguistically, with the [[Danish language]] being partially [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with both [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

Denmark is considered to be one of the most economically and socially developed countries in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/22/denmark-happiest-country_n_4070761.html|title=Denmark Is Considered The Happiest Country.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Etymology of Denmark}}
The etymology of the name "Denmark", the relationship between "Danes" and "Denmark", and the emergence of Denmark as a unified kingdom are topics of continuous scholarly debate.<ref>Kristian Andersen Nyrup, Middelalderstudier [http://www.nyrups.dk/Historie/MiddelalderIndex.htm Bog IX.

Most etymological dictionaries and handbooks derive "Dan" from a word meaning "flat land",<ref name="et1" /> related to German {{lang|de|Tenne}} "threshing floor", English ''den'' "cave".<ref name="et1">[[Jan de Vries (philologist)|J. de Vries]], ''Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1962, 73; [[:da:Niels Åge Nielsen|N.

The first recorded use of the word ''Danmark'' within Denmark itself is found on the two [[Jelling stones]], which are [[runestone]]s believed to have been erected by [[Gorm the Old]] ({{circa|955}}) and [[Harald Bluetooth]] ({{circa|965}}).

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Solvognen-00100.jpg|thumb|left|The gilded side of the [[Trundholm sun chariot]] dating from the Nordic Bronze Age]]
The earliest [[Archaeology of Denmark|archaeological finds in Denmark]] date back to the [[Eemian|Eem interglacial period]] from 130,000 to 110,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].<ref>Michaelsen (2002), p. 19.</ref> Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC.<ref name="foreign ministry">{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Poul Otto|date=May 2003|url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp|title=Denmark: History, Prehistory|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark]]|accessdate=1 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122020555/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp |archive-date=22 November 2005}}</ref> The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], which left an abundance of findings including [[lur]]s and the [[Trundholm sun chariot|Sun Chariot]].

During the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (500 BC&nbsp;– AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the [[Germanic Iron Age]],<ref>Busck and Poulsen (ed.) (2002), p. 20.</ref> in the [[Roman Iron Age]] (AD 1–400).<ref name="foreign ministry" /> The [[Roman province]]s maintained [[trade route]]s and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

The tribal Danes came from the east [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish islands]] ([[Zealand]]) and [[Scania]] and spoke an early form of [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of [[Jutland]] and the nearest islands were settled by tribal [[Jutes]]. The Jutes migrated to [[Great Britain]] eventually, some as mercenaries of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] King [[Vortigern]], and were granted the south-eastern territories of [[Kent]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] by the invading [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], who formed the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The remaining [[Jutes|Jutish]] population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]].

A short note about the ''Dani'' in "[[Getica]]" by the historian [[Jordanes]] is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the [[ethnic group]]s from whom modern [[Danes]] are descended.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jordanes |others=[[Charles C.

[[File:Ladbyskibet.jpg|thumb|The [[Ladby ship]], the largest ship burial found in Denmark]]
From the 8th to the 10th century the wider [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] region was the source of [[Vikings]]. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern [[British Isles]] and [[Western Europe]]. They conquered and settled parts of [[England]] (known as the [[Danelaw]]) under King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013, and [[France]] where Danes and Norwegians founded [[Normandy]] with [[Rollo]] as head of state. More [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[pence]] of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.<ref name="Lund">*{{cite web|last=Lund |first=Niels |date=May 2003 |url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510174200/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp |archive-date=10 May 2006 |title=Denmark – History – The Viking Age |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark]] |accessdate=24 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in [[Frankish language|Frankish]] sources as kings (''reges''). Under the reign of [[Gudfred]] in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the [[Lands of Denmark|lands]] of Jutland, [[Scania]] and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmFrVUb5DSwC&pg=PA76|title=Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy: Scandinavia, Central Europe and Rus' c.900–1200|first=Nora|last=Berend|date=22 November 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781139468367}}</ref>
The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to [[Gorm the Old]], who established his reign in the early 10th century.{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=31}} As attested by the [[Jelling stones]], the Danes were [[Christianised]] around 965 by [[Harald Bluetooth]], the son of [[Gorm the Old|Gorm]]. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising [[Holy Roman Empire|Christian power]] in Europe, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six [[fortresses]] around Denmark called [[Viking ring fortress|Trelleborg]] and built a further [[Danevirke]]. In the early 11th century, [[Canute the Great]] won and united Denmark, England, and [[Norway]] for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.<ref name="Lund" />

Throughout the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], Denmark also included [[Skåneland]] (the areas of Scania, [[Halland]], and [[Blekinge]] in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled [[Danish Estonia]], as well as the [[duchy|duchies]] of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Most of the latter two now form the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northern Germany.

In 1397, Denmark entered into a [[personal union]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden–Finland|Sweden]], united under Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=33}} The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union.<ref name="Lauring">Lauring, Palle (1960) ''A History of the Kingdom of Denmark'', Host & Son Co.: Copenhagen, p. 108.</ref> Thus, much of the next 125 years of [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]] revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish King]] [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] conquered the city of [[Stockholm]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the [[Count's Feud]] civil war, [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Denmark converted]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

After Sweden permanently [[Foundation of modern Sweden|broke away]] from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 [[Kalmar War]] but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a [[war reparations|war indemnity]] of 1 million [[silver]] [[riksdaler]] to Denmark, an amount known as the ''[[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Älvsborg ransom]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011111014/http://smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp |archive-date=11 October 2007 |title=Kalmarkriget 1611–1613 |accessdate=4 May 2007 |publisher=Svenskt Militärhistoriskt Bibliotek |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably [[Glückstadt]] (founded as a rival to [[Hamburg]]) and [[Oslo|Christiania]].

[[File:Denmark-Norway in 1780.svg|thumb|Extent of the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian Realm]]. After the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden while Denmark kept the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]].]]
In the 1645 [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|Treaty of Brømsebro]], Denmark surrendered Halland, [[Gotland]], the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway. In 1657, King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] declared war on Sweden and marched on [[Bremen-Verden]]. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King [[Charles X Gustav]] of Sweden conquered [[Jutland]], [[Funen]], and much of [[Zealand]] before signing the [[Treaty of Roskilde|Peace of Roskilde]] in February 1658, which gave Sweden control of Scania, [[Blekinge]], [[Trøndelag]], and the island of [[Bornholm]]. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having ruined Denmark and in August 1658, he began a two-year-long siege of [[Copenhagen]] but he failed to take the capital.{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=35}} In the ensuing peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.

Denmark tried but failed to regain control of Scania in the [[Scanian War]] (1675–1679). After the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–21), Denmark managed to regain control of the parts of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] ruled by the house of [[Holstein-Gottorp]] in the 1720 [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] and the 1773 [[Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo]], respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral status]] allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark traded with both [[First French Empire|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and joined the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Sweden, and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=League of Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=28 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130430/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]], in one case carrying off the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish fleet]], in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British [[Gunboat War]]. British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

The union was dissolved by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814; the Danish monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenssen-Tusch|first=Georg Friedrich|title=Zur Regierungsgeschichte Friedrich VI.

=== Constitutional monarchy (1849–present) ===
[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|The National Constitutional Assembly was convened by King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] in 1848 to adopt the [[Constitution of Denmark]].]]
A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European [[Revolutions of 1848]], Denmark peacefully became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a [[Rigsdagen|two-chamber parliament]]. Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]], lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to [[cession|cede]] [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] to [[Prussia]]. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial losses that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.

[[Industrialization|Industrialisation]] came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tellier|first=Luc-Normand|title=Urban world history an economic and geographical perspective|date=2009|publisher=Presses de l'Université du Québec|location=Québec|isbn=9782760522091|page=457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=PA457|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412182836/https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=PA457|archive-date=12 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[History of rail transport in Denmark|nation's first railways]] were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. [[Trade union]]s developed, starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.

Denmark maintained its neutral stance during [[World War I]]. After the defeat of Germany, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German [[irredentism]], Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a [[plebiscite]]; the two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and {{convert|3984|km2|sqmi}}.

During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the [[Outer Seven]], as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of what was then the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref>{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |work=Time |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104144427/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |archive-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]) after a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|public referendum]]. The [[Maastricht Treaty]], which involved further European integration, [[1992 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum|was rejected]] by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a [[1993 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum|second referendum]] in 1993, which provided for [[Opt-outs in the European Union|four opt-outs]] from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in [[2000 Danish euro referendum|a referendum in 2000]]. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded [[self-determination]] in 2009. Neither the [[Faroe Islands and the European Union|Faroe Islands]] nor [[Greenland–European Union relations#Outside the EU|Greenland]] are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.

Constitutional change in 1953 led to a [[unicameralism|single-chamber]] parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The [[centre-left]] [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the [[Nordic model|Nordic welfare model]]. The [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] have also led [[centre-right]] governments.

Denmark has an outstanding performance in the global [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI) with an overall ranking of 4 out of 180 countries in 2016. This recent and significant increase in ranking and performance is mostly due to remarkable achievements in [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in [[CO2 emission]] levels. A future implementation of [[air quality]] improvements are expected. The EPI was established in 2001 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

<!--This section only details divisions with an administrate purpose-->
{{Danish regions|float=right}}
Denmark, with a total area of {{convert|43,094|km2|sqmi|lk=in|sigfig=5}}, is divided into five administrative regions ({{lang-da|regioner}}). The regions are further subdivided into [[List of municipalities of Denmark|98 municipalities]] (''{{lang|da|kommuner}}''). The easternmost land in Denmark, the [[Ertholmene]] archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq mi), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonas |last=Michael Kjær |title=Christiansø betaler ikke sundhedsbidrag |date=15 November 2006 |url=http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Christiansoe/2006/11/15160130.htm |work=dr.dk |accessdate=12 August 2007 |language=da |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011075640/http://dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Christiansoe/2006/11/15160130.htm |archive-date=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the 16 [[Counties of Denmark|former counties]]. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 270. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule.<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/Denmark.html Denmark: Regions, Municipalities, Cities & Major Urban Areas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408144050/http://www.citypopulation.de/Denmark.html |date=8 April 2012 }} – Statistics and Maps on ''City Population''.</ref> The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent [[2017 Danish local elections|Danish local elections]] were held on 21 November 2017. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the [[Police of Denmark|police districts]], the [[courts of Denmark|court districts]] and the [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]].

=== Regions ===
The governing bodies of the regions are the [[local government|regional councils]], each with forty-one councillors elected for four-year terms. The councils are headed by regional district chairmen (''{{lang|da|regionsrådsformanden}}''), who are elected by the council.<ref name="brief">{{cite book|title=The Danish Regions – in Brief|date=2007|publisher=Danske Regioner|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-87-7723-471-2|edition=3rd revised}}</ref>
The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the [[health care in Denmark|national health service]], [[social services]] and [[regional development]].<ref name="brief" /><ref name=regioner>{{cite web|title=Regional Tasks in Denmark|url=http://www.regioner.dk/in+english/regional+denmark/regional+tasks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510023358/http://www.regioner.dk/in+english/regional+denmark/regional+tasks|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 May 2014|publisher=Danske Regioner|accessdate=23 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (''{{lang|da|sundhedsbidrag}}''), partly by funds from both government and municipalities.<ref name=taxation1>{{cite web|title=The Danish Tax System|url=http://ias.au.dk/taxation/the-danish-tax-system/|publisher=[[Aarhus University]]|accessdate=23 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821030836/http://ias.au.dk/taxation/the-danish-tax-system/|archive-date=21 August 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished, as it is being replaced by higher income tax instead.

The [[area]] and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]], which encompasses the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]] with the exception of the subtracted province East Zealand but includes the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Bornholm]], has a population three times larger than that of [[North Denmark Region]], which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These ''[[sui generis]]'' municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.

The Danish parliament is [[unicameral]] and called the Folketing ({{lang-da|Folketinget}}).

The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the [[government budget|state's budgets]], approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation. [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] may be initiated by the Government or by [[Member of parliament|members of parliament]]. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive [[Royal Assent]] within thirty days in order to become law.<ref>"A Bill passed by the Parliament shall become law if it receives the Royal Assent not later than thirty days after it was finally passed."

The Government of Denmark operates as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]], where executive authority is exercised—formally, on behalf of the monarch—by the prime minister and other [[cabinet minister]]s, who head [[List of Danish government ministries|ministries]]. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of a majority in the Folketing; this is often the current leader of the largest [[political party]] or, more effectively, through a [[political alliance|coalition of parties]]. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by [[coalition governments]], themselves usually [[minority government]]s dependent on non-government parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/din-mening/radikale-ved-historisk-skillevej|title=Radikale ved historisk skillevej|work=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=17 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811132101/http://www.b.dk/din-mening/radikale-ved-historisk-skillevej|archive-date=11 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Denmark has a long tradition of scientific and technological invention and engagement, and has been involved internationally from the very start of the [[scientific revolution]]. In current times, Denmark is participating in many high-profile international science and technology projects, including [[CERN]], [[ITER]], [[ESA]], [[International Space Station|ISS]] and [[E-ELT]].

In the 20th century, Danes have also been innovative in several fields of the technology sector. Danish companies have been influential in the shipping industry with the design of the largest and most energy efficient container ships in the world, the [[Maersk Triple E class]], and Danish engineers have contributed to the design of [[MAN Diesel]] engines. In the software and electronic field, Denmark contributed to design and manufacturing of [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]]s, and the now-defunct Danish company [[DanCall]] was among the first to develop [[GSM]] mobile phones.

[[Life science]] is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing [[diabetes]] care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish [[biotech]] company [[Novozymes]], the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch based [[bioethanol]], has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to [[cellulosic ethanol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&Itemid=132&id=3101|title=Novozymes, the world's leading provider of enzymes to the biofuels industry|publisher=Canadian Biomass Magazine|accessdate=7 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010095027/http://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&Itemid=132&id=3101|archive-date=10 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Medicon Valley]]'', spanning the [[Øresund Region]] between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe's largest life science [[business cluster|clusters]], containing a large number of life science companies and research institutions located within a very small geographical area.

Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the [[car taxation|high registration tax]] (150%), [[VAT]] (25%), and one of the world's highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership.

The [[Greenlandic Inuit|Inuit]] are indigenous to Greenland in the Kingdom and have traditionally inhabited Greenland and the northern parts of Canada and Alaska in the [[Arctic]]. From the 18th century up to the 1970s, the Danish government (Dano-Norwegian until 1814) have through time tried to assimilate the Greenlandic Inuit, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion. Because of this "[[Danization]] process", several persons of Inuit ancestry now identify their mother tongue as Danish.

Denmark has a [[universal health care|universal]] [[health care system]], characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, for most of the services, run directly by the regional authorities. ''One'' of the sources of income is a national health care contribution (''{{lang|da|sundhedsbidrag}}'') (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it is being phased out and will be gone from January 2019, with the income taxes in the lower brackets being raised gradually each year instead.<ref name=taxation1 /> Another source comes from the municipalities that had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007, a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead. This means that most [[health care provider|health care provision]] is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary [[health insurance|private insurance]] to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as [[physiotherapy]].<ref name=commonwealth /> {{As of|2012}}, Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita).<ref name=commonwealth>{{cite web |title=International Profiles of Health Care Systems |url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/Jun/1417_Squires_Intl_Profiles_622.pdf |publisher=The Commonwealth Fund |accessdate=31 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228014404/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/Jun/1417_Squires_Intl_Profiles_622.pdf |archive-date=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This places Denmark above the [[OECD]] average and above the other Nordic countries.<ref name=commonwealth /><ref>{{cite web|title=Country Comparison :: Life Expectancy at Birth|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=31 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The astronomical discoveries of [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), [[Ludwig A. Colding]]'s (1815–1888) neglected articulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], and the contributions to atomic physics of [[Niels Bohr]] (1885–1962) indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855), the short stories of [[Karen Blixen]] (penname [[Isak Dinesen]]), (1885–1962), the plays of [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684–1754), and the dense, aphoristic poetry of [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]] (1905–1996), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of [[Carl Nielsen]] (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with [[Dogme 95]] like those of [[Lars von Trier]].

A major feature of Danish culture is [[Jul (Denmark)|Jul]] (Danish [[Christmas]]). The holiday is celebrated throughout December, starting either at the beginning of Advent or on 1 December with a variety of traditions, culminating with the Christmas Eve meal.

There are five Danish heritage sites inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Northern Europe|World Heritage list in Northern Europe]]: [[Christiansfeld]], a Moravian Church Settlement, the [[Jelling stones|Jelling Mounds (Runic Stones and Church)]], [[Kronborg Castle]], [[Roskilde Cathedral]], and [[Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand|The par force hunting landscape in North Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dk|title=Denmark: Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List (8)|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=19 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713012915/https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dk|archive-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Human rights ===
{{Main|Human rights in Denmark}}

Denmark has been considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and [[LGBT rights in Denmark|LGBT rights]]. Human rights in Denmark are protected by the state's Constitution of the [[Realm of Denmark|Realm]] ''([[Constitution of Denmark|Danmarks Riges Grundlov]])''; applying equally in Denmark proper, [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], and through the [[ratification]] of international human rights treaties.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.dk/research/human-rights-in-denmark|title=Human rights in Denmark|website=The Danish Institute for Human Rights|publisher=The Danish Institute for Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Denmark has held a significant role in the adoption of both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and in the establishment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). In 1987, the [[Folketing|Kingdom Parliament]] (''Folketinget'') established a national human rights institution, the Danish Centre of Human Rights, now the [[Danish Institute for Human Rights]].<ref name=":8" />

In 2009, a referendum on changing the Danish Act of Succession were held to grant [[absolute primogeniture]] to the Danish throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child. The Danish constitution Article 2 states that "The monarchy is inherited by men and women"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedanishparliament.dk/-/media/pdf/publikationer/english/the_constitutional_act_of_denmark_2013,-d-,pdf.ashx |title=THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF DENMARK |publisher=Folketinget.dk |accessdate=21 October 2020}}</ref>

The Inuit have for decades been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant colonisers from [[Danish colonization of the Americas|Europe]], those countries claiming possession of Inuit lands.

Denmark has been greatly criticised by the Greenlandic community for the politics of ''Danization'' (50's and 60's) of and discrimination against the indigenous population of the country. Critical treatment paying non-Inuit workers higher wages than the local people, the relocation of entire families from their traditional lands into settlements, and separating children from their parents and sending them away to Denmark for schooling has been practiced.<ref>[https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=senproj_s2018 Long-term Effects of Denmark's Colonization of Greenland]</ref><ref>[https://saammaatta.gl//~/media/Forsoningskommission/Diverse/Endelig%20betænkning%20DK.pdf] Report published by the Greenland Reconciliation Commission</ref> Nevertheless, Denmark ratified, in 1996, to recognise the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO-convention 169]] on [[indigenous people]] recommended by the UN.

Danish [[mass media]] date back to the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, [[Anders Bording]], the father of Danish journalism, began a [[state media|state paper]]. In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting [[freedom of the press in Denmark]]. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or trade union. Modernisation, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925.<ref name="media1">Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 50 – 64, 433</ref> The [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] during World War II brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis.

Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of productions due largely to funding by the state-supported [[Danish Film Institute]]. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the [[silent film|silent era]]; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the [[Dogme 95]] movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker [[Carl Theodor Dreyer|Carl Th. Dreyer]] (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors of [[early cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Carl Dreyer:Day of Wrath, Ordet, Gertrud|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/29/carldreyer.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130307200514/http://brightlightsfilm.com/29/carldreyer.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2013|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=July 2000}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Robert|title=The Passion of Joan of Arc|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-1928|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=16 February 1997|quote=Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889–1968), the Dane who was one of the greatest early directors.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610025315/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-1928|archive-date=10 June 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include [[Lars von Trier]], who co-created the Dogme movement, and multiple award-winners [[Susanne Bier]] and [[Nicolas Winding Refn]]. [[Mads Mikkelsen]] is a world-renowned Danish actor, having starred in films such as ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', the Danish film ''[[The Hunt (2012 film)|The Hunt]]'', and the American TV series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]''.

[[File:Pv jensen-klint 05 grundtvig memorial church 1913-1940.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grundtvig's Church]] in Copenhagen, an example of expressionist architecture]]

Denmark's architecture became firmly established in the [[Middle Ages]] when first [[Romanesque style|Romanesque]], then [[Gothic style|Gothic]] churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.
During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, both in the capital and the provinces. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archive-date=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''. Retrieved 3 September 2011.</ref>

The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including [[expressionist architecture|expressionism]], best exemplified by the designs of architect [[Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint]], which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and [[Nordic Classicism]], which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as [[Arne Jacobsen]] entered the world scene with their highly successful [[Danish Functionalist style|Functionalist architecture]]. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]]'s [[Grande Arche]] de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as [[Bjarke Ingels]] to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/Danish+Culture/Architecture/ |title=Architecture |accessdate=6 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206051248/http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/Danish+Culture/Architecture/ |archive-date=6 February 2010 |df=dmy }}, Embassy of Denmark, Hanoi.

Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in the mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[Børge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign "Danish by Design"], ''DDC''. Retrieved 4 September 2011.</ref> Other designers of note include [[Kristian Solmer Vedel]] (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, [[Jens Quistgaard]] (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements and [[Ole Wanscher]] (1903–1985) who had a classical approach to furniture design.

=== Literature and philosophy ===
{{Main|Danish literature|Danish philosophy}}
[[File:Constantin Hansen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A portrait of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1836), by [[Christian Albrecht Jensen]]]]
The first known Danish literature is myths and [[Danish folklore|folklore]] from the 10th and 11th century. [[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.

In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nexø]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Turèll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter Høeg]].

Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[Søren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald Høffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

The [[Danish Golden Age]], which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism, typified in the later previous century by [[History painting|history painter]] [[Nicolai Abildgaard]]. [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] where his students included notable painters such as [[Wilhelm Bendz]], [[Christen Købke]], [[Martinus Rørbye]], [[Constantin Hansen]], and [[Wilhelm Marstrand]].

In 1871, [[Holger Drachmann]] and [[Karl Madsen]] visited [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful [[Skagen Painters|artists' colonies]] specialising in [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy. Hosted by [[Michael Ancher|Michael]] and his wife [[Anna Ancher|Anna]], they were soon joined by [[P.S. Krøyer]], [[Carl Locher]] and [[Laurits Tuxen]].

Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909–1912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948–1951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt Sørensen]] (1899–1985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907–1993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912–1993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913–2007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bjørn Wiinblad]] (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as [[Astrid Kruse Jensen]] and [[Jacob Aue Sobol]] are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.<ref>[http://www.photography-now.com/popup_ausst_5.php?id_ausstellungen=T50624 Contemporary Danish Photography.

[[File:Smørrebrød-01.jpg|thumb|left|''Smørrebrød'', a variety of Danish open sandwiches piled high with delicacies]]
The traditional [[cuisine]] of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of [[Northern Germany]], consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.

The open sandwiches on rye bread, known as ''[[smørrebrød]]'', which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of [[ground meat]]s, such as ''[[frikadeller]]'' (meat balls of veal and pork) and ''hakkebøf'' (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as ''[[flæskesteg]]'' (roast pork with crackling) and ''kogt torsk'' (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg]] beers and for its [[akvavit]] and [[bitters]].

Since around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced [[gourmet]] cooking, largely influenced by [[French cuisine]]. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as [[New Danish cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=new nordic recipes|url=http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/food-drink/new-nordic-recipes|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=15 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807191139/http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/food-drink/new-nordic-recipes/|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result of these developments, Denmark now have a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded [[Michelin Guide|Michelin stars]].
