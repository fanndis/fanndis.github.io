The '''2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and caucuses''' were a series of electoral contests that took place within all 50 [[U.S. state]]s, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and five [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] between February 1 and June 7, 2016. Sanctioned by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], these elections selected the 2,472 delegates that were sent to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. Businessman and [[reality television]] star [[Donald Trump]] won the Republican nomination for [[president of the United States]].

A total of 17 major candidates entered the race.

However, Trump scored landslide victories in [[New York Republican primary, 2016|New York]] and five northeastern states in April, before taking every delegate in the [[Indiana Republican primary, 2016|Indiana primary]] of May 3.

=== Delegate breakdown ===

Fifty-six primary contests were conducted to choose 2,472 delegates. In 50 states and territories the delegates were allocated to candidates by popular vote either statewide or on the congressional district level and then elected according to state rules. In six states and territories, the first-instance popular vote did not allocate any delegates; they were elected later at local conventions and either bound to a candidate or uncommitted.<ref name=schedule>See [[#Schedule|detailed schedule below]]</ref> Most delegates were elected as bound delegates, meaning that they were required to vote for a specific candidate on the first ballot at the [[2016 Republican National Convention|national convention]]. Some delegates attended the convention as unbound or uncommitted delegates, meaning that they were free to vote for anyone at the first ballot. These 130 uncommitted delegates included 18 unbound RNC delegates{{efn|name=RNC|RNC members from Colorado, Guam, North Dakota, Samoa, Virgin Islands and Wyoming attended the National Convention as unbound}} and 112 delegates that have been elected or allocated as uncommitted.{{efn|Uncommitted delegates have been allocated or elected in Colorado (4), Guam (6), Louisiana (5), North Dakota (25), Oklahoma (3), Pennsylvania (54), Samoa (6), Virgin Islands (2), Washington (3), West Virginia (3), and Wyoming (1)<ref name=tgp-rpu>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/R-PU.phtml |title=Presidential Primaries 2016 / Republican Pledged and Unpledged Delegate Summary |work=The Green Papers |first=Richard E. |last=Berg-Andersson |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref>}} Uncommitted delegates were still at liberty to express a preference for a candidate, although that preference was not binding. Among the 901 delegates elected for candidates who later dropped out of the race, 155 were still bound to vote for their candidate on the first ballot{{efn|Some delegates were bound to Bush (1), Carson (7), Fiorina (1), Huckabee (1), Paul (1) and Rubio (144)<ref name=Rubio /><ref name=tgp-rpu />}} and 34 were released{{efn |name=suspend | In US elections, suspending a campaign is a legal technicality allowing candidates to keep raising funds and paying off their debts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/11/why-do-candidates-suspend-losing-campaigns-rather-than-say-i-quit/ |title=Why Candidates 'Suspend' Losing Campaigns Rather Than Say 'I Quit' |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Rebecca |last=Ballhaus |date=February 11, 2016}}</ref>}} according to the local rules of each state party. If no candidate were elected in the first round of voting, a progressively larger number of delegates would have been allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice. The voting rules on subsequent ballots were determined by individual states: most states released their delegates on the second round of voting, and only four states kept them bound on the third round and beyond.<ref name="pbump">{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |last=Bump |first=Philip |title=Here's what happens to Republican delegates if no one clinches a majority before the convention |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/15/heres-what-happens-to-republican-delegates-if-no-one-clinches-a-majority-before-the-convention/ |date=April 15, 2016 |access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

==Timeline of the race==

===Background===
Former Massachusetts governor [[Mitt Romney]], the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 GOP presidential nominee]], lost the 2012 election to incumbent Democratic president [[Barack Obama]]. The Republican National Committee, believing that the long, drawn-out 2012 primary season had politically and personally damaged Romney, drafted plans to condense the 2016 primary season. As part of these plans, the [[2016 Republican National Convention]] was scheduled for the relatively early date of July 18–21, 2016,<ref>Isenstadt, Alex (January 14, 2014) [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/gop-convention-july-18-2016-114276.html "GOP convention set for July 18–21 in 2016"], ''[[Politico]]''.

In mid-December 2014, Jeb Bush—widely seen as a possible frontrunner for the nomination due to his relatively moderate stances, record as former governor of a crucial swing state, name recognition and access to high-paying donors—was the first candidate to form a [[political action committee]] (PAC) and an [[exploratory committee]].<ref>DelReal, Jose A.

Retrieved December 17, 2014.</ref> Many other candidates followed suit. The first candidate to declare his candidacy was Texas Senator [[Ted Cruz]], who was popular among grassroots conservatives due to his association with the [[Tea Party movement]], and who also received early backing of several prominent Republican donors including [[Robert Mercer]].<ref name="Mascaro, Lisa and David Lauter">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-na-pn-ted-cruz-presidential-bid-20150322-story.html|title=Texas Republican Sen.

The 2016 candidates were roughly divided into three camps, with grassroots conservatives represented by Cruz and Carson, the [[Christian right]] represented by Huckabee and Santorum, and moderates (or establishment) represented by Bush and Christie. Several - such as Rubio, Walker and Kasich - were seen as having political backgrounds that may be appealing to both conservatives and moderates. Additionally, not all of these candidates clearly toed the grassroots/establishment divide; for instance, Rubio and Cruz were both elected to the Senate in 2010 as a member of the Tea Party movement, but by 2015 had been courting the support of prominent party elders, political operatives, and large donors with significant success. In contrast, only three of the candidates, Carson, Trump and Fiorina, were true non-establishment candidates in the sense that they had no formal political experience; though Fiorina is widely considered to have views in line with the establishment wing led by Bush and Christie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/03/25/breaking-down-the-lanes-theory-of-the-2016-republican-field/|title=The 2016 GOP presidential race, broken down into 5 'lanes'|first=Philip|last=Bump|date=March 25, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/29/politics/conservative-primary-fights/|title=The GOP's 2016 problem|first=Alexandra|last=Jaffe|date=December 29, 2014|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref name="washingtonexaminer1">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/which-republican-is-winning-the-2016-conservative-primary/article/2567502|title=Which Republican is winning the 2016 conservative primary?|work=Washington Examiner|last1=Ante III|first1=W.

The field was noted for its diversity, and was even called the most diverse presidential field in American history. It included two [[Latinos]] (Cruz and Rubio), a woman (Fiorina), an [[Indian-American]] (Jindal), and an [[African-American]] (Carson).

===Overview===
Widely viewed as a very open contest with no clear front-runner, potential candidates fluctuated in the polls for an extended period from late 2012 to the end of 2015. In the year prior to the election season, a total of 17 major candidates campaigned for the nomination, thus making it the single largest presidential primary field in American history at the time.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> However, by the time the primary season started in early 2016, three candidates had clearly emerged ahead of the rest of the field: [[Florida]] Senator [[Marco Rubio]], [[Texas]] Senator [[Ted Cruz]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] businessman [[Donald Trump]]. Trump maintained wide poll leads throughout 2015 and into 2016, primarily due to his brash and unapologetic style of speaking and campaigning. Trump emphasized a disregard for [[political correctness]], as well as [[populist]] and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] policies; he earned the support of [[Working class|working-class]] voters and voters without [[Undergraduate education|college educations]], among other demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4205539/donald-trump-oral-history/|title=The 2016 Republican Primary, As Told by Donald Trump|website=Time|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref><ref name="jonahgoldberg">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/422716/donald-trump-bernie-sanders-populism |title=Donald Trump & Bernie Sanders – America's Populist Backlash – National Review Online |author=Jonah Goldberg |date=August 19, 2015 |work=National Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/04/why-trumps-big-advantage-among-those-without-college-degrees-is-important/ |title=Why Donald Trump's big advantage among those without college degrees is important |author=Philip Bump |date=December 4, 2015 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> However, Trump's brash attitude and polarizing policy stances generated numerous controversies in the media,<ref>See:

Senators Cruz and Rubio emphasized their youth in comparison to most other candidates and their possible appeal to Hispanic voters.<ref name="washingtonexaminer1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/03/25/breaking-down-the-lanes-theory-of-the-2016-republican-field/|title=The 2016 GOP presidential race, broken down into 5 'lanes'|author=Philip Bump|date=March 25, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/29/politics/conservative-primary-fights/|title=The GOP's 2016 problem|author=Alexandra Jaffe, CNN|date=December 29, 2014|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Additionally, [[Ohio]] governor [[John Kasich]], a moderate Republican, remained in the race for an extended period despite being viewed as having little to no chance of winning the nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/15/john_kasich_wins_ohio_keeps_chances_of_a_contested_convention_alive.html|title=John Kasich wins Ohio, keeps chances of a contested convention alive|work=Slate|access-date=May 7, 2016}}</ref>

Despite Trump's lead in most national polls, the first-in-the-nation [[Iowa caucuses]] were won by Cruz due to his support among grassroots conservatives. However, Trump rebounded with strong wins in [[New Hampshire]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Nevada]]. On [[Super Tuesday]], Trump expanded his lead by winning seven of the eleven states, while the Cruz campaign gained new energy with victories in [[Alaska]], [[Oklahoma]], and the significant stronghold of Cruz's home state [[Texas]]. Rubio maintained significant momentum with strong finishes in Iowa (third place), South Carolina (second place), and Nevada (second place), before finally claiming victory in [[Minnesota]] on Super Tuesday.

Between Super Tuesday and the beginning of the "winner-take-all" primaries, Cruz stayed nearly even with Trump, winning four states to Trump's five; Rubio won several smaller contests such as [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the first round of winner-take-all contests on March 15, Trump greatly expanded his lead by winning five of the six contests. After a significant loss to Trump in his home state of Florida, Rubio suspended{{efn|name=suspend}} his campaign that same day. Meanwhile, Kasich finally gained some momentum by winning his home state of Ohio.

As the primary season entered the spring, the mostly-consolidated field resulted in a closing of the gap between Trump and Cruz, with Trump sweeping the [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], and parts of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] while Cruz performed strongly in the [[Western United States|West]] and scored a surprise victory in [[Maine]]. Kasich, unable to win any other states besides Ohio, remained far behind in third place. After Cruz's upset win in [[Wisconsin]], speculation began to arise that the [[2016 Republican National Convention|convention]] would be a brokered one in which the establishment would choose Kasich or someone else, since both Trump and Cruz were not viewed favorably by the establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-86490780/|title=Why a brokered GOP convention would be bad news for both Trump and Cruz|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/05/ted-cruz-donald-trump-wisconsin-primary-john-kasich-never-trump-organizations/82657580/|title=Cruz beats Trump in Wisconsin, increasing chances of open convention|work=USA Today|access-date=May 7, 2016}}</ref>

As April came to a close and Trump won a resounding victory in his home state of [[New York (state)|New York]], both Cruz and Kasich were mathematically eliminated from winning the nomination without a brokered convention. Both men then formed an alliance to block Trump from winning the nomination, ahead of the "[[Acela Express|Acela]] primaries" of five Northeastern states on April 26.<ref name="theguardian1">{{cite web|title=Ted Cruz and John Kasich team up in deal to stop Trump|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/25/ted-cruz-and-john-kasich-team-up-in-deal-to-stop-trump|date=April 24, 2016|access-date=April 24, 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Subsequently, Trump swept all five states and greatly increased his delegate lead. In a final push to block Trump's path to the nomination, Cruz announced that one of the former candidates for the nomination, former [[Hewlett-Packard]] CEO [[Carly Fiorina]], would be his running mate if he was the nominee.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Sean|last2=Costa|first2=Robert|title=Cruz announces Carly Fiorina as his running mate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruz-says-he-will-make-a-major-announcement-at-afternoon-rally/2016/04/27/397bc1f0-0c18-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html|access-date=May 7, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, after Trump won the [[Indiana Republican primary, 2016|Indiana primary]] on May 3, Cruz suspended his campaign,<ref name="CNBC"/> subsequently leading to [[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Reince Priebus]] announcing Trump as the presumptive nominee.<ref>{{cite news |last1 = Nussbaum |first1 = Matthew |title = RNC chairman: Trump is our nominee |url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/reince-priebus-donald-trump-is-nominee-222767 |access-date = May 4, 2016 |agency = Politico |date = May 4, 2016 }}</ref> Kasich announced the suspension of his campaign the next day, leaving Trump as the only candidate left in the race. Trump then went on to win all of the remaining primaries, sweeping the remainder of the West, Midwest and the entirety of the West Coast. With his victories in [[New Jersey]] and the remaining final states on June 7, not only did Trump officially surpass the necessary number of bound delegates, but he also broke the 2000 record of 12,034,676 popular votes received by the winner of the Republican presidential primaries,<ref name="hannity1908">{{cite web |url=http://www.hannity.com/articles/hanpr-election-493995/graph-trumps-historic-13-million-primary-14794004 |title=Graph: Trump's Historic 13 Million Primary Votes Compared To Every GOP Nominee Since 1908 |publisher=Hannity.com |date=June 8, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610112108/http://www.hannity.com/articles/hanpr-election-493995/graph-trumps-historic-13-million-primary-14794004/# |archive-date=June 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with over 14 million votes.<ref name=greenpapers_convention />

===2012–2014: fluctuating polls===
[[File:Chris Christie by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Governor Chris Christie polled highly until the 2014 "[[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]]" scandal. He suspended his campaign after falling below the threshold in New Hampshire.]]
After Romney's unsuccessful [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] campaign, the potential 2016 field was left without a clear future nominee, similar to that of [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. Different speculations began rising from all sides of the right-leaning political spectrum as to who would make the best possible nominee: One faction of candidates included young freshmen senators, some with alliances to the [[Tea Party movement]], such as Cruz, Paul, and Rubio, who in particular was the focus of attention immediately following 2012. In most national polls from late-2012 to mid-2013, Rubio was leading due to being young, articulate, having a broad appeal among conservatives and moderates and also for his Latino heritage and continued efforts on immigration reform, which many viewed as possible tools to draw Hispanic voters to the GOP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/blog/2013/02/19/what-does-it-take-to-be-an-electable-con|title=Rubio's popularity makes him the conservative frontrunner in 2016|work=Reason}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-rubio-2016-poll-chris-christie-republican-tea-party-sarah-palin-2012-12|title=Poll: Marco Rubio 2016 Presidential Frontrunner|work=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cookpolitical.com/story/6862|title=Marco Rubio: Forgotten Frontrunner|work=Cook Political Report|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925115913/http://cookpolitical.com/story/6862|archive-date=September 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

However, another narrative for the nomination, similar to that which drove Romney's 2012 campaign, was that the nominee needed to be a governor in a traditionally Democratic or [[swing state|swing]] state, with a proven record that would stand as proof that such a governor could be president as well. The possible candidates that fit this criteria included Bush, Gilmore, Kasich, Pataki, Walker and Christie, who in particular had been rising in popularity due to his loud and blunt manner of speaking at public events, championed by some as challenging conventional political rhetoric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsmax-Tv/krauthammer-christie-gop-frontrunner/2013/11/08/id/535702/|title=Krauthammer: Christie 'Far and Away' 2016 GOP Frontrunner|publisher=Newsmax}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-christies-front-runner-status-asset-not-hindrance-2016-nomination-1493818|title=Chris Christie's frontrunner status is an asset, not a hindrance|work=IB Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/11/05/christie-re-elected-governor-of-new-jersey/|title=Christie now frontrunner for 2016|work=New York Post}}</ref> With his record as governor of [[New Jersey]], a heavily Democratic state, factored in, Christie overtook Rubio in the polls from mid-2013 up until early 2014, when the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|"Bridgegate" scandal]] was first revealed and started to damage Christie's reputation and poll standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/chris-christies-bridgegate-2016-president/|title=Chris Christie's Access Lanes to the GOP Nomination are Closed|work=Five Thirty Eight}}</ref> Although he was later cleared of personal responsibility in the subsequent investigation, Christie never regained frontrunner status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/christie_blames_nj_dems_liberal_media_for_his_weak.html|title=Christie blames N.J.

After Christie's fall, the polls fluctuated from January to November 2014. Candidates who often performed well included Rand Paul, who won [[CPAC Straw Poll|CPAC straw polls]] in 2013, 2014 and 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/16/rand-paul-washington-times-cpac-2013-straw-poll/|title=Rand Paul wins The Washington Times-CPAC 2013 Straw Poll|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/8/rand-paul-wins-2014-cpac-straw-poll-ted-cruz-finis/|title=Rand Paul wins 2014 CPAC straw poll, Ted Cruz finishes a distant second|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/28/cpac-straw-poll-rand-paul-wins-scott-walker-surgin/|title=CPAC 2015 Straw Poll: Rand Paul wins again — but Scott Walker is surging|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> [[Wisconsin]] congressman and 2012 vice presidential nominee [[Paul Ryan]] (the eventual House speaker) and former candidates such as former Arkansas governor [[Mike Huckabee]] and then-governor of Texas [[Rick Perry]], further reflecting the uncertainty of the upcoming race for the nomination.<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite news| url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-gop-primary | work=The Huffington Post | title=2016 National Republican Primary – Polls – HuffPost Pollster}}</ref><ref name="realclearpolitics1">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html|title=2016 Republican Presidential Nomination|access-date=September 20, 2015}}</ref>
===April 2014 – January 2015: Jeb Bush leading the polls===
[[File:Governor of Florida Jeb Bush at VFW in Hudson, New Hampshire, July 8th, 2015 by Michael Vadon a 03.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Despite holding an unsteady lead in most of 2014 and early 2015, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was unable to garner popular support and suspended{{efn|name=suspend}} his campaign following the South Carolina primary.]]
In April 2014, [[Robert Costa (journalist)|Robert Costa]] and [[Philip Rucker]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the period of networking and relationship-building that they dubbed the "credentials caucus" had begun, with prospective candidates "quietly studying up on issues and cultivating ties to pundits and luminaries from previous administrations".<ref>{{cite news|title=In the 'credentials caucus,' GOP's 2016 hopefuls study policy and seek advisers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-the-credentials-caucus-gops-2016-hopefuls-study-policy-and-seek-advisers/2014/04/06/cc97315e-bb48-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html|access-date=April 6, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 6, 2014|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Costa|first2=Robert}}</ref>

Though Bush often polled in the low double digits, he was considered a prominent candidate due to his high fundraising ability, record as governor of Florida (a crucial swing state) and apparent electability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pols-and-polls-say-the-same-thing-jeb-bush-is-a-weak-front-runner/|title=Pols and polls say the same thing: Jeb Bush is a weak frontrunner|work=Five Thirty Eight}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-jeb-bush-would-be-the-frontrunner-in-2016-2014-10|title=Why Jeb Bush would be the frontrunner in 2016|work=Business Insider}}</ref> By November 2014, Bush had finally solidified his lead in the polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/jeb-bush-the-mitt-romney-of-2016.html|title=Is Jeb Bush the Mitt Romney of 2016?|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret|date=August 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2015/0419/Jeb-Bush-Is-he-2016-s-Mitt-Romney-video|title=Jeb Bush: Is he 2016's Mitt Romney?|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|last=Sappenfield|first=Mark|date=April 19, 2015}}</ref> Around this time there were talks of the possibility of Romney making a third run for the presidency. During this period from November 2014 until late January 2015, the speculation fueled Romney's rise in many national polls as well, challenging Bush.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-jeb-bush-and-mitt-romney-a-history-of-ambition-fuels-a-possible-2016-collision/2015/01/10/255bfbaa-98f0-11e4-927a-4fa2638cd1b0_story.html|title=For Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, a history of ambition fuels a possible 2016 collision|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Although Romney admitted he was entertaining the idea after initially declining, he ultimately reaffirmed his decision not to run on January 30, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-out-a-boost-for-jeb-bush-and-who-else/2015/01/30/22a4bfdc-a8a4-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html|title=Romney out: A boost for Jeb Bush and who else?|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

However, by the end of February, another challenger rose to match Bush in the polls: Walker, who often touted his record as governor in a traditionally Democratic state, particularly noting his victory in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election|a recall election]] in 2012 (the first governor in American history to do so), combined with his [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2014|reelection in 2014]]. Walker and Bush balanced out in the polls from late February until about mid-June, at which point Trump entered the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/23/2016-power-index-unsteady-walker-still-jebs-top-rival-but-press-pile-on/|title=2016 Power Index: An Unsteady Walker is Still Jeb's Top Rival|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=September 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926175740/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/23/2016-power-index-unsteady-walker-still-jebs-top-rival-but-press-pile-on/|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Walker's challenge to Bush also allowed other candidates to briefly resurge in some polls from late April up until mid-June, including former top performers Rubio, Paul and Huckabee, in addition to several newcomers to the top tier of polling, including Cruz and Carson.<ref name="huffingtonpost1" /><ref name="realclearpolitics1" />

===Mid-2015: Donald Trump and the rise of the outsiders===
[[File:Donald Trump Signs The Pledge 14.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Donald Trump's poll numbers surged as he entered the race and he held a strong lead entering the primary season. After losing Iowa to Cruz, Trump won the next three February primaries.]]
Shortly after Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, many pundits noted his uniquely outspoken nature, blunt language and [[rhetoric]], often directly contradicting traditional political candidates. This style was seen as resonating strongly with potential Republican primary voters and Trump began to rise in the polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/donald-trump-comments-spark-poll-surge-put-2016-re/?page=all|title=Donald Trump comments spark poll surge, puts 2016 Republican hopefuls on the spot|work=The Washington Times}}</ref> After a few weeks of briefly matching Bush, Trump surged into first place in all major national polls by mid-July,<ref name="Cambell1">{{cite web |first=Colin |last=Campbell |date=July 9, 2015 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/polls-donald-trump-in-first-place-2015-7 |title=Donald Trump has surged to the top of 2 new 2016 polls |work=Business Insider}}</ref> which he continued to lead consistently until November. Trump also polled well in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, often leading or coming in second in those states.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

She ultimately suspended her campaign after New Hampshire. She briefly served as Cruz's running mate from April 27 to May 3, until Cruz suspended his campaign as well.]]
With the surge of Trump, a man who had never held political office, the general focus began to shift over to other non-politician candidates, commonly known as "outsiders" and the other two outsiders in the field quickly rose in the polls as well in the wake of the first two debates: Carson, who rose into second place after a well-received performance in the first debate and Fiorina, who rose into the top three after her performance in the second debate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/opinions/hoover-ben-carson-surge/|title=Ben Carson: Rise of the anti-Trump|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/ben-carsons-poll-surge-is-starting-to-look-like-donald-trumps/|title=Is Ben Carson the next Donald Trump?|work=The Washington Post|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=September 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/carly_fiorina_second_place_donald_trump_gop_debate_poll.html|title=Poll: Carly Fiorina surges to second place behind Donald Trump after GOP debates|work=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=September 21, 2015|last=Axelson|first=Ben}}</ref> The rising popularity of non-politician outsiders shocked many political analysts, and fueled a new conversation about how those with no political experience or prior runs for office could appeal more to potential primary voters than career politicians and what it means for the future of the Republican party and American politics in general.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/18/politics/donald-trump-populist-roots/index.html|title=Trump draws on populist campaign roots as 100th day nears|first=Jeremy |last=Diamond|publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/video/2015/08/rise-of-the-outsiders-013097|title=Rise of the Outsiders|work=[[Politico]]|date=August 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4472656151001/the-rise-of-political-outsiders-in-the-2016-race/?#sp=show-clips|title=The rise of the political outsiders in the 2016 race|publisher=Fox Business}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/rise-of-bernie-sanders-the-political-outsiders|title=The rise of the political outsiders|work=The Hill|last=Singleton|first=Shermichael|date=September 4, 2015|access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> Trump used ideas of populism to persuade the  average American throughout the election process.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Populist Persuasion|last=Kazin|first=Michael|publisher=Cornell University|year=1995}}</ref> In mid-September, the first two major candidates dropped out of the race.

By the end of September, most polling averages indicated that the field was finally stabilizing in terms of public opinion and six candidates in particular were gaining traction and pulling away from the rest of the field by considerable margins. Polling averages indicated the top six as Trump, Carson, Rubio, Fiorina, Bush and Cruz.<ref name="huffpost2">{{cite web |url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-gop-primary#!mindate=2015-06-01&maxdate=2015-12-31&estimate=custom&selected=Bush,Carson,Cruz,Fiorina,Rubio,Trump |title=Poll Chart (June to December 2015) – 2016 National Republican Primary |work=The Huffington Post |date=December 31, 2015 |access-date=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Trump and Carson were consistently first and second, respectively; Fiorina was initially in third place before being surpassed by Rubio; while Bush and Cruz remained in fifth and sixth place, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/gop-field-narrows-to-top_b_8248270.html|title=GOP Field Narrows to Top 6|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=November 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4589070289001/which-gop-candidates-should-be-the-final-6-/?#sp=show-clips|title=Which GOP candidates should be the final 6?|work=Fox News Video|access-date=November 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/here_s_how_the_gop_race_looks_now|title=Here's How the GOP Race Looks Now|work=Rasmussen Reports|date=November 13, 2015|access-date=November 23, 2015}}</ref> The other candidates who had been in the top ten of polling—Christie, Huckabee, Paul and Kasich—all leveled out at roughly 3% or less, while the five remaining candidates outside the top ten—Santorum, Jindal, Pataki, Graham and Gilmore—were consistently polling below 1%.

===January 2016: the road to the early primaries===
2016 dawned with the several-month-long truce between Trump and Cruz being broken.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/14/politics/republican-debate-2016-highlights/index.html?eref=rss_latest|title=GOP debate: Trump-Cruz 'bromance' is over|first=MJ|last=Lee|date=January 15, 2016|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Cruz accused Trump of not being a consistent conservative or an ethical businessman, while Trump questioned the [[Canada|Canadian]]-born Cruz's constitutional eligibility to be president—candidates have to be [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born U.S. citizens]] to be eligible to be president—while noting Cruz's past calls for immigration reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_is_questioning_if_ted_cruz_s_canadian_birth_makes_him_eligible.html|title=Does Ted Cruz Have a 'Birther' Problem?|first=Jim|last=Newell|date=January 7, 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/campaign-2016-ted-cruz-hits-back-at-donald-trump-over-citizenship/|title=Ted Cruz hits back at Donald Trump over citizenship|publisher=CBS News|date=January 7, 2016|first=Major|last=Garrett}}</ref> This occurred as Trump and Cruz were vying for supremacy at the top of Iowa polls, in addition to both being the top two candidates in all national polls, ahead of the rest of the field by significant margins.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-cruz-donald-trump-canada-polls-2016-1|title=TED CRUZ: Polls show Donald Trump 'loses to Hillary — and loses by a pretty big margin'|date=January 12, 2016|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/295502565/NBC-WSJ-January-Poll|title=NBC_WSJ January Poll|date=January 15, 2016}}</ref> In the closing weeks before Iowa, Trump and Cruz ran dueling television commercials, each attacking the other's record.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/in-both-parties-2016-front-runners-go-on-the-attack/ |title=In both parties, 2016 front-runners go on the attack |work=[[PBS NewsHour]] |first=Lisa |last=Desjardins|date=January 22, 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, there was conflict between "establishment" candidates Rubio, Christie, Bush and Kasich, largely due to a media-reinforced belief that only a single establishment candidate could remain in the race past the early primaries. The establishment candidates staked their bids on strong showings in New Hampshire and both Christie and Kasich saw upticks in their polling in the weeks before the primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/01/christies_nh_surge_improves_his_presidential_chanc.html|title=Christie's N.H. surge improves his presidential chances, report says|date=January 4, 2016|first=Jonathan|last=Salant|work=The Star-Ledger}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/john-kasichs-poll-surge-in-new-hampshire-alarms-so/ |work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=January 24, 2016|title=John Kasich's Poll Surge in New Hampshire Alarms Social Conservatives|first=Seth |last=McLaughlin}}</ref> Both the Trump-Cruz conflict and the squabbling between establishment candidates was evident at the Republican debate on January 14. The Republican debate of January 28, devoid of Trump due to priorities and conflicts with moderator [[Megyn Kelly]] after the debate in August, was the candidates' last shot at honing their message before the Iowa caucuses. Immigration and foreign policy featured prominently in this debate and many candidates used the opportunity of a "Trump-less debate" to criticize the second-place Cruz, who was also being heavily criticized by prominent Republican leaders in the weeks before Iowa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/29/464805170/trump-less-debate-is-different-but-with-a-familiar-outcome |title=Trump-less Debate Sets A New Standard, But With A Familiar Outcome |first=Ron |last=Elving |author-link=Ron Elving |publisher=NPR|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-would-the-republican-race-look-like-without-trump/ |first=Nate |last=Silver |author-link=Nate Silver |title=What Would The Republican Race Look Like Without Trump?|date=January 29, 2016 |publisher=[[FiveThirtyEight.com]]}}</ref>

Rubio used this narrative to pick up a number of endorsements in the days following the Iowa caucuses. However, in the New Hampshire debate of February 6, 2016, Rubio repeated a talking point four times almost verbatim during an exchange with Christie, which led to sharp criticism of his performance in the aftermath and the beginning of the end of Rubio's campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/06/465868773/watch-republican-presidential-debate |publisher=NPR |title=Republican Debate: 5 Things You Missed |first=Danielle |last=Kurtzleben |date=February 6, 2016}}</ref>

In the [[New Hampshire Republican primary, 2016|New Hampshire primary]], Trump scored a decisive victory over the rest of the field, winning the primary with 35% of the vote. Kasich, who had held over 100 town halls in the state, finished second in a surprise to many in the media. Cruz coming in third in the contest was also a shock to many, while Rubio slipped to fifth, behind Trump, Kasich, Cruz and Bush, whose campaign appeared to be revitalized following several months of apparent stagnation. After coming in seventh place in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Fiorina suspended her campaign on February 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/carly-fiorina-suspends-2016-presidential-campaign/story?id=36643752|title=Carly Fiorina Suspends 2016 Presidential Campaign|publisher=ABC News|access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> Later that same day, Christie, whose campaign was staked almost entirely on getting a strong showing in New Hampshire, suspended his campaign after coming in sixth in New Hampshire, failing to reach the minimum 10% vote threshold required to be allocated delegates from the state and qualifying for the next debate on CBS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/10/nj-gov-chris-christie-to-suspend-presidential-campaign-ap.html |title=Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie drop out of race |first=Everett |last=Rosenfeld |publisher=CNBC |date=February 10, 2016 |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/08/465916627/why-a-vote-for-jeb-bush-could-be-a-vote-for-trump-in-the-new-hampshire-primary |title=Why A Vote For An Establishment Candidate Could Be A Vote For Trump In N.H. |first=Domenico |last=Montanaro |publisher=NPR |date=February 10, 2016 |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> Later that week, Jim Gilmore, who had failed to gain traction, win delegates or be invited to most of the debates, suspended his campaign, narrowing the field to six.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/jim-gilmore-suspends-campaign-219220 |title=Jim Gilmore suspends campaign |work=[[Politico]] |date=February 12, 2016 |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>

===March 1, 2016: Super Tuesday===
[[Super Tuesday]] voting, after the early voting in February, decided nearly half of the delegate votes needed to achieve the 1,237 votes to win the nomination at the [[2016 Republican National Convention]]—595 delegates at stake, to be exact. Super Tuesday holds the primary voting for 11 states in the primary election process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/march-1st-results-election-2016/story?id=37353041|title=March 1st Results Election 2016|date=2016-03-04|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref> North Dakota held the last caucus on Super Tuesday, but there was no presidential straw poll and all the delegates elected later at its convention in April were unbound. Wyoming took a straw poll, but it was non-binding and no delegates were allocated on Super Tuesday. Leading up to Super Tuesday, a debate between the remaining five candidates took place in [[Houston]] on February 25, 2016. Political rhetoric and charges heated up with Cruz and Rubio teaming up to attack Trump.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/politics/republican-debate-highlights/|title=Republican Debate: Marco Rubio finds his fire |publisher=CNN |date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Marco Rubio by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Marco Rubio was considered a leading candidate for both establishment and tea party constituencies, polling in the top three in late 2015 and early 2016. He won his first state on Super Tuesday, capturing Minnesota. After a loss in his home state of Florida, he suspended his campaign on March 15, 2016.]]
Trump won the contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia, while Cruz netted a strong victory in his home state of Texas and added victories in Oklahoma and Alaska. Rubio won his first contest in the Minnesota Republican Caucus and finished a strong second in Virginia. Kasich won no contests, but he almost won in Vermont and finished second in Massachusetts. Carson did not win or place in any contest, netted only three delegates and though he initially expressed an intent to stay in the race, began showing signs of withdrawing in the days following Super Tuesday; he ultimately suspended his campaign on March 4, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ben-carson-to-tell-supporters-he-sees-no-path-forward-for-campaign/2016/03/02/d6bef352-d9b3-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html |title=Ben Carson tells supporters he sees no 'path forward' for presidential campaign |work=[[The Washington Post]]|first1=Robert |last1=Costa |first2=Ben |last2=Terris|date=March 2, 2016|access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/04/469250764/ben-carson-ends-presidential-campaign |title=Ben Carson Ends Presidential Campaign |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |date=March 4, 2016|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/04/carson-suspends-presidential-campaign.html?intcmp=hpbt2 |title=Carson suspends presidential campaign |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

===Early March 2016: between Super Tuesdays===
After [[Super Tuesday]] voting, but before winner-take-all voting was to begin, nine states, two territories and Washington, D.C. held their primaries and caucuses. During this period, 377 delegates were at stake. On March 3, 2016, the day before Carson dropped out of the race, Romney criticized Trump in [[Mitt Romney's March 3 speech|a heavily publicized speech]]. Later that day, there was [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016#March 3, 2016 – Detroit, Michigan|another GOP debate]], which again featured Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Kasich. Carson did not participate in the debate, as he announced the suspension of his campaign the next day, narrowing the field to four; he subsequently endorsed Trump on March 10, 2016, the day after Fiorina endorsed Cruz.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/10/ben-carson-plans-to-endorse-trump/|title=Ben Carson plans to endorse Trump|first=Robert|last=Costa|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, as the prospect of a Trump nomination became more imminent, establishment Republicans pressured Romney or House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] to enter the race; Romney had already decided not to enter the race on January 30, 2015, while Ryan announced he would not enter on April 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-republicans-ryan-idUSMTZSAPEC34IQ9V68 |title=Republicans in tailspin, group forms to draft Ryan for U.S. president |agency=Reuters |first1=Doina |last1=Chiacu |first2=Megan |last2=Cassella|date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reverbpress.com/politics/battlegrounds/romney-reactivates-presidential-campaign-committees/ |title=Before Loudly Denouncing Trump, Romney Quietly Reactivated Campaign Committees (VIDEO) |first=Nathaniel |last=Downes |publisher=ReverbPress|date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref>

On March 5, Cruz won the Kansas and Maine caucuses by comfortable margins. Trump narrowly won the Kentucky caucus and the Louisiana primary. Rubio and Kasich did not finish first or second on any primaries on "Super Saturday". The following day, the first of the 2016 primaries to be held in a U.S. territory went to Rubio, who won all of [[Puerto Rico]]'s 23 delegates.<ref>[http://presidenciales16.ceepur.org/resumen.aspx.htm Republican Party of Puerto Rico Presidential Primaries] ''[[Republican Party of Puerto Rico (1903)|Puerto Rico Republican Party]]'' March 6, 2016</ref> On March 8, Trump won in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, while Cruz took the Idaho Republican Primary, and Rubio missed delegate thresholds in Michigan, Mississippi and Idaho, finishing the night with only a single delegate.

Neither Rubio nor Kasich finished first or second in any primaries held that day.

In the Virgin Islands caucuses on March 10, a slate composed wholly of uncommitted delegates was initially elected. However, the entire slate was later disqualified by the territorial party and was replaced by the elected alternates – two uncommitted, two for Rubio and one each for Cruz and Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/trump-ted-cruz-virgin-islands-221102|title=Cruz, Trump score new delegates in Virgin Islands shakeup|first=Kyle|last=Cheney|website=[[Politico]]|date=March 22, 2016|access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref> The dispute later went to court.<ref>{{cite web |first=Valerie |last=Stiles |url=http://stthomassource.com/content/commentary/open-forum/2016/03/23/stiles-gop-delegate-proceedings-not-over |title=Stiles: GOP Delegate Proceedings Not Over |publisher=[[St. Thomas Source]] |date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> Also on March 10, there was a debate in Florida between the four surviving candidates, which was conducted in a more civil tone than prior debates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/10/470025493/the-12th-republican-debate-in-100-words-and-4-videos|title=The 12th Republican Debate In 100 Words (And 4 Videos) |first=Eyder |last=Peralta |publisher=NPR |date=March 10, 2016 |access-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>

===March 15, 2016: Super Tuesday II===
March 15 featured winner-take-all primaries in the delegate-rich states of Florida—Rubio's home state—and Ohio—Kasich's home state. There were also contests in Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and the Northern Mariana Islands, totaling 367 delegates. It was widely seen as a very important day in the presidential race because of the large number of winner-take-all delegates at stake. In the days leading up to Florida, the remaining candidates announced prominent endorsements and Trump and Rubio in particular spent millions on television advertisements assailing the other in Florida. The level of protest and violence at Trump rallies meanwhile became an object of criticism by other candidates; one such incident led to [[2016 Donald Trump Chicago rally protest|the cancellation of a Trump event in Chicago]] on March 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSMTZSAPEC3DZBTGD8|title=Trump says of campaign protesters: 'I don't hear their voice'|agency=Reuters |date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> On March 11, 2016, in an effort to stop Trump, Rubio told his supporters in Ohio to vote for Kasich, while Kasich refused to tell his Florida supporters to help Rubio, with a campaign spokesperson later quoted as saying: "We were going to win Ohio anyway even without his help, just as he's going to lose Florida to Trump without ours."<ref name="rubio-ohio">{{cite web|last1=Stokols|first1=Eli|title=Rubio urges voters to back Kasich in Ohio to stop Trump|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/marco-rubio-ohio-kasich-220635|website=Politico|access-date=April 2, 2016}}</ref> The Northern Mariana Islands caucuses were the first contest to close on March 15, with Trump taking 73% of the vote and collecting all nine delegates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/15/donald-trump-wins-in-northern-mariana-islands-gop-caucus/|first=Reid J.|last=Epstein|title=Donald Trump Wins Northern Mariana Islands GOP Caucus|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 15, 2016|access-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref> In Florida, Trump netted the biggest prize of the night, handily defeating Rubio in Rubio's home state.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/fl/ |publisher=CNN |title=CNN Election Center: Florida}}</ref> Trump added to that wins in North Carolina, Illinois and Missouri. Soon after the announcement of his loss in Florida, Rubio suspended his campaign. Kasich got on the board for the first time, winning his home state of Ohio to stave off elimination. Kasich's victory in Ohio meant that the 2016 Republican primaries were the first since [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968]] (and the first in which every state held a contest) in which more than three candidates won at least one state (though in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012]] three candidates ([[Mitt Romney]], [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) won states and a fourth ([[Ron Paul]]) won a territory ([[Virgin Islands]])) while Democratic primaries have historically been more divided; examples are the Democratic primaries in [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968]] (five candidates won states), [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1972|1972]] (seven), [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976]] (six), [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988]] (five), [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992]] (five), and [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004]] (four). The election in Missouri was very close, with Trump beating Cruz by fewer than 2,000 votes (0.21%);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/default.aspx?PageId=8491 |title=Kander Certifies March 15 Presidential Preference Primary Election Results |publisher=Missouri Secretary of State |date=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjoechannel.com/news/local-news/wins-missouri-primary|publisher=[[KQTV]]|title=Clinton, Trump Win Missouri Primary|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319061917/http://www.stjoechannel.com/news/local-news/wins-missouri-primary|archive-date=March 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Cruz could have contested the outcome because the difference was less than 0.5%, but chose not to, thereby giving the 12 statewide delegates to Trump and 37 overall out of the 52.<ref>{{cite web |first=David A. |last=Lieb |url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/politics/cruz-wont-seek-recount-of-missouri-primary-loss-to-trump/227591108 |title=Cruz won't seek recount of Missouri primary loss to Trump |publisher=[[WSOC-TV]] |date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>

===Late March – April 2016: a three-candidate race===
[[File:Donald Trump at Fountain Park in Fountain Hills, Arizona 2016.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Trump speaks at Fountain Park in [[Fountain Hills]], [[Arizona]].]]
Seven states and one territory voted between March 22 and April 19, 2016, totaling 315 delegates with New York the largest (winner-take-most, 95), followed by Arizona (winner-take-all, 58).{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The final debate between the candidates, which had been scheduled to take place on March 21, 2016, in [[Salt Lake City]], was cancelled after Trump and Kasich withdrew from the event. Trump had initially announced that he would be absent as there had been enough debates; Kasich subsequently stated that he would not attend a debate without Trump.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-not-attending-march-21-debate-in-utah/|title=GOP debate in Utah cancelled after Trump, Kasich skip|publisher=PBS|date=March 16, 2016|access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>

On March 22, with concerns about the border, immigration and national security at the fore, Trump won all 58 delegates in Arizona. However, in Utah, Cruz garnered 69% of the vote, triggering the 50% rule to take all 40 delegates, buoyed by anti-Trump sentiment among many [[Mormons]]. All of American Samoa's delegates were uncommitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/tuesday-caucus-primary-live-updates-2016-results-arizona-utah-idaho-american-samoa-2340555 |title=Tuesday Caucus And Primary Live Updates 2016: Results From Arizona, Utah, Idaho And American Samoa|work=International Business Times |date=March 23, 2016}}</ref>  After Trump was declared the presumptive nominee, all of the American Samoa delegates committed to him.<ref>{{cite news|first=Marshall |last=Cohen |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/09/politics/trump-gop-delegates-unbound/index.html |title=Donald Trump picks up more unbound GOP delegates |publisher=CNN |date=May 9, 2016 |access-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref> American Samoa and Utah were the last caucuses of the 2016 Republican primary season.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

As a Trump nomination became even more likely, the [[Club for Growth]] and other backers of the [[Stop Trump movement]] began adopting increasingly drastic strategies to derail his nomination, including all-out opposition to him in Wisconsin, seen as one opportunity to deny him the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-party.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share&_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Politics: Republican Leaders Map a Strategy to Derail Donald Trump |first1=Alexander |last1=Burns |first2=Jonathan |last2=Martin |date=March 19, 2016 |access-date=March 20, 2016}}</ref> Trump stated that he foresaw the outbreak of riots if he were denied the nomination at the convention.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/16/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-brokered-convention/|title=Donald Trump on brokered convention: 'I think you'd have riots'|first=Eugene|last=Scott|publisher=CNN|date=March 17, 2016|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref> Despite often being viewed as anathema to the establishment, Cruz began picking up endorsements of establishment figures dismayed by the prospect of a Trump nomination, including that of Romney just before the Utah primary, Bush on March 23, 2016, and Walker on March 29, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=A big endorsement, a criminal charge on the campaign trail |work=[[PBS Newshour]]|date=March 29, 2016|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/a-crucial-endorsement-and-a-criminal-charge-as-candidates-look-to-wisconsin/}}</ref>

Toward the end of March, the competition between the three remaining candidates grew even fiercer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/274264-cnn-to-host-gop-field-in-milwaukee-before-wisconsin |title=CNN to host GOP field in Milwaukee before Wisconsin primary|website=The Hill|date=March 24, 2016|access-date=March 30, 2016|quote=The remaining GOP presidential primary voting contests are becoming increasingly fierce as the remaining number of delegates shrinks nationwide.}}</ref> The increasingly acrimonious back-and-forth between Cruz and Trump took a new turn after the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' accused Cruz of being involved in five extramarital affairs – claims Cruz denied, accusing Trump of planting the claim, but other sources linked it to Rubio's suspended campaign.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirby|first1=Jen|title=National Enquirer — Which Just Happens to Have Ties to Trump — Says Cruz Has Had 5 Affairs|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/national-enquirer-claims-ted-cruz-had-affairs.html|access-date=March 25, 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=March 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/25/ted-cruz-affair-rumors-peddled-by-marco-rubio-s-allies.html |title=Ted Cruz 'Affair' Rumors Peddled by Marco Rubio's Allies |first1=Asawin |last1=Suebsaeng |first2=Betsy |last2=Woodruff |date=March 25, 2016 |access-date=March 26, 2016 |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref> On March 29, the same day Walker endorsed Cruz, at a GOP town hall event hosted by [[CNN]], all three remaining Republican candidates distanced themselves from the vow they had taken in September to support their party's eventual nominee.

April 3 had a North Dakota convention where Cruz gained support of eight delegates and Trump got one. Cruz later got six extra delegates committed to him. After Cruz dropped out, three delegates switched their support to Trump. The 13 uncommitted delegates backed Trump, giving him the support of 17 delegates and a majority. On April 5, buoyed by support from Walker and the state's talk and national radio hosts, Cruz won the statewide contests by a 48–35% margin and six congressional districts at the Wisconsin primary for 36 delegates. Trump won two [[congressional district]]s for six delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/primary-caucus/wisconsin |title=FoxNews 2016Election Headquarters |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

Following the Wisconsin primary, the three candidates moved on to Trump's home state of [[New York (state)|New York]] for its April 19 primary. Trump and Kasich teamed up to assail Cruz for his earlier criticism of Trump's "New York values", while Cruz reiterated his claim that Trump has an inconsistent conservative record and stated that "the only reason Kasich is attacking me now is because Kasich is afraid of going against Trump if I dropped out." Trump also received the support of former New York mayor and [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential candidate]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] during the lead-up to the New York primary. On April 9, 2016, Cruz won the [[Colorado]] delegates after taking a solid majority, the state's four uncommitted delegates declaring support for Cruz, bringing his total delegate count in Colorado to 34. On April 16, 2016, Cruz won all 14 at-large delegates in the [[Wyoming]] state convention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GOP_2016_WYOMING_WYOL-?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=News from The Associated Press |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=April 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190205062223/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GOP_2016_WYOMING_WYOL-?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archive-date=February 5, 2019 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  He also received the support of RNC Committeewoman Marti Halverson, one of the 3 RNC delegates to the convention.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berman |first=Dan |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/16/politics/wyoming-republican-convention-election-results/ |title=Ted Cruz sweeps Wyoming Republican Convention |publisher=CNN |date=April 17, 2016 |access-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref>

On April 19, Trump won New York with 59% of the vote, taking 89 of its 95 delegates. Kasich was a distant second with 25% of the vote, taking the other six delegates. Cruz was completely shut-out from receiving any New York delegates, coming in third place with only 15% of the vote, as the threshold for obtaining any delegates was 20%. Following the New York primary, Cruz was mathematically eliminated from reaching the majority of 1,237 delegates to earn the nomination on the first ballot, as he needed 678 more while only 674 were available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ted-cruz-isgoing-to-have-a-hard-time-convincing-voters-he-deserves-the-nomination |title=How Can Ted Cruz Pretend He Deserves The Republican Nomination Now? |work=Talking Points Memo |first=Lauren |last=Fox |date=April 21, 2016 |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref>

On April 26, 2016, five Northeastern primaries were contested—Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island—and were collectively termed the "[[Amtrak]]" or "Acela primary" in reference to the ''[[Acela Express]]'', which runs through the area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/24/politics/republican-party-acela-primary/|last=LoBianco|first=Tom|title=Republican Party braces ahead of critical 'Acela primary'|publisher=CNN|date=April 25, 2016|access-date= April 26, 2016}}</ref> All five primaries were won by Trump by overwhelming margins between 29% and 41%; Trump received over 54% of the vote in all five. He claimed all the delegates available in Connecticut, Delaware and Maryland, as well as all 17 pledged delegates in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania also elected 54 unpledged delegates and both the Trump campaign and ''The Washington Post'' estimated that Trump would win the support of at least 39 of the Keystone State's 54 unpledged delegates.<ref name="paunpledged1">{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Ed|last2=Zezima|first2=Katie|title=Trump won at least 39 unbound Pa. delegates, according to Washington Post tally|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-won-at-least-30-unbound-pa-delegates-according-to-washington-post-tally/2016/04/27/4648e264-0be6-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html|access-date=April 28, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> Only in Rhode Island, where delegates were allocated proportionally, did Kasich (5) or Cruz (2) win any pledged delegates.

===May 3, 2016: Indiana primary===
Five primaries were contested in May: Indiana, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Washington, with Indiana awarding the most, with 57 delegates. By late April, Cruz and Kasich had both been eliminated from getting 1,237 delegates, but they still had a chance to accumulate enough delegates to force a contested convention in Cleveland. Realizing this, Cruz and Kasich attempted to focus their efforts in different states, with Cruz challenging Trump head-to-head in Indiana and Kasich challenging Trump in Oregon and New Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian |last=Schwartz |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/25/kasich_on_indiana_i_never_told_people_not_to_vote_for_me_they_ought_to_vote_for_me.html |title=Kasich on Indiana: 'I Never Told People Not To Vote For Me, They Ought To Vote For Me' &#124; Video |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=April 25, 2016 |access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/28/politics/john-kasich-ted-cruz-alliance/|title=Ted Cruz on John Kasich: 'There is no alliance' |first=Eugene |last=Scott|publisher=CNN|date=April 28, 2016|access-date=April 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mack |first=Justin L. |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/05/01/poll-reversal-fortune-donald-trump-tops-ted-cruz-indiana/83789056/ |title=Poll: Reversal of fortune, Donald Trump tops Ted Cruz in Indiana |publisher=Indystar.com |date=May 2, 2016 |access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> The [[Indiana Republican primary, 2016|Indiana primary]], whose delegates were awarded winner-take all statewide and by congressional district, was seen as essential to denying Trump the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination.<ref name="theguardian1"/> Following the Acela primaries, Cruz attempted to bolster his chances by announcing that, if nominated, he would name Fiorina as his running mate<ref name=fiorinarm>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/27/475894723/in-unprecedented-move-cruz-will-name-fiorina-as-his-vice-presidential-pick|title=Ted Cruz Will Name Carly Fiorina As His Vice Presidential Pick|publisher=NPR}}</ref> (Fiorina had served as a Cruz campaign surrogate since endorsing him in March after suspending her own presidential campaign in February and Cruz hoped that Fiorina could help his campaign in Indiana and her home state of California).<ref name="fiorinarm2">{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Sean|last2=Costa|first2=Robert|title=Cruz announces Carly Fiorina as his running mate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cruz-says-he-will-make-a-major-announcement-at-afternoon-rally/2016/04/27/397bc1f0-0c18-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html|access-date=April 27, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> On April 29, 2016, Governor [[Mike Pence]] of Indiana announced that he would vote for Cruz in the primary election.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/indiana-governor-to-endorse-cruz-for-president-media/ar-BBsqgZ9?ocid=ansmsnnews11 |title=Indiana governor Pence endorses Cruz for president |publisher=MSN |date=April 21, 2016 |access-date=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502101304/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/indiana-governor-to-endorse-cruz-for-president-media/ar-BBsqgZ9?ocid=ansmsnnews11 |archive-date=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Nevertheless, although Trump was outspent by a margin of more than 4–1, he handily won Indiana with 53.3% of the vote, winning a plurality in every Congressional District and taking all 57 delegates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Collinson|first1=Stephen|title=CNN projects Donald Trump wins Indiana, on cusp of GOP nomination|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/politics/indiana-primary-highlights/index.html |publisher=CNN|date=May 3, 2016 |access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> Cruz subsequently dropped out of the race, eliminating any hope of a contested convention in July.

===May 2016: Trump as presumptive nominee===
142 delegates were awarded between the Indiana primary and the final primaries in June; however, with Trump the only candidate remaining, Washington, Oregon, West Virginia and Nebraska became essentially uncontested, although Cruz and Kasich remained on the ballot. Trump won handily in West Virginia, Nebraska and Oregon, although Kasich received one delegate from West Virginia and five in Oregon, while Cruz took five in Oregon as well. The next week, Trump won decisively in Washington State, taking 76% of the vote and 41 of 44 delegates, with the other three uncommitted.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump said regarding the Republican primaries: "You've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lovelace |first1=Ryan |title=Trump: GOP 'rigged,' but I don't care because I won |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-gop-rigged-but-i-dont-care-because-i-won |work=[[Washington Examiner]] |access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>

On May 26, 2016, the [[Associated Press]] announced that Trump had passed the threshold of 1,237 delegates required to guarantee his nomination,<ref name=ap-1237>{{cite news |url=http://elections.ap.org/content/mister-1237-north-dakota-delegate-puts-trump-over-top |title=Mister 1,237: North Dakota delegate puts Trump over the top |publisher=Associated Press |first=Stephen |last=Ohlemacher |date=May 26, 2016 |access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> thanks to unbound delegates from North Dakota who declared their support for Trump.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===June 2016: final primaries===
{{See also|Free the Delegates}}
The final five primary contests were held on June 7, 2016, in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, with California awarding the most with 172 delegates and New Jersey with 51. Though initially pegged by pundits as being an important primary, the suspension of the Cruz and Kasich campaigns following the Indiana primary made the California primary merely a formality at that point, as Trump shattered the all-time record for votes in the Republican primaries set by [[George W. Bush]] in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000]] of 12,034,676 votes.<ref name="hannity1908"/> After the final primaries, his vote total was 14,015,993 (44.9%), almost 2 million votes higher than the previous record.<ref name=greenpapers_convention />

===July 2016: National Convention===
{{Main|2016 Republican National Convention}}
The 2016 Republican National Convention was held from July 18–21 at the [[Quicken Loans Arena]] in [[Cleveland]]. The delegates selected the Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees and wrote the [[party platform]]. A simple majority of 1,237 delegates was needed to win the presidential nomination.<ref name=gop-official>{{cite web |url=https://www.gop.com/official-2016-gop-delegate-count/ |title=RNC's 2016 Presidential Primary Estimated Delegate Count |publisher=Republican Party |date=April 21, 2016 |access-date=April 22, 2016}} (official source tracking active campaigns + adding delegates won on April 26, pending source update)</ref> Following Trump's decisive win in Indiana and the subsequent suspension of the Cruz and Kasich campaigns, as well as Trump reaching the threshold following his decisive win in Washington state, it became clear that there would not be a contested convention in Cleveland. On the first ballot, Trump won the nomination with 1,725 delegates, 488 more than required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/19/politics/live-updates-republican-national-convention/index.html|title=Republican National Convention: Live updates|author=Tal Kopan|website=CNN|access-date=2016-07-19}}</ref>

==Campaign finance==
This is an overview of the money used in the campaign as it was reported to Federal Election Committee and released on July 21, 2016. Outside groups are [[independent expenditure]]-only committees, also called [[Political action committee|PACs and SuperPACs]]. Several such groups normally support each candidate but the numbers in the table are a total of all of them, meaning that a group of committees can be shown as [[Insolvency|technically insolvent]] even though it is not the case for all of them. The source of all the numbers is the [[Center for Responsive Politics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Presidential Race|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/|website=OpenSecrets.org – Center for Responsive Politics|access-date=July 27, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) imposed strict new rules for states wishing to hold early contests in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/the-2016-gop-primary-was-at-least-as-cc-as-democratic-version/|title=2016 GOP Primary|website=Huffington Post|access-date=November 14, 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="hill rnc" /> Under these rules, no state was permitted to hold a primary or caucus in January; only Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada were entitled to February contests. States with primaries or caucuses in early March were to award their delegates proportionally. Any state that might have violated these rules was to have their delegation to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|2016 convention]] severely cut: states with more than 30 delegates would have been deprived of all but nine, plus RNC members from that state; states with fewer than 30 would have been reduced to six, plus RNC members.<ref name="hill rnc">Joseph, Cameron. [http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/196353-rnc-tightens-2016-primary-calendar-rules "RNC tightens 2016 primary calendar, rules"]. ''The Hill''. January 24, 2014. Retrieved June 11, 2015.</ref> In contrast to the 2012 cycle no states violated these rules.

The Republican Party presidential primaries and caucuses are [[indirect election]]s in which voters allocated or elect delegates to the [[2016 Republican National Convention]]. These delegates can be bound or unbound to vote for a particular candidate. The election of the state delegation can happen directly or indirectly as the primary election table below shows.
* '''Date:''' The date given in the first column is the date of the popular primary or caucus in a particular state or territory. This event may or may not allocate delegates. Two more dates are also important in the process: the date on which Congressional District delegates are (s)elected, and the date on which state delegates are (s)elected. Some events stretch for more than one day; in these cases the date stated in the table is the final day of the event.
* '''State delegation:''' Each delegation is made up of up to three kinds of delegates: party members, delegates from the congressional districts and delegates from the state at-large. They can either be bound, meaning that they are legally bound to vote for a particular candidate in the first ballot at the National Convention, or they can be unbound, meaning that they are free to vote for any candidate at the National Convention. Bound delegates' voting obligations are not necessarily in line with their own personal views, and thus cannot always be used as an indicator as to how a certain delegate will vote should there be more than one ballot at the Convention. If a candidate suspends his campaign,{{efn|name=suspend}} the delegates allocated and/or elected to him may become unbound or stay bound depending on state rules
** ''RNC:'' Three Republican National Committee members from each state will go to the National Convention as delegates. Most of them will be bound to a candidate according to the result of the primary or caucuses. Only fifteen RNC members will be unbound, their states and territories are marked with a footnote.
** ''AL:'' At Large delegates are elected as representatives of the whole state. Each state is allotted ten delegates and each territory six delegates. Each state can on top of this get bonus delegates based on whether it has a Republican governor, it has Republican majorities in one or all chambers of its state legislature, and whether it has Republican majorities in its delegation to the U.S. Congress, among other factors.<ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/R-Alloc.phtml|title=Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2016|work=The Green Papers|access-date=September 14, 2015}}</ref> With the exception of Missouri all these delegates are allocated at the state level.
** ''CD:'' Each Congregational District have been assigned three delegates. These are allocated either on the District or State level according to state rules.
* '''Allocation:''' Delegates can either be allocated or unallocated at the starting primary or caucuses. They can be allocated to a candidate or as uncommitted. Those delegates that are not allocated at the starting event will later be elected either bound to a candidate or uncommitted also called unbound. The contests that allocate delegates on state and district levels use the following allocating systems:
** [[Plurality voting system|Winner-take-all]]. The candidate receiving the most votes is allocated all the delegates. A few states allocated all their delegates based solely on the statewide vote, but most allocated the AL delegates based on the statewide vote and the CD delegates based on the district vote in each districts. This means a candidate can "win" a state without getting all the delegates in that state's delegation.
** [[Proportional representation|Proportional]]. All candidates receive delegates in accordance with the popular vote at the primary or caucuses.
** Winner-take-most. This is a hybrid of winner-take-all and proportional. The delegates are allocated proportionally but different rules ensure that only the leading candidates take part in the allocation. If a candidate gets more than a certain threshold of the votes he will be allocated all the delegates, otherwise it is allocated proportionally. High thresholds are in place in winner-take-most primaries or caucuses. Additional rules are also in place in some states.
** [[Direct election]]. Instead of voting for a candidate at the primary or caucuses the voters elect the delegates directly. The delegates can state their presidential preference (and be elected on a particular candidate's "ticket") or they can be elected as uncommitted.
* '''Election:''' Delegates are elected before, at the same time or after the starting event depending on the allocation method and the state rules.
** [[Political convention|Convention]]. This including Congressional District Conventions, Congressional District Caucuses at State Conventions, Summer Meetings, State and {{abbr|CD|Congressional District}} delegation selection meetings and State Conventions where delegates are elected. Conventions where National Delegates are not (s)elected have not been included in the tablet.
** [[Direct election]]. The National Convention delegates are elected directly on the ballot. They will either be bound, as a delegation, to the result of the contest or they will individually state on the ballot what candidate they will be bound to or if they wish to be elected as unbound delegates depending.
** [[Slate (elections)|Slate]]. A slate can be made up in three ways: all candidates submitting a slate before the primary or caucuses, the winning candidate submitting their slate after the primary or caucuses, or the State Committee or Convention making up the slates before the primary or caucuses. The allocated delegates are then selected from these slates.
** [[Republican Party (United States)#Structure and composition|Committee]]. Each state has its own rules and regulations. Ordinarily, the state GOP executive committee or its chairman selects the delegates.

According to Rule 40(b) of the RNC Rules of the Republican Party,<ref name="rule40" /> enacted prior to the 2012 convention and amended most recently in 2014, nominations at the National Convention may be made only of candidates who demonstrate the support of a majority of delegates of at least eight state delegations. Previously, this had been a lower threshold of a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] in five states. However, per Rule 42, Rules 26–42 are "Standing Rules for this convention (2012) and the temporary rules for the next convention (2016)". While the current candidates operate under these temporary rules, it is unclear whether they will remain in place for the 2016 convention.{{update inline|date=August 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/ben-ginsberg-republican-contested-convention-rules-220499?lo=ap_d3 |title=GOP superlawyer on contested convention rule: 'In fact, that's not a rule'|work=Politico}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/13/why_rule_40_wont_affect_the_gop_primary_outcome_129012.html |title=Why Rule 40 Won't Affect the GOP Primary Outcome|work=RealClear Politics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontloading.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-real-import-of-rule-40-in-2016.html |title=The Real Import of Rule 40 in 2016|work=FrontLoading HQ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2014/04/07/dramatic-little-known-gop-rule-change-takes-choice-of-presidential-candidate-away-from-rank-and-file-republicans-and-hands-it-to-party-elite/ |title=Dramatic, Little Known GOP Rule Change Takes Choice Of Presidential Candidate Away From Rank And File Republicans And Hands It To Party Elite|work=Forbes}}</ref> As of March 16, 2016, RNC Chairman [[Reince Priebus]] has not taken a position on the potential rule change, while others in the party advocate for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/rnc-weighs-scrapping-convention-rule-book-to-head-/ |title=RNC weighs scrapping convention rule book to head off anti-Trump maneuvers|work=The Washington Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/republican-convention-rules-trump-cruz-221355 |title=GOP panelists eager to scrap rule that helps Trump|work=Politico|access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref>
