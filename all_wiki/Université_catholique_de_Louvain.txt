The '''Université catholique de Louvain''' (also known as the '''Catholic University of Louvain''', the English translation of its French name, and the '''University of Louvain''', its official English name)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/016709801#Graphic_representation|title=University of Louvain - EUTM file information|website=European Union Intellectual Property Office|year=2017|access-date=May 16, 2018}}</ref> is Belgium's largest French-speaking university. It is located in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], which was expressly built to house the university, and [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Mons]], [[Tournai]] and [[Namur]]. Since September 2018, the university has used the branding '''UCLouvain''', replacing the acronym '''UCL''', following a merger with [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]].

The original [[Old University of Louvain|University of Louvain]] (''Universitas Lovaniensis'') was founded at the centre of the historic town of [[Leuven]] (or ''Louvain'') in 1425, making it the [[List of universities in Belgium|first university in Belgium]] and the [[Low Countries]]. After being closed in 1797 during the Napoleonic period, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|''Catholic'' University of Leuven]] was "re-founded" in 1834, and is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution.{{ref|caveat|A}}{{ref|caveat2|B}} In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven [[Split of the Catholic University of Leuven|split]] into the Dutch-language ''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]'', which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language ''Université catholique de Louvain'', which moved to Louvain-la-Neuve in [[Wallonia]], 30&nbsp;km southeast of Brussels. Since the 15th century, ''Leuven/Louvain'', as it is still often called, has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology. The UCLouvain is often ranked among the world's top 50 institutions for the study of [[philosophy]] and top 20 institutions for [[theology]] and [[religious studies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roundranking.com/universities/university-catholique-de-louvain.html?sort=O&year=2018&subject=SN|title=Université catholique de Louvain|website=RUR|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/Catholic-University-of-Louvain.html|title=Catholic University of Louvain|website=ARWU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/philosophy|title=Ranking by subject: philosophy|website=QS World University Rankings|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/theology-divinity-religious-studies|title=Ranking by subject: Theology, Divinity & Religious Studies|website=QS World University Rankings|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref>

==History==
{{For|the history of the university prior to 1968|Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)#History|Universities in Leuven}}

The [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], based in [[Leuven]] ("''Louvain''" in French), 30&nbsp;km east of [[Brussels]], provided lectures in French from its refounding in 1835, and in Dutch from 1930. In 1968, the [[Dutch-language]] section became the independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was moved to a greenfield campus and town, [[Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain-la-Neuve]], 30&nbsp;km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language. This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.

With the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in [[Brussels]] or [[Wallonia]] were quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it was not anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all of its buildings and infrastructure in [[Leuven]]. The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.[[File:Louvain-la-Neuve Halles.JPG|thumb|The ''Halles universitaires'' in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]]]]According to a 2007 agreement, the University of Louvain was to absorb three smaller French-speaking catholic colleges: the [[Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix|Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] ([[FUNDP]]) located in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], the [[Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis|Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis]] ([[FUSL]]) located in Brussels (now called Saint-Louis University, Brussels) and the [[Catholic university of Mons]] ([[FUCaM]]) located in [[Mons]] and [[Charleroi]]. The negotiations for a full merger aborted by an insufficient vote by the general assembly of the [[FUNDP]] in December 2010. The result was a merger between the University of Louvain and the [[Facultés universitaires catholiques de Mons|FUCaM]] in [[Mons]], effective from September 15, 2011. The Mons campus is denoted UCLouvain FUCaM Mons. The three universities still collaborate in consortium, the [[Académie Louvain]]. Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences as well as the doctoral programmes in all disciplines.

In September 2018, the University of Louvain (or UCL until then) and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]] ''[[de facto]]'' merged, founding the ''UCLouvain'', a denomination they currently share.

== Chronology ==
In 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain<ref>{{Cite web|title = UNIVERSITÉ DE LOUVAIN|url = http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/universite-de-louvain/|website = Encyclopædia Universalis|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = Encyclopædia|last = Universalis}}</ref> (Université de Louvain), which was suppressed under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], reopened in 1790, and was finally closed under the French Republic in 1797.<ref name=cathen>{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09391a.htm|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|author=V. Brants|date= 1910|title=University of Louvain|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|via=New Advent|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref>

In 1817, the [[State University of Louvain]] (''Université de l'Etat de Louvain'') was founded, which closed 15 August 1835.<ref>{{Cite book|title = La matricule de l'Universite de Louvain (1817-1835)|last = Graffart|first = Arlette|publisher = Album de Carlos Wyffels|year = 1987|location = Bruxelles|pages = 181}}</ref>

In 1834, the Catholic bishops of Belgium created the Catholic University of Belgium (Université catholique de Belgique) in [[Mechlin]], also known as the Catholic University of Malines (Université catholique de Malines).

A law passed on 27 September 1835 stated that there would be only one university funded by the State of Belgium in Louvain. The same year, shortly after the suppression of the State University, the Catholic University of Belgium moved to Louvain.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Dictionnaire de l'histoire universelle de l'Eglise|last = Encyclopedie theologique|publisher = J.P. Migne|year = 1863|location = Paris}}</ref> It took advantage of the reputation of the city as an ancient university centre and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain).

In a Catholic spirit inspired by [[Pope Gregory XVI]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = Les annees Lovanium|last = [[Isidore Ndaywel è Nziem|Ndaywel è Nziem]]|first = Isidore|publisher = L'Harmattan|year = 2010|location = Paris|pages = 19}}</ref> the promoter and first rector of the university, Monseigneur de Ram, wanted to create a shield that would repulse religion's enemies and block every doctrine weakening the base of Catholic society.

The pharmacy school was founded in 1845 and the [[Louvain School of Engineering|engineering school]] in 1865.

In 1884 the Catholic University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Universite Catholique de Louvain: Liber Memorialis: 1834-1884|last = Descamps|first = E.|publisher = Peeters|year = 1887|location = Louvain|pages = V}}</ref>

In 1968, as a result of linguistic issues, the university was divided into two different universities: one French speaking, which moved to the province of Brabant Wallon, and one Dutch speaking, which remained in the same location.

In 1970, these two universities were established by law as the ''Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven'' and ''Université catholique de Louvain''.

In 1971, the first foundation stone was laid in Louvain-la-Neuve, a new city constructed for the French-speaking university.

==Student activities==

===Cercles===
''Cercles'' are [[Student society|Student Societies]] or [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternities]] based around each faculty. The Cercles, along with the Régionales (which are based around their respective regions of origin) coordinate and manage most of the students' animation and nightlife.  Most Cercles run small bars to fund their activities, and also jointly operate a larger nightclub, "La Casa".

Cercles and Régionales are run exclusively by member students known as the Committee. These members are elected every year, usually by voting from all members (active or otherwise) wishing to participate, although some Cercles restrict the number of possible voters in some cases.

Aside from promoting student folklore and coordinating student animation, Cercles also offer academic aid to students in their respective faculties and organize more cultural activities, such as visits to museums and/or other cities, conferences, and low-cost trips for students (for example skiing in the Alps during the Winter Break).

Every Cercle and Régionale has its own customs and traditions, but some are practiced by all:

The Baptême ({{lang-fr|baptism}}) is a [[hazing]] ceremony used by most to induct new members, who then participate in a number of trials and activities involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc. Baptized members (les Baptisés) are among the most common type of members, and some Cercles and Régionales try to only accept new members this way, although "it is in no way an obligation to be baptized in order to be a part of the Cercle or to frequent them".

The [[Calotte (Belgium)|calotte]] is a Belgian [[student cap]] worn by students attending Catholic universities. They are emblems of student folklore dating back to the late 19th century. Nowadays, most calottes are passed by way of a ceremony known as the coronae.  How they are passed and what must be known or done to deserve it depends on the Cercle or Régionale. One thing that is universally known, is that there is a lot of singing involved.

Cercles are notorious for their generally high output of alcohol (especially beer) and low level of cleanliness. Students tend to wear old clothes that they don't mind damaging or dirtying as a consequence, and the overall ambiance is more akin to a rave or a frat-party than a nightclub or sports bar.

===Kots===
Student accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a "[[Kot (lodging)|kot]]", a term having [[Flemish|Belgian Dutch]] origin. A "kot" can be translated as den or hut. The French way to form the plural of "kot" is "kots" (in Dutch, the plural of "kot" is "koten"). In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that "for rent" signs are in French only, with the French plural of "kot".

===Kot-à-projet===
{{main|Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)}}

Unique to UCLouvain a [[Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)|Kot-à-projet]] (kap) is a kot whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to [[Fraternity and sorority houses]], but smaller in size with only the committee living in the kot. Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building. One of them is "le kap contes", a kot promoting the art of storytelling. Another is called "Kap Délices" which suggests varied activities such as theme buffets, cooking lessons, and material renting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kapdelices.net |title=Kap Délices &#124; Accueil |publisher=Kapdelices.net |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>

===Student Union===
The AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCLouvain's [[Students' union]]. The body comprises an [[Executive (government)|executive]] Committee, and a [[Legislature|legislative]] Council.

{{main|24h velo (LLN)}}

The 24 Hour Cycle (24h Vélo) is, nominally, a [[bicycle]] endurance [[Road bicycle racing|road race]] held in October, organised by  ''CSE Animations'' (Centre Sportif Etudiant). While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes. The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race. A 240-minute race also takes place for teenagers. The event is probably best known for what happens off the track. Concurrent with the race is [[Belgium]]'s largest student event, with concerts and stands lasting the full 24hrs.

==Notes==
:A.{{note|caveat}} The Old University of Leuven (1425) is the oldest university in the low countries, and the Catholic University of Leuven (1834) is sometimes, controversially, identified as a continuation of it. Belgium's highest court, the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] has ruled that the (1834) Catholic University of Leuven cannot be regarded as continuing the old (1425) University of Leuven.<ref>Ruling of the Cour de Cassation of Belgium of 26 November 1846: "''The Catholic University of Leuven can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Leuven''", in, ''Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850'', Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: ''Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés'', 1861, p.166</ref> See [[Old University of Leuven#History]].
:B.{{note|caveat2}} This is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1884, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary, acknowledging its actual date of foundation.<ref>In the year 1887, the Catholic University of Louvain, has celebrated his 50th anniversary.... E. Descamps, in : ''Université Catholique de Louvain : Liber Memorialis : 1834-1884'', Louvain : Peeters, 1887, p. V : "''les fêtes du cinquantième anniversaire de l'Université catholique de Louvain ont eu un brillant éclat et un immense retentissement''".</ref> Only in 1968 did the new Catholic university add the date 1425 to its neo-gothic seal (created in 1909).
