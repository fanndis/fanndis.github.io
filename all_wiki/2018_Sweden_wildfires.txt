In the summer of 2018, a large number of [[wildfire]]s (primarily forest fires) occurred throughout much of [[Sweden]]. According to the [[Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency]], they are the most serious in the country in modern history.<ref name=TheLocal17July>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180717/sweden-battles-most-serious-wildfire-situation-of-modern-times-heres-what-you-need-to-know|title=What you need to know about Sweden's historic wildfire outbreak|date=17 July 2018|publisher=The Local|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref> The summer [[2018 European drought and heat waves|was unusually warm and dry]], significantly raising the risk of fire.

In addition to the country's firefighters and civilian volunteers, Sweden's armed forces were involved, mostly providing manpower and equipment such as helicopters.<ref name=WAPO20July/> Locally the [[Swedish Air Force|air force]] also used aerial bombings by [[JAS 39 Gripen]] fighter jets to make [[firebreak]]s and draw oxygen from the wildfires.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/dalarna/mig-veterligen-har-det-aldrig-hant-forut|title=Flygvapnet släppte 270 kilo tung bomb över branden|publisher=SVT Nyheter|date=25 July 2018|language=Swedish|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>

By June, several fires were out of control and Sweden requested help from neighbouring countries and via the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Sweden received help from Denmark (firefighters and equipment), [[Estonia]] (firefighters and equipment), France (soldiers, firefighters, [[Aerial firefighting|water bombing aircraft]]), Finland (firefighters), Germany (firefighters, helicopters), Italy (water bombing aircraft), [[Lithuania]] (helicopter), Norway (firefighters and equipment, water bombing helicopters), Poland (firefighters and equipment), and Portugal (water bombing aircraft).<ref name="thelocal.se"/><ref name=SVT30JulyB/><ref name="auto"/><ref name=TheGuardian30July>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/30/the-swedish-town-on-the-frontline-of-the-arctic-wildfires|title=The Swedish town on the frontline of the Arctic wildfires|date=30 July 2018|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>
