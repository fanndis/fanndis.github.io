== Character: rural and urban ==
Settlements range in character from farming communities and frontier villages to urban suburbs and neighborhoods. The four largest settlements, [[Modi'in Illit]], [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Beitar Illit]] and [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], have achieved city status. Ariel has 18,000 residents, while the rest have around 37,000 to 55,500 each.

{{See also|Israeli settlement timeline}}

=== Occupied territories ===
Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel [[military occupation|occupied]] a number of territories.<ref name="fmep1">{{cite web |url=http://www.fmep.org/reports/special-reports/special-report-on-israeli-settlement-in-the-occupied-territories/PDF |title=Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories |publisher=[[Foundation for Middle East Peace]] |access-date=2012-08-05 }}{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It took over the remainder of the Palestinian Mandate territories of the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|West Bank including East Jerusalem]], from [[Jordan]] which had [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|controlled the territories]] since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and the [[Gaza Strip]] from [[Egypt]], which had [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|held Gaza under occupation since 1949]]. From Egypt it also captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and from [[Syria]] it captured most of the [[Golan Heights]], which [[Status of the Golan Heights|since 1981 has been administered under the Golan Heights Law]].

=== Settlement policy ===
As early as September 1967, Israeli settlement policy was progressively encouraged by the [[Thirteenth government of Israel|Labor government]] of [[Levi Eshkol]]. The basis for Israeli settlement in the West Bank became the [[Allon Plan]],<ref name=HRW_Separate-IV>[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/95059/section/5 ''Separate and Unequal''], Chapter IV.

''Haaretz'', 1 June 2008</ref> named after its inventor [[Yigal Allon]]. It implied Israeli annexation of major parts of the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], especially [[East Jerusalem]], [[Gush Etzion]] and the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].<ref>Ian S.

They were established as military outposts and later expanded and populated with civilian inhabitants. According to a secret document dating to 1970, obtained by [[Haaretz]], the settlement of [[Kiryat Arba]] was established by confiscating land by military order and falsely representing the project as being strictly for military use while in reality, Kiryat Arba was planned for settler use. The method of confiscating land by military order for establishing civilian settlements was an open secret in Israel throughout the 1970s, but publication of the information was suppressed by the [[Israeli Military Censor|military censor]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page//.premium-1.733746 Secret 1970 document confirms first West Bank settlements built on a lie (''Haaretz'', 28 July 2016)] "In minutes of meeting in then defense minister Moshe Dayan's office, top Israeli officials discussed how to violate international law in building settlement of Kiryat Arba, next to Hebron (...)

THE SETTLEMENT STRATEGY IN JUDEA AND SAMARIA<br /><br />
''"In light of the current negotiations on the future of Judea and Samaria, it will now become necessary for us to conduct a race against time. During this period, everything will be mainly determined by the facts we establish in these territories and less by any other considerations. This is therefore the best time for launching an extensive and comprehensive settlement momentum, particularly on the Judea and Samaria hilltops which are not easily passable by nature and which preside over the Jordan Valley on the cast and over the Coastal Plain on the west."''

''"It is therefore significant to stress today, mainly by means of actions, that the autonomy does not and will not apply to the territories but only to the Arab population thereof. This should mainly find expression by establishing facts on the ground. Therefore, the state-owned lands and the uncultivated barren lands in Judea and Samaria ought to be seized right away, with the purpose of settling the areas between and around the centers occupied by the minorities so as to reduce to the minimum the danger of an additional Arab state being established in these territories. Being cut off by Jewish settlements the minority population will find it difficult to form a territorial and political continuity."''

''"There mustn't be even the shadow of a doubt about our intention to keep the territories of Judea and Samaria for good. Otherwise, the minority population may get into a state of growing disquiet which will eventually result in recurrent efforts to establish an additional Arab state in these territories. The best and most effective way of removing every shadow of a doubt about our intention to hold on to Judea and Samaria forever is by speeding up the settlement momentum in these territories."''

SETTLEMENT POLICY IN JUDEA AND SAMARIA<br /><br />
''"Thus, it is necessary to establish additional settlements near every existing settlement in Judea and Samaria, so as to create settlement clusters in homogenous settlement regions ..."''

''"Over the next 5 years it is necessary to establish 12-15 rural and urban settlements per annum in Judea and Samaria, so that in five years from now the number of settlements will grow by 60-75 and the Jewish population thereof will amount to between 120,000 and 150,000 people."''<br /><br /></ref><!----------END CITATION---------->

Since 1967, government-funded settlement projects in the West Bank are implemented by the "Settlement Division" of the [[World Zionist Organization]].<ref name=JP_Cabinet_seeks_limit>[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Cabinet-seeks-to-limit-Baraks-say-on-settlements "Cabinet seeks to limit Barak's say on settlements"]. Tovah Lazaroff and Herb Keinon, ''Jerusalem Post'', 20 June 2011</ref> Though formally a [[non-governmental organization]], it is funded by the Israeli government and leases lands from the Civil Administration to settle in the West Bank. It is authorized to create settlements in the West Bank on lands licensed to it by the Civil Administration.<ref name=HRW_Separate-IV /> Traditionally, the Settlement Division has been under the responsibility of the Agriculture Ministry. Since the Olso Accords, it was always housed within the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). In 2007, it was moved back to the Agriculture Ministry. In 2009, the Netanyahu Government decided to subject all settlement activities to additional approval of the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister. In 2011, Netanyahu sought to move the Settlement Division again under the direct control of (his own) PMO, and to curtail Defense Minister Ehud Barak's authority.<ref name=JP_Cabinet_seeks_limit />

At the presentation of the [[Oslo II Accord]] on 5 October 1995 in the Knesset, PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] expounded the Israeli settlement policy in connection with the permanent solution to the conflict. Israel wanted ''"a Palestinian entity, less than a state, which will be a home to most of the Palestinian residents living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank"''. It wanted to keep settlements beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] including Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev in East Jerusalem. Blocs of settlements should be established in the West Bank. Rabin promised not to return to the 4 June 1967 lines.<ref>Presentation of the Oslo II Accord in the Knesset by Rabin: MFA, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1995/pages/pm%20rabin%20in%20knesset-%20ratification%20of%20interim%20agree.aspx ''Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin: Ratification of the Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement—The Knesset October 5, 1995''].</ref>

In June 1997, the Likud government of [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] presented its "Allon Plus Plan". This plan holds the retention of some 60% of the West Bank, including the "Greater Jerusalem" area with the settlements Gush Etzion and Ma'aleh Adumim, other large concentrations of settlements in the West Bank, the entire Jordan Valley, a "security area", and a network of Israeli-only bypass roads.<ref name=CEIRPP_V>[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/3DF99D9DCCB3B21F85257C62004B782F ''The origins and evolution of the Palestine problem''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064330/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/3DF99D9DCCB3B21F85257C62004B782F |date=21 April 2014 }}, Part V (1989–2000), chap.

In the [[Road map for peace]] of 2002, which was never implemented, the establishment of a Palestinian state was acknowledged. Outposts would be dismantled. However, many new outposts appeared instead, few were removed. Israel's settlement policy remained unchanged. Settlements in East Jerusalem and remaining West Bank were expanded.

While according to official Israeli policy no new settlements were built, at least some hundred [[Israeli outpost|unauthorized outposts]] were established since 2002 with [[Sasson Report|state funding]] in the 60% of the West Bank that was not under [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian administrative control]] and the population growth of settlers did not diminish.

In 2005, all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank were forcibly evacuated as part of [[Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip]], known to some in Israel as "the Expulsion".<ref name="West Bank" /> However, the disengagement was more than compensated by transfers to the West Bank.<ref name="fmep1972-2010" />

After the failure of the Roadmap, several new plans emerged to settle in major parts of the West Bank. In 2011, ''Haaretz'' revealed the [[Israeli Civil Administration|Civil Administration's]] ''"Blue Line"''-plan, written in January 2011, which aims to increase Israeli "state-ownership" of West Bank lands ("state lands") and settlement in strategic areas like the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian northern Dead Sea area.<ref name=Eldar_220711>Akiva Eldar, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-civil-administration-pushing-for-land-takeover-in-west-bank-1.374564 "IDF Civil Administration pushing for land takeover in West Bank"] ''Haaretz'', 22 July 2011</ref> In March 2012, it was revealed that the Civil Administration over the years covertly allotted 10% of the West Bank for further settlement. Provisional names for future new settlements or settlement expansions were already assigned. The plan includes many Palestinian built-up sites in the [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Areas A and B]].<ref name=Eldar_300312>Akiva Eldar, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-defense-ministry-plan-earmarks-10-percent-of-west-bank-for-settlement-expansion-1.421589 "Israel Defense Ministry plan earmarks 10 percent of West Bank for settlement expansion"].

== Reasons for settlements ==
* Jews who had been living in the West Bank before they were expelled in 1948 wanted to return home.<ref>Gershom Gorenberg, ''The Accidental Empire''(New York: Times Books, Henry Holt and Company, 2006), 21.</ref>
* After the Six-Day War, some Israelis believed that war might break out again. They built settlements on hilltops to act as observation posts for an early warning system.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/isdf/text/troen.html |title=Israel Studies An Anthology: Jewish Settlement in Israel |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2016-06-10}}</ref>
* Israelis were afraid that if strategically important lands were returned, Israelis would be in danger. For years, Syria had been firing from the Golan Heights into the kibbutzim of the valley. If Syria got back the Golan Heights, they would resume firing on the Israelis below. Israelis remembered that after conquering the Sinai, Israel withdrew from the Sinai. If Israel constructed a military base, the soldiers could be ordered to leave, but if they created a "settlement on the Syrian heights – a civilian presence, then no one could just order a withdrawal. There'd have to be a debate in the Knesset."<ref>Eytan Sat, interview, Yehudah Harel, interview; Admoni, Asor, 23.</ref>
* There were Israelis who remembered that Israel had conquered the Sinai in 1956, but gave it back. "The promises made by Eisenhower had proved hollow at the first test and had failed to prevent war …"<ref>Gorenberg, ''The Accidental Empire'', 54.</ref> They were willing to return land, but only if Israel got a peace treaty in return. They were hoping that building settlements would make it more difficult for Israel to withdraw from land without getting a peace treaty in return.
* There were "Religious radicals, convinced that they were fulfilling God's plan for history …"<ref>Gorenberg,''The Accidental Empire'', 4.</ref> For Avraham Kook, "the Jews' role was to be the vessel that brings the "divine idea" into the world. The world's redemption depended on the Jews living in the Land of Israel"<ref>Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen Kook, ''Orot'' (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 5753),9.</ref> Rabbi Tzvi Kook said...It's "the Lord's land. Is it in our hands to give up even a millimeter?" The State of Israel represented the "beginning of redemption" and was "the state that the prophets foresaw" when they spoke of the End of Days.<ref>A. Ben-Ami, ed., ''HaKol: The Peace Frontiers of Israel'' (Tel Aviv: Madaf, 1967), 65–75.</ref> "…the Bible was the Jewish deed to the Land of Israel…"<ref>Gouri,"Hashiva Le'Abu Dis."</ref> "…the conquest as introducing the end of days, when 'nation shall not lift up sword against nation.'"<ref>Mashe Shamir, "Min Haplishtiut--El Hahar," ''Ma'ariv'', 15 July 1967.</ref>
* There were secular Israelis who saw "the West Bank as the historic patrimony of the Jewish people and control of this region as a matter of momentous historic importance."<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org" />
* Settlement building as punishment. "According to reports on Israel Radio, the development is a response to the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers."<ref>"Israel launches massive new West Bank settlement plans", ''Israel Herald''. 31 August 2014.</ref>
* Settlements as bargaining chips for negotiations.<ref>Joshua L. Gleis, ''Withdrawing Under Fire: Lessons Learned from Islamist Insurgencies'', (Washington, D.C.:Potomac Books, Inc., 2011), Chapter 7.</ref>

Some settlements are self-contained cities with a stable population in the tens of thousands, infrastructure, and all other features of permanence. Examples are [[Beitar Illit]] (a city of close to 45,000 residents), [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Modi'in Illit]], and [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] (almost 20,000 residents). Some are towns with a [[Local council (Israel)|local council]] status with populations of 2,000–20,0000, such as [[Alfei Menashe]], [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]], [[Elkana]], [[Efrat]] and [[Kiryat Arba]]. There are also clusters of villages governed by a local elected committee and [[Regional council (Israel)|regional councils]] that are responsible for municipal services. Examples are [[Kfar Adumim]], [[Neve Daniel]], [[Kfar Tapuach]] and [[Ateret]]. [[Kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im in the territories include [[Argaman]], [[Gilgal, Bik'at HaYarden|Gilgal]], [[Niran]] and [[Yitav]]. Jewish neighborhoods have been built on the outskirts of Arab neighborhoods, for example in [[Hebron]]. In Jerusalem, there are urban neighborhoods where Jews and Arabs live together: the [[Muslim Quarter]], [[Silwan]], [[Abu Tor]], [[Sheikh Jarrah]] and [[Shimon HaTzadik]].

Under the [[Oslo Accords]], the West Bank was divided into three separate parts designated as [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area A, Area B and Area C]]. Leaving aside the position of East Jerusalem, all of the settlements are in [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] which comprises about 60% of the West Bank.

== Types of settlement ==
* Cities/towns: [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], [[Betar Illit]], [[Modi'in Illit]] and [[Ma'ale Adumim]].
* [[Suburb|Urban suburbs]], such as [[Har Gilo]].
* [[Block settlement]]s, such as [[Gush Etzion]] and settlements in the [[Nablus]] area.
* Frontier villages, such as those along the Jordan River.
* [[Israeli outpost|Outposts]], small settlements, some authorized and some unauthorized, often on hilltops. The [[Sasson Report]], commissioned by [[Ariel Sharon]]'s administration, found that several government ministries had cooperated to establish illegal outposts, spending millions of dollars on infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2DF163CF93AA35750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=Israeli Report Condemns Support for Settlement Outposts|first=Steve|last=Erlanger|date=9 March 2005|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

== Resettlement of former Jewish communities ==
Some settlements were established on sites where Jewish communities had existed during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] or even since the [[First Aliyah]] or ancient times.<ref>"Twenty-three Jewish settlements werde destroyed during the 1948 fighting.

In May 2014, the Israeli Housing Minister Uri Ariel, who himself lives in the West Bank settlement of Kfar Adumim, put the settler population at up to 750,000: 400,000 in the West Bank and up to 350,000 in East Jerusalem.

The establishment of settlements in the Palestinian territories is linked to the displacement of the Palestinian populations as evidenced by a 1979 Security Council Commission which established a link between Israeli settlements and the displacement of the local population. The commission also found that those who remained were under consistent pressure to leave to make room for further settlers who were being encouraged into the area. In conclusion the commission stated that settlement in the Palestinian territories was causing "profound and irreversible changes of a geographic and demographic nature".<ref name="Jacques2012">{{cite book|author=Mélanie Jacques|title=Armed Conflict and Displacement: The Protection of Refugees and Displaced Persons Under International Humanitarian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQlt588JmeYC|access-date=8 April 2013|date=20 September 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00597-6|pages=77–124}}</ref>

The Israeli settlements in the West Bank fall under the administrative district of ''[[Judea and Samaria Area]]''. Since December 2007, approval by both the Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli Defense Minister of all settlement activities (including planning) in the West Bank is required.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olmert curbs WBank building, expansion and planning| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL31349948|work=Reuters|date=31 December 2007|access-date=31 December 2007 | first=Adam | last=Entous}}</ref> Authority for planning and construction is held by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] [[Israeli Civil Administration|Civil Administration]].

The [[Yesha Council]] ({{lang-he|מועצת יש"ע}}, ''Moatzat Yesha'', a Hebrew acronym for [[Judea]], [[Samaria]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]) is the umbrella organization of municipal councils in the West Bank.

The actual buildings of the Israeli settlements cover only 1 percent of the West Bank, but their jurisdiction and their regional councils extend to about 42 percent of the West Bank, according to the Israeli NGO [[B'Tselem]]. Yesha Council chairman [[Dani Dayan]] disputes the figures and claims that the settlements only control 9.2 percent of the West Bank.<ref name="CBSmain6650897">[[CBS News]], 2010 Jul 6, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/06/world/main6650897.shtml "Group: Israel Controls 42% of West Bank: Settlements Occupy Land Seized from Palestinians in Defiance of 1979 Court Ban, Israeli Human Rights Group Says"]</ref>

=== East Jerusalem ===
East Jerusalem is defined in the [[Jerusalem Law]] as part of Israel and its capital, [[Jerusalem]]. As such it is administered as part of the city and its district, the [[Jerusalem District]]. Pre-1967 residents of East Jerusalem and their descendants have residency status in the city but many have refused Israeli citizenship. Thus, the Israeli government maintains an administrative distinction between Israeli citizens and non-citizens in East Jerusalem, but the [[Kikar Safra|Jerusalem municipality]] does not.

=== Golan Heights ===
The Golan Heights is administered under Israeli civil law as the Golan sub-district, a part of the [[Northern District (Israel)|Northern District]]. Israel makes no legal or administrative distinction between pre-1967 communities in the Golan Heights (mainly [[Druze]]) and the post-1967 settlements.

=== Sinai Peninsula ===
{{See also|Israeli occupation of Sinai |Category:Former Israeli settlements in Sinai}}
After the capture of the Sinai Peninsula from [[Egypt]] in the 1967 Six-Day War, settlements were established along the Gulf of Aqaba and in northeast Sinai, just below the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israel had plans to expand the settlement of [[Yamit]] into a city with a population of 200,000,<ref>''The Arab–Israeli Dilemma (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East)'', Syracuse University Press; 3rd edition (August, 1985 {{ISBN|0-8156-2340-2}}</ref> though the actual population of Yamit did not exceed 3,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.689861/k.7BC5/Israels_Withdrawal_from_Sinai_19791982.htm/ |title=Kintera.org—The Giving Communities<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=10 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301091150/http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/c.hsJPK0PIJpH/b.689861/k.7BC5/Israels_Withdrawal_from_Sinai_19791982.htm |archive-date=1 March 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in stages beginning in 1979 as part of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. As required by the treaty, in 1982 Israel evacuated the Israeli civilian population from the 18 Sinai settlements in Sinai. In some instances evacuations were done forcefully, such as the evacuation of Yamit. All the settlements were then dismantled.

=== Gaza Strip ===
{{See also|Population statistics for Israeli Gaza Strip settlements}}
Before [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]] in which the Israeli settlements were evacuated, there were [[Template:Former Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip|21 settlements]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] under the administration of the [[Hof Aza Regional Council]]. The land was allocated in such a way that each Israeli settler disposed of 400 times the land available to the Palestinian refugees, and 20 times the volume of water allowed to the peasant farmers of the Strip.<ref>[[Jean-Pierre Filiu]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPhzBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA196 ''Gaza: A History''], Oxford University Press, 2014 p. 196.</ref>

The consensus of the international community - the vast majority of states, the overwhelming majority of legal experts, the International Court of Justice and the UN, is that settlements are in violation of international law.<ref name="Waxman" >‘The charge that israeli settlements violate international law is widely accepted in the international community. The UN, the ICJ, almost every state in the world, and the vast majority of legal experts all consider Israeli settlemnents to be illegal and, in fact, a war crime according to the Fourth Geneva Convention (specifically article 49, paragraph 6). The Israeli government and a small number of legal experts dispute this, arguing that the Geneva Convention is not applicable to the West Bank because Israel is not an occupying power there (since the territory had no legitimate sovereign  and that, even if the Geneva Convention does apply, it only prohibits forcible population transfers (like the mass deportations..)’.

This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge).

This legal opinion was sent to Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]]. However, it was not made public at the time. The Labor cabinet allowed settlements despite the warning. This paved the way for future settlement growth. In 2007, Meron stated that "I believe that I would have given the same opinion today."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/secret-memo-shows-israel-knew-six-day-war-was-illegal-450410.html|title=Secret memo shows Israel knew Six Day War was illegal}}</ref>

The International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion, has since ruled that Israel is in breach of international law by establishing settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. The Court maintains that Israel cannot rely on its right of self-defense or necessity to impose a regime that violates international law.

A secret database, drafted by a retired senior officer, Baruch Spiegel, on orders from former [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|defense minister]] [[Shaul Mofaz]], found that some settlements deemed legal by Israel were illegal outposts, and that large portions of [[Ofra]], [[Elon Moreh]] and [[Beit El]] were built on private Palestinian land.

According to Amira Hass, one of the techniques used by Israel to expropriate Palestinian land is to place desired areas under a 'military firing zone' classification, and then issue orders for the evacuation of Palestinians from the villages in that range, while allowing contiguous Jewish settlements to remain unaffected.<ref>[[Amira Hass]], [http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/a-proper-zionist-live-fire-zone.premium-1.459329 'A proper Zionist live fire zone,'] ''[[Haaretz]]'', 20 August 2012</ref>

The construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has been criticized as an infringement on Palestinian human and land rights. The [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] estimated that 10% of the West Bank would fall on the Israeli side of the barrier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456944/html/nn2page1.stm|title=Guide to the West Bank barrier|work=BBC News|access-date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3111159.stm|title=Q&A: What is the West Bank barrier?|work=BBC News|date=15 September 2005|access-date=5 January 2010}}</ref>

In July 2012, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] decided to set up a probe into Jewish settlements.

== Economy ==
[[File:Ma'ale adumim 01.jpg|thumb|Many residents of [[Ma'ale Adumim]] work in [[Mishor Adumim]] industrial park]]
Goods produced in Israeli settlements are able to stay competitive on the global market, in part because of massive state subsidies they receive from the Israeli government. Farmers and producers are given state assistance, while companies that set up in the territories receive tax breaks and direct government subsidies. An Israeli government fund has also been established to help companies pay customs penalties.<ref name=SpiegelSC /> Palestinian officials estimate that settlers sell goods worth some $500 million to the Palestinian market.<ref name="Reuters">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE64Q136.htm Q&A-Palestinians boycott Israeli settler goods], Reuters, 27 May 2010</ref> Israel has built 16 industrial zones, containing roughly 1000 industrial plants, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem on acreage that consumes large parts of the territory planned for a future Palestinian state. According to Jodi Rudoren these installations both entrench the occupation and provide work for Palestinians, even those opposed to it. The 16 parks are located at [[Shaked]], [[Beka'ot]], [[Baran, Israel|Baran]], [[Karnei Shomron]], [[Immanuel (town)|Emmanuel]], [[Barkan]], [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]], [[Halamish]], [[Ma'ale Efraim]], [[Sha'ar Binyamin Industrial Zone|Sha'ar Binyamin]], [[Atarot]], [[Mishor Adumim]], [[Gush Etzion]], [[Kiryat Arba]] and [http://www.haaretz.com/news/new-jewish-settlement-established-in-jordan-valley-1.71568 Metarim] (2001).<ref>Jodi Rudoren, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/world/middleeast/palestinians-work-in-west-bank-for-israeli-industry-they-oppose.html?hpw&rref=world 'In West Bank Settlements, Israeli Jobs Are Double-Edged Sword,'] ''New York Times'', 10 February 2014.</ref>

In spite of this, the West Bank settlements have failed to develop a self-sustaining local economy. About 60% of the settler workforce commutes to Israel for work. The settlements rely primarily on the labor of their residents in Israel proper rather than local manufacturing, agriculture, or research and development. Of the industrial parks in the settlements, there are only two significant ones, at Ma'ale Adumim and Barkan, with most of the workers there being Palestinian. Only a few hundred settler households cultivate agricultural land, and rely primarily on Palestinian labor in doing so.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-the-settlement-enterprise-has-failed-1.5421498 | title=The Settlement Enterprise Has Failed| newspaper=Haaretz| date=17 November 2015}}</ref>

Settlement has an economic dimension, much of it driven by the significantly lower costs of housing for Israeli citizens living in Israeli settlements compared to the cost of housing and living in Israel proper.<ref name="maannews.net" /> Government spending per citizen in the settlements is double that spent per Israeli citizen in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], while government spending for settlers in isolated Israeli settlements is three times the Israeli national average. Most of the spending goes to the security of the Israeli citizens living there.<ref name=Rudoren />

=== Export to EU ===
According to Israeli government estimates, $230 million worth of settler goods including fruit, vegetables, cosmetics, textiles and toys are exported to the EU each year, accounting for approximately 2% of all Israeli exports to Europe.<ref name=SpiegelSC>{{cite news|last=Sydow|first=Christoph|title=Activists Seek Ban on Trade with Israeli Settlers|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-activists-demand-an-end-to-imports-from-israeli-settlements-a-864355.html|access-date=2012-11-02|newspaper=Spiegel|date=2012-10-30}}</ref> A 2013 report of Profundo revealed that at least 38 Dutch companies imported settlement products.<ref name=Profundo>Profundo, [http://www.profundo.nl/files/download/Cord-ICCO-IKV0413.pdf ''Dutch economic links with the occupation''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621170906/http://www.profundo.nl/files/download/Cord-ICCO-IKV0413.pdf |date=21 June 2013 }}. 20 April 2013.

[[European Union]] law requires a distinction to be made between goods originating in Israel and those from the occupied territories. The former benefit from preferential custom treatment according to the [[Israel–European Union relations|EU-Israel Association Agreement (2000)]]; the latter don't, having been explicitly excluded from the agreement.<ref name=SpiegelSC /><ref name=g20091210 /> In practice, however, settler goods often avoid mandatory customs through being labelled as originating in Israel, while European customs authorities commonly fail to complete obligatory postal code checks of products to ensure they have not originated in the occupied territories.<ref name=SpiegelSC /><ref name=Profundo />

In 2009, the [[United Kingdom]]'s Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issued new guidelines concerning labelling of goods imported from the West Bank. The new guidelines require labelling to clarify whether West Bank products originate from settlements or from the Palestinian economy. Israel's foreign ministry said that the UK was "catering to the demands of those whose ultimate goal is the boycott of Israeli products"; but this was denied by the UK government, who said that the aim of the new regulations was to allow consumers to choose for themselves what produce they buy.<ref name=g20091210>{{Cite news|author1=Ian Black |author2=Rory McCarthy |title=UK issues new guidance on labelling of food from illegal West Bank settlements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/10/guidance-labelling-food-israeli-settlements|newspaper=The Guardian|location=United Kingdom|date=10 December 2009|access-date=5 January 2012}}]</ref> Denmark has similar legislation requiring food products from settlements in the occupied territories to be accurately labelled.<ref name=SpiegelSC />

On 12 November 2019 the Court of Justice of the European Union in a ruling<ref>https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2019-11/cp190140en.pdf</ref> covering all territory Israel captured in the 1967 war decided that labels on foodstuffs must not imply that goods produced in occupied territory came from Israel itself and must "prevent consumers from being misled as to the fact that the State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity". In its ruling, the court said that failing to inform EU consumers they were potentially buying goods produced in settlements denies them access to "ethical considerations and considerations relating to the observance of international law".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-israel-settlements/eu-court-rules-goods-from-israeli-settlements-must-be-labeled-idUSKBN1XM1WU|title=EU court rules goods from Israeli settlements must be labeled |publisher=Reuters |date=12 November 2019|access-date = 12 November 2019 }}</ref>

=== Palestinian economy and resources ===
A Palestinian report argued in 2011 that settlements have a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy, equivalent to about 85% of the nominal gross domestic product of Palestine, and that the "occupation enterprise" allows the state of Israel and commercial firms to profit from Palestinian natural resources and tourist potential.<ref name=g20110929>{{Cite news|author=Harriet Sherwood|title=Israeli occupation hitting Palestinian economy, claims report|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/29/israeli-occupation-hits-palestinian-economy|newspaper=The Guardian|location=United Kingdom|date=29 September 2011|access-date=9 January 2012}}]</ref> A 2013 report published by the [[World Bank]] analysed the impact that the limited access to Area C lands and resources had on the Palestinian economy. While settlements represent a single axis of control, it is the largest with 68% of the Area C lands reserved for the settlements. The report goes on to calculate that access to the lands and resources of Area C, including the territory in and around settlements, would increase the Palestinian GDP by some $3.5 billion (or 35%) per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=World Bank|title=West Bank and Gaza:Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy|journal=Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department|date=2 October 2013|issue=Report No. AUS2922|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/st/inter/Hheb/images/worldbankctar.pdf|access-date=10 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145555/http://www.haaretz.co.il/st/inter/Hheb/images/worldbankctar.pdf|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Palestinian labour ==
Due to the availability of jobs offering twice the prevailing salary of the West Bank ({{As of|2013|8|lc=y}}), as well as high unemployment, tens of thousands of Palestinians work in Israeli settlements.<ref name=am20140218>{{cite web|title=A Palestinian contradiction: working in Israeli settlements|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/02/settlements-palestinians-occupation-israel-sodastream.html|publisher=Al-Monitor|author=Jihan Abdalla|date=18 February 2014|access-date=12 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312213911/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/02/settlements-palestinians-occupation-israel-sodastream.html|archive-date=12 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="jpost.com" /> According to the [[Manufacturers Association of Israel]], some 22,000 Palestinians were employed in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and service industries.<ref>Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/29/palestinian-boycott-israeli-settlement-goods Palestinian boycott of Israeli settlement goods starts to bite], [[The Guardian]], 29 June 2010</ref> An [[Al-Quds University]] study in 2011 found that 82% of Palestinian workers said they would prefer to not work in Israeli settlements if they had alternative employment in the West Bank.<ref name=am20140218 />

Palestinians have been highly involved in the construction of settlements in the West Bank. In 2013, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics released their survey showing that the number of Palestinian workers who are employed by the Jewish settlements increased from 16,000 to 20,000 in the first quarter.<ref name="jpost.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/20000-Palestinians-working-in-settlements-survey-finds-323222|title=20,000 Palestinians working in settlements, survey finds|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The survey also found that Palestinians who work in Israel and the settlements are paid more than twice their salary compared to what they receive from Palestinian employers.<ref name="jpost.com" />

In 2008, [[Kav LaOved]] charged that Palestinians who work in Israeli settlements are not granted basic protections of Israeli labor law. Instead, they are employed under [[Jordan]]ian labor law, which does not require minimum wage, payment for overtime and other social rights. In 2007, the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that Israeli labor law does apply to Palestinians working in West Bank settlements and applying different rules in the same work place constituted discrimination. The ruling allowed Palestinian workers to file lawsuits in Israeli courts. In 2008, the average sum claimed by such lawsuits stood at 100,000 shekels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kavlaoved.org.il/media-view_eng.asp?id=2356|title=Palestinian workers in Israeli West Bank settlements – 2008|publisher=[[Kav LaOved]]|access-date=29 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233329/http://www.kavlaoved.org.il/media-view_eng.asp?id=2356|archive-date=16 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 63% of Palestinians opposed PA plans to prosecute Palestinians who work in the settlements.

=== Olive trees ===
While the [[Economy of the Palestinian territories]] has shown signs of growth, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] reported that Palestinian olive farming has suffered. According to the ICRC, 10,000 olive trees were cut down or burned by settlers in 2007–2010.<ref name="BBC1">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8519921.stm Israel makes life very hard for Palestinians, says ICRC] (BBC, 17 February 2010)</ref><ref name="btselem5">{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Settler_Violence/20061029_Olive_Harvest.asp|title=29 October 06: B'Tselem Urges the Security Forces to Prepare for the Olive Harvest|publisher=[[B'Tselem]]|date=29 October 2006}}</ref> Foreign ministry spokesman [[Yigal Palmor]] said the report ignored official PA data showing that the economic situation of Palestinians had improved substantially, citing Mahmoud Abbas's comment to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in May 2009, where he said "in the West Bank, we have a good reality, the people are living a normal life."<ref name="BBC1" />

Violent attacks on olive trees seem to be facilitated by the apparently systematic refusal of the Israeli authorities to allow Palestinians to visit their own groves, some times for years, especially in cases where the groves are deemed to be too close to settlements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barahona|first=Ana|title=Bearing Witness: Eight Weeks in Palestine|publisher=Metete|location=London |isbn=978-1-908099-02-0|year=2013|pages=23, 26}}</ref>

== Environmental issues ==
Municipal Environmental Associations of Judea and Samaria, an environmental awareness group, was established by the settlers to address sewage treatment problems and cooperate with the Palestinian Authority on environmental issues.<ref name=bbc_pollution /> According to a 2004 report by [[EcoPeace Middle East|Friends of the Earth Middle East]], settlers account for 10% of the population in the West Bank but produce 25% of the sewage output.<ref name="bbc_pollution" /> [[Beit Duqqu]] and [[Qalqilyah]] have accused settlers of polluting their farmland and villagers claim children have become ill after swimming in a local stream.

== Dismantling of settlements ==
{{Further|Israel's unilateral disengagement plan}}
[[File:Yamit evacuation 3.jpg|thumb|upright|IDF soldiers evacuating Yamit, 1982]]
An early evacuation took place in 1982 as part of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, when Israel was required to evacuate its settlers from the 18 Sinai settlements. Arab parties to the conflict had demanded the dismantlement of the settlements as a condition for peace with Israel. The evacuation was carried out with force in some instances, for example in Yamit. The settlements were demolished, as it was feared that settlers might try to return to their homes after the evacuation.

[[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]] took place in 2005. It involved the evacuation of settlements in the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank, including all 21 settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank, while retaining control over Gaza's borders, coastline, and airspace. Most of these settlements had existed since the early 1980s, some were over 30 years old;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dromi|first=Shai M.|title=Uneasy Settlements: Reparation Politics and the Meanings of Money in the Israeli Withdrawal from Gaza|journal=Sociological Inquiry|year=2014|volume=48|issue=1|pages=294–315|doi=10.1111/soin.12028 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/976461}}<!--|accessdate=23 December 2013--></ref> the total population involved was more than 10,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} There was significant opposition to the plan among parts of the Israeli public, and especially those living in the territories.

Within the former settlements, almost all buildings were demolished by Israel, with the exception of certain government and religious structures, which were completely emptied. Under an international arrangement, productive greenhouses were left to assist the Palestinian economy but about 30% of these were destroyed within hours by Palestinian looters.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9331863 Looters strip Gaza greenhouses], NBC News, [[Associated Press]], 13 September 2005.</ref> Following the withdrawal, many of the former synagogues were torched and destroyed by Palestinians.<ref name="t2005-09-12">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article565679.ece|title=Synagogues burn in Gaza|last=Freeman|first=Simon|date=12 September 2005|work=The Times|access-date=7 September 2010}}</ref> The Palestinian leadership "maintained" that the synagogues were "symbols of Israeli occupation."

Some believe that settlements need not necessarily be dismantled and evacuated, even if Israel withdraws from the territory where they stand, as they can remain under Palestinian rule. These ideas have been expressed both by left-wing Israelis,<ref name="A Cup of Tea in Old Jerusalem">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.co.il/com/Advertising/Ysadeh/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991006195817/http://www.jpost.co.il/com/Advertising/Ysadeh/|archive-date=6 October 1999|title=A Cup of Tea in Old Jerusalem}}</ref> and by Palestinians who advocate the [[two-state solution]], and by extreme Israeli right-wingers and settlers<ref name="Interview: Israeli settler Avi Farhan">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5EB5E1B3-B64F-43DF-A588-1C40FDDB0A83.htm |title=Interview: Israeli settler Avi Farhan |access-date=12 November 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101013515/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/5EB5E1B3-B64F-43DF-A588-1C40FDDB0A83.htm |archive-date=1 November 2005}}</ref> who object to any dismantling and claim links to the land that are stronger than the political boundaries of the state of Israel.

The Israeli government has often threatened to dismantle [[Israeli outpost|outposts]]. Some have actually been dismantled, occasionally with use of force; this led to [[Israeli settler violence|settler violence]].

== Palestinian statehood bid of 2011 ==
American refusal to declare the settlements illegal was said to be the determining factor in the 2011 attempt to declare Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, the so-called [[Palestine 194]] initiative.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/pa-official-u-s-mideast-peace-offer-convinced-palestinians-to-seek-statehood-at-un-1.385011 "PA official: U.S. Mideast peace offer convinced Palestinians to seek statehood at UN."] ''Haaretz'', 17 September 2011.</ref>

Palestinians claim that Israel has undermined the Oslo accords and peace process by continuing to expand the settlements. Settlements in the Sinai Peninsula were evacuated and razed in the wake of the peace agreement with [[Egypt]]. The 27 ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union published a report in May 2012 strongly denouncing policies of the State of Israel in the West Bank and finding that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and "threaten to make a two-state solution impossible."<ref name="haaretz.com" /> In the framework of the [[Oslo I Accord]] of 1993 between the Israeli government and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), a [[modus vivendi]] was reached whereby both parties agreed to postpone a final solution on the destination of the settlements to the permanent status negotiations (Article V.3). Israel claims that settlements thereby were not prohibited, since there is no explicit interim provision prohibiting continued settlement construction, the agreement does register an undertaking by both sides, namely that "Neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations" (Article XXX1 (7)), which has been interpreted as, not forbidding settlements, but imposing severe restrictions on new settlement building after that date.<ref name="Jacques">Mélanie Jacques, ''Armed Conflict and Displacement: The Protection of Refugees and Displaced Persons Under International Humanitarian Law'', Cambridge University Press 2012 pp. 96–97.</ref> Melanie Jacques argued in this context that even 'agreements between Israel and the Palestinians which would allow settlements in the OPT, or simply tolerate them pending a settlement of the conflict, violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.'<ref name="Jacques" />

Final status proposals have called for retaining long-established communities along the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] and transferring the same amount of land in Israel to the Palestinian state. The Clinton administration [[The Clinton Parameters|proposed]] that Israel keep some settlements in the West Bank, especially those in large blocs near the pre-1967 borders of Israel, with the Palestinians receiving concessions of land in other parts of the country.<ref>[http://www.hanania.com/aaview/CD08-16-05DennisRoosBook.htm Review of Dennis Ross book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201743/http://www.hanania.com/aaview/CD08-16-05DennisRoosBook.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, by Ray Hanania, hanania.com, 16 August 2004.

He cited Israel's dismantlement of settlements in both the Sinai which took place after a peace agreement, and its unilateral dismantlement of settlements in the Gaza Strip. He presumed that settlements would stop being built were Palestinians to establish a state in a given area.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3970766,00.html 'Israel's UN envoy says only peace can halt settlements,'] AFP/[[Ynet]], 17 October 2010.</ref>

=== Proposals for land swap ===

{{see also|Settlement blocs}}
[[The Clinton Parameters]], a 2000 peace proposal by then U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], included a plan on which the Palestinian State was to include 94–96% of the [[West Bank]], and around 80% of the settlers were to be under Israeli sovereignty, and in exchange for that, Israel will concede some territory (so called 'Territory Exchange' or 'Land Swap') within the Green Line (1967 borders). The swap would consist of 1–3% of Israeli territory, such that the final borders of the West Bank part of the Palestinian state would include 97% of the land of the original borders.<ref name=peacelobby>[http://www.peacelobby.org/clinton_parameters.htm Clinton Parameters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117011736/http://www.peacelobby.org/clinton_parameters.htm |date=17 January 2015 }}, The Jewish Peace Lobby website, full text (English)</ref>

In 2010, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinians and Israel have agreed on the principle of a land swap. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping settlement blocs is an issue of dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel insisting that other factors be considered as well.<ref name=JP>{{cite news|last=Abu Toameh|first=Khaled|title=Abbas: Land swap principle reached|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=176148 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref>

Under any peace deal with the Palestinians, Israel intends to keep the major settlement blocs close to its borders, which contain over 80% of the settlers. Prime Ministers [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] have all stated Israel's intent to keep such blocs under any peace agreement. U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] acknowledged that such areas should be annexed to Israel in a 2004 letter to Prime Minister Sharon.<ref name="factsheet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-ldquo-consensus-rdquo-settlements|title=The "Consensus" Settlements|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>

The [[European Union]] position is that any annexation of settlements should be done as part of mutually agreed land swaps, which would see the Palestinians controlling territory equivalent to the territory captured in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=378&PID=1857&IID=6797|title=The European Union: Challenges for Israeli Diplomacy|publisher=Jewish Center for Public Affairs|access-date=28 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917192246/http://jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=378&PID=1857&IID=6797|archive-date=17 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The EU says that it will not recognise any changes to the 1967 borders without an agreement between the parties.

Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] has proposed a [[Lieberman plan|plan]] which would see settlement blocs annexed to Israel in exchange for heavily [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] areas inside Israel as part of a [[population exchange]].

According to [[Mitchell Bard|Mitchell G. Bard]]: "Ultimately, Israel may decide to unilaterally disengage from the West Bank and determine which settlements it will incorporate within the borders it delineates. Israel would prefer, however, to negotiate a peace treaty with the Palestinians that would specify which Jewish communities will remain intact within the mutually agreed border of Israel, and which will need to be evacuated. Israel will undoubtedly insist that some or all of the "consensus" blocs become part of Israel".<ref name="factsheet" />

=== Proposal of dual citizenship ===
A number of proposals for the granting of Palestinian citizenship or residential permits to Jewish settlers in return for the removal of Israeli military installations from the West Bank have been fielded by such individuals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1014952.html|title=Let them stay in Palestine|work=Haaretz|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> as Arafat,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/01/30/story2939.asp |title=Arafat may allow Jewish settlers to stay in West Bank |access-date=3 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040518071800/http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/01/30/story2939.asp |archive-date=18 May 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Ibrahim Sarsur]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/715018.html|title=Haaretz – Israel News – Haaretz.com|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> and [[Ahmed Qurei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5056912|title=PA: Settlers can become Palestinian citizens|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> In contrast, [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in July 2013 that "In a final resolution, we would not see the presence of a single Israeli—civilian or soldier—on our lands."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Abbas-wants-not-a-single-Israeli-in-future-Palestinian-state-321470|title=Abbas: 'Not a single Israeli' in future Palestinian state|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2013-07-30|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref>

Israeli Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]] said in April 2010 that ''"just as Arabs live in Israel, so, too, should Jews be able to live in Palestine." ... "If we are talking about coexistence and peace, why the [Palestinian] insistence that the territory they receive be ethnically cleansed of Jews?"''.<ref>Herb Keinon, [https://www.jpost.com/Israel/No-need-to-remove-any-settlements 'No need to remove any settlements'] ''Jerusalem Post'', 16 April 2010</ref>

The idea has been expressed by both advocates of the two-state solution<ref name="A Cup of Tea in Old Jerusalem" /> and supporters of the settlers and conservative or fundamentalist currents in Israeli Judaism<ref name="Interview: Israeli settler Avi Farhan" /> that, while objecting to any withdrawal, claim [[Land of Israel|stronger links to the land]] than to the state of Israel.

===Pre Resolution 2334===
On 19 June 2011, ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that the Israeli cabinet voted to revoke Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s authority to veto new settlement construction in the West Bank, by transferring this authority from the Agriculture Ministry, headed by Barak ally [[Orit Noked]], to the Prime Minister's office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heruti |first=Tali |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/cabinet-votes-to-curtail-barak-s-power-to-veto-west-bank-settlement-construction-1.368517 |title=Cabinet Votes to Curtail Barak's Power to Veto West Bank Settlement Construction |work=Haaretz |date=2011-06-19 |access-date=2016-06-10}}</ref>

As stated before, the Israeli government (as of 2015) has a program of residential subsidies in which Israeli settlers receive about double that given to Israelis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As well, settlers in isolated areas receive three times the Israeli national average. From the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2013, the Israeli settlement population as a whole increased by a rate of over 4% per year. A ''New York Times'' article in 2015 stated that said building had been "at the heart of mounting European criticism of Israel."<ref name=Rudoren />

The 2017 [[Regulation Law|Settlement Regularization in "Judea and Samaria" Law]] permits backdated legalization of outposts constructed on private Palestinian land.
