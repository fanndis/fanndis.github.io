The '''Associated Press''' ('''AP''') is an American [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[news agency]] headquartered in [[New York City]]. Founded in 1846, it operates as a [[cooperative]], [[unincorporated association]]. Its members are U.S. newspapers and broadcasters. AP news reports, distributed to its members and customers, are produced in English, Spanish and Arabic. The AP has earned 54 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], including 32 for photography, since the award was established in 1917.

The AP has been tracking vote counts in U.S. elections since 1848, including national, state and local races down to the legislative level in all 50 states, along with key ballot measures. The AP collects and verifies returns in every county, parish, city and town across the U.S., and declares winners in over 5,000 contests.

By 2016, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/AssociatedPress_2016FinancialStatements.pdf|title=2016 Consolidated Financial Statements|date=April 5, 2017|website=Associated Press|access-date=March 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172429/https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2016/AssociatedPress_2016FinancialStatements.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The AP operates 248 [[news bureau]]s in 99 countries.<ref name=bythenumbers2019/> It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative. As part of their cooperative agreement with the AP, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their [[local news]] reports. The AP traditionally employed the "[[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]]" formula for writing, a method that enables news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essentials, although in 2007, then-AP President [[Tom Curley]] called the practice "dead."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Associated Press CEO: "The Inverted Pyramid Is Dead" |journal=Adweek |date=November 2, 2007 |url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/associated-press-ceo-the-inverted-pyramid-is-dead/}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:the associated press building in new york city.jpg|thumb|upright|Logo on the former AP Building in New York City]]

The Associated Press was formed in May 1846<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|title=Associated Press Founded - This Day in History May 22|work=New York Natives|date=2015-05-22|accessdate=2016-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324173630/http://newyorknatives.com/on-this-day-in-nycs-history-associated-press-formed/|archive-date=2016-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> by five daily newspapers in [[New York City]] to share the cost of transmitting news of the [[Mexican–American War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15108618|title=Network effects|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221035608/http://www.economist.com/node/15108618|archive-date=2018-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> The venture was organized by [[Moses Yale Beach]] (1800–68), second publisher of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', joined by the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'', ''[[The Journal of Commerce]]'', and the ''[[New York Evening Express]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/06/26/the-birth-of-atari-modern-computer-design-and-the-software-industry-this-week-in-tech-history/|title=The Birth of Atari, Modern Computer Design, And The Software Industry: This Week In Tech History|last=Press|first=Gil|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221040359/https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/06/26/the-birth-of-atari-modern-computer-design-and-the-software-industry-this-week-in-tech-history/|archive-date=2018-02-21|url-status=live}}</ref> Some historians<ref name=Tribune>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us-kDH5LqHEC&q=tribune+associated+press+1849&pg=PA93|title=The Nation's Newsbrokers: The formative years, from pretelegraphs to 1865|last=Schwarzlose|first=Richard Allen|date=1989|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=9780810108189|page=93|access-date=January 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104124424/https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Us-kDH5LqHEC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=tribune+associated+press+1849&source=bl&ots=4NXNCQqM_9&sig=ZdCcNzuktOTNGHU4lbzmIfr_x-0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5juSHldPfAhUU6LwKHTWfBFAQ6AEwGnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=tribune%20associated%20press%201849&f=false|archive-date=January 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> believe that the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. ''[[The New York Times]]'' became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and [[price setting]] practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by [[Victor Lawson]], editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 [[Illinois Supreme Court]] decision (''Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press'')—that the AP was a [[public utility]] and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/International_News_Agencies/fNHHDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22In+1900,+an+Illinois+Supreme+Court+decision+Chicago+Inter+Ocean%22&pg=PA69&printsec=frontcover|title=International News Agencies: A History|last=Palmer|first=Michael B.|date=2019|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9783030311773|page=69|access-date=3 June 2020}}</ref>

When the AP was founded, news became a saleable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Spanish–American War]], there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. [[Melville Stone]], who had founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after [[World War&nbsp;II]]), the Middle East. He introduced the "telegraph typewriter" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA392 |title=Wire That Photo |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1937 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>

In 1945, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'' that the AP had been violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival [[United Press International]], headed by [[Hugh Baillie]] from 1935 to 1955.

AP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form [[Associated Press Television News|APTN]], which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at [[Manhattan West|450 West 33rd Street]] in Manhattan—which also houses the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the studios of New York's public television station, [[WNET]]. In 2019, AP had more than 240 bureaus globally.<ref name=bythenumbers2019>{{Cite web |title=AP by the numbers |agency=Associated Press |date=2019 |access-date=10 September 2020 |url=https://www.ap.org/about/annual-report/2019/ap-by-the-numbers}}</ref> Its mission—"to gather with economy and efficiency an accurate and impartial report of the news"—has not changed since its founding, but digital technology has made the distribution of the AP news report an interactive endeavor between AP and its 1,400 U.S. newspaper members as well as broadcasters, international subscribers, and online customers.

The AP began diversifying its news gathering capabilities and by 2007 AP was generating only about 30% of its revenue from United States newspapers. 37% came from the global broadcast customers, 15% from online ventures and 18% came from international newspapers and from photography.<ref>{{cite news |title=Down On The Wire |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/13/media-newspapers-ap-biz-media-cx_lh_0214ap.html |quote=Last year, AP generated only about 30% of its revenue from U.S. newspapers.

===Web resources===
The AP's multi-topic structure has resulted in web portals such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[MSN]] posting its articles, often relying on the AP as their first source for news coverage of breaking news items. This and the constant updating evolving stories require has had a major impact on the AP's public image and role, giving new credence to the AP's ongoing mission of having staff for covering every area of news fully and promptly.

The AP college basketball poll has been used as a guide for which teams deserve national attention. The poll first began its poll of college basketball teams in 1949, and has since conducted over 1,100 polls. The college basketball poll started with 20 teams and was reduced to 10 during the 1960-61 college basketball season. It returned to 20 teams in 1968-69 and expanded to 25 beginning in 1989–90.

====Fair-use controversy====
In June 2008, the AP sent numerous [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] take down demands and threatened legal action against several [[blog]]s. The AP contended that the internet blogs were violating AP's [[copyright]] by linking to AP material and using headlines and short summaries in those links. Many bloggers and experts noted that the use of the AP news fell squarely under commonly accepted internet practices and within [[fair use|fair-use]] standards.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4381 |title = AP's Fair Use Challenge (Harvard Law) |work = Berkman Center for Internet and Society |date = 2008-06-17 |accessdate = 2014-06-04 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512044752/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4381 |archive-date = 2011-05-12 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Others noted and demonstrated that AP routinely takes similar excerpts from other sources, often without attribution or licenses.

====Shepard Fairey====
In March 2009, the Associated Press counter-sued artist [[Shepard Fairey]] over [[Obama HOPE poster|his famous image of Barack Obama]], saying the uncredited, uncompensated use of an AP photo violated [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright laws]] and signaled a threat to [[journalism]]. Fairey had sued the AP the previous month over his artwork, titled "Obama Hope" and "Obama Progress", arguing that he did not violate copyright law because he dramatically changed the image. The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by [[Mannie Garcia]], was a popular image during the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] and now hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. According to the AP lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly "misappropriated The AP's rights in that image". The suit asked the court to award AP profits made off the image and damages. Fairey said he looked forward to "upholding the [[Freedom of speech|free expression]] rights at stake here" and disproving the AP's accusations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In January 2011 this suit was settled with neither side declaring their position to be wrong but agreeing to share reproduction rights and profits from Fairey's work.<ref name=NPRFaireyvAPSettlement>{{cite news|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title=Shepard Fairey And AP Settle Copyright Dispute Over 'Hope' Poster|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/12/132860606/shepard-fairey-and-ap-settle-copyright-dispute-over-hope-poster|accessdate=31 August 2012|work=NPR|date=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623172550/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/12/132860606/shepard-fairey-and-ap-settle-copyright-dispute-over-hope-poster|archive-date=23 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

==="Illegal immigrant"===
In April 2013, AP stated that it had dropped the term "[[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]" from its [[AP Stylebook]]. AP followed [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[CNN]] in not using the term. [[Jose Antonio Vargas]] commended The Associated Press for its decision.<ref>{{cite news |title=Associated Press Drops 'Illegal Immigrant' From Stylebook |author=Christina Costantini |url=https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/press-drops-illegal-immigrant-standards-book/story?id=18862824&page=2 |work=ABC News |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406011944/https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/press-drops-illegal-immigrant-standards-book/story?id=18862824&page=2 |archive-date=6 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===AP deal with Nazi Germany===
The AP gave the [[Nazi regime]] access to its photo archives for its antisemitic propaganda.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Philip Oltermann |title=Revealed: how Associated Press cooperated with the Nazis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/associated-press-cooperation-nazis-revealed-germany-harriet-scharnberg |accessdate=4 July 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 March 2016 |language=en |quote=AP also allowed the Nazi regime to use its photo archives for its virulently antisemitic propaganda literature. Publications illustrated with AP photographs include the bestselling SS brochure “Der Untermensch” (“The Sub-Human”) and the booklet “The Jews in the USA”, which aimed to demonstrate the decadence of Jewish Americans with a picture of New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia eating from a buffet with his hands}}</ref>

Investigators (chiefly Norman Domeier of the University of Vienna) have in recent years brought to wider attention the (well known in some  circles) secret that there was a deal between Associated Press and the German government related to the interchange of press photos during the period in which the United States was at war with Germany. This relationship involved the Buro Laux, run by the photographer, [[Helmut Laux]].

The mechanism for this interchange was that a courier flew to Lisbon and back each day transporting photos from and for Germany's wartime enemy, the US, via diplomatic pouch. The transactions were initially conducted at the AP bureau under Luiz Lupi in Lisbon, and from 1944, when the exchange via Lisbon took too long, also at the AP bureau in Stockholm under Eddie Shanke. Here, as a cover, the Swedish agency, {{Ill|Pressens Bild|sv}}, was involved as an intermediary. An estimated 40,000 photos were exchanged between the enemies in this way.<ref>{{cite web|trans-title=Secret Photos.
