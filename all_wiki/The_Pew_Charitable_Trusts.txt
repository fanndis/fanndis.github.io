'''The Pew Charitable Trusts''' is an independent [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), founded in 1948.

With over {{US$}}6 billion in assets, its stated mission is to serve the [[public interest]] by "improving [[public policy]], informing the public, and invigorating civic life".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/how-we-work |title=How We Work |publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts

==History==
The Trusts, a single entity, is the successor to, and sole beneficiary of, seven charitable funds established between 1948 and 1979 by [[J. Howard Pew]], Mary Ethel Pew, [[Joseph N. Pew, Jr.]], and Mabel Pew Myrin—the adult sons and daughters of [[Sunoco|Sun Oil Company]] founder [[Joseph Newton Pew|Joseph N. Pew]] and his wife, Mary Anderson Pew. Honoring their parents' religious conviction that good works should be done quietly, the original Pew Memorial Foundation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/history |title=History of The Pew Charitable Trusts |publisher=Pewtrusts.org |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> was a grantmaking organization that made donations anonymously. The foundation became the Pew Memorial Trust in 1956, based in Philadelphia, the donors' hometown. Between 1957 and 1979, six other trusts were created, representing the personal and complementary philanthropic interests of the four siblings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bushouse |first=Brenda K. |title=Universal Preschool: Policy Change, Stability, and The Pew Charitable Trusts |date=March 5, 2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-8e47YCXFYC&q=pew+Memorial+Foundation&pg=PA104 |isbn=9780791493878 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/pew.html |title=J.

Although today The Pew Charitable Trusts is non-partisan and non-ideological, Joseph Pew and his sons were politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. The modern day organization works to encourage responsive government and support scientific research on a wide range of issues, including global [[ocean governance]], [[correction reform]], and [[antibiotic resistance]].

Early priorities of the Pew Memorial Trust included [[cancer research]], the [[American Red Cross]], and a pioneering project to assist [[historically black colleges]]. Later beneficiaries included conservative organizations such as the [[John Birch Society]], the [[American Liberty League]], and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], as well as environmental organizations such as the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], and mainstream think tanks like the center-left [[Brookings Institution]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Sara| authorlink = Sara Diamond |title=Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States |url=https://archive.org/details/roadstodominionr00diamrich |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Colby |first=Gerald| authorlink =Gerard Colby |author2=Charlotte Dennett  |title=Thy Will Be Done: The Conquest of the Amazon: Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of Oil |year=1995 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York}}</ref> The Trusts continues to fund charities and the arts in [[Philadelphia]].

In 2004, the Pew Trusts applied to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to change its status from [[private foundation]] to [[nonprofit organization]].  Since that change it can now raise funds freely and devote up to 5% of its budget to lobbying the public sector.

According to the Pew Trusts' website, five of the ten Directors serving on the Board are named Pew.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/leadership |title=Leadership |publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=2020-07-01}}</ref>

==Current concerns==
The Trusts' public policy areas include the environment, state policy, economic policy and health and human services.

The Trusts, with other groups, backed an effort to create [[marine protected area]]s in the Pacific Ocean, near the [[Mariana Islands]].<ref name=washpost2009jan7>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/05/AR2009010501181.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Bush to Protect Three Areas in Pacific|author=Juliet Eilperin, Washington Post Staff Writer |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> The protected area was officially designated in January 2009, and includes the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest ocean canyon in the world. Another marine protected area that the Trusts and other groups sought to protect is [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] which was protected by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in 2006<ref name=pewsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/global-ocean-legacy |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Pewtrusts.org |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> and expanded by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] in 2016.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/27/obama-creates-largest-ocean-reserve-takes-heat-for-new-federal-decrees.html Obama creates largest ocean reserve, takes heat for new federal decrees] (August 27, 2016).

The Trusts also funds the [[Pew Research Center]], the third-largest [[think tank]] in Washington, D.C., after the [[Brookings Institution]] and the [[Center for American Progress]].

The Trusts have worked closely with the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] on issues related to state correction policies in the Public Safety Performance Project.<ref>[https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/public-safety-performance-project Public Safety Performance]. Retrieved 2010-02-22.</ref> In 2008, Pew reported that more than one in 100 adults in the United States is in jail or prison, an all-time high.

Pew reported in 2009 that "explosive growth in the number of people on probation or parole has propelled the population of the American corrections system to more than 7.3 million, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults."

The trust also helped fund the ''Gospel and Our Culture Network'', which published books such as ''Missional Church: A vision for the sending of the Church in North America''.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nmn1xBsVBcIC&q=Missional+Church | title = Missional church: A vision for the sending of the church in North America | isbn = 978-0-8028-4350-0 | last1 = Guder | first1 = Darrell L | last2 = Barrett | first2 = Lois | date = 1998-03-15}}</ref>

In October 2020, the Trusts unveiled research on [[naloxone]], the lifesaving overdose reversal drug. Pew researchers concluded that expanded access to naloxone saves lives and put forth several recommendations on how to do so, including options such as [[co-prescribing naloxone with opioids]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carey|first=Liz|date=2020-10-22|title=PEW researchers: expanded naloxone access can curb opioid deaths|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/56677-pew-researchers-expanded-naloxone-access-can-curb-opioid-deaths/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-29|website=Homeland Preparedness News}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Barnes Art Collection===
The Trusts have supported the relocation of the famed [[Barnes Foundation|Barnes Art Collection]] from its longtime home in [[Lower Merion, PA]], to [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]]. This has been controversial in the art world. The Barnes Foundation was established by [[Albert C. Barnes]] in 1922 to "promote the advancement of education and the appreciation of the fine arts and horticulture."<ref>{{Cite web |title=About |url=https://www.barnesfoundation.org/about |publisher=[[Barnes Foundation]] |date=15 August 2017 |orig-year=5 July 2017 |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> "The Barnes is home to one of the world's largest collections of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] and early [[Modern art|Modern]] paintings, with especially deep holdings by [[Renoir]], [[Matisse]], and [[Picasso]]", as well as important examples of [[African art]], [[Native American pottery]] and [[Native American jewelry|jewelry]], [[Pennsylvania German]] furniture, American [[avant-garde]] painting, and [[wrought iron|wrought-iron]] metalwork."<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the Collection |url=https://www.barnesfoundation.org/whats-on/collection |publisher=[[Barnes Foundation]] |date=14 January 2020 |orig-year=31 July 2017 |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

Opponents of relocating the collection to a new museum along the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] said that move violates Barnes' will that the collection stay intact at its original location and not be loaned, transferred or sold. Columnist [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote in 2010, "It is perfectly clear exactly what Barnes specified in his will. It was drawn up by the best legal minds. It is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes."<ref name=barnes>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2010/01/20/faq-on-the-pew-charitable-trusts-role-in-the-barnes-foundation-move |title=FAQ on The Pew Charitable Trusts' Role in the Barnes Foundation Move |publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-27}}</ref> Yet the Barnes Foundation prevailed in a series of legal actions and the new museum opened on May 16, 2012. At the opening Barnes trustee and treasurer [[Stephen Harmelin]] noted, "There were financial challenges to be faced...questions about how the foundation as it existed could go on with its mission, worries about the safety and integrity of the collection in the long run," he said. "We were convinced that the only change that could save the Barnes was to redouble our commitment to its mission, to reach out more widely than ever before, to build, to expand and to move the collection to a more accessible location."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/contested-barnes-foundation-artworks-open-in-new-philly-location-1.1139748 | publisher=[[CBC News]] | title=Contested Barnes Foundation artworks open in new Philly location | date=2012-05-17}}</ref>

The Trusts became involved with the Barnes Collection when the foundation overseeing the art collection had serious financial trouble, ultimately contributing more than $20 million for a new museum. ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[Roberta Smith]] said of the new building, "Against all odds, the museum that opens to the public on Saturday is still very much the old Barnes, only better."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/arts/design/the-barnes-foundation-from-suburb-to-city.html |work=The New York Times |first=Roberta |last=Smith |title=A Museum, Reborn, Remains True to Its Old Self, Only Better | date=2012-05-17}}</ref>

The controversy involving Pew, other donors, the Barnes trustees and the collection was the subject of a documentary film ''[[The Art of the Steal (2009 film)|The Art of the Steal]]''. The Trusts did not participate in the film. [[Rebecca Rimel]], then head of The Pew Charitable Trusts, said they believed the film would not be fair.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030405778.html |work=The Washington Post | first=Philip |last=Kennicott |title='The Art of the Steal' highlights one-sided nature of some documentaries | date=2010-03-07}}</ref>

=== Texas Public Policy Foundation ===
Between 2011 and 2015, financial returns show The Pew Charitable Trusts gave $4.7 million to the [[Texas Public Policy Foundation]] (TPPF) earmarked specifically for the organization’s criminal justice reform project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.desmogblog.com/2017/12/14/pew-charitable-trusts-funding-climate-denial-texas-public-policy-foundation-hartnett-white|title=Why Has One of the World's Biggest Funders of Environmental Conservation Also Given $4 Million to a Climate Denial Group?|work=[[DeSmogBlog]]|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/revealed-the-corporations-and-billionaires-that-fund-the-texas-public-policy-foundation/|title=Revealed: The Corporations and Billionaires that Fund the Texas Public Policy Foundation |date=2012-08-24|work=The Texas Observer|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=There is no explanation of what the controversy is?|date=June 2020}}
