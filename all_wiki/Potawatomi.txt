The '''Potawatomi''' {{IPAc-en|p|ɒ|t|ə|ˈ|w|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}},<ref>{{OED|Potawatomi}}</ref><ref>Clifton, James A. (1978). "Potawatomi." In ''Northeast'', ed. Bruce G. Trigger. Vol. 15 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 725</ref> also spelled '''Pottawatomi''' and '''Pottawatomie''' (among [[Potawatomi ethnonyms|many variations]]), are a Native American people of the Great Plains, upper [[Mississippi River]], and western [[Great Lakes]] region. They traditionally speak the [[Potawatomi language]], a member of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin family]]. The Potawatomi call themselves '''''Neshnabé''''', a [[cognate]] of the word ''[[Anishinaabe]]''. The Potawatomi are part of a long-term alliance, called the [[Council of Three Fires]], with the [[Ojibway]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Odawa (Ottawa)]]. In the Council of Three Fires, the Potawatomi are considered the "youngest brother" and are referred to in this context as '''''Bodéwadmi''''', a name that means "keepers of the fire" and refers to the council fire of three peoples.

In the 19th century, they were pushed to the west by European/American encroachment in the late 18th century and removed from their lands in the Great Lakes region to reservations in Oklahoma. Under [[Indian Removal]], they eventually ceded many of their lands, and most of the Potawatomi relocated to [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Indian Territory]], now in Oklahoma. Some bands survived in the Great Lakes region and today are federally recognized as tribes. In Canada, there are over 634 recognized [[First Nation]] governments or bands.

==Name==
{{main|List of Potawatomi ethnonyms}}
The English "Potawatomi" is derived from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] {{lang|oj|Boodewaadamii(g)}} ([[syncope (phonology)|syncoped]] in the [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] as {{lang|otw|Boodewaadmii(g)}}).  The Potawatomi name for themselves ([[endonym|autonym]]) is {{lang|pot|Bodéwadmi}} (without syncope: {{lang|pot|Bodéwademi}}; plural: {{lang|pot|Bodéwadmik}}), a [[cognate]] of the Ojibwe form. Their name means "those who tend the hearth-fire," which refers to the hearth of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. The word comes from "to tend the hearth-fire," which is {{lang|pot|bodewadm}} (without syncope: {{lang|pot|bodewadem}}) in the [[Potawatomi language]]; the Ojibwe and Ottawa forms are {{lang|oj|boodawaadam}} and {{lang|oj|boodwaadam}}, respectively.

Alternatively, the Potawatomi call themselves {{lang|pot|Neshnabé}} (without syncope: {{lang|pot|Eneshenabé}}; plural: {{lang|pot|Neshnabék}}), a cognate of Ojibwe {{lang|oj|[[Anishinaabe]](g)}}, meaning "original people".

== Teachings ==
The Potawatomi teach their children about the "Seven Grandfather Teachings" of wisdom, respect, love, honesty, humility, bravery, and truth toward each other and all creation,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Humphries|first1=Maria|last2=Verbos|first2=Amy Klemm|date=2014-08-01|title=A Native American Relational Ethic: An Indigenous Perspective on Teaching Human Responsibility|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s10551-013-1790-3|s2cid=143379265|issn=1573-0697}}</ref> each one of which teaches them the equality and importance of their fellow tribesmen and respect for all of nature’s creations. The story itself teaches the importance of patience and listening as it follows the Water Spider's journey to retrieve fire for the other animals to survive the cold. As the other animals step forth one after another to proclaim that they shall be the ones to retrieve the fire, the Water spider sits and waits while listening to her fellow animals. As they finish and wrestle with their fears, she steps forward and announces that she will be the one to bring it back. As they laugh and doubt her she weaves a bowl out of her own web that sails her across the water to retrieve the fire. She brings back a hot coal out of which they make fire, and they celebrate her honor and bravery.

==History==
[[File:Pottawatomi Fashion at the Field Museum in Chicago.jpg|thumb|upright|Regalia at the Field Museum in Chicago]]

The Potawatomi are first mentioned in French records, which suggest that in the early 17th century, they lived in what is now southwestern [[Michigan]]. During the [[Beaver Wars]] they fled to the area around [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] to escape attacks by both the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Neutral Nation]], who were seeking expanded hunting grounds. It is estimated in 1658 that the Potawatomi numbered around 3,000.

As an important part of [[Tecumseh]]'s Confederacy, Potawatomi warriors took part in [[Tecumseh's War]], the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Peoria War]].  Their alliances switched repeatedly between [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the United States as power relations shifted between the nations, and they calculated effects on their trade and land interests.

At the time of the War of 1812, a band of Potawatomi inhabited the area near [[Fort Dearborn]], where [[Chicago]] developed. Led by the chiefs Blackbird and Nuscotomeg (Mad Sturgeon), a force of about 500 warriors attacked the United States evacuation column leaving Fort Dearborn; they killed most of the civilians and 54 of Captain [[Nathan Heald]]'s force, and wounded many others. [[George Ronan]], the first graduate of [[West Point]] to be killed in combat, died in this ambush. The incident is referred to as the "[[Fort Dearborn Massacre]]". A Potawatomi chief named [[Black Partridge (chief)|Mucktypoke]] ({{lang|pot|Makdébki}}<!--Omakedébeki-->, Black Partridge), counseled his fellow warriors against the attack. Later he saved some of the civilian captives who were being ransomed by the Potawatomi.<ref name=edmunds>Edmunds, R. David (1988). ''The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire''.  Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press (Civilization of the American Indian Series); {{ISBN|0-8061-2069-X}}</ref>

===French period (1615–1763)===
The [[France|French]] period of contact began with early explorers who reached the Potawatomi in western Michigan.  They also found the tribe located along the [[Door Peninsula]] of Wisconsin. By the end of the French period, the Potawatomi had begun a move to the [[Detroit]] area, leaving the large communities in Wisconsin.<ref name=edmunds/>

* Onanghisse (''Wnaneg-gizs''<!--unsyncoped: Onanego-gizes; Oj: Onaanigo-giizis--> "Shimmering Light") at [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]
* Otchik at [[Detroit]]

===British period (1763–1783)===
The British period of contact began when France ceded its lands after the defeat in the [[French and Indian War]] (aka [[Seven Years' War]]). [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] was an attempt by Native Americans to push the British and other European settlers out of their territory. The Potawatomi captured every British Frontier Garrison but the one at Detroit.<ref name=edmunds/>

The Potawatomi nation continued to grow and expanded westward from Detroit, most notably in the development of the St. Joseph villages adjacent to the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]] in southwestern Michigan. The Wisconsin communities continued and moved south along the Lake Michigan shoreline.<ref name=edmunds/>

* Washee (from {{lang|pot|Wabzi}}<!--Unsyncoped:Wabezi; Oj:Waabizii-->, "the Swan") at St. Joseph during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]

===United States treaty period (1783–1830)===
The United States Treaty period of Potawatomi history began with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] and established the United States' interest in the lower Great Lakes. It lasted until the treaties for [[Indian Removal]] were signed. The US recognized the Potawatomi as a single tribe. They often had a few tribal leaders whom all villages accepted. The Potawatomi had a decentralized society, with several main divisions based on geographic locations: [[Milwaukee]] or [[Wisconsin]] area, [[Detroit]] or [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]], the [[Kankakee River]], [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] and [[Wabash River]]s, the [[Illinois River]] and Lake Peoria, and the [[Des Plaines River|Des Plaines]] and [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox Rivers]].

===American removal period (1830–1840)===
The removal period of Potawatomi history began with the treaties of the late 1820s, when the United States created reservations. [[Billy Caldwell]] and Alexander Robinson negotiated for the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potowatomi in the [[Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien]] (1829), by which they ceded most of their lands in Wisconsin and Michigan. Some Potawatomi became religious followers of the "Kickapoo Prophet", [[Kennekuk]]. Over the years, the US reduced the size of the reservations under pressure for land by incoming European Americans. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The final step followed the [[Treaty of Chicago]], negotiated in 1833 for the tribes by Caldwell and Robinson. In return for land cessions, the US promised new lands, annuities and supplies to enable the peoples to develop new homes. The Illinois Potawatomi were removed to [[Nebraska]] and the Indiana Potawatomi to [[Kansas]], both west of the Mississippi River. Often annuities and supplies were reduced, or late in arrival, and the Potawatomi suffered after their relocations. Those in Kansas later were removed to [[Indian Territory]], now Oklahoma. The removal of the Indiana Potawatomi was documented by a Catholic priest, [[Benjamin Petit]], who accompanied the Indians on the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]]. Petit died while returning to Indiana. His diary was published in 1941 by the Indiana Historical Society.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petit |first1=Benjamin |title=The trail of death; letters of Benjamin Marie Petit |date=1941 |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |location=Indianapolis, IN |url=https://archive.org/details/trailofdeathlett141peti |accessdate=22 June 2018 |ref=petit |language=English, French}}</ref>

Many Potawatomi found ways to remain, primarily those in Michigan. Others fled to their [[Odawa people|Odawa]] neighbors or to Canada to avoid removal to the west.

==Location==
[[Image:Trail of Death Warren County.png|thumb|[[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]] marker in [[Warren County, Indiana]].]]

The Potawatomi first lived in Lower Michigan, then moved to northern Wisconsin and eventually settled into northern Indiana and central Illinois. In the early 19th century, major portions of Potawatomi lands were seized by the U.S. government. Following the [[Treaty of Chicago]] in 1833, by which the tribe ceded its lands in Illinois, most of the Potawatomi people were [[Indian Removal|removed]] to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Many perished en route to new lands in the west on their journey through [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]] and [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]), following what became known as the "[[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]]".

The Potawatomi language is most similar to the [[Odawa language]]; it also has borrowed a considerable amount of vocabulary from [[Sauk people|Sauk]]. Like the Odawa language, or the Ottawa dialect of the [[Anishinaabe language]], the Potawatomi language exhibits a great amount of vowel [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]].

Many places in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] have names derived from the Potawatomi language, including [[Waukegan]], [[Muskegon]], [[Oconomowoc]], [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa|Pottawattamie County]], [[Kalamazoo]], and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]].
