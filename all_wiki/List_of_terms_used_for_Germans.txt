There are many alternative terms for the people of [[Germany]]. In English the [[demonym]], or noun, is '''German'''. During the early [[Renaissance]], "German" implied that the person spoke [[German language|German]] as a native language. Until the [[German unification]], people living in what is now Germany were named for the region in which they lived: examples are [[Bavaria]]ns and [[Brandenburg]]ers. 

Some terms are [[humour|humorous]] or [[pejorative]] [[slang]], and used mainly by people from other countries, although they can be used in a self-deprecating way by German people themselves. Other terms are serious or tongue-in-cheek attempts to [[word coinage|coin]] words as alternatives to the ambiguous standard terms.

Many pejorative terms for Germans in various countries originated during the two World Wars.

==English==

===Hun (pejorative)===
[[File:Vote union govt - canada-hun.jpg|thumb|A First World War Canadian electoral campaign poster]]
''Hun'' (or ''The Hun'') is a term used in reference to the [[Huns]] of the [[Migration Period]]. This term was used heavily during [[World War I]] and was often seen on Allied war posters.

The origin of the term was a reference to Attila the Hun in [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]'s [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor#Hun speech of 1900|"Hun speech"]] (''{{lang|de|Hunnenrede}}'') delivered on 27 July 1900, when he bade farewell to the German expeditionary corps sailing from [[Bremerhaven]] to defeat the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The relevant part of the speech was:
{{quote|{{lang|de|Kommt ihr vor den Feind, so wird derselbe geschlagen! Pardon wird nicht gegeben! Gefangene werden nicht gemacht! Wer euch in die Hände fällt, sei euch verfallen! Wie vor tausend Jahren die Hunnen unter ihrem König Etzel sich einen Namen gemacht, der sie noch jetzt in Überlieferung und Märchen gewaltig erscheinen läßt, so möge der Name Deutsche in China auf 1000 Jahre durch euch in einer Weise bestätigt werden, daß es niemals wieder ein Chinese wagt, einen Deutschen scheel anzusehen!}}


When you meet the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! No prisoners will be taken! Those who fall into your hands are forfeit to you! Just as a thousand years ago, the Huns under their King [[Attila|Etzel]] made a name for themselves which shows them as mighty in tradition and myth, so shall you establish the name of Germans in China for 1000 years, in such a way that a Chinese will never again dare to look askance at a German.<ref>Die Reden Kaiser Wilhelms II., Hg. v. Johannes Penzler. Bd. 2: 1896-1900. Leipzig o.J., S. 209-212. [http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/dokumente/wilhelm00/index.html Deutsches Historisches Museum]</ref>}}

The theme of Hunnic savagery was then developed in a speech of [[August Bebel]] in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in which he recounted details of the cruelty of the German expedition which were taken from soldiers' letters home, styled the ''{{lang|de|Hunnenbriefe}}'' (letters from the Huns).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYOHaIa-9Z8C&pg=PA171 |title=Kolonialkrieg in China: die Niederschlagung der Boxerbewegung 1900–1901 |author=Klaus Mühlhahn |isbn=9783861534327 |year=2007 }}</ref>
The Kaiser's speech was widely reported in the European press at that time.

At the start of the [[First World War]], and following the [[Rape of Belgium|brutal and ruthless actions]] of the German Army during their [[German invasion of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]], the term was revived: It became the basis for the characterisation of the Germans during World War I as barbarians and savages with no respect for European civilisation and humanitarian values.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Picture This: World War I Posters and Visual Culture |author=Nicoletta Gullace |chapter=Barbaric Anti-Modernism: Representations of the "Hun" in Britain, North America, Australia and Beyond }}</ref> The term "Hun" from this speech was later used for the Germans by British propaganda during [[World War I]]. The comparison was helped by the spiked ''[[Pickelhaube]]'' [[helmet]] worn by German forces until 1916, which would be reminiscent of images depicting ancient Hun helmets. This usage, emphasising the idea that the Germans were [[barbarian]]s, was reinforced by [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] propaganda throughout the war. The French songwriter [[Théodore Botrel]] described the Kaiser as "an Attila, without remorse", launching "cannibal hordes".<ref>"Quand un Attila, sans remords, / Lance ses hordes cannibales, / Tout est bon qui meurtrit et mord: / Les chansons, aussi, sont des balles!", from ''Theodore Botrel'', by Edgar Preston '''T.P.'s Journal of Great Deeds of the Great War''', 27 February 1915</ref> 
By coincidence, [[Gott mit uns]] ("God is with us"), a motto first used in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and later the [[German Empire]], may have contributed to the popularization of 'Huns' as British Army slang for Germans by misreading 'uns' for 'Huns'.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CpDPBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT289&ots=tebY36ywCH&dq=huns%20gott%20mit%20uns&pg=PT289#v=onepage&q&f=false Original wavelength]</ref>

The usage of the term "Hun" to describe Germans resurfaced during [[World War II]], although less frequently than in the previous war. For example, [[Winston Churchill]] 1941 said in a broadcast speech: "There are less than 70,000,000 malignant Huns, some of whom are curable and others killable, most of whom are already engaged in holding down Austrians, Czechs, Poles and the many other ancient races they now bully and pillage."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/410427awp.html|title=PRIME MINISTER WINSTON CHURCHILL'S BROADCAST "REPORT ON THE WAR"}}</ref>
Later that year Churchill referred to the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] as "the dull, drilled, docile brutish masses of the Hun soldiery, plodding on like a swarm of crawling locusts."<ref>Churchill, Winston S. 1941. [http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/410622dwp.html "WINSTON CHURCHILL'S BROADCAST ON THE SOVIET-GERMAN WAR", London, June 22, 1941]</ref> During this time American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] also referred to the German people in this way, saying that an Allied invasion into Southern France would surely "be successful and of great assistance to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] in driving the Huns from France."<ref>[[Winston Churchill]]. 1953. "Triumph and Tragedy" (volume 6 of ''The Second World War''). Boston: Houghton-Mifflin. Ch. 4, p. 70</ref>

===Fritz===
[[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers employed a variety of epithets for the Germans. ''[[Fritz]]'', a German pet form of Friedrich,<ref name="BBC News">{{cite web|title=The English expressions coined in WW1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26277732|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> was popular in both World War I and [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Language of Ethnic Conflict: Social Organization and Lexical Culture|first=Irving|last=Allen|url=https://archive.org/details/languageofethnic0000alle|url-access=registration|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-05557-9|year=1983|page=[https://archive.org/details/languageofethnic0000alle/page/57 57]}}</ref> with ''Jerry'', short for "German", but also modeled on the English name,<ref name="BBC News"/> favoured in the latter.

===Heinie (pejorative)===
The [[Americans]] and [[Canadians]] referred to Germans, especially German soldiers, as ''Heinies'', from a diminutive of the common German male proper name Heinrich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=kraut&searchmode=none |title=etymonline, origin of "heinie" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> For example, in the film ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' the [[Slim Pickens]] character calls a German officer "''Mr Hynee Kraut!''"

Heinie is also a colloquial term for buttocks, in use since the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heinie Heinie], Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref> In German, ''[[:de:Heini|Heini]]'' is a common colloquial term with a slightly pejorative meaning similar to "moron" or "idiot", but it could be of different origin.

===Jerry ===
[[File:61-124-W Helmet German M16, WWI (5269247140).jpg|thumb|right|World War One [[Stahlhelm]], said by the British to resemble a Jeroboam.]]
''Jerry'' was a nickname given to Germans during the [[Second World War]] by soldiers and civilians of the Allied nations, in particular by the British. The nickname was originally created during [[World War One]].<ref name="etym-jerry">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Jerry |title=etymonline, origin of "Jerry" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>

The name Jerry was possibly derived from the [[stahlhelm]] introduced in 1916, which was said by British soldiers to resemble a [[chamber pot]] or Jeroboam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o11EBgAAQBAJ&q=jeroboam%20helmet%20chamber%20pot&pg=PA102|title=Laindon in the Great War|last1=Porter|first1=Ken|last2=Wynn|first2=Stephen|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2014|isbn=9781473848016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-02-18/dont-mention-the-jerries-bbc-changes-world-war-one-programme-title/|title=Don't mention the Jerries: BBC changes World War One programme title|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=18 February 2014|work=Radio Times|access-date=24 November 2018}}</ref> Alternatively, it may be a simple alteration of the word ''German''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17uHAgAAQBAJ&q=jerry%20helmet%20chamber%20pot&pg=PA119|title=Shorter Slang Dictionary|last1=Beale|first1=Paul|last2=Partridge|first2=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=9781134879526|pages=119}}</ref>

===Kraut (pejorative)===
Since World War II, ''Kraut'' has come to be used in the English language as a pejorative term for a German. This is probably based on [[sauerkraut]], which is popular in various South [[German cuisine]]s but not traditionally prepared in North Germany. The stereotype of the sauerkraut-eating German pre-dates this, as it appears in [[Jules Verne]]'s depiction of the evil German industrialist Schultze as an avid sauerkraut eater in ''[[The Begum's Fortune]]''. Schultze's antagonist is an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who hates sauerkraut but pretends to love it to win his enemy's confidence.

"Kraut" may refer to the practice of distributing sauerkraut on German ships to prevent [[scurvy]] just as the English were referred to as [[limey]]s by Americans for their use of lime juice in navy ships.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The rock music genre [[krautrock]] has been commonplace in [[music journalism]] since the early 1970s and is of English invention; it is not considered pejorative.

===Nazi (pejorative)===
''Nazi'', a shortening of ''Nationalsozialist'' (National Socialist) (attested since 1903, as a shortening of ''national-sozial'',<ref name="Etymonline">, [https://www.etymonline.com/word/nazi Nazi], Etymology Online, citing Friedrich Kluge, Elmar Seebold, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache'', 24.

A homonymic term ''Nazi'' was in use before the rise of the NSDAP in Bavaria as a pet name for Ignaz and (by extension from that) a derogatory word for a backwards peasant, which may have influenced<ref name=GottliebMorgensen2007>{{cite book |editor=Henrik Gottlieb |editor2=Jens Erik Morgensen|year=2007|title=Dictionary Visions, Research and Practice: Selected Papers from the 12th International Symposium on Lexicography, Copenhagen 2004|edition=illustrated|location=Amsterdam|publisher=J.

===Ted===
"Ted", and "Teds", from ''Tedeschi'', the Italian word for Germans, became the term used by Allied soldiers during the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian  campaign]] of [[World War II]].<ref>NZ Army Board (1946) ''One More River: With the Second New Zealand Division from Florence to Trieste'' p42  Army Board Wellington (ISBN none)</ref><ref>Bob Pearson (2014) ''A Peg Leg Hero'' Australian Self-Publishing Group {{ISBN|9781925011760}} p.111</ref>

===Teuton (poetic)===
In a more poetical sense Germans can be referred to as ''Teutons''. The usage of the word in this term has been observed in English since 1833. The word originated via an ancient Germanic tribe, the [[Teutons]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=teuton&searchmode=none |title=etymonline, origin of "teuton" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> (see also [[Teutons|Teutonic]] and the [[Teutonic Order]]).

===<span id="Boche">Boche (pejorative)</span>===
Pronounced {{IPA-fr|boʃ||}}, ''{{lang|fr|boche}}'' is a derisive term used by the Allies during World War I, often collectively ("the Boche" meaning "the Germans"). It is a shortened form of the [[Argot|French slang]] [[portmanteau]] ''{{lang|fr|alboche}}'', itself derived from ''{{lang|fr|Allemand}}'' ("German") and ''{{lang|fr|caboche}}'' ("head" or "cabbage"). The alternative spellings "Bosch" or "Bosche" are sometimes found.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120707171724/http://digital.nls.uk/pageturner.cfm?id=74545952 National Library of Scotland Digital Archive] (click "More information")</ref><ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/B0360800.html Boche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821033907/http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/B0360800.html |date=21 August 2006 }}, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''</ref> According to a 1916 article in the ''New York Times'' magazine ''[[Current History]]'', the origin is as follows:

{{quote|''{{lang|fr|Boche}}'' is an abbreviation of ''{{lang|fr|caboche}}'', (compare ''{{lang|fr|bochon}}'', an abbreviation of ''{{lang|fr|cabochon}}''). This is a recognized French word used familiarly for "head," especially a big, thick head, ("slow-pate"). It is derived from the Latin word ''{{lang|la|caput}}'' and the suffix ''{{lang|la|oceus}}''. ''{{lang|fr|Boche}}'' seems to have been used first in the underworld of Paris about 1860, with the meaning of a disagreeable, troublesome fellow. In the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870 it was not applied to the Germans, but soon afterward it was applied by the Parisian printers to their German assistants because of the reputed slowness of comprehension of these foreign printers. The epithet then used was ''{{lang|fr|tête de boche}}'', which had the meaning of ''{{lang|fr|tête carrée d'Allemand}}'' (German [[wikt:blockhead|blockhead]] or ''{{lang|fr|imbécile}}''). The next step was to apply ''{{lang|fr|boche}}'' to Germans in general.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/currenthistoryfo04newyuoft#page/524/mode/2up |title=Current History |work=The New York Times |date=April–September 1916 |page=525 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>}}

===Squarehead (pejorative)===
"Squarehead", a generic derogatory term for people from Germany and Scandinavia;<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/squarehead ''Squarehead''] at [[Merriam-Webster]]</ref> Commonly used for Germans during the First and Second World War, but found in a collection of slang from 1906 relating particularly to German military style.<ref>[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/188200?redirectedFrom=squarehead#eid ''Squarehead''] at OED</ref>

The term [[:wikt:Appendix:List of terms used for Germans#Jerry|''Boxhead'']], commonly used after World War II within the British Armed Forces in the former West Germany is derived from this.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Erics === 
First came to prominence in the English 1983 television show ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]''. It was a term used by the English and Irish when referring to Germans without them knowing it was them being talked about.

==Other countries==

===Austria===
====Piefke (pejorative)====
The [[Austria]]n [[ethnic slur]] for a German is ''Piefke''. Like its Bavarian counterpart ''Saupreiß'' (literally: [[pig|sow]]-Prussian), the term ''Piefke'' historically characterized only the people of [[Prussia]], and not people of other Germanic states. There are two hypotheses on how the term developed; both of them suggest an origin in the 1860s. One theory suggests that the term came from the name of the popular Prussian composer [[Johann Gottfried Piefke]], who composed some of the most iconic German military marches, for example ''[[Preußens Gloria]]'' and the ''[[Königgrätzer Marsch]]'' – particularly since Piefke and his brother conducted the Prussian music corps in the parade in Austria following the Prussian victory of the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. The second theory suggests an origin in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, where Prussians and Austrians were allies. A Prussian soldier with the name ''Piefke'' and a stereotypically ''Prussian'' gruff and snappy manner made such a negative impression on his Austrian comrades that the term came to refer to all Prussians.<ref>Peter Wehle. "Die Wiener Gaunersprache", 1977, p. 79</ref>

Since Prussia no longer exists, the term now refers to the cliché of a pompous northern [[Protestantism|Protestant]] German in general and a [[Berlin]]er in particular. However, the citizens of the free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities and the former northern duchies of Oldenburg, Brunswick and Mecklenburg are also quite offended by the terms ''Piefke'' and also by ''Saupreiß'' (a slur for any German who is not native Bavarian). In 1990, Austrian playwright Felix Mitterer wrote and co-directed a TV mini-series, ''Die Piefke-Saga'', about Germans on holiday in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. Sometimes the alteration "Piefkinese" is used. Some Austrians use the playful term "Piefkinesisch" (Pief-Chinese) to refer to German spoken in a distinctly northern German – that is, not Austrian – accent.

====Marmeladinger (pejorative)====
The term ''Marmeladinger'' originated in the trenches of World War I. It is derived from the German word "Marmelade", which is a [[fruit preserves#Marmalade|fruit preserve]].  While Austrian infantry rations included butter and lard as [[Spread (food)|spread]], German troops had to make do with cheaper "Marmelade" as [[ersatz good|ersatz]]. They disdainfully called it ''Heldenbutter'' "hero's butter" or ''[[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]fett''. This earned them ridicule from their Austrian allies who would call them ''Marmeladebrüder'' (jam brothers) or ''Marmeladinger'' (-''inger'' being an Austrian [[suffix|derivational suffix]] describing a person through a characteristic item or action).<ref>Anton Karl Mally: „Piefke". Herkunft und Rolle eines österreichischen Spitznamens für den Preußen, den Nord- und den Reichsdeutschen, in: Muttersprache. Zeitschrift zur Pflege und Erforschung der deutschen Sprache, [Wiesbaden] 1984, number 4, pp. 257-286.</ref> Germans would conversely call Austrians ''Kamerad Schnürschuh'' "comrade lace-up shoe" because the Austrian infantry boots used laces while the German boots did not. This term has survived, but it is rarely used.


===Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia===
====Švabo, Švaba (pejorative)====
The Term ''Švabo'' (Cyrillic: Швабо) is most often used in jokes but also very popularly used by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] during the Second World War. In the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] it was commonly used in movies depicting battles betweens the Partisans and Nazi forces. The word in its origin is not pejorative since it is used to depict a person from the German region of Swabia; however, the word probably entered the [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] languages in relation to the [[Danube Swabians]]. The variant Švaba (Шваба) is primarily used in the Serbian language. The female form is ''Švabica'' (Швабица).


===China===
====Jiamen (colloquial)====
In [[Shanghainese]], a German can be colloquially called a ''Jiamen'' (茄門/茄门),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0117/06/6748870_179831658.shtml |title=趣说八十八句上海闲话 |publisher=360doc.com |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> which is an adaptation of the English word "German".

This word carries a somewhat negative meaning of a stereotypical German being proud, withdrawn, cold and serious. Today, this phrase, when pronounced as "Ga-Men",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wu-chinese.com/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=11882 |title=茄门的两义 - 基础吴语问题 - 吳語協會 - Powered by Discuz! |publisher=Wu-chinese.com |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> can mean "disdainful, indifferent, or uninterested in someone or something".


===Czech Republic===
In [[Czech language|Czech]], a German can be called a ''Skopčák'' (skopchāk), originally meaning just someone from the highlands (of the Sudeten mountains). Due to the negative perception of the Sudeten Germans′ role in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, it is generally perceived negatively, relating to rough and stupid manners ascribed to Germans (skopová hlava - muttonhead).


===Finland===
During the [[Lapland War]] between [[Finland]] and Germany, the terms ''saku'', ''sakemanni'', ''hunni'' and ''lapinpolttaja'' (burner of [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], see: [[Lapland War]]) became widely used among the Finnish soldiers, ''saku'' and ''sakemanni'' being modified from ''saksalainen'' (German).

===France===
====Boches (pejorative, historical)====
''Boches'' is an [[Apheresis (linguistics)|apheresis]] of the word ''alboche'', which in turn is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''allemand'' (French for German) and ''caboche'' (slang for ''head'').  It was used mainly during the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, and directed especially at German soldiers.<ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Boche|year=1920}}</ref>
====Casque à pointe (historical)====
[[File:2 Pickelhauben (1860).jpg|thumb|right|Two leather Pickelhauben, or "casques à pointe" from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] era.]]
''Casque à pointe'' is derived from the [[France|French]] name for the traditional [[Pickelhaube|Prussian military helmets]] worn by German soldiers from the 1840s until [[World War I]]. In modern British and [[American sign language]], the word for Germany continues to be an index finger pointed to the top of the forehead, simulating the Pickelhaube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/g/germany.htm |title=Germany in sign language |publisher=Lifeprint.com |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>
====Chleuh (pejorative)====
''Chleuh'' derives from the name of the [[Chleuh]], a [[Berbers|Berber]] ethnic group in [[Morocco]]. It also denotes the absence of words beginning in Schl- in French.


===Germany===
====Ossi/Wessi====
The term ''Ossi'', derived from the German word ''Osten'' which means east, is used in Germany for people who were born in the area of the former [[German Democratic Republic]].

The term ''Wessi'', derived from the German word ''Westen'' which means west, is used in Germany for people who were born or live in the [[old states of Germany]] (those that formed the Federal Republic or "West Germany" before reunification). Sometimes it is also modified to "Besserwessi", from the German word ''Besserwisser'' which means [[Know-it-all]], reflecting the stereotype that people from the Western part of Germany are arrogant.

In 2010 there was a lawsuit in Germany because a job applicant was denied employment and her application was found to have the notation "Ossi" and a minus sign written on her application documents. A German court decided that denial of employment for such a reason would be discrimination, but not ethnic discrimination, since "East German" is not an ethnicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/diskriminierung-ossi-streit-endet-mit-vergleich-a-723605.html |title=Diskriminierung: "Ossi"-Streit endet mit Vergleich - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>

====Other Terms====
The term ''Saupreiß'', derived from the German words ''Sau'' which means female pig and ''Preuße'' which means Prussian, is used in [[Bavaria]] for people who were born or live in any German area north of the [[Danube river]], or at least north of the Bavarian border. A number of other terms exist. Similar to the Polish ''Szwab'', the term ''Schwab'' can be pejorative and be used to express [[Schwabenhass]]. Various – more or less good-humoured – nicknames are being used between the different German states or areas, such as ''Gelbfüßler'' ("Yellowfeet") for the inhabitants of [[Baden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wochenblatt-reporter.de/oestringen/c-lokales/wie-die-gelbfuessler-zu-ihrem-namen-kamen-oder-auch-nicht_a109483|title=Wie die Gelbfüßler zu ihrem Namen kamen, oder auch nicht (How the Yellowfeet got their name, or didn't)|publisher=Wochenblatt|date=2019-08-18|accessdate=2020-06-21}}</ref>


===Hungary===
==== Sváb ====
The term ''sváb'' derives from the German word "Schwaben", describing people from [[Swabia]] (ger: Schwaben). The first German-speaking people (Saxon merchants and miners, see: Carpathian Germans) first arrived to the Carpathian basin (then mostly under rule of the Kingdom of Hungary) in the 12th century, their numbers and territory of settlement were limited, mainly in towns. In the 18th century various German-speaking peasant groups settled in Hungary in large numbers to inhabit the vast territories being depopulated during the Osman rule, they are known as [[Danube Swabians]] (Donauschwaben), though most of their forefathers have Bavarian or Thuringian roots. They settled mainly where the destruction was most severe, especially around Buda (now: Budapest), Danube valley and southern part of Hungary. Although they have assimilated in large parts until the beginning of the 20th century, they maintained strong cultural identity up to date. These people, and through them German people in general are called ''svábok'' (plural), having a hint of pejorative nature.
====Labanc====
The term ''labanc'' came into use during [[Rákóczi's War of Independence]]. It was specifically used for the soldiers fighting for the Austrian/German soldiers of the Habsburg rulers. There are multiple theories about where it came from, such as being a strange concatenation of the German term "Lauf Hans!" (Run Hans!) or the French term ''Le Blanc'' (the white one), it might also be a reference to the Hungarian word ''lobonc'' which referred to the large, common wig, which used to be common in the Vienna court at the time. Now ''Labanc'' is exclusively used for Austrians, but becomes rare in usage as there are no tensions between the two countries. Still however, the expression describes mentality or behaviour that is counter to general Hungarian interest and describes persons not content with "true" Hungarian values.


===Italy===
====Crucco (pejorative)====
The term ''crucco'' derived from the Slovenian ''kruh'' ("bread"). Italian soldiers invented this word during World War I when they captured some hungry Austrian-Slovenian soldiers who asked for "kruh". Later, during World War II, it was applied to German people.
====Tuder / Tudro (pejorative)====
''Tudro'' designates Germans as a people lacking flexibility and fantasy, but also emotional intelligence. It is more widely adopted to describe a sturdy and stupid man. Tudro is mainly used in Northern Italy. ''Tuder'' is the [[Lombard language|Lombard]] usage of the word.

===Netherlands and Belgium===

====Mof (pejorative)====
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] the most common term for the [[German people]], after the regular/official "Duitse", is ''mof''. It is regarded as a pejorative term, used exclusively for Germans and reflecting Dutch resentment of the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|German occupation of the Netherlands]] during the [[Second World War]] and the respective German actions.<ref name="ReferenceA">Prisma Etymologisch woordenboek, {{ISBN|90-274-9199-2}}. "''Mof heeft historisch gezien niet de huidige betekenis (die van een verwijzing naar de Duitsers en hun acties tijdens de Tweede wereldoorlog) maar …''"</ref> The word "Mofrika" is a portmanteau of [[Africa]] and "mof" and is used as a humorous reference to Germany.

In the late 16th century the area now known as [[East Frisia]] and [[Emsland]] and the people that lived there were referred to as ''Muffe''. At the time the [[Netherlands]] was by far the [[Dutch Golden Age|richest country]] in the whole of Europe, and these people were looked down upon greatly by the Dutch. The area of Western [[Lower Saxony]] was at that time very poor and a good source for many Dutch people looking for cheap labour. The inhabitants of this region were regarded as being rather reserved and were often described as grumpy, rude and unsophisticated by the Dutch. Later the term was used to describe the whole of Germany, which, at the time, was not much better off [[economy|economically]] than Western Lower Saxony, mainly due to the various wars waged on its territory by foreign powers. The term seemed to have died out around 1900, but returned after the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion of the Netherlands]] in 1940.<ref name="Why Germans are called moffen">[http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Marieke/mof.htm Why Germans are called "''moffen''"] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]])</ref>

A popular humorous (but false) etymology of the word ''mof'' by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] is that it is a [[German language|German]] abbreviation meaning ''Menschen ohne Freunde'' ("people without friends").


===Poland===
====Fryc (pejorative)====
Means [[novice]], and comes from the German name [[Fritz]], which is a diminutive of Friedrich. German trade and settlements acquainted Poles with this name. German coming to Poland was actually a novice hence was called ''Fryc''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Encyklopedia_staropolska/Fryc |title=Encyklopedia staropolska - Fryc |publisher=pl.wikisource.org |accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref>.
====Prusak (pejorative)====
Historically characterized only the people of [[Prussia]], not people of other Germanic states. During [[Partitions of Poland]] under [[Prussian Partition]] gained negative connotations. ''Prusak'' also refers to [[German cockroach]].
====Szkop (pejorative)====
Contemptuous term for a German, especially a soldier of the Wehrmacht during World War II. In the past, the word ''szkop'' in the [[Polish language]] meant a castrated ram.<ref>[[:pl:Szkop]] at Polish Wikipedia</ref>
====Szwab (pejorative)====
Another popular term, originally meaning a person from [[Swabia]]. It is worth noting that a colloquial verb "oszwabić" means "to rook", "to fleece".
====Other terms====
Another pejorative term for a German (and, stereotypically, unattractive) woman is ''niemra'', coming from a word "Niemka" (a woman of German nationality). This term can also mean a female German language teacher or German language classes. Similarly, the term for the Germans can be ''niemiaszki''. It does not have to be pejorative, it may be permissive or irreverent, but it may also be used in an almost caressing way. Next term is ''[[Helmut]]'' that refers to the popular german name. Another pejorative term for a German is ''[[szołdra]]'' (plural: ''szołdry''). However, it is an [[Old Polish language|old Polish]] term, out of use nowadays. It can be found in 19th century historical novels by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] and [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]]. It comes from a term meaning pork or ham. Next pejorative and historical term is ''pluder'' came from [[Hose (clothing)]] being the part of warderobe<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sjp.pl/pluder |title=Słownik języka polskiego - Pluder |publisher=sjp.pl |accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref>.

===Switzerland===
====Gummihals (pejorative)====
German for ''rubber-neck''. The term has been verified to be in use since the 1970s at least. Its actual meaning is subject to debate.

The ordinary (non-pejorative) meaning is people from [[Swabia]] (roughly Baden-Württemberg) in South Germany, neighbouring Switzerland, but in Switzerland it is used for any German. A strengthening is Sauschwabe.
