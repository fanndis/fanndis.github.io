==Mission==
The mission of ''Philadelphia Gay News'' is to serve as a forum for LGBT community discussion, and to act as a platform for communicating LGBT issues with mainstream media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epgn.com/pages/about_us |title=PGN-The Philadelphia Gay News. |publisher=Epgn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> "My initial goal for PGN was to be the publication that informed our community," Segal said in an interview with Julia Klein. "It was very modest. Then as we went on, I began to realize how powerful a communications medium that connected our community together could be, and my goals changed. I wanted to do more."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epgn.com/pages/about_us |title=PGN-The Philadelphia Gay News. |publisher=Epgn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>

'''2016''' - [[Hillary Clinton]] writes an op-ed for ''PGN'', which is the first time a major-party presidential candidate writes an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epgn.com/news/local/11120-pgn-exclusive-hillary-clinton-addresses-lgbt-equality |title=PGN Exclusive: Hillary Clinton addresses LGBT equality |publisher=Epgn.com |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010034910/http://www.epgn.com/news/local/11120-pgn-exclusive-hillary-clinton-addresses-lgbt-equality |archive-date=2016-10-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''2020''' - In March, ''PGN'' is approved for a commemorative marker from the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.pa.gov:443/Pages/PHMC-Details.aspx?newsid=367|title=PHMC Details|website=Pennsylvania Pressroom|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> The sign will read: “First published in 1976, this early newspaper of the LGBTQ community was an outlet for intracommunication when few others were available. It served as a community-building vehicle at a time when the LGBTQ rights movement was still forming. At the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it became a lifesaving source for a community in need. It is now the most-awarded LGBTQ publication in the nation.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishexponent.com/2020/04/02/community-briefs-holocaust-survivor-dies-and-more/|title=Community Briefs: Holocaust Survivor Dies and More|last=Andy Gotlieb|date=2020-04-02|website=Jewish Exponent|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>

== Circulation ==
The ''Philadelphia Gay News'' is disturbed for free and can be picked up in vending boxes throughout Greater Philadelphia, Easter Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epgn.com/find-a-copy-of-pgn/|title=Find a copy of PGN {{!}} Philadelphia Gay News|website=epgn.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

=== Vending Machines ===
The ''Philadelphia Gay News'' received its batch of around 30 vending boxes in 1976. They were provided for free by the ''Philadelphia Evening Bulletin'', who were retiring and old fleet. PGN’s longtime distribution manager, Don Pignolet, took them to  Earl Shibe Auto for painting. The shop was willing to donate paint for the boxes, but only one color: fresh plumb, or RAL-0007. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://epgn.com/2020/01/30/how-pgn-got-its-vending-boxes/|title=How PGN got its vending boxes {{!}} Philadelphia Gay News|website=epgn.com|date=30 January 2020|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

“No one else had that color,” Pignolet said, “and it just seemed so gay.”

Pignolet and his father attached the coin mechanisms to the boxes, initially charging 50 cents an issue. Today the paper is free. Throughout the years the boxes have been used as trash cans and vandalized with stickers and graffiti. People have glued the boxes shut and scrawled homophobic graffiti on them, such as “Gay=Got AIDS Yet?” On several occasions, the boxes were blown up with homemade bombs consisting of M-80 fireworks.<ref name=":0" />
