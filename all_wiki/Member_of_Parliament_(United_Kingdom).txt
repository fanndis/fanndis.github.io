{{Politics of the United Kingdom|legislature}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''Member of Parliament''' ('''MP''') is an individual elected to serve in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What MPs do|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/mps/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
All 650 members of the UK Parliament are elected using the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system in single member [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]] across the whole of the United Kingdom, where each constituency has its own single representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/voting-systems/|title=Voting Systems in the UK|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/constituencies/|title=Parliamentary Constituencies|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>

==Elections==
All MP positions become simultaneously vacant for [[election]]s held on a five-year cycle. The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] sets out that ordinary general elections are held on the first Thursday in May, every five years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fixed-term Parlliaments Act 2011 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/introduction/enacted|publisher=UK Legislation|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> However, with approval from Parliament, both the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] and [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] general elections were held earlier than the schedule set by the Act.

If a [[Vacancy (economics)|vacancy]] arises at another time, due to death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]], then a constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1981]] any MP sentenced to over a year in jail automatically vacates their seat. For certain types of lesser acts of wrongdoing the [[Recall of MPs Act 2015]] mandates that a [[Recall election|recall petition]] be opened; if signed by more than 10% of registered voters within the constituency the seat is vacated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/recallofmps.html|title=Recall of MPs Act 2015|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>

== Eligibility ==
To be eligible to stand as an MP a person must be at least 18 years old and be a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom|citizen of the UK]], a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation, or [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. A person is not required to be registered to vote, nor are there any restrictions regarding where a candidate is resident.<ref name="el">{{Cite web|url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf_file/UKPGE-Part-1-Can-you-stand-for-election.pdf|title=UK Parliamentary general election, Guidance for candidates and agents, Part 1 of 6 – Can you stand for election?|website=Electoral Commission|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="el_NI" >{{Cite web|url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-09/UKPGE-Part%201-Can%20you%20stand%20for%20election-Northern-Ireland_1.pdf|title=UK Parliamentary general election – Northern Ireland, Guidance for candidates and agents, Part 1 of 6 – Can you stand for election?|website=Electoral Commission|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]] outlaws the holders of various positions from being MPs. These include [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil servants]], [[Police in the UK|police officers]], members of the [[Armed forces of the United Kingdom|armed forces]], and [[Judiciary of the United Kingdom|judges]]. Members of the [[House of Lords]] are not permitted to hold Commons seats. Members of legislatures outside of the Commonwealth are excluded,<ref name="el"/> with the exemption of the [[Oireachtas|Irish legislature]].<ref name="el_NI"/> Additionally, members of the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament]] or the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] are also ineligible for the Commons according to the [[Wales Act 2014|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014|Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions)]] Acts respectively, passed in 2014.

People who are [[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom|bankrupt]] cannot stand to be MPs.<ref name="el"/> The [[Representation of the People Act 1981]] excludes persons who are currently serving a prison sentence of a year or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03221.pdf|title=Disqualification for membership of the House of Commons|date=13 October 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321002524/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03221.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2006}}</ref>

==Title==
Members of Parliament are entitled to use the post nominal title MP. MPs are only referred to as "honorable" as a courtesy during debates in the House of Commons or if they are the child of a peer. Those who are members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] use the form [[The Right Honourable|The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon. or Rt Hon.)]] ''Name'' MP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debretts.com/expertise/forms-of-address/professions/politics/|title=How to Address an MP}}</ref>

==Responsibilities==
{{quote
|text=The first duty of a member of Parliament is to do what he or she thinks in his or her faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate. Burke's famous declaration on this subject is well known. It is only in the third place that his duty to party organization or programme takes rank. All these three loyalties should be observed, but there is no doubt of the order in which they stand under any healthy manifestation of democracy.

Theoretically, contemporary MPs are considered to have two duties, or three if they belong to a political party. Their primary responsibility is to act in the national interest. They must also act in the interests of their constituents where this does not override their primary responsibility. Finally, if they belong to a political party, they may act in the interests of that party, subordinate to the other two responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/politics/brexit-deal-theresa-may-parliament-constitution-commons-vote-mps-a8797151.html|title=Fixing Brexit: How parliament's checks and balances can solve our political crisis|date=1 March 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bL0FDAAAQBAJ&q=%22representative+but+not+the+delegate%22&pg=PT45|title=Political Parties and Elections: Legislating for Representative Democracy|first=Anika|last=Gauja|date=22 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317078722|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTff_YwkKSYC&q=%22representative+but+not+the+delegate%22&pg=PA8|title=Revitalising the Chamber: the role of the back bench Member, first report of session 2006–07, report, together with formal minutes, oral and written evidence|first=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of|last=Commons|date=20 June 2007|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780215034670|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89AYDQAAQBAJ&q=%22representative+but+not+the+delegate%22&pg=PT1001|title=Classic Readings and Cases in the Philosophy of Law|first=Susan|last=Dimock|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315509631|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2017/02/03/churchill-would-have-defended-enemies-democracy/|title=Why Churchill would have defended our 'enemies of democracy'|first=Michael|last=Deacon|date=3 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>
