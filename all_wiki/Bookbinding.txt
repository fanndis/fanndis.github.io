'''Bookbinding''' is the process of physically assembling a [[book]] of [[codex]] format from an ordered stack of [[paper]] sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack (signature) is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods of binding that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards, including identifying information and decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can also greatly enhance a book's content by creating book-like objects with artistic merit of exceptional quality.

Before the computer age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was [[stationery]] binding (known as [[vellum]] binding in the trade) that deals with books intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as [[notebook|note books]], manifold books, day books, diaries and portfolios. Computers have now replaced the pen and paper based accounting that constituted most of the stationery binding industry. Second was [[letterpress printing|letterpress]] binding which deals with making books intended for reading, including [[library binding]], fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings.{{sfn|Vaughan|1950|p=xi}} A third division deals with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings.

Today, modern bookbinding is divided between hand binding by individual craftsmen working in a shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high-speed machines in a factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from one-of-a-kind custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large-run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. For the largest numbers of copies, commercial binding is effected by production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory.

==Overview==
Bookbinding is a specialized trade that relies on basic operations of measuring, cutting, and gluing. A finished book might need dozens of operations to complete, according to the specific style and materials. Bookbinding combines skills from other trades such as paper and fabric crafts, leather work, model making, and graphic arts. It requires knowledge about numerous varieties of book structures along with all the internal and external details of assembly. A working knowledge of the materials involved is required. A book craftsman needs a minimum set of hand tools but with experience will find an extensive collection of secondary hand tools and even items of heavy equipment that are valuable for greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

Bookbinding is an artistic craft of great antiquity, and at the same time, a highly mechanized industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.{{sfn|Robinson|1968|p=9}}

==History==
===Origins of the book===

Writers in the Hellenistic-Roman culture wrote longer texts as [[scroll]]s; these were stored in boxes or shelving with small cubbyholes, similar to a modern winerack. Court records and notes were written on [[wax tablet]]s, while important documents were written on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]. The modern English word ''book'' comes from the Proto-Germanic ''*bokiz'', referring to the beechwood on which early written works were recorded.<ref>{{OEtymD|book|accessdate=2018-03-08}}</ref>

The book was not needed in ancient times, as many early Greek texts—scrolls—were 30 pages long, which were customarily folded accordion-fashion to fit into the hand. Roman works were often longer, running to hundreds of pages. The Greeks used to call their books ''tome'', meaning "to cut". The Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] was a massive 200 pages long and was used in funerary services for the deceased. [[Torah]] scrolls, editions of the Jewish holy book, were—and still are—also held in special holders when read.

Scrolls can be rolled in one of two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text at the end of the scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is partially overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.

===Early book formats===
[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval [[bookcase]] containing about ten codices depicted in the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' ({{circa}} 700)]]

In addition to the scroll, [[wax tablet]]s were commonly used in Antiquity as a writing surface. [[Diptych]]s and later [[polyptych]] formats were often hinged together along one edge, analogous to the spine of modern books, as well as a folding ''concertina'' format. Such a set of simple wooden boards sewn together was called by the Romans a [[codex]] (pl. codices)—from the Latin word ''caudex'', meaning "the trunk" of a tree, around the first century AD. Two ancient polyptychs, a ''pentaptych'' and ''octoptych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pugliese Carratelli|first=Giovanni |encyclopedia=Pompeiana: raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei |title=L'Instrumentum Scriptorium nei Monumenti Pompeiani ed Ercolanesi |year=1950 |pages=166–178}}</ref>

At the turn of the first century, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin, became commonly used for writing throughout the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Roberts|Skeat|1987|pp=15–22}} This term was used by both the pagan [[Roman literature|Roman poet]] [[Martial]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the Apostle]]. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. According to T. C. Skeat, "in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then "must have spread rapidly to the Near East".{{sfn|Skeat|2004|p=45}} In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating "its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory" and that "early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt".<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first= Eric |title=The Typology of the Early Codex |year=1977 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn= 0-8122-7696-5 |page=38}}</ref>

Early intact codices were discovered at [[Nag Hammadi]] in Egypt. Consisting of primarily Gnostic texts in Coptic, the books were mostly written on [[papyrus]], and while many are single-[[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quire]], a few are multi-quire. Codices were a significant improvement over papyrus or vellum scrolls in that they were easier to handle. However, despite allowing writing on both sides of the leaves, they were still foliated—numbered on the leaves, like the Indian books. The idea spread quickly through the early churches, and the word ''Bible'' comes from the town where the Byzantine monks established their first [[scriptorium]], [[Byblos]], in modern Lebanon. The idea of numbering each side of the page—Latin ''pagina'', "to fasten"—appeared when the text of the individual testaments of the Bible were combined and text had to be searched through more quickly. This book format became the preferred way of preserving manuscript or printed material.

The [[codex]]-style book, using sheets of either [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] (before the spread of Chinese [[papermaking]] outside of [[Imperial China]]), was invented in the [[Roman Empire]] during the 1st century AD.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H|last2=Skeat|first2=TC|title=The Birth of the Codex|year=1983|publisher=British Academy|location= London|isbn=0-19-726061-6|pages=15–22}}</ref> First described by the poet [[Martial]] from [[Roman Spain]], it largely replaced earlier writing mediums such as [[wax tablet]]s and [[scroll]]s by the year 300 AD.<ref name=Oxf>"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}</ref> By the 6th century AD, the scroll and wax tablet had been completely replaced by the codex in the [[Western world]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C.

Western books from the fifth century onwards{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} were bound between hard covers, with pages made from parchment folded and sewn onto strong cords or ligaments that were attached to wooden boards and covered with leather. Since early books were exclusively handwritten on handmade materials, sizes and styles varied considerably, and there was no standard of uniformity. Early and medieval codices were bound with flat spines, and it was not until the fifteenth century that books began to have the rounded spines associated with hardcovers today.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenfield |first=Jane |title=ABC of Bookbinding |year=2002 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press |location=New Castle, DE |isbn=1-884718-41-8 |pages=79–117 }}</ref> Because the vellum of early books would react to humidity by swelling, causing the book to take on a characteristic wedge shape, the wooden covers of medieval books were often secured with straps or clasps. These straps, along with metal bosses on the book's covers to keep it raised off the surface that it rests on, are collectively known as furniture.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|p=8}}

The earliest surviving European bookbinding is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700, in red goatskin, now in the [[British Library]], whose decoration includes raised patterns and coloured tooled designs. Very grand manuscripts for liturgical rather than library use had covers in [[metalwork]] called [[treasure binding]]s, often studded with gems and incorporating [[ivory]] relief panels or enamel elements. Very few of these have survived intact, as they have been broken up for their precious materials, but a fair number of the ivory panels have survived, as they were hard to recycle; the divided panels from the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch]] are among the most notable. The 8th century [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]] were given a new gold relief cover in about 1500, and the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now [[Morgan Library]], New York) have their original cover from around 800.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–9}}

Luxury medieval books for the library had leather covers decorated, often all over, with tooling (incised lines or patterns), [[blind stamp]]s, and often small metal pieces of furniture. Medieval stamps showed animals and figures as well as the vegetal and geometric designs that would later dominate book cover decoration. Until the end of the period books were not usually stood up on shelves in the modern way. The most functional books were bound in plain white [[vellum]] over boards, and had a brief title hand-written on the spine. Techniques for fixing [[gold leaf]] under the tooling and stamps were imported from the Islamic world in the 15th century, and thereafter the gold-tooled leather binding has remained the conventional choice for high quality bindings for collectors, though cheaper bindings that only used gold for the title on the spine, or not at all, were always more common. Although the arrival of the printed book vastly increased the number of books produced in Europe, it did not in itself change the various styles of binding used, except that vellum became much less used.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–11}}

===Introduction of paper===
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}

Although early, coarse [[hemp]]en paper had existed in China during the [[Western Han]] period (202 BC - 9 AD), the [[Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] Chinese court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (ca. 50 AD&nbsp;– 121 AD) introduced the first significant improvement and standardization of papermaking by adding essential new materials into its composition.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=38–41}}</ref>

[[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|Bookbinding in medieval China]] replaced traditional Chinese writing supports such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227}}</ref> The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century AD, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644 AD) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century (coupled with the European [[printing press]] that replaced [[History of printing|traditional Chinese printing methods]]).<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227–229}}</ref> The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227–229}}</ref>

With the arrival (from the East) of [[Cotton paper|rag paper]] manufacturing in Europe in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the use of the [[printing press]] beginning in the mid-15th century, bookbinding began to standardize somewhat, but page sizes still varied considerably.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. Paper leaves also meant that heavy wooden boards and metal furniture were no longer necessary to keep books closed, allowing for much lighter pasteboard covers. The practice of rounding and backing the spines of books to create a solid, smooth surface and "shoulders" supporting the textblock against its covers facilitated the upright storage of books and titling on spine. This became common practice by the close of the 16th century but was consistently practiced in Rome as early as the 1520s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundlessbw.com/2/post/2020/02/the-book-on-two-legs-an-analysis-of-the-upright-book-and-its-humble-beginnings.html|title=The Book on Two Legs|website=Boundless Books and Writingware|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Piepenbring|first=Dan|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/11/12/a-brief-history-of-shelving-and-other-news/|title=A brief history of shelving, and other news|date=12 November 2015|work=The Paris Review|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref>

In the early sixteenth century, the Italian printer [[Aldus Manutius]] realized that personal books would need to fit in saddle bags and thus produced books in the smaller formats of ''[[quarto]]s'' (one-quarter-size pages) and ''[[octavo]]s'' (one-eighth-size pages).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/libraries-books-and-printing-biographies/aldus-manutius|title=Aldus Manutius facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Aldus Manutius|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref>

[[Leipzig]], a prominent centre of the German book-trade, in 1739 had 20 bookshops, 15 printing establishments, 22 book-binders and three type-foundries in a population of 28,000 people.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|p=269}}

In the German book-distribution system of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the end-user buyers of books "generally made separate arrangements with either the publisher or a bookbinder to have printed sheets bound according to their wishes and their budget".<ref>{{cite book |last=Erlin |first=Matt |editor-last=Tatlock |editor-first=Lynne |title=Publishing Culture and the "Reading Nation": German Book History in the Long Nineteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0GxZg3EYEC |access-date=2013-02-19 |series=Studies in German Literature Linguistics and Culture Series |volume=76 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Camden House Publishing|Camden House]] |isbn=9781571134028 |pages=25–54 |chapter=How to Think about Luxury Editions in Late Eighteenth- & Early Nineteenth-Century Germany |quote=In most cases, questions related to book-binding did not figure into the discussions between authors and publishers about the formal aspects of editions of their works, because individual purchasers generally made separate arrangements with either the publisher or a bookbinder to have printed sheets bound according to their wishes and their budget.}}</ref>

The reduced cost of books facilitated cheap lightweight Bibles, made from tissue-thin oxford paper, with floppy covers, that resembled the early [[Arabic]] [[Quran]]s, enabling missionaries to take portable books with them around the world, and modern wood glues enabled the addition of paperback covers to simple glue bindings.

Some older presses could not separate the pages of a book, so readers used a [[paper knife]] to separate the outer edges of pages as a book was read.

==Modern commercial binding==
There are various commercial techniques in use today. Today, most commercially produced books belong to one of four categories:

===Hardcover binding===
[[File:Book Conservators, Mitchell Building.jpg|thumb|Book conservators at the State Library of New South Wales, 1943]]A [[hardcover]], hardbound or hardback book has rigid covers and is stitched in the spine. Looking from the top of the spine, the book can be seen to consist of a number of [[#Terms and techniques|signatures]] bound together. When the book is opened in the middle of a signature, the binding threads are visible. Signatures of hardcover books are typically [[Octavo (text)|octavo]] (a single sheet folded three times), though they may also be folio, quarto, or 16mo (see [[Book size]]). Unusually large and heavy books are sometimes bound with wire.

Until the mid-20th century, covers of mass-produced books were laid with cloth, but from that period onward, most publishers adopted clothette, a kind of textured paper which vaguely resembles cloth but is easily differentiated on close inspection. Most cloth-bound books are now half-and-half covers with cloth covering only the spine. In that case, the cover has a paper overlap. The covers of modern hardback books are made of thick cardboard.

Some books that appeared in the mid-20th century signature-bound appear in reprinted editions in glued-together editions. Copies of such books stitched together in their original format are often difficult to find, and are much sought after for both aesthetic and practical reasons.

A variation of the hardcover which is more durable is the calf-binding, where the cover is either half or fully clad in [[leather]], usually from a [[calf]]. This is also called full-bound or, simply, leather bound.

[[Library binding]] refers to the [[hardcover]] binding of books intended for the rigors of [[library]] use and are largely [[Serial (literature)|serials]] and [[paperback]] publications. Though many publishers have started to provide "library binding" editions, many libraries elect to purchase paperbacks and have them rebound in hard covers for longer life.

====Methods of hardcover binding====
There are a number of methods used to bind hardcover books. Those still in use include:
# Case binding is the most common type of hardcover binding for books. The pages are arranged in signatures and glued together into a "[[book block|textblock]]." The textblock is then attached to the cover or "case" which is made of cardboard covered with paper, cloth, vinyl or leather. This is also known as cloth binding, or edition binding.
# [[oversewn binding|Oversewing]], where the signatures of the book start off as loose pages which are then clamped together. Small vertical holes are punched through the far left-hand edge of each signature, and then the signatures are sewn together with lock-stitches to form the text block. Oversewing is a very strong method of binding and can be done on books up to five inches thick. However, the margins of oversewn books are reduced and the pages will not lie flat when opened.
# Sewing through the fold (also called Smyth Sewing), where the signatures of the book are folded and stitched through the fold, has been called the "gold standard" for binding.<ref>Joshua P. Hochschild, Publishers' Bind, First Things (November 2020), https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/11/publishers-bind</ref> The signatures are then sewn and [[Adhesive|glued]] together at the spine to form a text block. In contrast to oversewing, through-the-fold books have wide margins and can open completely flat.  Pages cannot fall out unless they are ripped. Many varieties of sewing stitches exist, from basic links to the often used Kettle Stitch. While Western books are generally sewn through punched holes or sawed notches along the fold, some Asian bindings, such as the Retchoso or Butterfly Stitch of Japan, use small slits instead of punched holes.
# Double-fan adhesive binding starts off with two signatures of loose pages, which are run over a roller—"fanning" the pages—to apply a thin layer of glue to each page edge. Then the two signatures are perfectly aligned to form a text block, and glue edges of the text block are attached to a piece of cloth lining to form the spine. Double-fan adhesive bound books can open completely flat and have a wide margin. However, certain types of paper do not hold adhesive well, and, with wear and tear, the pages can come loose.<ref name="Parisi">{{cite journal | last = Parisi | first = Paul |date=February 1994 | title = Methods of Affixing Leaves: Options and Implications | journal = New Library Scene | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–11, 15}}</ref>

==={{anchor|Square bind}}Punch and bind===
Different types of the ''punch and bind'' binding include:
# [[Wire binding|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding]] is a type of binding that is used for books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding involves the use of a "C" shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge.<br />This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a "closer" which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.
# [[Comb binding]] uses a 9/16" pitch rectangular hole pattern punched near the bound edge. A curled plastic "comb" is fed through the slits to hold the sheets together. Comb binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage. Comb supplies are typically available in a wide range of colors and diameters. The supplies themselves can be re-used or recycled. In the United States, comb binding is often referred to as 19-ring binding because it uses a total of 19 holes along the 11-inch side of a sheet of paper.
# [[VeloBind]] is used to permanently rivet pages together using a plastic strip on the front and back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a plastic strip called a Comb feeds through the holes to the other side and then goes through another plastic strip called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.
# [[coil binding|Spiral binding]] is the most economical form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and other publications where it is necessary or desirable for the publication to be opened back onto itself without breaking or damaging the spine. A number of different varieties exist, though all are produced through the basic principle of a wire [[helix]] being wound through a number of holes punched along the spine of the book, providing a hinge with a greater degree of flexibility.<br />Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.

===Thermally activated binding===
Some of the different types of thermally activated binding include:
# ''Perfect binding'' is often used for [[paperback]] books. It is also used for [[magazine]]s; ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' is one example of this type. Perfect bound books usually consist of various sections with a cover made from heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong glue. The sections are milled in the back and notches are applied into the spine to allow hot glue to penetrate into the spine of the book. The other three sides are then face trimmed, allowing the magazine or paperback book to be opened. [[Mass-market paperback]]s (pulp paperbacks) are small (''[[Duodecimo|16mo]]'' size), cheaply made with each sheet fully cut and glued at the spine; these are likely to fall apart or lose sheets after much handling or several years. [[Paperback#Trade paperback|Trade paperbacks]] are more sturdily made, with traditional gatherings or sections of bifolios, usually larger, and more expensive. The difference between the two can usually easily be seen by looking for the sections in the top or bottom sides of the book.
# ''Thermal binding'' uses a one piece cover with glue applied to its spine to quickly and easily bind documents without the need for punching. Individuals usually purchase "thermal covers" or "therm-a-bind covers", which are usually made to fit a standard-size sheet of paper and come with a glue channel down the spine. The paper is placed in the cover, heated in a machine (resembling a [[griddle]]), and when the glue cools, it adheres the paper to the spine. Thermal glue strips can also be purchased separately for individuals that wish to use customized or original covers. However, creating documents using thermal binding glue strips can be a tedious process, requiring a scoring device and a large-format printer.
# A ''cardboard article'' is a publication that resembles a hardbound book, despite being a paperback with a hard cover. Many books sold as hardcover are actually of this type; the [[Modern Library]] series is an example. This type of document is usually bound with thermal adhesive glue using a perfect-binding machine.
# ''Tape binding'' refers to a binding method that utilises thermal adhesive tape applied to the base of a document. A tape binding machine, such as the PLANAX COPY Binder or Powis Parker Fastback system, is then typically used to complete the binding process and to activate the thermal adhesive on the glue strip. However, some users also refer to tape binding as the process of adding a colored tape to the edge of a mechanically fastened (stapled or stitched) document.

===Stitched or sewn binding===
# A ''sewn book'' is constructed in the same way as a hardbound book, except that it lacks the hard covers. The binding is as durable as that of a hardbound book.
# ''[[Stapling]]'' through the [[centerfold]], also called ''saddle-stitching'', joins a set of nested folios into a single magazine issue; most [[comic book]]s are well-known examples of this type.
# ''[[Magazine]]s'' are considered more ephemeral than books, and less durable means of binding them are usual. In general, the cover papers of magazines will be the same as the inner pages (self-cover)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3010.html|accessdate=2008-10-22|title=A Dictionary of Descriptive Terminology: self-cover|publisher=Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources}}</ref> or only slightly heavier (plus cover). Most magazines are stapled or saddle-stitched; however, some are bound with perfect binding and use thermally activated adhesive.

Modern bookbinding by hand can be seen as two closely allied fields: the creation of new bindings, and the repair of existing bindings. Bookbinders are often active in both fields. Bookbinders can learn the craft through [[apprenticeship]]; by attending specialized trade schools;<ref>Such as the: [http://www.cbl-ascona.ch/html/english.html Centro del bel Libro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826103021/http://www.cbl-ascona.ch/html/english.html |date=26 August 2009 }}, [[Camberwell College of Arts|The Camberwell College of Arts]], The London College of Communication, and [http://www.nbss.org/ The North Bennet Street School]</ref> by taking classes in the course of university studies, or by a combination of those methods. Some European countries offer a ''Master Bookbinder'' certification, though no such certification exists in the United States. MFA programs that specialize in the 'Book Arts' (hand paper-making, printmaking and bookbinding) are available through certain colleges and universities.<ref>Such as: [http://www.colum.edu/book_and_paper/ Columbia College Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512143659/http://www.colum.edu/Book_and_Paper/ |date=12 May 2009 }}, the [http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama], [http://www.nscad.ca – Nova Scotia College of Art and Design] and the [http://www.uarts.edu/academics/cad/bookarts.html/ University of the Arts in Philadelphia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121024815/http://www.uarts.edu/academics/cad/bookarts.html |date=21 November 2007 }}.</ref>

Hand bookbinders create new bindings that run the gamut from historical book structures made with traditional materials to modern structures made with 21st-century materials, and from basic cloth-case bindings to valuable full-leather fine bindings. Repairs to existing books also encompass a broad range of techniques, from minimally invasive conservation of a historic book to the full restoration and rebinding of a text.

Though almost any existing book can be repaired to some extent, only books that were originally sewn can be rebound by resewing. Repairs or restorations are often done to emulate the style of the original binding. For new works, some publishers print unbound manuscripts which a binder can collate and bind, but often an existing commercially bound book is ''pulled'', or taken apart, in order to be given a new binding. Once the textblock of the book has been pulled, it can be rebound in almost any structure; a modern suspense novel, for instance, could be rebound to look like a 16th-century manuscript. Bookbinders may bind several copies of the same text, giving each copy a unique appearance.

Hand bookbinders use a variety of specialized hand tools, the most emblematic of which is the [[bonefolder]], a flat, tapered, polished piece of bone used to crease paper and apply pressure.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt1387.html | title = Etherington & Roberts. Dictionary—folder | publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}</ref> Additional tools common to hand bookbinding include a variety of knives and hammers, as well as brass tools used during [[Finishing (bookbinding)|finishing]].

When creating new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound in many different materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are [[leather]], decorative [[paper]], and [[cloth]] (see also: [[buckram]]). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as ''fine'' or ''extra'' bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book that has already been printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative end sheets, leather cover etc."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=W.|date=2016|title=Bridging the Gap: Artist's Book and Design Bindings by Karen Hanmer.|journal=Journal of Artists Books|volume=39|pages=47–49}}</ref>

==Conservation and restoration==
Conservation and restoration are practices intended to repair damage to an existing book. While they share methods, their goals differ. The goal of conservation is to slow the book's decay and restore it to a usable state while altering its physical properties as little as possible. Conservation methods have been developed in the course of taking care of large collections of books. The term archival comes from taking care of the institutions archive of books. The goal of restoration is to return the book to a previous state as envisioned by the restorer, often imagined as the original state of the book. The methods of restoration have been developed by bookbinders with private clients mostly interested in improving their collections.

In either case, one of the modern standard for conservation and restoration is "reversibility". That is, any repair should be done in such a way that it can be undone if and when a better technique is developed in the future. Bookbinders echo the physician's creed, "[[Primum non-nocere|First, do no harm]]". While reversibility is one standard, longevity of the functioning of the book is also very important and sometimes takes precedence over reversibility especially in areas that are invisible to the reader such as the spine lining.

[[File:restore.jpg|right|thumb|Rebacking saving original spine, showing one volume finished and one untouched]]
Books requiring restoration or conservation treatment run the gamut from the very earliest of texts to books with modern bindings that have undergone heavy usage. For each book, a course of treatment must be chosen that takes into account the book's value, whether it comes from the binding, the text, the [[provenance]], or some combination of the three. Many people choose to rebind books, from amateurs who restore old paperbacks on internet instructions to many professional book and paper conservators and restorationists, who often in the United States are members of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).

Many times, books that need to be restored are hundreds of years old, and the handling of the pages and binding has to be undertaken with great care and a delicate hand. The archival process of restoration and conservation can extend a book's life for many decades and is necessary to preserve books that sometimes are limited to a small handful of remaining copies worldwide.

Typically, the first step in saving and preserving a book is its deconstruction. The text pages need to be separated from the covers and, only if necessary, the stitching removed. This is done as delicately as possible. All page restoration is done at this point, be it the removal of [[foxing]], ink stains, page tears, etc. Various techniques are employed to repair the various types of page damage that might have occurred during the life of the book.

The preparation of the "foundations" of the book could mean the difference between a beautiful work of art and a useless stack of paper and leather.

The sections are then hand-sewn in the style of its period, back into book form, or the original sewing is strengthened with new lining on the text-spine. New hinges must be accounted for in either case both with text-spine lining and some sort of end-sheet restoration.

The next step is the restoration of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with [[natural dye]]s, and [[Paper marbling|hand-marbled]] papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.

Sometimes the restoration of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the original cover by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength. This is perhaps a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather books can be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.

It is harder to restore leather books typically because of the fragility of the materials.

==Terms and techniques==
Most of the following terms apply only with respect to American practices:
* A ''leaf'' (often wrongly referred to as a ''folio'') typically has two pages of text and/or images, front and back, in a finished book. The Latin for ''leaf'' is ''folium'', therefore the ablative "folio" ("on the folium") should be followed by a designation to distinguish between recto and verso. Thus "folio 5r" means "on the recto of the leaf numbered 5". Although technically not accurate, common usage is "on folio 5r". In everyday speech it is common to refer to "turning the pages of a book", although it would be more accurate to say "turning the leaves of a book"; this is the origin of the phrase "to turn over a new leaf" i.e. to start on a fresh blank page.
** The ''[[recto]]'' side of a leaf faces left when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an odd-numbered page).
** The ''[[verso]]'' side of a leaf faces right when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an even-numbered page).
* A ''bifolium'' (often wrongly called a "bifolio", "bi-folio", or even "bifold") is a single sheet folded in half to make two leaves. The plural is "bifolia", not "bifolios".
* A ''[[Section (bookbinding)|section]]'', sometimes called a ''gathering'', or, especially if unprinted, a ''quire'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington & Roberts. Dictionary—quire| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}</ref> is a group of bifolia nested together as a single unit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3005.html | title = Etherington & Roberts. Dictionary—section| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref> In a completed book, each quire is sewn through its fold. Depending of how many bifolia a quire is made of, it could be called:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/chapter3/index.html | title = Printing and Book Designs| publisher = National Diet Library, Japan | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}</ref>
** ''duernion''&nbsp;– two bifolia, producing four leaves;
** ''ternion''&nbsp;– three bifolia, producing six leaves;
** ''quaternion''&nbsp;– four bifolia, producing eight leaves;
** ''quinternion''&nbsp;– five bifolia, producing ten leaves;
** ''sextern'' or ''sexternion''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington & Roberts. Dictionary—sexternion| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}</ref>&nbsp;– six bifolia, producing twelve leaves.
* A ''[[codex]]'' is a series of one or more quires sewn through their folds, and linked together by the sewing thread.
* A ''[[Section (bookbinding)|signature]]'', in the context of printed books, is a section that contains text. Though the term ''signature'' technically refers to the [[signature mark]], traditionally a letter or number printed on the first leaf of a section in order to facilitate collation, the distinction is rarely made today.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3109.html | title = Etherington & Roberts. Dictionary—signature| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}</ref>
* ''Folio'', ''quarto'', and so on may also refer to the size of the finished book, based on the size of sheet that an early paper maker could conveniently turn out with a manual press. Paper sizes could vary considerably, and the finished size was also affected by how the pages were trimmed, so the sizes given are rough values only.
** A [[folio (printing)|folio]] volume is typically {{Convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more in height, the largest sort of regular book.
** A [[quarto]] volume is typically about {{Convert|9|by|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}, roughly the size of most modern magazines. A sheet folded ''in quarto'' (also 4to or 4º) is folded in half twice at right angles to make four leaves. Also called: eight-page signature.
** An [[octavo]] volume is typically about {{Convert|5|to|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} by {{Convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most modern [[digest magazine]]s or [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperbacks]]. A sheet folded ''in octavo'' (also 8vo or 8º) is folded in half 3 times to make 8 leaves. Also called: sixteen-page signature.
** A sextodecimo volume is about {{Convert|4+1/2|by|6+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most mass market paperbacks. A sheet folded ''in sextodecimo'' (also 16mo or 16º) is folded in half 4 times to make 16 leaves. Also called: 32-page signature.
** ''Duodecimo'' or 12mo, 24mo, 32mo, and even 64mo are other possible sizes. Modern paper mills can produce very large sheets, so a modern printer will often print 64 or 128 pages on a single sheet.
* ''Trimming'' separates the leaves of the bound book. A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be trimmed. ''[[Deckle edge]]'', or ''Uncut'' books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to [[book collecting|book collectors]].

===Paperback binding===
Though books are sold as hardcover or paperback, the actual binding of the pages is important to durability.
Most paperbacks and some hard cover books have a "perfect binding". The pages are aligned or cut together and glued. A strong and flexible layer, which may or may not be the glue itself, holds the book together. In the case of a paperback, the visible portion of the spine is part of this flexible layer.

== Spine ==
=== Orientation ===
[[File:A_selection_of_Sophie_Calle_books_spine_titling.jpg|thumb|100px|Three [[Sophie Calle]] books with different titling orientations: ascending (left), descending (middle) and upright (right)]]
{{float right clear none|[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|The spine of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, what is on the spine is the only visible information about the book. In a book store, the details on the spine are what initially attract attention.]]}}
In languages written from left to right, such as English, books are bound on the left side of the cover; looking from on top, the pages increase counter-clockwise. In right-to-left languages, books are bound on the right. In both cases, this is so the end of a page coincides with where it is turned. Many translations of [[manga|Japanese comic books]] retain the binding on the right, which allows the art, laid out to be read right-to-left, to be published without mirror-imaging it.

In China (only areas using Traditional Chinese), Japan, and Taiwan, literary books are written top-to-bottom, right-to-left, and thus are bound on the right, while text books are written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and thus are bound on the left. In mainland China the direction of writing and binding for all books was changed to be like left to right languages in the mid-20th century.

=== Titling ===
Early books did not have [[title (publishing)|titles]] on their spines; rather they were shelved flat with their spines inward and titles written with ink along their fore edges. Modern books display their titles on their spines.

In languages with Chinese-influenced writing systems, the title is written top-to-bottom, as is the language in general. In languages written from left to right, the spine text can be pillar (one letter per line), transverse (text line perpendicular to long edge of spine) and along spine. Conventions differ about the direction in which the title along the spine is rotated:

* '''Top-to-bottom (descending):'''
In texts published or printed in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], the spine text, when the book is standing 
upright, runs from the top to the bottom. This means that when the book is lying flat with the front cover upwards, the title is oriented left-to-right on the spine. This practice is reflected in the industry standards ANSI/NISO Z39.41<ref>[https://www.niso.org/publications/ansiniso-z3941-1997-s2015 ANSI/NISO Z39.41-1997 Printed Information on Spines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114105821/http://www.niso.org/kst/reports/standards?step=2&gid=None&project_key%3Austring%3Aiso-8859-1=adf940d30971d49c34abb475530b58b9cefd0ffa |date=14 November 2008 }}</ref> and ISO 6357.<ref>[https://www.iso.org/standard/12665.html ISO 6357 ''Spine titles on books and other publications'', 1985.]</ref>, but ″... lack of agreement in the matter persisted among English-speaking countries as late as the middle of the twentieth century, when books bound in Britain still tended to have their titles read up the spine ...″.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Book on the Bookshelf | last = Petroski | first = Henry | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-375-40649-2 | ref = harv | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/bookonbookshelf00petr_0 }}</ref>

* '''Bottom-to-top (ascending):'''
In most of [[continental Europe]], [[Latin America]], and [[French language in Canada|French Canada]] the spine text, when the book is standing upright, runs from the bottom up, so the title can be read by tilting the head to the left. This allows the reader to read spines of books shelved in alphabetical order in accordance to the usual way left-to-right and top-to-bottom.<ref name="Drösser">{{cite news|last=Drösser|first=Christoph|title=Linksdrehende Bücher|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/15/Stimmts|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|date=9 April 2011}}</ref>
