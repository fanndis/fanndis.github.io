==Background==
On 8 May 2020, the [[National Assembly of Belarus|National Assembly]] set 9 August as the date for the presidential election.<ref>[https://federalnewsnetwork.com/world-news/2020/05/belarus-to-hold-its-presidential-election-on-aug-9/ "Belarus to hold its presidential election on Aug. 9"], [[Associated Press]]. 8 May 2020. Retrieved 19 June 2020.</ref> 

Incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko has been leading the country since the first presidential elections held in [[1994 Belarusian presidential election|1994]]. Over the next two years, he rapidly consolidated his power. In 1995, he won a [[1995 Belarusian referendum|referendum]] that gave him the power to dissolve the legislature if he felt it contravened the Constitution. In 1996, he won [[1996 Belarusian referendum|another referendum]] that dramatically increased his power, and also extended his original five-year term to [[2001 Belarusian presidential election|2001]]. <ref>[http://belarusdigest.com/story/why-does-%E2%80%9Clast-dictatorship-europe%E2%80%9D-hold-elections-8551 Why Does The "Last Dictatorship In Europe" Hold Elections?] Belarus Digest, 26 March 2012</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/116265.stm Profile: Europe's last dictator?] BBC News, 10 September 2001</ref> Since then, his regime has been reckoned as an authoritarian dictatorship by Western observers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 August 2020|title=Who is Belarus' long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko?|url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/07/belarus-presidential-election-who-is-long-time-leader-alexander-lukashenko|access-date=8 August 2020|website=euronews|language=en}}</ref> Opposition activists are often pressured or detained by the government, and Lukashenko or those loyal to him control (as of 2020) all of the seats in both houses of the [[National Assembly of Belarus|National Assembly]], all judicial appointments, the media, and the CEC (which has the power to approve or deny candidates for political offices).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Roth|first=Andrew|date=7 August 2020|title=Belarus goes to the polls with longtime leader Lukashenko feeling the heat|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/belarus-goes-to-the-polls-with-longtime-leader-lukashenko-feeling-the-heat|access-date=8 August 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
The President of Belarus is elected using the [[two-round system]]. If no candidate obtains over 50% of the vote, a second round is held with the top two candidates. The winner of the second round is elected. A turnout quorum of 50% is applied.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Despite the two-round system being in place, a second round has not been required since 1994. In the previous four elections, Lukashenko claimed margins of 77% or more in the first round. No election since 1994 has met international standards of transparency and fairness.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=22 November 2019|title=Opposition Wins No Seats in Belarus Election|url=https://crd.org/2019/11/22/opposition-wins-no-seats-in-belarus-election/|access-date=5 August 2020|website=Civil Rights Defenders|language=en-US}}</ref>

The blogger's arrest was due to his trips around the Belarus that covered consequences of the [[Lukashenko]]’s 26-year tenure as a president. The Tsikhanouski trips were popular and gathered hundreds of people who spoke out to him about violations of human rights and economic problems. During these trips, Tsikhanouski and his team was constantly chased by cars with the people which were recording him and his activities, presumably they were employees of the Belarusian special services.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFW9GeF83zs Watching Siarhei Tsihanouski] // [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFPC7r3tWWXWzUIROLx46mg/videos Country for Life] YouTube channel</ref>

Tsikhanouski then began travelling round the country to hold pickets in order to collect signatures for Tsikhanouskaya. Tsikhanouski's pickets were very popular and attracted thousands of people.{{strip categories|{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}}} The queue to the picket in Minsk near Kamarouski market was half a mile long.{{strip categories|{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}}} Several thousand people also attended the picket of Tsikhanouski in [[Gomel|Homiel]].{{strip categories|{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}}} Tsikhanouski announced that he was collecting signatures for fair election in Belarus.

Tsikhanouski uses the slogan "Stop the cockroach!" in his campaign, which is chanted by his supporters. The symbol of the campaign is a slipper. The slogan "Stop the cockroach!" refers to the fairy tale "Cockroach" by Soviet poet [[Kornei Chukovsky]] about how a "moustached cockroach" intimidated all the animals and became their ruler. Apparently, this slogan is a reference to the current leadership of Belarus. Slippers are supposedly a traditional means of pest control.<ref>[https://telegraf.by/politika/na-piket-tihanovskogo-ochered-rastyanulas-na-kilometr-razbiraemsya-pochemu-oni-krichali-stop-tarakan-i-chto-znachat-prinesennye-tapki/ The Tsikhanouski queue stretched for one kilometer for the picket.

On 29 May, Tsikhanouski visited [[Grodno|Hrodna]] to collect signatures for his wife. On the same day, the head of Belarus [[Alexander Lukashenko]] alluded to Tsikhanouski at a meeting with workers of [[Minsk Tractor Works]]: "They come cool, all in jeeps — 10-12 cars... we know whose cars he drives, who finances it. We know where he comes from, what his citizenship is and stuff... We all know that. I'm already looking, they're giving me information, our people have already seen it."<ref>[https://news.tut.by/elections/686613.html Lukashenka told about the dirt on Capkala and called Tsikhanouski "peeling".] // [[TUT.BY]] {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Tsikhanouski commented on Lukashenko's statement to the [[Nasha Niva]] newspaper: "My last name isn't there, but a hint of me: "We know his citizenship."

Before the 2020 presidential election, Alexander Lukashenko insisted that Belarus is not ready for a woman to be president. On 17 July 2020, the three women representing the main opposition candidates (Tsikhanouskaya, Tsepkalo's wife Veronica and Babaryka's campaign manager Maryja Kalesnikava) merged their campaigns, pitting "Female Solidarity" to fight Lukashenko.<ref>{{Cite web|agency=Agence France-Presse |date=17 July 2020|title=3 Belarusian women teamed up to fight strongman Lukashenko|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/3-belarusian-women-teamed-up-to-fight-strongman-lukashenko|access-date=25 July 2020|website=Daily Sabah|language=en}}</ref>

On 4 August, Tsikhanouskaya planned to visit [[Slutsk]] and [[Salihorsk]] (Minsk region).

On 6 August, Tsikhanouskaya was forced to cancel a previously announced rally in Minsk due to full booking at all six sites in the city that were made available by the authorities. Instead, she, with Veranika Tsepkalo and Maryja Kalesnikava, visited one of the booked sites and invited people to join them, but the policemen did not allow three of them to come in.

According to a poll conducted back in March–April 2020 by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, the level of trust of current Lukashenko in the capital city of Belarus is 24%. At the same time, 11% of the poll participants trust the Central Election Commission.<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 June 2020|script-title=ru:Институт социологии НАН: В апреле уровень доверия Лукашенко в Минске составлял 24%|url=https://news.tut.by/economics/689489.html|access-date=9 August 2020|website=TUT.BY|language=ru}}</ref>

The state-affiliated analytical center "Ecoom" commissioned by the state TV channel ONT, which was criticized for its biased coverage of the election campaign, conducted a sociological survey of electoral moods and preferences of citizens.

===Results===
The result of the vote, "as in previous elections, was never in any real doubt" and had a "foregone nature" according to [[The New York Times]], stating that Lukashenko "controls vote counting, [and abused] a vast security apparatus and a noisy state media machine unwavering in its support for him and contempt for his rivals." Tsikhanouskaya, the principal challenger, was stated to have gone into hiding in Minsk after security agents detained at least eight members of her campaign staff on the day of the election.<ref name=":3" />

===Protocols of the polling stations===
Once the votes have been duly counted, polling stations in Belarus write a "Protocol" (report) which sums up the election tallies. The Protocol is then displayed for passers-by.

People took photos of the protocols, which testified that in many stations in the [[Minsk]] capital, and in foreign consulates, the support for Tsikhanouskaya was roughly equal or even several times higher than of Lukashenko.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.tut.by/economics/696090.html|title=Читатели присылают десятки протоколов с участков по всей Беларуси, на которых Тихановская побеждает|date=10 August 2020|website=TUT.BY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.tut.by/economics/696057.html|title=На каких избирательных участках победила Тихановская? Данные протоколов|date=9 August 2020|website=TUT.BY}}</ref>

Belarusian political scientist {{ill|Valer Karbalevich|ru|Карбалевич, Валерий Иванович}} stated that the local protocols and final results are completely uncorrelated.<ref name=ex>[https://gazetaby.com/post/sem-istorij-o-tom-kak-falsificirovali-vybory/168022/ Семь историй о том, как фальсифицировали выборы]</ref>

Although the Electoral Code of Belarus requires to hang out the protocols on every voting station (article 55<ref>[https://kodeksy.by/izbiratelnyy-kodeks/statya-55 Статья 55. Подсчет голосов на участке для голосования при проведении выборов Президента Республики Беларусь, депутатов Палаты представителей, депутатов местных Советов депутатов, референдума]</ref>), it was reported that some stations didn't make them public. The Central Electoral Commission of Belarus stated that no such info was known and reported that there are no specific requirements to the procedure of announcement of the local protocols.<ref>[https://news.tut.by/economics/696390.html ЦИК: Правового механизма, чтобы избиратели могли ознакомиться с протоколами, на сегодняшний день нет].

Although the voting papers should be kept for 6 months, a Brest-based human rights activist obtained a big bale of partially burned voting papers a few days after the election: according to him, they were to be burned in the boiler room.<ref>[https://www.svaboda.org/a/30785175.html Праваабаронцам у Берасьці прынесьлі абгарэлыя бюлетэні для галасаваньня.

The ''Voice'' ({{lang-ru|Голос|Golos}}, {{lang-be|Голас|Holas}}) initiative invited Belarusian citizens to submit photographs of both sides of their voting papers, together with their voting bureau locations. The aim was to make all photographs available as a public photographic database, enabling cross-checks against the official results. 

On 15 August 2020, ''Voice'' claimed to have had 1,248,714 valid voting papers recorded,<ref>[https://belarus2020.org/ Онлайн-платформа "Голос"]{{web archive|url=https://archive.today/nviFi|date=15 August 2020}}</ref> about 18% of the voting population. {{As of|2020|08|28}}, ''Voice'' updated its count to 1,049,334 unique confirmed votes recorded,<ref name=golos1>{{Cite web|url=https://partizan-results.com/|title=This time your voice matters!|website=Online Platform "Voice"|accessdate=28 August 2020}}</ref> with 545,947 verified ballot photos.

==== Protocols vs Official data and photographs ====
On 21 August 2020, a final report by the ''Voice'', partnering with the "Zubr" and "Honest People" platforms<ref name="Golos_20200828" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kSprtBUUtS1vb-W_jc4QJkPkoZPJBWxd/view|title=Voice Report.pdf|website=Google Drive|accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref> analyzed polling station results. For 1310 out of the total of 5767 polling stations, there were photographs of the protocols.

The ''Voice'' report on the analysis of the official data, calculated that if both official results and photographs were correct, then at the polling stations where comparison was not possible (4457 out of 5847), Tsikhanouskaya would have to have had about 3% support. At the stations for which data were published, she received (according to ''Voice'''s analysis of the official data) 25% of the votes overall, split into 57% in the voting areas where she led, and 20% in those where she trailed. ''Voice'' described these differences as "extreme anomalies".<ref name="Golos_20200831_details" />

==Aftermath==
{{main|2020 Belarusian protests|Coordination Council}}
After state TV revealed the results of an exit poll showing a landslide Lukashenko victory, clashes between protesters and riot police broke out in Minsk. Reports of injuries and the use of stun grenades and rubber bullets emerged.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-53717834|title=Belarus election: Clashes after poll predicts Lukashenko re-election|website=BBC News|date=10 August 2020}}</ref>

The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said in a news conference that she did not trust the exit poll, saying, "I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us".<ref name="bbc"/>

As polling closed many internet service providers lost routing, the communication losses were widespread as police and military closed down most of Minsk.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/09/belarus-presidential-election-police-storm-opposition-headquarters-as-vote-begins |title=Belarus election: Protesters clash with police after disputed presidential vote |publisher=euronews |date=10 August 2020}}</ref>

On the second night after the allegedly falsified results were announced, protesters barricaded the area around the Rīga market. Security forces responded by [[Tear gas|tear-gassing]] the protesters and using [[flashbang]]s.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=be:Менск: да «Рыгі» дабраліся сілавікі, пачалася зачыстка, чуваць шумавыя гранаты, будуюцца барыкады |url=https://www.svaboda.org/a/30776680.html |website=Радыё Свабода |language=be}}</ref>

After being released from a seven-hour-long detention on election night following her submission of a formal complaint to the Central Election Commission (CEC), Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was escorted by Belarusian security services to [[Lithuania]], reportedly a condition of a deal securing the release of her campaign manager, Maria Moroz.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|date=12 August 2020|title=Challenger fled Belarus 'for sake of her children'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53733330|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>

On 11 August, Tsikhanouskaya released a video reading from a script following her detainment, seemingly filmed under duress and promoted on state-sponsored media,<ref name=":6" /> in which she called upon the people of Belarus to stop protesting and accept the victory of Lukashenko. The strong change in message and demeanor of Tsikhanouskaya post-detainment led allies to insist the video was coerced, likening it to a hostage video.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Seddon|first=Max|date=|title=Belarus protesters decry pressure that forced their leader to flee|url=https://www.ft.com/content/23411f95-4806-443e-9b6e-0dea8e673860|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 August 2020|website=www.ft.com}}</ref> She had previously sent her children abroad before the elections for their safety. On 14 August, Tikhanovskaya, now in Lithuania, published another video in which she claimed to have won the presidential election with between 60 and 70% of the vote and called for the creation of a [[Coordination Council|transitional council]] of "civil society activists, respected Belarusians and professionals" to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko. She also encouraged her supporters to sign an online petition calling for a recount of the election.<ref name="BBC148"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200815_05/amp.html?__twitter_impression=true|title=Belarus opposition candidate declares victory &#124; NHK WORLD-JAPAN News|website=www3.nhk.or.jp}}</ref>

Arrests and violence against protesters, including claims of torture, increased in the week after the election resulting in calls for international sanctions against the perpetrators.<ref name="BBC148">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-53780685 |title=Belarus election: Exiled leader calls weekend of 'peaceful rallies' |work=BBC News |date=14 August 2020}}</ref> 

On 19 August, the Belarusian Central Election Committee said that Mr Lukashenko would be inaugurated as president for a new term within the next two months.<ref name="Sky198"/>

On 16 November 2020, ''[[BBC]]'' reported that more than 1,000 people were arrested during the demonstrations in Belarus, over the disputed presidential election. The police fired [[rubber bullets]] at protesters and also used [[tear gas]] to disperse the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54953599|title=Belarus: 'Over 1,000 arrested' at latest anti-government protest|accessdate=16 November 2020|website=BBC}}</ref>

=== Deaths ===
29-year-old [[Konstantin Shishmakov]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 August 2020|title=Директора волковысского музея нашли мертвым|url=https://news.tut.by/society/697178.html|access-date=18 August 2020|website=TUT.BY|language=ru}}</ref> director of the Volkovysk Military History Museum named after Bagration, disappeared on 15 August. He refused to sign the protocol of the election commission, called his wife at about 5 PM local time and said: "I will not work here anymore; I am going home." But he never came home. 

Later, he was found dead. This was announced by the search and rescue squad "Angel".

"It all started on the 9th [of August], - the father recalls. - When he was on the election commission. There was another guy with him - I do not remember his last name, I will not name it. The two of them did not sign the final protocol. According to his son, they signed for them. He called his wife and talked about it."
