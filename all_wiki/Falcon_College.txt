'''Falcon College''' (or simply '''Falcon''') is an [[Independent school|independent]] [[Boarding school|boarding]] school for boys and girls aged 12–18 in the southern [[Matabeleland]] region of [[Zimbabwe]]. It was founded in 1954 near [[Esigodini|Essexvale]], [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] (now Esigodini, Zimbabwe),<ref>{{citation|editor=[[D. Berens]]|year=1988|title=[[A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe]]|publisher=[[Mambo Press]]|location=[[Gweru]]|page=157}}.</ref> 55&nbsp;km southeast of [[Bulawayo]] on the remains of the [[Bushtick Mine]]. The college's graduates include a British member of parliament, surgeons and doctors, leaders of industry and commerce, soldiers and educators.

The college has 40&nbsp;km² of Matabeleland bush, 10&nbsp;km² approximately is game fenced and houses [[Quiet Waters]] game park. The park contains examples of most of Zimbabwe’s plains game species, including zebra, giraffe, kudu, impala, tsessebe, bushbuck and warthog. The campus is surrounded by an electric fence (a reminder of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|bush war]] of pre-1980). An air strip is nearby.

The school's motto is ''Sic itur ad astra'' and the school badge is a representation of a [[Lanner Falcon]] designed by the wife of a former Headmaster.

Falcon College was ranked as one of the Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe in 2014.<ref name="Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe">{{cite web |author = DarrylYV8 |url= http://youthvillage.co.zw/2014/10/top-10-high-schools-in-zimbabwe/|title= Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe |date= 9 October 2014 |website= Youth Village Zimbabwe |publisher= Youth Village Zimbabwe |accessdate= 5 January 2015}}</ref>

Falcon College is a member of the [[Association of Trust Schools]] (ATS) and the Headmaster is a member of the [[Conference of Heads of Independent Schools in Zimbabwe]] (CHISZ).<ref name="ATS Directory">{{cite web |url= http://www.atschisz.co.zw/schools-directory/wpbdp_category/senior/ |title= ATS CHISZ Senior » » Schools Directory |website= ATS CHISZ |publisher=ATS CHISZ |access-date= 13 March 2016}}</ref>

In December 2015 Falcon became a coeducational school accepting girls in January 2016.

== Historical background ==

Originally [[Bushtick Mine]], and with 36 boys and a handful of staff, the college was founded on Wednesday 3 February 1954. It was opened by the [[Governor General]] of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], [[John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin|Lord Llewellin]], on Saturday 10 April 1954. Much has changed since then but the college has some remains of its founding days.

The original motto was ''Arduus ad Solem''. The newer Motto is: Sic Itur Ad Astra
The school motto comes from the words of Publius Vergilius Marote (70-19BC) a classical Roman poet who wrote: “nova virtute, puer; sic itur ad astra” which translates: Look to your new-found courage, young man, for that is the way to the stars.

In the beginning the boys were divided into three colour groups for sport, Whites, Blues and Khakis. Later, the houses were named A,B,C and D and in April 1956, Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], Chairman of the Board of Governors, announced that the houses were to be renamed Hervey, Oates, Tredgold and Founders. Founders was so named to commemorate the Founders of the School; Tredgold after Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], who was also Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; Oates after [[Frank Oates]], explorer and naturalist who travelled extensively in southern central Africa in the 19th century; and Hervey after Hubert Hervey, adventurer, gentleman and soldier, who was killed in the 2nd Matabele war, and who was buried in the [[Matopos]].<ref name=SRRSS>{{citation|editor=[[I.P. Maclaren]]|year=1981|title=[[Some Renowned Rhodesian Senior Schools 1892 - 1979]]|publisher=[[Books of Zimbabwe]]|location=[[Bulawayo]]|pages=120–123}}.</ref>

== Student body ==
The college admittance is based on strength of prior education and character of the applicant. Although the vast majority of students are Zimbabwean, others attend from neighbouring countries ([[Zambia]], [[Botswana]]). Some [[scholarships]] are available to deserving students whose particular financial circumstances do not allow for the payment of school fees.

==The house system==
The school is based on a '''[[house system]]''' that is divided into six [[House system|Houses]]; Founders, Hervey, Oates, Tredgold, George Grey and Chubb, each comprising the full range of year groups. Each house has a [[housemaster]] in charge who lives nearby. Each housemaster has a house Tutor and two assistant tutors, as well as other members of staff, who assist in duties.

Boys can either go home, or (with parental permission) to friends or relatives on two Fixture Frees which last from break time on a Friday to dinner time on the following Monday. There is a Mid term [[Exeat]] which is a day longer. In addition, there are three floating exeats but these must be spent with parents.

== Quiet Waters Conservation Scheme ==
{{main|Quiet Waters}}

The project began in 1986 and was officially opened in 1988. It consists of a Nature Reserve and Wilderness Area which cover 8.1&nbsp;km². [[Quiet Waters]] conserves indigenous fauna and flora, furthers the educational pursuits of the college and serves as a base for conservation education in other schools. It is also used for scientific research and provides recreational facilities for the College community and visitors.

Picnic sites are available for the use of day visitors within the Nature Reserve area, with four chalets which can be rented for overnight stays in the Wilderness area.

Animals which can be seen are [[kudu]], [[zebra]], [[giraffe]], [[reedbuck]], [[bushbuck]], [[steenbok]], [[tsessebe]], [[impala]], [[klipspringer]], [[bushpig]] and [[warthog]] and the two species of [[jackal]], while there are many smaller mammals which are not so easily seen, such as four species of [[mongoose]].
