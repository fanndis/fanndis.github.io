"'''The Lady Is a Tramp'''" is a [[show tune]] from the 1937 [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical ''[[Babes in Arms]]'', in which it was introduced by former child star [[Mitzi Green]]. This song is a spoof of New York [[upper class|high society]] and its strict etiquette (the first line of the verse is "''I get too hungry for dinner at eight''...") and phony social pretensions. It has become a [[pop standards|popular music standard]].

The song appears in the film version of ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939) in an instrumental version only.

==Versions==
Early recordings from 1937 include one by [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra]] (featuring [[Edythe Wright]] on vocals), [[Midge Williams|Midge Williams and Her Jazz Jesters]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and [[Bernie Cummins]] on the [[Vocalion]] records label (#3714). [[Lena Horne]] recorded the song with the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio Orchestra on March 30, 1948. Her performance appeared in the film ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'', a fictionalized biography of the partnership of Rodgers and Hart.

The song was also used in the film version of ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' starring Frank Sinatra, Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Joey Evans (Sinatra) sings the song to Vera Simpson (Hayworth) as he tries to entice the wealthy widow Simpson into financing Evans's dream of owning his own night club.

It was recorded by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Buddy Greco]] (whose version updates the lyrics to include several 1950s pop-culture references), [[Bing Crosby]]<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/CBS.html |website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}</ref> and [[Pat Suzuki]] in the 1950s and [[Shirley Bassey]] in the 1960s, becoming a signature song for Sinatra. Sinatra sang the song with new lyrics as "The Gentleman Is a Champ" at tribute events for [[Spiro Agnew]] and [[Orson Welles]].  Sinatra also recorded a new version titled "Maureen Is a Champ" for [[Ringo Starr]]'s wife [[Maureen Starkey]]; never commercially released, it was issued on the Beatles' [[Apple Records]] as Apple 1.
