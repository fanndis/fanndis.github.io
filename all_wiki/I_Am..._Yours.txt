'''I Am... Yours''' was the first [[concert residency]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. It was held four consecutive nights in July and August 2009 in support of her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The residency was held at the [[Encore Las Vegas|Encore at Wynn Las Vegas]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Beyoncé performed over thirty songs backed by an orchestra and her all-female band, the Suga Mamas, to an audience of 1,500. The residency was deemed "an intimate encounter" as Beyoncé portrayed a more raw and uninhibited show versus her previous concert performances. The concept of the shows revolves around Beyoncé's recording career.

I Am... Yours received positive response from music critics who praised the intimate performances and Beyoncé's vocals as well as the [[jazz]], [[funk]] and orchestral arrangements of the songs. The success of ''I Am... Yours'' has led [[Wynn Resorts]] to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act. A double disc CD and DVD, ''[[I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas]]'', was released in November 2009, featuring the performance recorded on August 2, 2009. It contained the full concert, a behind-the-scenes feature, along with an audio CD of the concert. ''I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas'' was aired on several TV Networks as a special.

When Beyoncé's [[I Am... World Tour|I Am... Tour]] (2009–2010), was announced in 2008 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the article mentioned Beyoncé would perform a week-long Las Vegas [[Variety show|showcase]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/10/split-personali.html |title=Split personality for new Beyoncé album |date=2008-10-15 |access-date=2008-10-15 |last=Willman |first=Chris |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218232338/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/10/split-personali.html |archive-date=2009-02-18 |df= }}</ref> As tour dates were announced, it was later revealed that Beyoncé would perform four shows in Las Vegas. The concerts were held at the [[Encore Las Vegas|Encore Theatre]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] to a standing room-only audience of 1,500.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2009/11/23/20091123newcdreleases.html|title=New CD releases: Lambert, Rihanna, Shakira, more|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|first=Ed|last=Masley|date=November 24, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref> Tickets for the first three shows were sold out after they were made available, but the ones for the fourth night were sold slowly with ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' reporting that ninety percent of the tickets were sold. The prices for the tickets were from $250 to $1,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/14/encore-two-night-stay-no-longer-needed-see-beyonc/|title=Encore: Two-night stay no longer needed to see Beyoncé|work=Las Vegas Sun|publisher=The Greenspun Corporation|first=Melissa|last=Arseniuk|date=July 14, 2009|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> According to Beyoncé, the show is an "unplugged" version of her normal concerts; she removed all the elaborate costumes and theatrics of her latest tour and performed with her band, Suga Mama, and a small team of dancers.<ref name="huffpost" /><ref name="jam" /> Regarding the concerts, she told [[ABC News]], 
<blockquote>
"I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've always wanted to do my own show there, because a lot of the icons that I look up to had amazing shows in Las Vegas. I thought if I'm going to have my own Las Vegas show, it has to be right and it has to have heart and soul and it has to be something memorable... My whole objective here is for people to see what they don't get to see. Just give me my band, give me a stage, some cool smoke and lights and you see the sweat, you see the pain, you see the love, you see the soul and it's about music."<ref name="yoursinspiration">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/beyonce-concert-thanksgiving/story?id=9168086|title=Beyonce: What I'm Thankful For|publisher=[[ABC News]].

</blockquote>

During the documentary, "What Happens in Vegas...", Beyoncé stated that when the idea of a Vegas show was presented to her, she wanted the show to be a complete 180 from her current tour. Also, she did not want it to be the typical Las Vegas showcase. She wanted to remove the theatrics and "consciously show that I don't need any of that stuff. Just give me my band, a stage and some cool smoke and lights."<ref name="dvd">{{cite video | people=Knowles, Beyoncé (Performer)| date=November 23, 2009 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1547653/ | title=I Am...

The concept of the shows revolves around Beyoncé's recording career, from her early childhood beginnings to the star she is today. She revealed, "In the beginning, I'm gonna start out, sing and make it about my songwriting, my arrangements, my band and my love for music. Then, I'm gonna tell my story. This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant more than just the chorus that's catchy... it's my life."<ref name="dvd"/> Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, "Ego", "At Last", "Listen", "Ring the Alarm", and "Upgrade U".<ref name="dvd"/> These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments.<ref name="dvd"/><ref name="lvrj" /> The success of the show has led [[Wynn Resorts]] to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/18/beyonce-deal-wynn-be-announced-after-holidays/|title=Beyonce deal at the Wynn to be announced after the holidays|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009|last=Leach |first=Robin|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |publisher=[[The Greenspun Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/beyonc%C3%A9-talks-take-vegas|title=Beyoncé In Talks Yo Take Vegas|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/12/09/beyonce-in-talks-for-vegas-shows-throws-jay-z-surprise-birthday/|title=Beyoncé in Talks for Vegas Shows, Throws Jay-Z Surprise Birthday|work=Rap-Up|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
{{Quote box|width=240px|align=right|quote="[...] beyond the customary thanks, introductions and shout-outs, Knowles' banter is thin on the ground – requests for the crowd to get up on their feet are answered, and the singer's patter is perfunctory rather than particularly tailored to this occasion. But this is a polished, professional performance... Knowles doesn't put a dangerously high heel wrong at any step. The stories that precede her cover versions are neatly scripted, succinct and fit the flow of the set well. Her vocals peak and dip, tremble and roar, mercifully without ever hitting [[Mariah Carey]] levels of skull-rattling intensity. All told, all boxes ticked.|source= — Mike Diver, [[BBC Online]]<ref name="bbcreview" />}}

Overall, the show received a positive response from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' wrote, "The spectacle rivals [[Celine Dion]]'s '[[A New Day...|A New Day]]' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, ''I Am ... Sasha Fierce''."<ref name="lvrj">{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/52169137.html|title=Beyoncé creating a special show for cozy Encore theater|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009|last=Weatherford|first=Mike|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|publisher=Stephens Media, LLC}}</ref> Melissa Arseniuk of ''Las Vegas Weekly'' wrote in her review of the show, "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater from left to right throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the [[mezzo-soprano]] is as easy on the eyes as she is on the ears."<ref name="lvw">{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/off-the-record/2009/aug/03/night-bootylicious-beyonc/|title=A night with the bootylicious Beyoncé|work=[[Las Vegas Weekly]]|first=Melissa|last=Arseniuk|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> John Griffiths of ''Us Weekly'' described the concert as "lavish".<ref name="usweekly" /> Andy Kellman from [[Allmusic]] wrote, "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-amyours-an-intimate-performance-at-wynn-las-vegas-r1700137/review|title=I Am...Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas |publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Darryl Sterdan of the website [[Jam!]] commented: "Only Beyonce would think an 'intimate' theatre gig should include her massive all-girl band, an orchestra, lasers, dancers, costume changes and a wind machine to keep her hair blowing majestically.
