===Notable stories===

Baquet was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]] in 1988, in recognition of a six-month investigation that he conducted alongside ''Chicago Tribune'' reporters William C. Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski documenting corruption and [[influence-peddling]] in the Chicago City Council in a seven-part series. Baquet was also a finalist for the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, for stories that exposed "fraud and mismanagement" at the largest U.S. non-profit health insurer.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan & Elizabeth C. Clarage, ''Who's Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners'' (Oryx Press: 1999), pp. 358-59.</ref><ref name=PulitzerOrg>{{cite web |title=Finalist: Dean Baquet and Jane Fritsch of The New York Times |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/dean-baquet-and-jane-fritsch |publisher=[[Pulitzer Prize|The Pulitzer Prizes]] |accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

As managing editor at the ''Los Angeles Times'', Baquet was involved in the newspaper's decision to publish, a few days before the [[2003 California recall]] election, an article raising concerns about containing "a half-dozen credible allegations by women in the movie industry" that [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], a front-runner in the election, had sexually harassed them.<ref name="Schudson">Michael Schudson, "The Multiple Political Roles of American Journalism" in ''Media Nation: The Political History of News in Modern America'' (eds. Bruce J. Schulman & Julian E.

In 2006, [[Brian Ross (journalist)|Brian Ross]] and Vic Walter of [[ABC News]] reported that Baquet and ''Los Angeles Times'' managing editor [[Douglas Frantz]] had made the decision to kill a planned ''Times'' story about [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|NSA warrantless surveillance of Americans]], acceding to a request made to him by the [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Negroponte]] and [[Director of the NSA]] [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]].<ref name="RossWalter">Brian Ross and Vic Walter, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/03/whistleblower_h.html "Whistle-blower Had to Fight NSA, LA Times to Tell Story"], ABC News, March 8, 2007.</ref> Baquet confirmed that he had spoken with Negroponte and Hayden, but said that "government pressure played no role in my decision not to run the story," and that he and Frantz had determined that "we did not have a story, that we could not figure out what was going on" based on highly technical documents submitted by a whistleblower.<ref name="RossWalter"/> Baquet's decision was criticized by [[Glenn Greenwald]], who said that Baquet had "a really disturbing history of practicing this form of journalism that is incredibly subservient to the American national security state."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/16/glenn-greenwald-new-york-times_n_5337486.html |title=Glenn Greenwald On Dean Baquet: A 'Disturbing History' Of Journalism 'Subservient' To National Security State |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=May 16, 2014}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], Baquet explained to [[NPR]] that some [[mainstream media]] outlets were too secular for their own good. He said: {{Quote|I think that the New York-based and Washington-based ... media powerhouses don't quite get religion. We have a fabulous religion writer, but she's all alone. We don't get religion.
