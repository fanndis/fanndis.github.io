Aécio Neves is son of politician Aécio Cunha and Inês Maria. Neves hails from a family of traditional politicians in Minas Gerais. His maternal grandfather, [[Tancredo Neves]], was a key figure in the re-democratization of Brazil, served as governor of Minas Gerais and elected via electoral college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u701853.shtml|first=Phillip|last=Dântom|date=4 March 2010|title=Tancredo Neves foi a fiador transição para democracia, diz sociólogo|work=Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate=}}</ref> Neves’ paternal grandfather, Tristão Ferreira da Cunha, and his father Aécio Cunha were congressmen representing the state of Minas Gerais.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/a-camara/conheca/historia/Ex_presidentesCD_Republica/aecio.html|title=A História da Câmara dos Deputados|publisher=Câmara dos Deputados|accessdate=}}</ref> His paternal grandfather, [[Tristão Ferreira da Cunha]], a native of [[Teófilo Otoni]], a northern city in [[Minas Gerais]], was also a politician as well as a lawyer and a professor.

[[Aécio Cunha]], son of Tristão and father of Aécio, was state deputy between 1955 and 1963 and federal representative between 1963 and 1987.

Neves moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]] with his parents when his was 10 years old. He had his first job at the Administrative Council for Economic Defense of the Ministry of Justice in Rio de Janeiro. In 1981 his maternal grandfather convinced Neves to return to Belo Horizonte. He moved into an apartment that he shared with his maternal grandfather and father and transferred to [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais]], where he studied economics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/eleicoes2006/interna/0,,OI1168900-EI6670,00.html|title=MG: veja a trajetória política de Aécio Neves|work=[[Terra (company)|Terra]]|date=1 October 2006|accessdate=1 October 2006}}</ref>

Tancredo Neves was elected governor of Minas Gerais, and in 1983, Aécio served as his private secretary. In the following years, Aécio participated in the movement "[[Diretas Já]]" and in Tancredo Neves’ presidential campaign. Tancredo Neves won the Brazilian presidency via electoral college in 1985.

They visited the United States and US President [[Ronald Reagan]], France with President [[François Mitterrand]], Italy and [[Sandro Pertini]], Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]], King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] of Spain and [[Pope John Paul II]].

Neves launched the Youth Savings Program in March 2007 with the goal to support 50,000 high school students from the state system who live in areas of high social risk by 2010. Every student received a sum of R$3,000 at the end of the third year of high school, which can be used in their professional career. To receive the money, the high school graduates must take a series of commitments on school performance, such as attendance, good grades, and personal behavior. They cannot, for example, engage in criminal activity and should perform community service.<ref name="Poupança Jovem">{{cite web |url=http://www.agenciaminas.mg.gov.br/noticias/aecio-lanca-programa-inedito-para-alunos-do-ensino-medio-2/ |title=Aécio lança programa inédito para alunos do ensino médio |work=Agência Minas |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003402/http://www.agenciaminas.mg.gov.br/noticias/aecio-lanca-programa-inedito-para-alunos-do-ensino-medio-2/ |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Over 30,000 students have participated in the program and have received English classes, computer skills and professional training.

The Neves government created the Paving Program Links and Access Road program in 2004 with own resources and funding from the Interamerican Development Bank. The program included the paving of accesses to 225 municipalities that had previously been connected only by dirt roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iadb.org/en/news/news-releases/2005-12-21/idb-approves-100-million-financing-to-improve-road-access-to-small-municipalities-in-state-of-minas-gerais-brazil,2687.html |title=IDB approves $100 million financing to improve road access to small municipalities in state of Minas Gerais, Brazil |publisher=[[Inter-American Development Bank]] |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="Proacesso 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.der.mg.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=261 |title=PROACESSO – Programa de Pavimentação de Ligações e Acessos Rodoviários aos Municípios |publisher=Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem do Estado de Minas Gerais |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009161225/http://www.der.mg.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=261 |archivedate=9 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Candidacy for Presidency in 2014==
[[File:Aécio Neves e a filha Gabriela.jpg|thumb|right|Neves and his daughter Gabriela in March 2010.]]
In December 2012, former Brazilian president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] appointed Aécio Neves as candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party for the 2014 presidential elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2012/12/fhc-e-lideres-tucanos-lancam-aecio-como-pre-candidato-presidencia.html|title=FHC e líderes tucanos lançam Aécio como pré-candidato à Presidência|work=G1|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> In the October 2014 election, Neves received the second greatest number of votes in the first round, defeating former Environment Minister [[Marina Silva]].  He narrowly lost in the second round, a run-off against incumbent [[Dilma Rousseff]] on 26 October 2014, 48.4% to Rousseff's 51.6%.<ref name="BBC Online"/>

==Controversies==
===Operation Car Wash===
Neves is being investigated in several corruption cases related to the "Car Wash" probe into kickbacks to politicians.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/home/5306397-155/brazil-crisis-deepens-with-probe-of Brazil crisis deepens with probe of president, top senator] by Peter Prengaman and Mauricio Savarese "The Associated Press" (2017)</ref> 
Aécio Neves was quoted by four whistleblowers during investigations into [[Operation Car Wash]]. [[Alberto Youssef]] said he heard the former deputy José Janene tell Aécio's sister that he would give him the collection of funds from Furnas, a mixed economy company linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy.<ref>[http://www.ligiadeslandes.com.br/21/04/2015/por-que-moro-nao-mandou-prender-a-irma-de-aecio-ela-tem-foro-privilegiado/ Por que Moro não mandou prender a irmã de Aécio?

On 25 August 2015, the CPI of [[Petrobras]], Youssef reiterated that Aécio received money diverted from [[Furnas]].<ref>[http://br.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKCN0QU2IF20150825 Doleiro Youssef diz que Aécio recebeu dinheiro de corrupção de Furnas] by Reuters (2016){{in lang|pt}}</ref> A Supreme Court Judge, by the end of 2015, closed the case for insufficient information.<ref name="zeroH">[http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/noticia/2016/03/aecio-nevesfoi-citado-por-quatro-delatores-na-lava-jato-conheca-os-casos-4997205.html Aécio Neves foi citado por quatro delatores na Lava-Jato; conheça os casos] by "Zero Hora" (2016){{in lang|pt}}</ref>

In July 2015, another witness, Carlos Alexandre de Souza Rocha, also known as Ceará, said he took {{BRL|300,000}} to a director of UTC in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the money would go to the senator. The director said that Aecio was "the most annoying" of his bribe's collector.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-idUSKCN0QV00D20150826 Brazil judge says president's ex-chief of staff may have been bribed] by Caroline Stauffer, published by [[Reuters]] on 25 August 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cartacapital.com.br/blogs/parlatorio/aecio-neves-teria-recebido-r-300-mil-em-propina-da-utc-diz-delator Aécio Neves teria recebido R$ 300 mil em propina da UTC, diz delator] by "CartaCapital" (2016){{in lang|pt}}</ref> In February 2016, the same Supreme Court Judge closed the case, again for insufficient information.

On 3 February 2016, Fernando Moura, in a statement, said he heard reports of an alleged kickback from Furnas to Aécio Neves. Per Moura, who made a whistle-blowing agreement with the police, Dimas Toledo's appointment to the position of director of Furnas was made by Aécio in 2002.
