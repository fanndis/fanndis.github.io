{{Precedence}}

The '''United States order of precedence''' is an advisory document maintained by the Ceremonials Division of the Office of the [[Chief of Protocol of the United States]] which lists the ceremonial order, or relative preeminence, for domestic and foreign government officials (military and civilian) at diplomatic, ceremonial, and social events within the United States and abroad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Mel French|title=United States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4P2RuXD0QjwC&pg=PA15|year=2010|page=15ff|isbn=9781442203204}}</ref><ref name=sdregs>{{cite web | first= | last= | authorlink = | title=U.S. State Department Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 2 Section 320 "Precedence" | date= | publisher= | url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/02FAM/02FAM0320.html
