The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best Female Country Vocal Performance''' was first awarded in 1965, to [[Dottie West]]. The award has had several minor name changes:

*From 1965 to 1967 the award was known as '''Best Country & Western Vocal Performance - Female'''
*In 1968 it was awarded as '''Best Country & Western Solo Vocal Performance, Female'''
*From 1969 to 1994 it was awarded as '''Best Country Vocal Performance, Female'''
*From 1995 to 2011 it was awarded as '''Best Female Country Vocal Performance'''

The award was discontinued after 2011 award season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012 to the present, all solo performances (male, female and instrumental) in the country category are recognized in the newly formed '''[[Best Country Solo Performance]]''' category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.
