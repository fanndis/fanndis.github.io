A '''roundel''' is a circular [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]. [[Roundel]]s are among the oldest charges used in [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], dating from the start of the age of heraldry in Europe, ''circa'' 1200–1215. Roundels are typically a solid colour but may be [[charge (heraldry)|charged]] with an item or be any of the [[Tincture _(heraldry)#Furs|furs used in heraldry]]. Roundels are similar to the [[Annulet (heraldry)|annulet]], which some heralds would refer to as a ''false roundel''.<ref name="boutell">{{cite book|last1=Boutell|first1=Charles|title=Heraldry, Ancient and Modern: Including Boutell's Heraldry|date=1890|publisher=F.

== Terms for roundels ==

In some languages, the heraldic roundel has a unique name specific to its [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]], based on the Old French tradition. This is still observed in English-language heraldry, which adopted terms from Old French for specific round items.<ref>{{cite book| last=Fox-Davies | first= Arthur Charles | year=1909 | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | url=https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich/page/151 151] }}</ref> Thus, while a gold roundel may be [[blazon]]ed by its tincture, e.g., ''a roundel or'', it is more often described as a ''bezant'', from the [[Old French language|Old French]] term ''[[bezant|besant]]'' for a gold coin, which itself is named for the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref name="boutell"/>

A ''roundel vert'' ("green roundel") is known as a ''pomme'', the French word for apple. It was frequently pluralised as ''pomeis'' – as in the Heathcote arms: ''Ermine, three pomeis, each charged with a cross or''<ref name="boutell"/> – but ''pommes'' is now more common. The term for a red roundel, ''torteau'', is typically pluralised in the French manner as {{lang|fr|torteaux}} rather than ''torteaus'', although ''torteaus'' is occasionally seen. A ''pellet'' may also be called an ''ogress''.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Thomas |last1=Woodcock |author-link1=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms) |first2=John Martin |last2=Robinson |authorlink2=John Martin Robinson |title=The Oxford Guide to Heraldry |location=Oxford |year=1988 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-211658-4 |page=204 }}</ref>

In modern French blazonry, a roundel of either metal (''[[or (heraldry)|or]]'' or ''[[argent]]'') is a ''besant'', and a roundel of any colour (dark tincture) is a ''torteau'', with the tincture specified. However, an alternate naming system has been used for the non-mental tinctures, with similar terms as English heraldry (''guse'' for ''gules'', ''heurte'' for ''azure'', ''ogoesse'' for ''sable'', ''somme'', ''volet'' or ''pomme'' for ''vert'', and ''gulpe'' for ''purpure''). Archaic names for roundels based on the French tradition are sometimes found in other languages, such as Spanish (see {{lang|es|[[:es:Roel|roel]]}}) and Portuguese (see {{lang|pt|[[:pt:Arruela (heráldica)|arruela]]}})

In German blazonry, the general word for a roundel is {{lang|de|Kugel}} ('ball'); a roundel of silver can also be called {{lang|de|Ball}}, and a roundel of gold {{lang|de|Bille}}.

== Special roundels ==
[[File:Roundel-fountain (traditional).svg|thumb|The classic ''fountain'' with three rows each of ''argent'' and ''azure''.]]
===Fountain===
One special example of a named roundel is the ''[[fountain (heraldry)|fountain]]'', depicted as ''a roundel barry wavy argent and azure'', that is, containing alternating horizontal wavy bands of blue and silver (or white). Because the fountain consists equally of parts in a light and a dark tincture, its use is not limited by the [[rule of tincture]] as are the other roundels.  The traditional fountain in heraldry was a ''barry wavy of six'', that is, with six alternating wavy rows of white and blue.<ref name="boutell"/>

Another name for the fountain is the ''syke'' (Northern English for "well").<ref>{{cite book |last=Fearn |first=Jacqueline |title=Discovering Heraldry |year=1980 |publisher=Shire |page=25 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/syke |title=Scottish National Dictionary of 1700: ''syke'' }}</ref> One of the most well-known and ancient uses of the fountain is in the arms of the [[Baron Stourton|Stourton]] family. Three fountains appear on the arms of [[County Leitrim]], Ireland.

== Semy ==
In their earliest uses, roundels were often strewn or sown as seeds (Latin: ''semen, -inis'', a seed) upon the field of a coat of arms, blazoned as ''[[Variation of the field|semée/semy]]'', an arrangement with numerous varieties. For example, a field ''semy of plates'' (i.e. ''roundels argent'') could be blazoned  ''platy''; a field ''semy of pellets'' (i.e. ''roundels sable'') could be blazoned ''pellety''. The precise number and placement of the roundels in such cases were usually left to the discretion of the artist.
