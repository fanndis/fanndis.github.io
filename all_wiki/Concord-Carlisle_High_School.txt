==Academics==
Class subjects include the normal core subjects of English, mathematics, science and social studies, but a number of elective studies are offered as well, including programming, art, music, and [[photography]].

In social studies or English, a broad course selection is offered. CCHS chooses not to offer AP classes in the humanities in order to allow for a more flexible curriculum, but students may choose to take the AP tests. For students' freshman and sophomore years, they are required to take world cultures and US history respectively, neither of which are levelled classes. The English department offers classes on topics such as rhetoric and debate, [[American literature]], [[British literature]], contemporary literature, world literature and [[African American literature|black literature]]. The social studies department curriculum includes classes on [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]] and 20th century [[United States history]], as well as [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[Major religious groups|world religions]] and Russian history.

Foreign languages offered are [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Educational experiences and trips to other countries include one to [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in 2008, two to [[Prague]] in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Vienna]] in [[Austria]] in 2001 and 2005, a trip which explored the entire length of [[Italy]] from north to south in 2003, and a trip to [[Spain]] in 2004, staying in [[Madrid]] and [[Málaga]]. In 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2014 there were trips to [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. In 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2010 there were trips to [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]], for the Concert Band and the Sci Fi club. There have been trips to [[China]], [[East Timor]] and [[Estonia]].

A trip to Italy for Latin students is regularly offered, as is an exchange program with a private school in Ecuador and an exchange program with Concord's Japanese sister city of [[Nanae, Hokkaido|Nanae]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/concordcarlisle.org/cchseducationaltripsexchanges/past-trips|title=CCHS Educational Trips & Exchanges - Past Trips|website=sites.google.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>

A staple of recognition, the school's old campus had a one-of-a-kind attribute – a giant {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} high purple [[crayon]] covering an exhaust pipe in the middle of the courtyard. Later, a double-rainbow sculpture was added in the memorial of Richard Koch.

==New school building project==
Concord Carlisle High School moved to a brand new, eco-friendly building in mid-April 2015, after almost 18 years of planning.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://lwvcc.org/CCHS_project.html|title=Concord Carlisle High School Project|last=|first=|date=2017-11-13|website=LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CONCORD-CARLISLE, MASSACHUSETTS|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> The old school was built in the 1960s and 1970s, with a one-level "California Layout" that was unsuitable for Massachusetts weather and conditions. Initial approval for the building of the school was granted by the towns of Concord and Carlisle in 2011. The school took around 4 years to build, and is situated directly behind where the former CCHS building once stood. The entire project cost $93 million.

Interesting features of the new school include a 600-seat auditorium, a black box theater, 2 attached gyms, a 'media wall' consisting of 24 flat-screen televisions in the cafeteria, and another display in the lobby which lists water usage and air quality facts about the building in real time. The new building also includes many updated safety features that the old building lacked, including fewer exits and entrances, and automated doors with security cameras and alarms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fenn Lefferts|first1=Jennifer|last2=Gavin|first2=Christopher|title=Concord-Carlisle High set to open|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/west/2015/04/23/concord-carlisle-high-set-open/Mjo68ojQz9OPAYYSsgUH7I/story.html|website=The Boston Globe|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref>
