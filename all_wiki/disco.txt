'''Disco''' is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[dance music]] and a [[subculture]] that emerged in the 1970s from the [[United States]]' urban [[nightclub|nightlife]] scene. Its sound is typified by [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beats, [[syncopation|syncopated]] basslines, [[string section]]s, horns, [[electric piano]], [[synthesizer]]s, and electric [[rhythm guitar]]s.

Well-known disco artists include [[Donna Summer]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Boney M.]], [[Earth Wind & Fire]], the [[Bee Gees]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[The Trammps]], the [[Village People]], and [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-best-disco-songs-of-all-time-20120523|title=Readers' Poll: The Best Disco Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone|date=May 23, 2012|access-date=March 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105849/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-best-disco-songs-of-all-time-20120523|archive-date=March 20, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blackmusicscholar.com/michael-jackson-disco-era/|title=Michael Jackson: Disco Era|date=2017-11-28|website=Black Music Scholar|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607162419/https://blackmusicscholar.com/michael-jackson-disco-era/|archive-date=June 7, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> While performers garnered public attention, [[record producer]]s working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. Films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) and ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.

Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with [[African-American culture|African Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Culture|Hispanic and Latino Americans]], [[Italian Americans]],<ref name="Italian">Shapiro, Peter. "Turn the Beat Around: The Rise and Fall of Disco", Macmillan, 2006. p.204–206: "'Broadly speaking, the typical New York discothèque DJ is young (between 18 and 30) and Italian,' journalist Vince Lettie declared in 1975.

Disco can be seen as a reaction by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] to both the dominance of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco's popularity in the United States, including "the [[Bump (dance)|Bump]]" and "the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]".

By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs such as [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]], a venue popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Discothèque-goers often wore expensive, extravagant, and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]] in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[Quaaludes]], the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed "disco biscuits". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]] as a reflection of the [[sexual revolution]] of this era in popular history.

Disco was the last popular music movement driven by [[baby boomers]], peaking in popularity during the mid-late 1970s. It declined as a major trend in popular music during the late 1970s to early 1980s, but remained a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]], [[house music]], [[hip-hop]], [[New wave music|new wave]], and [[post-disco]]. While no new disco movement has dominated popular music since its decline, the style has had several revivals since the 1990s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. 

==Etymology==
The term "disco" is shorthand for the word ''discothèque'', a French word for "library of phonograph records" derived from "bibliothèque". The word "discothèque" had the same meaning in English in the 1950s.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|title=The birth of disco|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|date=October 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416163030/http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|archive-date=April 16, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

"Discothèque" became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris, France, after these had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960, it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.<ref name=Oxford />

In the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called "discotheque dress" was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form "disco" described this dress and has been found in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' on July 12, 1964, but ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.<ref name=Oxford />

Vince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the feature article "Discotheque Rock Paaaaarty" that appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in September 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1072|title=Playing favourites: Vince Aletti|website=Resident Advisor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/20/paul-morley-disco|title=Paul Morley's showing off ...

==Musical characteristics==
[[File:Characteristic disco bass rhythm.PNG|Disco bass pattern. {{audio|Characteristic disco bass rhythm.mid|Play}}|thumb|upright=1.15]]
[[File:Characteristic rock and disco drum patterns.png|Rock & disco drum patterns: disco features greater [[divisive rhythm|subdivision]] of the beat, which is [[Four-on-the-floor (dance)|four-to-the-floor]] {{audio|Characteristic disco drum pattern.mid|Play}}|thumb|upright=1.15]]

The music typically layered soaring, often-[[reverb]]erated vocals, often doubled by horns, over a background "pad" of [[electric piano]]s and "chicken-scratch" [[rhythm guitar]]s played on an [[electric guitar]]. [[Lead guitar]] features less frequently in disco than in [[Rock music|rock]]. "The "chicken scratch" sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Beginners/en-us/What-the-Funk-!-How-to-Get-That-James-Brown-Sound.aspx|title=What the Funk?! How to Get That James Brown Sound|website=Gibson.com|accessdate=27 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045402/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Beginners/en-us/What-the-Funk-!-How-to-Get-That-James-Brown-Sound.aspx|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other backing keyboard instruments include the [[piano]], [[electric organ]] (during early years), [[string synthesizer]]s, and electromechanical keyboards such as the [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano, [[Wurlitzer]] electric piano, and Hohner [[Clavinet]]. Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.

The [[rhythm section|rhythm]] is laid down by prominent, syncopated [[bassline]]s (with heavy use of broken [[octave]]s, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]. The sound was enriched with solo lines and [[harmony part]]s played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]], string section or a full [[string orchestra]].

Most disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the [[rhythm guitar]] and may be implied rather than explicitly present.

Songs often use [[syncopation]], which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the [[bass drum]] hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.

The orchestral sound is usually known as "disco sound" relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background "pad" sound defining the [[chord progression|harmony progression]]. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich "[[wall of sound]]". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by Chic.

Harmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords, which are found more often in jazz than pop music.

==Production==
The "disco sound" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of [[funk]], [[soul music]] of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of "[[classical music|classical]]" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).

Disco songs were [[Arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[Orchestration|orchestrators]], and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using [[multitrack recording]] techniques and [[effects unit]]s. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, record producers, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and [[Break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the "disco sound" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated [[disco mix]].

Early records were the "standard" three-minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl [[single (music)|singles]] of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five&nbsp;minutes of good-quality music. With the help of José Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10" disc instead of 7". They cut the next single on a 12" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. [[Twelve-inch single|12" single records]], also known as "[[Maxi single]]s", quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|title=DISCO History @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121160210/http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|archive-date=January 21, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Club culture==
===Nightclubs===

By the late 1970s most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were most notably in [[New York City]] but also in [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and private [[loft]] parties.

In the 1970s, notable discos included "[[Crisco Disco]]", "The Sanctuary", "Leviticus", "[[Studio 54]]" and "[[Paradise Garage]]" in New York, "Artemis" in Philadelphia, "Studio One" in Los Angeles, "Dugan's Bistro" in Chicago, and "The Library" in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|title=Once a Hot Disco, Now a Cool Opportunity – Philadelphia Magazine|date=May 18, 2016|website=Phillymag.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028004100/http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|archive-date=October 28, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Disco197510/>

In the late '70s, Studio 54 in [[Midtown Manhattan]] was arguably the best known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general. It was operated by [[Steve Rubell]] and [[Ian Schrager]] and was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the "[[Man in the Moon]]" that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].

The "[[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]", another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a [[Barry Manilow]] [[Copacabana (At the Copa)|song of the same name]].

In [[Washington, D.C.]], large disco clubs such as "The Pier" ("Pier 9") and "The Other Side," originally regarded exclusively as "[[Gay bar|gay bars,"]] became particularly popular among the capital area's gay and straight college students in the late '70s.

===Sound and light equipment===
[[File:Dance floor 2 by harmon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Major disco clubs had lighted dance floors, with the lights flashing to complement the beat.]]
[[File:ZMF 2015 IMGP 0000.jpg|thumb|The reflective light [[disco ball]] was a fixture on the ceilings of many discothèques.]]
Powerful, bass-heavy, [[hi-fi]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. "Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of [[subwoofer]]s positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade [[sound engineer]]s such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage."<ref name="timlawrence.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.timlawrence.info/articles2/2013/7/16/beyond-the-hustle-seventies-social-dancing-discotheque-culture-and-the-emergence-of-the-contemporary-club-dancer|title="Beyond the Hustle: Seventies Social Dancing, Discotheque Culture and the Emergence of the Contemporary Club Dancer".

Typical lighting designs for disco dance floors could include multi-coloured lights that swirl around or flash to the beat, [[strobe light]], an [[illuminated dance floor]] and a [[Disco ball|mirror ball]].

===DJs===
Disco-era [[disc jockey]]s (DJs) would often remix existing songs using [[reel-to-reel tape recorder|reel-to-reel tape machines]], and add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a [[DJ mixer]] and using a [[microphone]] to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as [[reverb]], equalization, and echo [[effects unit]]. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include [[Francis Grasso]] of The Sanctuary, [[David Mancuso]] of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], [[Frankie Knuckles]] of the Chicago [[Warehouse (nightclub)|Warehouse]], [[Larry Levan]] of the [[Paradise Garage]], [[Nicky Siano]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[Karen Mixon Cook]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[John "Jellybean" Benitez]], Richie Kulala of [[Studio 54]] and Rick Salsalini.

Some DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the [[recording studio]]. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific [[record producer]] as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in leading nightclubs, DJs were also influential for the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.

===Dance===
[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura162.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Disco dancers typically wore loose slacks for men and flowing dresses for women, which enabled ease of movement on the dance floor.]]
In the early years, dancers in discos danced in a "hang loose" or "freestyle" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the "Bump", "Penguin", "Boogaloo", "Watergate" and "Robot". By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|the Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].<ref name="Disco197510">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&pg=840,3518488&dq=disco+music&hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975</ref>

During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as "touch dancing", "the hustle", and "[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]]". The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book ''The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing'' (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book topped the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.

In Chicago, the ''Step By Step'' disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that [[Don Cornelius]] used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''Step by Step'''s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show aired on Saturday mornings and had a strong following. The viewers of this would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as "Disco Night at White Sox Park".

In Sacramento, California, Disco King Paul Dale Roberts danced for the Guinness Book of World Records. Roberts danced for 205 hours which is the equivalent of 8 ½ days. Other dance marathons took place after Roberts held the world's record for disco dancing for a short period of time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Former Pocket area resident was Sacto's "disco king" {{!}} Valley Community Newspapers, Inc.|url=https://www.valcomnews.com/former-pocket-area-resident-was-sacto%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cdisco-king%E2%80%9D/|access-date=2020-08-14|website=www.valcomnews.com}}</ref>

Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn [[Reality TV|dance competition TV shows]] such as ''[[Dance Fever]]'' (1979).

===Fashion===
[[File:Fotothek df n-15 0000413 Disko.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Dancers at an East German discothèque in 1977]]
Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore glamorous, expensive, and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as [[Halston]] dresses or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless [[halter top]]s, [[disco pants]], "hot pants", or body-hugging [[spandex]] bodywear or "catsuits".<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|title=Disco Fashion: That's the way They Liked It|website=The Ultimate History Project|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006032157/http://ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Men would wear shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore [[Pierre Cardin]] suits, [[three piece suit]]s with a vest and [[Double knitting|double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the [[leisure suit]]. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted in some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom, but the lower part of the pants were flared in a [[bell bottom]] style, to permit freedom of movement.<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/>

During the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, both activities that would have been considered "feminine" according to the gender stereotypes of the era.<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/> Women dancers wore [[glitter]] makeup, [[sequin]]s, or [[gold lamé]] clothing that would shimmer under the lights.<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/> Bold colors were popular for both genders. [[Platform shoe]]s and boots for both genders and [[high heel]]s for women were popular footwear.<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/> [[Necklace]]s and [[medal]]lions were a common [[fashion accessory]]. Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]], covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups were more likely to be seen at invitation-only [[New York City]] loft parties and disco clubs.<ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/>

===Drug subculture===

In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving [[club drug]] [[subculture]], particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud, bass-heavy music and the flashing colored lights, such as [[cocaine]]<ref name="ReferenceA">Gootenberg, Paul 1954–

===Eroticism and sexual liberation===
According to [[Peter Braunstein]], the "massive quantities of [[drug]]s ingested in discothèques produced the next [[cultural phenomenon]] of the disco era: rampant [[promiscuity]] and [[public sex]]. While the dance floor was the central arena of [[seduction]], actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit [[stairwell]]s, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out."<ref name=r1/> At [[The Saint (club)|The Saint]] nightclub, a high percentage of the [[gay male]] dancers and patrons would have sex in the club; they typically had [[Safe sex|unprotected sex]], because in 1980, [[HIV-AIDS]] had not yet been identified.<ref name="Tim Lawrence 2011">Tim Lawrence.

In his paper, "In Defense of Disco" (1979), [[Richard Dyer]] claims [[eroticism]] as one of the three main characteristics of disco.<ref name="Dyer">Richard Dyer: "In Defense of Disco." In: Gay Left, 8, Summer 1979, pp. 20-23. Reprinted in: Mark J. Butler (ed): Electronica, Dance and Club Music. New York/London: Routledge 2017, pp. 121-127.</ref> As opposed to [[rock music]] which has a very [[Phallocentrism|phallic centered]] eroticism focusing on the sexual pleasure of men over other persons, Dyer describes disco as featuring a non-phallic full body eroticism.<ref name="Dyer"/> Through a range of percussion instruments, a willingness to play with rhythm, and the endless repeating of phrases without cutting the listener off, disco achieved this full body eroticism by restoring eroticism to the whole body for both sexes.<ref name="Dyer"/> This allowed for the potential expression of sexualities not defined by the cock/penis, and the erotic pleasure of bodies that are not defined by a relationship to a penis.<ref name="Dyer"/> The sexual liberation expressed through the rhythm of disco is further represented in the club spaces that disco grew within.

In [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]]'s ''[[Modulations: A History of Electronic Music]]: Throbbing Words on Sound'', he discusses eroticism through the technology disco utilizes to create it's audacious sound.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Modulations : a history of electronic music : throbbing words on sound |year=2000 |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |isbn=1-891024-06-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap/page/40 40]–49 |url=https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap|url-access=registration }}</ref> The music, Shapiro states, is adjunct to "the pleasure-is-politics ethos of post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] culture." He explains how "mechano-eroticism," which links the technology used to create the unique mechanical sound of disco to eroticism, sets the genre in a new dimension of reality living outside of naturalism and heterosexuality.

He uses Donna Summer's singles "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" (1975) and "[[I Feel Love]]" (1977) as examples of the ever present relationship between the synthesized bass lines and backgrounds to the simulated sounds of orgasms Summers echoes in the tracks, and likens them to the drug-fervent, sexually liberated fans of disco who sought to free themselves through disco's "aesthetic of machine sex."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Modulations : a history of electronic music : throbbing words on sound |date=2000 |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |isbn=1-891024-06-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap/page/44 44] |url=https://archive.org/details/modulationshisto00shap|url-access=registration }}</ref> Shapiro sees this as an influence that creates sub-genres like [[hi-NRG]] and [[Dub music|dub]]-disco, which allowed for eroticism and technology to be further explored through intense synth bass lines and alternative rhythmic techniques that tap into the entire body rather than the obvious erotic parts of the body.

The New York nightclub The Sanctuary under resident DJ [[Francis Grasso]] is a prime example of this sexual liberty. In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, [[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as "poured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality."<ref name="Brewster_Disco">Bill Brewster/Frank Broughton: ''Last Night a DJ Saved my Life: The History of the Disc Jockey.'' London: Headline 1999, pp. 136-148.</ref> The Sanctuary was the "first totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America" and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, the bathrooms and the hallwasy of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy like sexual engagements.<ref name="Brewster_Disco"/>

By describing the music, drugs and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. This supports the argument that the disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. Further, this coupled with the recent legalization of abortions, the introduction of antibiotics and the pill all facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment fostering a very sex positive framework around discotheques.<ref name="Brewster_Disco"/> Given that at this time all instances of oral and anal gay sex were considered deviant and illegal acts in New York state, this sexual freedom can be considered quite liberatory and resistant to dominant oppressive structures.<ref name="Brewster_Disco"/>

Further, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] classified homosexuality as an illness.<ref name="Brewster_Disco"/> This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. David Mancuso's club/house party, [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], was described as having a "[[pansexual]] attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually carried bail money with them."<ref name="Brewster_Disco"/>

==History==
===First discotheques===
Disco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band. The first discotheques mostly played [[swing music]]. Later on uptempo [[rhythm and blues]] became popular in American clubs and [[northern soul]] and [[glam rock]] records in the UK.

In the early 1940s nightclubs in Paris resorted to playing (jazz) records during the Nazi occupation.<ref name=Oxford />

[[Régine Zylberberg]] claimed to have started the first discotheque and to have been the first club DJ in 1953 in the "Whisky à Go-Go" in Paris. She installed a dance floor with coloured lights and two turntables so she could play records without having a gap in the music.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoK1CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA176|title=The History of Live Music in Britain, Volume I: 1950-1967: From Dance Hall to the 100 Club|first1=Simon|last1=Frith|first2=Matt|last2=Brennan|first3=Emma|last3=Webster|date=March 9, 2016|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|isbn=9781317028871}}</ref>

In October 1959 the owner of the [[Scotch Club]] in [[Aachen|Aachen, West Germany]] chose to install a record player for the opening night instead of hiring a live band. The patrons were unimpressed until a young reporter, who happened to be covering the opening of the club, impulsively took control of the record player and introduced the records that he chose to play. Klaus Quirini later claimed to thus have been the world's first nightclub DJ.<ref name=Oxford />

Discotheque dancing became a European trend that was enthusiastically picked up by the American press.<ref name=Oxford />

The birth of disco is often claimed to be found in the private dance parties held by New York City DJ David Mancuso's home that became known as [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], an invitation-only non-commercial underground club that inspired many others.<ref name=NYT>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/10/arts/arts-in-america-here-s-to-disco-it-never-could-say-goodbye.html |title=ARTS IN AMERICA; Here's to Disco, It Never Could Say Goodbye |work=The New York Times, USA |date=December 10, 2002 |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106064333/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/10/arts/arts-in-america-here-s-to-disco-it-never-could-say-goodbye.html |archive-date=November 6, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He organized the first major party in his Manhattan home on Valentine's Day 1970 with the name "Love Saves The Day".

=== Timeframe and social context for the rise of disco culture in New York ===
In the 1970s, the key [[counterculture of the 1960s]], the hippie movement, was fading away. The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of race riots, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy and the [[Watergate]] scandal left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless. The start of the '70s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Peter |title=Turn the Beat Around: the Secret History of Disco |url=https://archive.org/details/turnbeataround00pete |date=2005 |publisher=Faber |location=London}}</ref>

In ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture'', [[Simon Frith]] highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. "The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie", he says. "The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria."<ref>Alan McKee, ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture''. John Wiley & Sons, April 15, 2008, p.196</ref>

When Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the [[gay community]] (which made up much of The Loft's attendee roster) was often harassed in the [[gay bar|gay bars and dance clubs]], with many gay men carrying bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private [[discotheque]]s, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, policies. [[Vince Aletti]] described it "like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else," and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying "It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life|last1=Brewster|first1=Bill|last2=Broughton|first2=Frank|publisher=Headline Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=120–122}}</ref>

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the popular embrace of disco's exuberant dance moves an escape from "the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachrock.org/lesson/the-rise-of-disco/|title=The Rise of Disco|publisher=teachrock.org|accessdate=June 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618001058/http://teachrock.org/lesson/the-rise-of-disco|archive-date=June 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Pauline Kael]], writing about the disco-themed film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', said the film and disco itself touched on "something deeply romantic, the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you'd like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary."<ref>Pauline Kael, ''For Keeps'', Dutton, 1994, p. 767</ref>

===1960s–1974: Proto-disco and early history of disco music===
During the 1960s, when the discotheque culture from Europe became popular in the United States, several music genres with dance-able rhythms rose to popularity and evolved into different sub-genres: [[rhythm and blues]] (originated in the 1940s), [[Soul (music)|soul]] (late 1950s and 1960s), funk (mid-1960s) and [[go-go]] (mid-1960s and 1970s; more than "disco", the word "go-go" originally indicated a music club). Those genres, mainly African-American ones, would influence much of early disco music.

During the 1960s, the Motown record label developed a popular and influential [[Motown sound|own sound]], described as having "1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were half way between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-motown-story-19710513|title=The Motown Story|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> Motown had many hits with early disco elements by acts like [[the Supremes]] (for instance "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]" in 1966), [[Stevie Wonder]] (for instance "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" in 1972), [[The Jackson 5]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]] ("[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']]" in 1973).

In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, [[Philadelphia soul]] and [[New York soul]] developed as sub-genres that also had lavish [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], lush [[string orchestra]] arrangements and expensive record production processes.

At the end of the 1960s, musicians and audiences from the Black, Italian and Latino communities adopted several traits from the [[hippie]] and [[psychedelia]] subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, and the use of [[hallucinogenic]] drugs.<ref name="Partylikeits1975">[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It's 1975] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130151059/http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 |date=January 30, 2015 }}.

Partly through the success of [[Jimi Hendrix]], psychedelic elements that were popular in rock music of the late 1960s found their way into soul and early funk music and formed the subgenre [[psychedelic soul]]. Examples can be found in the music of [[the Chambers Brothers]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] with his [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective, [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and the productions of [[Norman Whitfield]] with [[The Temptations]].

The long instrumental introductions and detailed orchestration found in psychedelic soul tracks by the Temptations are also considered as [[cinematic soul]]. In the early 1970s, [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Isaac Hayes]] scored hits with cinematic soul songs that were actually composed for movie soundtracks: "[[Superfly (song)|Superfly]]" (1972) and "[[Theme from Shaft]]" (1971). The latter is sometimes regarded as an early disco song.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hotstuffdiscorem00echo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hotstuffdiscorem00echo/page/24 24]|quote=shaft disco.|title=Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture|first=Alice|last=Echols|date=29 March 2010|publisher=W.

Psychedelic soul influenced proto-disco acts such as [[Willie Hutch]] and Philadelphia soul.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} Psychedelic Soul Allmusic]</ref>

In the early 1970s, the Philadelphia soul productions by [[Gamble and Huff]] evolved from the simpler arrangements of the late-1960s into a style featuring lush strings, thumping basslines, and sliding hi-hat rhythms. These elements would become typical for disco music and are found in several of the hits they produced in the early 1970s:
*"[[Love Train]]" by [[the O'Jays]] (with M.F.S.B. as the backup band) was released in 1972 and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in March 1973
*"[[The Love I Lost]]" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]] (1973)
*"[[Now That We Found Love]]" by [[The O'Jays]] (1973), later a hit for [[Third World (band)|Third World]] in 1978.
*"[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]" by [[MFSB]] with vocals by [[The Three Degrees]], a wordless song written as the theme for ''[[Soul Train]]'' and a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1974.

Other early disco tracks that helped shape disco and became popular on the dance floors of (underground) discotheque clubs and parties include: 
* "[[Soul Makossa]]" by [[Manu Dibango]] was first released in France in 1972. It was picked up by the underground disco scene in New York and subsequently got a proper release in the U.S., reaching #35 on Billboard Hot 100 in 1973.
* "[[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|The Night]]" by [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] was released in 1972, but was not immediately popular. It appealed to the [[Northern soul]] scene and became a hit in the UK in 1975.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* "[[Love's Theme]]" by [[Barry White]]'s [[the Love Unlimited Orchestra]], an instrumental song from their album ''[[Rhapsody in White]]'' reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 early in 1974.
* "[[Jungle Fever (song)|Jungle Fever]]" by [[The Chakachas]] was first released in Belgium in 1971, was later released in the U.S. in 1972, where it reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 that same year.
* "[[Girl You Need a Change of Mind]]" by [[Eddie Kendricks]] was released in May 1972, on the album [[People ... Hold On]].

Early disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as [[Salsoul Records]] (Ken, Stanley, and [[Joseph Cayre]]), [[West End Records]] ([[Mel Cheren]]), [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] (Neil Bogart), and [[Prelude Records (record label)|Prelude]] (Marvin Schlachter), to name a few. The genre was also shaped by [[Tom Moulton]], who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs — thus creating the extended mix or "[[remix]]", going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12" record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the "disco sound" included David Mancuso, [[Nicky Siano]], [[Shep Pettibone]], [[Larry Levan]], [[Walter Gibbons]], and Chicago-based [[Frankie Knuckles]]. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.

Disco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show ''Soul Train'' in 1971 hosted by [[Don Cornelius]], then [[Marty Angelo]]'s ''[[Disco Step-by-Step Television Show]]'' in 1975, Steve Marcus' ''Disco Magic/Disco 77'', Eddie Rivera's ''Soap Factory'', and [[Merv Griffin]]'s ''[[Dance Fever]]'', hosted by [[Deney Terrio]], who is credited with teaching actor [[John Travolta]] to dance for his role in the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', as well as DANCE, based out of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].

In 1974, New York City's [[WPIX-FM]] premiered the first disco radio show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discosavvy.com/discoearly70s.html|title=The First Years of Disco (1972-1974)|website=discosavvy.com|access-date=2019-06-18|quote=In November 1974, WPIX FM launched the world's first disco radio show, "Disco 102", hosted by Steve Andrews for 4 hours every Saturday night.}}</ref>

==== Disco culture in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1970s ====
In the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] scene and formed the [[northern soul]] movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent) and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as [[Little Anthony & the Imperials]] and [[Jackie Wilson]].

In 1974, there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events. [[Glam rock]] tracks were popular, with for example [[Gary Glitter]]'s 1972 single "[[Rock and Roll Part 2]]" becoming popular on UK dance floors while it did not get any radio airplay.<ref>Reynolds, Simon (2016).

In the northwestern sections of the United Kingdom, the [[northern soul]] explosion, which started in the late 1960s and peaked in 1974, made the region receptive to disco, which the region's disc jockeys were bringing back from New York City. The shift by some DJs to the newer sounds coming from the U.S.A. resulted in a split in the scene, whereby some abandoned the 1960s soul and pushed a modern soul sound which tended to be more closely aligned with disco than soul.

[[File:Gloria Gaynor (1976).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|[[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1976]]
In 1975, [[Gloria Gaynor]] released her first side-long [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] [[album]], which included a remake of [[the Jackson 5]]'s "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]" (which, in fact, is also the [[Never Can Say Goodbye (Gloria Gaynor album)|album title]]) and two other songs, "Honey Bee" and her disco version of "[[Reach Out I'll Be There|Reach Out (I'll Be There)]]", first topped the Billboard disco/dance charts in November 1974. Later in 1978, Gaynor's number-one disco song was "[[I Will Survive]]", which was seen as a symbol of female strength and a gay anthem,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hubbs|first=Nadine|date=May 1, 2007|title='I Will Survive': musical mappings of queer social space in a disco anthem|url=https://zenodo.org/record/854793|journal=Popular Music|volume=26|issue=2|pages=231–244|doi=10.1017/S0261143007001250|via=Cambridge Core|access-date=September 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142529/https://zenodo.org/record/854793/files/article.pdf|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> like her further disco hit, a 1983 remake of "[[I Am What I Am (Broadway musical song)|I Am What I Am]]"; in 1979 she released "[[Let Me Know (I Have a Right)]]", a single which gained popularity in the civil rights movements. Also in 1975, [[Vincent Montana Jr.]]'s [[Salsoul Orchestra]] contributed with their Latin-flavored orchestral dance song "Salsoul Hustle", reaching number four on the Billboard Dance Chart and their 1976 hits "[[Tangerine (1941 song)|Tangerine]]" and "Nice 'n' Naasty", the first being a cover of a 1941 song.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Songs such as [[Van McCoy]]'s 1975 "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" and the humorous [[Joe Tex]] 1977 "[[Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)]]" gave names to the popular disco dances "the Bump" and "the Hustle". Other notable early successful disco songs include [[Barry White]]'s "[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]" (1974), [[Labelle]]'s "[[Lady Marmalade]]" (1974), [[Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes]]' "[[Get Dancin']]" (1974), [[Silver Convention]]'s "[[Fly, Robin, Fly]]" (1975) and "[[Get Up and Boogie (song)|Get Up and Boogie]]" (1976) and [[Johnnie Taylor|Johnny Taylor]]'s "[[Disco Lady]]" (1976).

Formed by [[Harry Wayne Casey]] (a.k.a. "KC") and [[Richard Finch (musician)|Richard Finch]], Miami's [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] had a string of disco-definitive top-five singles between 1975 and 1977, including "[[Get Down Tonight]]", "[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]", "[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]", "[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]" and "[[Keep It Comin' Love]]". In this period, rock bands like the English [[Electric Light Orchestra]] featured in their songs a violin sound that became a staple of disco music, as in the 1975 hit "[[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]", although the genre was correctly described as [[Progressive rock|orchestral rock]].

Other disco producers such as [[Tom Moulton]] took ideas and techniques from [[dub music]] (which came with the increased [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the "four on the floor" style that dominated. DJ Larry Levan utilized styles from [[Dub music|dub]] and [[jazz]] and remixing techniques to create early versions of [[house music]] that sparked the genre.<ref>{{cite book

====Motown turning disco (early to late 1970s)==== 

[[Norman Whitfield]] was an influential producer and songwriter at [[Motown records]], renowned for creating innovative "[[psychedelic soul]]" songs with many hits for [[Marvin Gaye]], [[the Velvelettes]], [[the Temptations]] and [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]]. From around the production of the Temptations' album ''[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations album)|Cloud Nine]]'' in 1968, he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer, dance-friendly tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. An example of such a long psychedelic soul track is "[[Papa Was a Rollin' Stone]]", which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12" version in 1972. By the early 70s, many of Whitfield's productions evolved more and more towards [[funk]] and disco, as heard on albums by [[the Undisputed Truth]] and the 1973 album ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]'' by [[The Jackson 5]]. [[The Undisputed Truth]], a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]". Their disco single "You + Me = Love" (number 43) was produced by Whitfield and made number 2 on the [[Dance Club Songs|US Dance Charts]] in 1976 . 

In 1975, Whitfield left Motown and founded his own label [[Whitfield records]], on which also "You + Me = Love" was released. Whitfield produced some more disco hits, including "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]" (1976) by [[Rose Royce]] from the [[Car Wash: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|album soundtrack]] to the 1976 film [[Car Wash (film)|''Car Wash'']]. In 1977, singer, songwriter and producer [[Willie Hutch]], who had been signed to Motown since 1970, now signed with Whitfield's new label, and scored a successful disco single with his song [[In and Out (Willie Hutch song)|"In and Out"] in 1982.
 
[[File:Diana Ross 1976.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Diana Ross in 1976]]
Other Motown artists turned to disco as well. [[Diana Ross]] embraced the disco sound with her successful 1976 outing "[[Love Hangover]]" from her self-titled album. Her 1980 dance classics "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]" and "[[I'm Coming Out]]" were written and produced by [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of the group [[Chic]]. [[The Supremes]], the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976's "[[I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking]]" and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's "You're My Driving Wheel".

At the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, [[Marvin Gaye]] released "[[Got to Give It Up]]" in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre, and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye's songs have disco elements, including "[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]]" (1975). [[Stevie Wonder]] released the disco single "[[Sir Duke]]" in 1977 as a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], the influential [[jazz]] legend who had died in 1974. [[Smokey Robinson]] left the Motown group [[the Miracles]] for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album ''[[A Quiet Storm]]'' in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the "[[Quiet Storm]]" musical programming format and subgenre of R&B. It contained the disco single "[[Baby That's Backatcha]]". Other Motown artists who scored disco hits include: Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with [[Love Machine (The Miracles song)|"Love Machine"]] (1975), [[Eddie Kendricks]] with [[Keep on Truckin' (song)|"Keep On Truckin'"]] (1973), [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]] with "[[Down to Love Town]]" (1976) and [[Thelma Houston]] with her cover of the [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] song "[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]" (1976). The label continued to release successful disco songs into the 1980s with [[Rick James]]' "[[Super Freak]]" (1981), and the [[Commodores]]' "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]" (1981).

Several of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. [[Mary Wells]], Motown's first female superstar with her signature song "[[My Guy]]" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song [[Gigolo (Mary Wells song)|"Gigolo"]] in 1980. [[Jimmy Ruffin]], the elder brother of [[the Temptations]] lead singer [[David Ruffin]], was also signed to Motown, and released his most successful and well-known song "[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song "[[Hold On (To My Love)]]", which was written and produced by [[Robin Gibb]] of the Bee Gees, for his album ''[[Sunrise (Jimmy Ruffin album)|Sunrise]]''. [[Edwin Starr]], known for his Motown protest song "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, "[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|Contact]]" and "[[H.A.P.P.Y. Radio (song)|H.A.P.P.Y. Radio]]". [[Kiki Dee]] became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, ''Great Expectations'' (1970), and two singles "The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday" (1970) and "Love Makes the World Go Round" (1971), the latter giving her first ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with [[Elton John]]'s [[The Rocket Record Company]], and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, "[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with [[Tammi Terrell]] and [[Kim Weston]]. 

Many Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. [[The Jackson 5]], one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s, left the record company in 1975 ([[Jermaine Jackson]], however, remained with the label) after successful songs like "[[I Want You Back]]" (1969) and "[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]" (1970), and even the disco song "[[Dancing Machine]]" (1974). Renamed as 'the Jacksons' (as Motown owned the name 'the Jackson 5'), they went on to find success with disco songs like "Blame It on the Boogie" (1978), "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]" (1979) and "Can You Feel It?" (1981) on the Epic label. The Jacksons' former lead singer, [[Michael Jackson]], who had also released many successful solo singles under the Motown label, like [[Got to Be There (song)|"Got To Be There"]] (1971), [[Ben (song)|"Ben"]] (1972) and a cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s [[Rockin' Robin (song)|"Rockin' Robin"]] (1972), went on to score hits in the disco genre with "[[Rock with You]]" (1979), "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]" (1979) and "[[Billie Jean]]" (1983) for [[Epic Records]].

[[The Isley Brothers]], whose short tenure at the company had produced the song "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like [[That Lady (song)|"That Lady"]] (1973) and "[[It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)]]" (1979). [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]], who recorded the most successful version of "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as "Baby, Don't Change Your Mind" (1977) and "Bourgie, Bourgie" (1980) in the disco era. [[The Detroit Spinners]] were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song "[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow [[Detroit]] native [[Aretha Franklin]], to [[Atlantic Records]], and there had disco songs like "[[The Rubberband Man]]" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's "[[Are You Ready for Love]]", as well as a medley of [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]' song "[[Working My Way Back to You]]" and [[Michael Zager|Michael Zager's]] "Forgive Me, Girl". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, ''[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]'' (1972) – to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, [[The Night (Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song)|"The Night"]], was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the [[Northern Soul]] circuit, reached number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song "[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]" (1975) for [[Warner Curb Records]].

By far the most successful Euro disco act was [[ABBA]] (1972–1982). This Swedish quartet, which sang primarily in English, found success with singles such as "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" (1974), "[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]" (1976), "[[Take a Chance on Me]]" (1978), "[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]" (1979), and their signature smash hit "[[Dancing Queen]]" (1976)—ranks as the [[List of best-selling music artists|Fourth best-selling act of all time]].

In 1970s [[Munich|Munich, West Germany]], music producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] made a decisive contribution to disco music with a string of hits for [[Donna Summer]], which became known as the "Munich Sound".<ref name="munichsound">{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Ahlers |editor2-first=Christoph |editor2-last=Jacke | first=Thomas| last= Krettenauer| year=2017 | title=Perspectives on German Popular Music |chapter=Hit Men: Giorgio Moroder, Frank Farian and the eurodisco sound of the 1970s/80s| edition= | publisher=[[Routledge]] | location= London| pages=77–78| isbn= 978-1-4724-7962-4}}</ref> In 1975, Summer suggested the lyric "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" to Moroder and Bellotte, who turned the lyric into a full disco song. The final product, which contained a series of simulated [[orgasm]]s, initially was not intended for release, but when Moroder played it in the clubs it caused a sensation and he released it. The song became an international hit, reaching the charts in many European countries and the US (No. 2). It has been described as the arrival of the expression of raw female sexual desire in pop music. A 17-minute [[12-inch single]] was released. The 12" single became and remains a standard in discos today.<ref name="mixmag_moroder">{{cite web| first=Bill|last=Brewster|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/i-feel-love-donna-summer-and-giorgio-moroder-created-the-template-for-dance-music-as-we-know-it |title=I feel love: Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder created the template for dance music as we know it | publisher=[[Mixmag]] |date=June 22, 2017 |accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/donna-summer-was-the-queen-who-made-disco-work-on-the-radio/story-fnb64oi6-1226360052284|title=Subscribe – theaustralian|website=theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=June 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521034952/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/donna-summer-was-the-queen-who-made-disco-work-on-the-radio/story-fnb64oi6-1226360052284|archive-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1976 Donna Summer's version of "[[Could It Be Magic]]" brought disco further into the mainstream. In 1977 Summer, Moroder and Bellotte further released "[[I Feel Love]]", as the B-side of "Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)", which revolutionized dance music with its mostly [[Electronic music|electronic]] production and was a massive worldwide success, spawning the [[Hi-NRG]] subgenre.<ref name="mixmag_moroder" /> Giorgio Moroder was described by [[AllMusic]] as "one of the principal architects of the disco sound".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23915|pure_url=yes}} Giorgio Moroder] Allmusic.com</ref> Another successful disco music project by Moroder at that time was [[Munich Machine]] (1976–1980).

[[Boney M.]] (1974–1986) was a West German disco group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by record producer [[Frank Farian]]. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]" (1976) "[[Ma Baker]]" (1977) and "[[Rivers Of Babylon]]" (1978). Another successful West German disco recording act was [[Silver Convention]] (1974–1979). The German group [[Kraftwerk]] also had an influence on Euro disco. 

In France, [[Dalida]] released "[[J'attendrai]]" ("I Will Wait") in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe and Japan. [[Dalida]] successfully adjusted herself to disco era and released at least a dozen of songs that charted among top number 10 in whole Europe and wider. [[Claude François]], who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released "La plus belle chose du monde", a French version of the Bee Gees song "[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]", which became successful in Canada and Europe and "Alexandrie Alexandra" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. [[Cerrone]]'s early songs, "Love in C Minor" (1976), "[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]" (1977) and "Give Me Love" (1978) were successful in the US and Europe. Another Euro disco act was the French diva [[Amanda Lear]], where Euro disco sound is most heard in "[[Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)]]" (1978). French producer [[Alec R. Costandinos|Alec Costandinos]] assembled the disco group [[Love & Kisses|Love and Kisses]] (1977–1982). 

In Italy [[Raffaella Carrà]] is the most successful disco act, alongside [[La Bionda]], [[Hermanas Goggi]] and [[Guido & Maurizio De Angelis|Oliver Onions]]. Her greatest international single was "Tanti Auguri" ("Best Wishes"), which has become a popular song with [[gay]] audiences. The song is also known under its Spanish title "Para hacer bien el amor hay que venir al sur" (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song "Jätke võtmed väljapoole" was performed by [[Anne Veski]]. "[[A far l'amore comincia tu]]" ("To make love, your move first") was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as "En el amor todo es empezar", in German as "Liebelei", in French as "Puisque tu l'aimes dis le lui", and in English as "Do It, Do It Again". It was her only entry to the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number 9, where she remains a [[one-hit wonder]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book | first = David

"A far l'amore comincia tu" has also been covered in Turkish by a Turkish popstar [[Ajda Pekkan]] as "Sakın Ha" in 1977.

Recently, Carrà has gained new attention for her appearance as the female dancing soloist in a 1974 TV performance of the [[Experimental music|experimental]] [[gibberish]] song "[[Prisencolinensinainciusol]]" (1973) by [[Adriano Celentano]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/04/164206468/its-gibberish-but-italian-pop-song-still-means-something|title=It's Gibberish, But Italian Pop Song Still Means Something|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318092600/http://www.npr.org/2012/11/04/164206468/its-gibberish-but-italian-pop-song-still-means-something/|archive-date=March 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A remixed video featuring her dancing went [[viral video|viral]] on the internet in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEogw6w5d_jNGyUvjmdcDdJgqG40Wl-eN|title=Popular Videos – Prisencolinensinainciusol – YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410161344/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEogw6w5d_jNGyUvjmdcDdJgqG40Wl-eN|archive-date=April 10, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In 2008 a video of a performance of her only successful UK single, "Do It, Do It Again", was featured in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Midnight (Doctor Who)|Midnight]]".

The Bee Gees used [[Barry Gibb]]'s [[falsetto]] to garner hits such as "[[You Should Be Dancing]]", "[[Stayin' Alive]]", "[[Night Fever]]", "[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than A Woman]]" and "[[Love You Inside Out]]". [[Andy Gibb]], a younger brother to the Bee Gees, followed with similarly styled solo singles such as "[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]", "[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water]]" and "[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]".

In 1978, Donna Summer's multi-million selling vinyl single disco version of "[[MacArthur Park (song)#Donna Summer version|MacArthur Park]]" was number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for three weeks and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. The recording, which was included as part of the "MacArthur Park Suite" on her double live album ''[[Live and More]]'', was eight minutes and 40 seconds long on the album. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version of MacArthur Park was Summer's first single to reach number one on the Hot 100; it does not include the balladic second movement of the song, however. A 2013 remix of "MacArthur Park" by Summer topped the Billboard Dance Charts marking five consecutive decades with a number-one song on the charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720151423/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |archivedate=July 20, 2014 }}</ref> From mid-1978 to late 1979, Summer continued to release singles such as "[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]", "[[Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)|Heaven Knows]]" (with [[Brooklyn Dreams]]), "[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]", "[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]", "[[Dim All the Lights]]" and "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]", all very successful songs, landing in the top five or better, on the Billboard pop charts.

The band Chic was formed mainly by guitarist [[Nile Rodgers]]—a self-described "street hippie" from late 1960s New York—and bassist [[Bernard Edwards]]. Their popular 1978 single, "[[Le Freak]]", is regarded as an iconic song of the genre. Other successful songs by Chic include the often-sampled "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" (1979) and "[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]" (1979). The group regarded themselves as the disco movement's rock band that made good on the [[hippie]] movement's ideals of peace, love, and freedom.

The [[Village People]] were a singing/dancing group created by [[Jacques Morali]] and [[Henri Belolo]] to target disco's gay audience. They were known for their onstage costumes of typically male-associated jobs and ethnic minorities and achieved mainstream success with their 1978 hit song "[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]". Other songs include "[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]" (1979) and "[[In the Navy]]" (1979).

[[The Jacksons]] (formerly the Jackson 5) released many disco songs from 1977 to 1981, including "[[Blame It on the Boogie]]" (1978), "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]" (1979), "[[Lovely One]]" (1980) and "[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]" (1981): all of them were sung by Michael Jackson, whose 1979 solo album, ''[[Off the Wall]]'', also included several disco hits, such as [[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson song)|the album's title song]], "[[Rock with You]]", "[[Workin' Day and Night]]" and his second chart-topping solo disco hit, "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]".

Also noteworthy are [[The Trammps]]' "[[Disco Inferno]]" (1978, reissue due to the popularity gained from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack), [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s "[[Got to Be Real]]" (1978), [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn "Champagne" King]]'s "[[Shame (Evelyn King song)|Shame]]" (1978), [[Alicia Bridges]]' "[[I Love the Nightlife]]" (1978), [[Patrick Hernandez]]' "[[Born to Be Alive]]" (1978), [[Sister Sledge]]'s "[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]" (1979), [[Anita Ward]]'s "[[Ring My Bell]]" (1979), [[Lipps Inc.]]'s "[[Funkytown]]" (1979), [[George Benson]]'s "[[Give Me the Night (George Benson song)|Give Me the Night]]" (1980) and [[Walter Murphy]]'s various attempts to bring [[classical music]] to the mainstream, most notably his disco song "[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]" (1976), which was inspired by [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]].

The disco sound was also adopted by "non-pop" artists, including the 1979 U.S. number one hit "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]" by [[easy listening]] singer [[Barbra Streisand]] in a duet with Donna Summer. In [[country music]], artists like [[Connie Smith]] covered Andy Gibb's "I Just Want to Be Your Everything" in 1977, [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] recorded "Double S" in 1978, and [[Ronnie Milsap]] released "Get It Up" and covered [[blues]] singer [[Tommy Tucker (singer)|Tommy Tucker]]'s song "[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]" in 1979.

Pre-existing non-disco songs, standards, and TV themes were frequently "disco-ized" in the 1970s, such as the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' theme or [[Mike Post]]'s "[[Theme from Magnum P.I.|Theme from ''Magnum P.I.'']]" The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the [[big band]] era—which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big-band arrangements, including [[Perry Como]], who re-recorded his 1945 song "[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]", in 1975, as well as [[Ethel Merman]], who released an album of disco songs entitled ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]]'' in 1979.

[[Myron Floren]], second-in-command on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', released a recording of the "[[Clarinet Polka]]" entitled "Disco Accordion." Similarly, [[Bobby Vinton]] adapted "The Pennsylvania Polka" into a song named "Disco Polka". Easy listening icon [[Percy Faith]], in one of his last recordings, released an album entitled ''[[Disco Party (album)|Disco Party]]'' (1975) and recorded a disco version of his "[[Theme from A Summer Place|Theme from ''A Summer Place'']]" in 1976. Classical music was even adapted for disco, notably [[Walter Murphy]]'s "A Fifth of Beethoven" (1976, based on the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]]) and "Flight 76" (1976, based on [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]"), and [[Louis Clark]]'s ''[[Hooked On Classics]]'' series of albums and singles.

[[File:Manhattan Transfer.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[a cappella]] [[jazz]] group [[the Manhattan Transfer]] had a disco hit with the 1979 "Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone" theme.]]

Many original [[television]] [[theme songs]] of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', "[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]" (1977) by [[Meco]], and "Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone" (1979) by [[the Manhattan Transfer]]. Other examples include ''[[S.W.A.T.

Disco [[jingle]]s also made their way into many TV commercials, including [[Ralston Purina|Purina's]] 1979 "Good Mews" cat food commercial<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtKOGvHqgvg|title=1979 Purina Good Mews cat food TV commercial|date=August 15, 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref> and an "IC Light" commercial by [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Iron City Brewing Company]].

====Parodies====
Several parodies of the disco style were created. [[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded "[[Disco Duck]]" (1976) and "Dis-Gorilla" (1977); [[Frank Zappa]] parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in "[[Disco Boy]]" on his 1976 ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' album and in "[[Dancin' Fool]]" on his 1979 ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' album; [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s [["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|eponymous 1983 debut album]] includes a disco song called "Gotta Boogie", an extended pun on the similarity of the disco move to the American slang word "[[Dried nasal mucus|booger]]". Comedian [[Bill Cosby]] devoted his entire 1977 album ''[[Disco Bill]]'' to disco parodies. In 1980, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad Magazine]]'' released a flexi-disc titled ''Mad Disco'' featuring six full-length parodies of the genre. [[Rock and roll]] songs critical of disco included [[Bob Seger]]'s "[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]" and, especially, [[The Who]]'s "[[Sister Disco]]" (both 1978)—although The Who's "[[Eminence Front]]" (four years later) had a disco feel.

The film ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]'' and [[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (album)|its soundtrack album]] contained a disco medley of Sex Pistols songs, entitled ''Black Arabs'' and credited to a group of the same name. [[Jello Biafra]] of the [[Dead Kennedys]], in the song "Saturday Night Holocaust", likened disco to the [[cabaret]] culture of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era [[Germany]] for its apathy towards government policies and its escapism.

Anti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' was a hostile attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'', a wayward airplane slices a radio tower with its wing, knocking out an all-disco radio station. July 12, 1979, became known as "the day disco died" because of the [[Disco Demolition Night]], an anti-disco demonstration in a [[baseball]] double-header at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago.<ref name="Campion">Campion, Chris ''Walking on the Moon: The Untold Story of the Police and the Rise of New Wave Rock''. John Wiley & Sons, (2009), {{ISBN|978-0-470-28240-3}} pp. 82–84.</ref> Rock station DJs [[Steve Dahl]] and [[Garry Meier]], along with Michael Veeck, son of [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Bill Veeck]], staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader which involved exploding disco records in [[Baseball field|centerfield]]. As the second game was about to begin, the raucous crowd [[Pitch invasion|stormed onto the field]] and proceeded by setting [[Bonfire|fires]], tearing out seats and pieces of turf, and other damage.

====Impact on music industry====
The anti-disco movement, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, [[country music]] began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. The continued popularity of [[power pop]] and the revival of [[oldies]] in the late 1970s was also related to disco's decline; the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was [[John Travolta]], who in 1977 had starred in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.

During this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] purchased [[ABC Records]], absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. [[Midsong International Records]] ceased operations in 1980. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981 and [[TK Records]] closed in the same year. [[Salsoul Records]] continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|title=Salsoul Records @ Disco-Disco.com|website=disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014151424/http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Casablanca Records]] had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company [[PolyGram]].

Many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. [[The Bee Gees]], for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989's "[[One (Bee Gees song)|One]]") and three more top-40 songs (despite recording and releasing far more than that and completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs) in the United States after the 1970s, even though numerous songs they wrote and had ''other'' artists perform were successful. Of the handful of groups ''not'' taken down by disco's fall from favor, [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Donna Summer]], [[the Jacksons]]—and [[Michael Jackson]] in particular—stand out: In spite of having helped ''define'' the disco sound early on,<ref>''[[Jackson 5: The Ultimate Collection]]'' (1996), liner notes.</ref> they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s.

Six months prior to the chaotic event (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI ([[WLS-FM]]) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that also competed against WDAI at the time, [[WGCI-FM]], would later incorporate [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the [[Chicago house]] genre to the airwaves.

====Factors contributing to disco's decline====
Factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] from the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles led by participants.<ref name="BeeGees">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3652|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic BeeGees bio]</ref> In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the "Disco sucks" movement as implicitly [[machism|macho]] and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.<ref name=allmusicdisco/><ref name=espn/><ref name=Campion/> It was also interpreted being part of a wider cultural "backlash" towards conservatism,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jun/18/disco-sucks Ben Myers: "Why 'Disco sucks!' sucked"], in: [[The Guardian]], June 18, 2009, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref> that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the [[United States Senate]] for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] around the same time.

In January 1979, rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] argued that [[homophobia]], and most likely [[racism]], were reasons behind the movement,<ref name="Christgau" /> a conclusion seconded by [[John Rockwell]]. Craig Werner wrote: "The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of [[funk]]ateers and [[feminist]]s, progressives and [[puritan]]s, rockers and reactionaries. Nonetheless, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, [[sexism]] and homophobia."<ref>Easlea, Daryl, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/disco-inferno-680390.html Disco Inferno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913220555/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/disco-inferno-680390.html |date=September 13, 2011 }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', December 11, 2004</ref> [[Legs McNeil]], founder of the [[fanzine]] ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'', was quoted in an interview as saying, "the [[hippie]]s always wanted to be black. We were going, 'fuck the blues, fuck the black experience'." He also said that disco was the result of an "[[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy]]" union between homosexuals and blacks.<ref name="Reynolds154">Rip it Up and Start Again POSTPUNK 1978–1984 by [[Simon Reynolds]] p. 154</ref>

[[Steve Dahl]], who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, "It's really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it. But we weren't thinking like that."<ref name="espn">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=behrens/040809 |title=Top Sports Searches – ESPN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504172447/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=behrens%2F040809 |archivedate=May 4, 2010 }}</ref> It has been noted that British [[punk rock]] critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist [[reggae]] genre as well as the more pro-gay [[new romantic]]s movement.<ref name="allmusicdisco" /> Christgau and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.<ref name="Christgau" /><ref name="Testa" />

In 1979, the music industry in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed. The producer-oriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industry's artist-oriented marketing system.<ref>"Are We Not New Wave Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s Theo Cateforis Page 36 {{ISBN|978-0-472-03470-3}}</ref> Harold Childs, senior vice president at [[A&M Records]], told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "radio is really desperate for rock product" and "they're all looking for some white rock-n-roll".<ref name="Campion" /> [[Gloria Gaynor]] argued that the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emplive.org/exhibits/index.asp?articleID=622|title=empsfm.org – EXHIBITIONS – Featured Exhibitions|website=emplive.org|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Post-disco, boogie, HI-NRG and Italo disco (1980s)===
{{Main|Post-disco|boogie (genre)|Hi-NRG|Italo disco}}

Despite its decline in popularity, disco music remained ''relatively'' successful in the early 1980s, with songs like [[Irene Cara]]'s "[[Flashdance... What a Feeling]]" (theme to the film ''[[Flashdance (film)|Flashdance]]'') and the [[Fame (Irene Cara song)|theme song]] to the film ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (later re-sung by [[Erica Gimpel]] for the [[Fame (1982 TV series)|TV show of the same name]]), Michael Jackson's "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" and "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s first album–all which had strong disco influences. Record producer Giorgio Moroder's soundtracks to ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'' and ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (which also had a heavy disco influence) proved that the style was still very much embraced. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1982 album, ''[[Hot Space]]'' was inspired by the genre as well.

To a significant extent, the transition from disco to 1980s dance music was one of relabeling. The ''word'' "disco" simply became unfashionable to use when describing new music. As late as 1983, [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]] had a major hit single, "[[Give It Up (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Give It Up]]", which was not considered disco, even though it would have been considered to be in the heart of the genre if it had been released four years earlier.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981–83 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and jazz, creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discothèque]]s. Examples of early-1980s' dance sound performers include [[D Train (music group)|D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered "[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]"-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco's popularity.

During the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra, his 1981 song "One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)" had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[Symphony|symphonic]] arrangements.

This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]] which also included [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], [[Hi-NRG]] and [[Italo disco]]. It had an important influence on early [[alternative dance]] and [[dance-pop]], and played a key role in the transition between disco and [[house music]] during the early 1980s and later forms of [electronic dance music]].<ref name="AMG1">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/post-disco-ma0000012124|title=Post-disco |website=Allmusic |accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, this transition was marked by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio [[session musician]]s (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral string section), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of synthesizer [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.

In 1980s house music, and [[Chicago house]] in particular, a strong disco influence was constantly present, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping electronic dance music and contemporary club culture, is often described being "disco's revenge".<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg85ab/house-music-is-discos-revenge-a-look-at-the-early-days-of-american-house "House Music is Disco’s Revenge: A Look at the Early Days of American House"], in: [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] magazine, September 9, 2014, accessed on March 26, 2020.</ref>

===1990s–2010s: Disco revivals and nu-disco===
{{main|Nu-disco}}
In the 1990s, disco and its legacy became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs and films were released that referenced disco. This was part of a wave of [[Retro style|1970s nostalgia]] that was taking place in popular culture at the time. Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included [[Deee-Lite]]'s "[[Groove Is in the Heart]]" (1990), [[U2]]'s "[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]" (1993), [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s "[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]" (1994) & "Entertain Me" (1995), [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s "[[Disco 2000 (song)|Disco 2000]]" (1995), and [[Jamiroquai]]'s "[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]" (1999), while films such as ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.

In the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called "nu-disco" began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]" and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s "[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love At First Sight]]" and "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with [[funky house]], such as [[Spiller]]'s "[[Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)]]" and [[Modjo]]'s "[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2000. [[Robbie Williams]]' disco single "[[Rock DJ]]" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] released a disco song, "Miss Europa Disco Dancer", in 2001. The song's disco influence, which appears on ''[[Know Your Enemy (Manic Street Preachers album)|Know Your Enemy]]'', was described as being "much-discussed".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture1|title=Condemned to rock'n'roll|first=Garry|last=Mulholland|date=March 16, 2001|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=December 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224140032/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture1|archive-date=February 24, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s, and released her album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' to rave reviews. In addition to that, her song "[[Hung Up]]" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled [[ABBA]]'s 1979 song "[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her [[Confessions Tour]] also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the [[roller derby]].

The success of the "nu-disco" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: "The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It's a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. [[Madison Avenue (band)|Madison Avenue]] look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. 'Groovejet' accepts the night's changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused smile and a few great one-liners."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=SPILLER – "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/|website=Freaky Trigger|accessdate=April 12, 2017|date=April 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222225543/http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/|archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2014 Brazilian [[Globo TV]], the second biggest television network in the world, aired [[Boogie Oogie]], a [[telenovela]] about the Disco Era that takes place between 1978 and 1979, from the hit fever to the decadence. The show's success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to stage, and to record charts, Discothèque Divas like Lady Zu and As Frenéticas.

Other top-10 entries from 2015 like [[Mark Ronson]]'s disco groove-infused "[[Uptown Funk]]", [[Maroon 5]]'s "[[Sugar (Maroon 5 song)|Sugar]]", [[the Weeknd]]'s "[[Can't Feel My Face]]" and [[Jason Derulo]]'s "[[Want to Want Me|Want To Want Me]]" also ascended the charts and have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared with his new album ''[[Déjà Vu (Giorgio Moroder album)|Déjà Vu]]'' in 2015 which has proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like "[[I Don't Like It, I Love It]]" by [[Flo Rida]], "[[Adventure of a Lifetime]]" by [[Coldplay]], "[[Back Together (Robin Thicke song)|Back Together]]" by [[Robin Thicke]] and "[[Levels (Nick Jonas song)|Levels]]" by [[Nick Jonas]] feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs are showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that have been dominating the current charts. Justin Timberlake's 2016 song "[[Can't Stop the Feeling!]]", which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the history of the chart. [[The Martian (film)|''The Martian'']], a 2015 film, extensively uses disco music as a soundtrack, although for the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, there's only one thing worse than being stranded on Mars: it's being stranded on Mars with nothing but disco music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6715353/the-martian-soundtrack-disco-music-guardians-of-the-galaxy |title=Will the '70s Disco Soundtrack of 'The Martian' Be the Next 'Guardians of the Galaxy'? |first=Melinda |last=Newman |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 2, 2015 |accessdate=May 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011191757/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6715353/the-martian-soundtrack-disco-music-guardians-of-the-galaxy |archive-date=October 11, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "[[Kill the Lights (Alex Newell & DJ Cassidy song)|Kill the Lights]]", featured on an episode of the HBO television series "[[Vinyl (TV series)|Vinyl]]" (2016) and with [[Nile Rodgers]]' guitar licks, hit number one on the US Dance chart in July 2016.

==Legacy==
===DJ culture===
[[File:Vintage DJ Station 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|thumb|right|Classic DJ Station. A [[DJ mixer]] is placed between two [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]] turntables.]]

The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and [[DJ mixer]]s to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new [[turntablism]] techniques, such as [[beatmatching]] and [[scratching]], a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]], first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable [[pitch control]] and a [[direct drive]] motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure [[soul music|soul]] records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.

In the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at [[Paradise Garage]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]] and [[Francis Grasso]] became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a [[cult following]] among club-goers, who referred to his DJ sets as "[[Mass (liturgy)|Saturday Mass]]". Some DJs would use [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]]s to make [[remix]]es and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat matched records, the first user of electronic [[effects unit]]s in his mixes and an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies into his mixes, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of [[WKTU]] and [[WBLS]]. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ "profession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef".<ref>Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (1999). Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey. Headline Book Publishing Ltd. (updated edition 2000), p. 141.</ref> Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use his own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining his personal sound and aesthetic, and building his own reputation. Known as the first DJ to create a take his audience on a narrative, musical journey, Grasso discovered that music could effectively shift the energy of the crowd, and even more, that he had all this power at his fingertips.

===Early hip hop===
{{main|Hip hop music}}
The disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early hip hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used Chic's "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" as the foundation for their 1979 song "[[Rapper's Delight]]", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.

With synthesizers and [[Krautrock]] influences, that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when [[Afrika Bambaataa]] released the single "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]," spawning a [[hip hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend that includes songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s "Play at Your Own Risk" (1982), [[C-Bank]]'s "One More Shot" (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s "Club Underworld" (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s "[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]" (1983), [[Freeez]]'s "[[I.O.U. (Freeez song)|I.O.U.]]" (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s "Freak-a-Zoid" (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s "[[I Feel For You]]" (1984).

===House music and rave culture===
{{Main|House music|rave}}
[[File:Miguel Migs by Peter Chiapperino.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Like disco, house music was based around [[DJ]]s creating mixes for dancers in clubs. Pictured is DJ [[Miguel Migs]], mixing using [[CDJ]] players.]]
[[House music]] is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that originated in [[Chicago]] in the early 1980s (also see: [[Chicago house]]). It quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, where it developed into the harder and more industrial [[techno]], New York City (also see: [[garage house]]) and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes.

In the mid- to late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.<ref name=unesco_4>{{cite journal | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | title=The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon | publisher=UNESCO | date=July–August 2000 | last=Fikentscher | first=Kai | journal=UNESCO Courier | page=47 | quote=Around 1986/7, after the initial explosion of house music in Chicago, it became clear that the major recording companies and media institutions were reluctant to market this genre of music, associated with gay African Americans, on a mainstream level. House artists turned to Europe, chiefly London but also cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin,  Manchester, Milan, Zurich, and Tel Aviv.&nbsp;... A third axis leads to Japan where, since the late 1980s, New York club DJs have had the opportunity to play guest-spots. | access-date=March 7, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181437/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | archive-date=March 3, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as "[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up The Volume]]" by [[MARRS]] (1987), "House Nation" by [[Farley "Jackmaster" Funk|House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House]] (1987), "[[Theme from S'Express]]" by [[S'Express]] (1988) and "[[Doctorin' the House]]" by [[Coldcut]] (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]] worldwide.

Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] beats, rhythms mainly provided by [[drum machine]]s,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |title=House : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |website=AllMusic |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006233620/http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> off-beat [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist,<ref name="allmusic"/> and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more aggressive [[acid house]] or the minimalist [[microhouse]]. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres,<ref name="allmusic"/> such as [[Eurodance|euro house]], [[tech house]], [[electro house]] and [[Jump House (music genre)|jump house]].

[[File:RaveOn.jpg|thumb|right|Strobing lights flash at a [[rave]] dance event in [[Vienna]], 2005]]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, [[rave]] culture began to emerge from the house and acid house scene.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html | title = The History Of House | accessdate = August 13, 2013 | author = Phil Cheeseman-fu | magazine = [[DJ Magazine]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130906062503/http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html | archive-date = September 6, 2013 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Like house, it incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music played by DJs over powerful [[PA system|sound systems]], [[recreational drug]] and club drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and [[hedonism]]. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for [[mass consumption]]. In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed (mostly) underground. In part this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid [[law enforcement]] attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]].

===Post-punk{{Anchor|Post punk}}===
{{Main|Post-punk|dance-punk}}
The [[post-punk]] movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported [[punk rock]]'s rule breaking while rejecting its move back to raw [[rock music]].<ref name=Reynolds/> Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.<ref name=Reynolds/> [[Public Image Limited]] is considered the first post-punk group.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's second album ''[[Metal Box]]'' fully embraced the "studio as instrument" methodology of disco.<ref name=Reynolds/> The group's founder [[John Lydon]], the former lead singer for the [[Sex Pistols]], told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.

[[No wave]] was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City.<ref name=Reynolds/> For shock value, [[James Chance]], a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the ''East Village Eye'' urging his readers to move uptown and get "trancin' with some superradioactive disco voodoo funk". His band [[James White and the Blacks]] wrote a disco album titled ''[[Off White]]''.<ref name=Reynolds/> Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on).<ref name=Reynolds/> In 1981 [[ZE Records]] led the transition from no wave into the more subtle [[mutant disco]] ([[Post-disco#Dance-rock|post-disco/punk]]) genre.<ref name=Reynolds/> Mutant disco acts such as [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]], [[Was Not Was]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]] and [[Liquid Liquid]] influenced several British post-punk acts such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] and [[A Certain Ratio]].<ref name="Reynolds">Rip It Up and Start Again POSTPUNK 1978–1984 by [[Simon Reynolds]]</ref>
