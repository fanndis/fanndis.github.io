The '''University of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Universitas Indonesia}}, abbreviated as '''UI''') is a public university in [[Depok]], [[West Java]] and [[Salemba]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. It is one of the oldest tertiary-level educational institutions in Indonesia (known as the [[Dutch East Indies]] when UI was established), and is generally considered as the most prestigious university in Indonesia, along with the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] and [[Gadjah Mada University]].<ref name="sib-spmb2006">{{cite news|title=707 Siswa Pandai Tapi Tak Mampu Lulus SPMB|format=online archive|language=Indonesian|url=http://www.hariansib.com/content/view/10396/48/|publisher=Sinar Indonesia Baru|date=6 August 2006|accessdate=2006-11-02}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="jawapos-spmb2004">{{cite news|title=Mencermati Peringkat Nilai Hasil Seleksi Penerimaan Mahasiswa Baru (SPMB) 2004 |format=online archive|language=Indonesian|url=http://jawapos.co.id/index.php?act=detail_c&id=124161|publisher=Harian Jawa Pos|date=13 August 2004|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/study/abroad/exchange/destinations/economics-management/show-destination-aseby/item-study-abroad-exchange-economics-management-indonesia-ui/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121212200803/http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/students/study/abroad/exchange/destinations/economics-management/show-destination-aseby/item-study-abroad-exchange-economics-management-indonesia-ui/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-12|title=Universitas Indonesia|publisher=[[Tilburg University]]}}</ref> In the 2019 [[QS World University Rankings|QS World Universities Ranking]], UI is ranked 1st in Indonesia, 57th in Asia and 292nd in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-indonesia |title=Universitas Indonesia |access-date=2016-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308031740/http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-indonesia |archive-date=2016-03-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="topuniversities.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universitas-indonesia/undergrad|title=Universitas Indonesia|date=2012-12-07|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto met de gebouwen van de Stovia de Centrale Burgerlijke Ziekeninrichting (CBZ) het Geneeskundig Laboratorium en de Opiumfabriek Weltevreden TMnr 60013949.jpg|thumbnail|left|STOVIA medical school complex during the 1920s, the complex consists of buildings now known as the Faculty of Medicine of Universitas Indonesia (top) and Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (center).|255x255px]]
The roots of UI date back to 1851. At that time, the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies established a school to train medical assistants. Training lasted for two years, and the graduates were certified to provide basic medical treatments. The degree conferred was Javanese Doctor, as the graduates were certified only to open their practice in the Dutch East Indies, especially Java. The program became more comprehensive; by 1864 it was expanded to three years. By 1875, the program of study had reached seven years and the graduates were entitled to the degree of Medical Doctor.<ref name="Universitas Indonesia History">{{cite web|work=University of Indonesia|title=History|url=http://www.ui.ac.id/en/about-us/about-ui/history.html|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>

The next step came in 1898, when the Dutch East Indies government established a new school to train medical doctors, named [[STOVIA]] (''School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen''). A school building was opened in March 1902, in a building that is now the [[Museum of National Awakening]]. The prerequisite to enter STOVIA was roughly the equivalent of a junior high school diploma. The schooling took nine years, so it was a mix between high school and university education. Many STOVIA graduates later played important roles in Indonesia's national movement toward independence, as well in developing medical education in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|work=University of Indonesia|title=History|url=http://old.ui.ac.id/en/profile/page/history|accessdate=2 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026233616/http://old.ui.ac.id/en/profile/page/history|archive-date=26 October 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1924, the colonial government decided to open a new tertiary-level educational facility, the RHS (''Rechts Hogeschool''), to train civilian officers and servants. The RHS would later evolve into the Faculty of Law. In 1927, STOVIA's status was changed to that of a full tertiary-level institution and its name was changed to GHS (''Geneeskundige Hogeschool''). The GHS occupied the same main building and used the same teaching hospital as the current Faculty of Medicine. Many GHS alumni would later play roles in establishing '''Universitas Indonesia'''.<ref name="tudelft.nl">[http://www.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=890cbbcf-a9ce-4ea6-9b38-4fdbecbee3ce&lang=en TU Delft Colonial influence remains strong in Indonesia]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

After Indonesia gained independence, the Indonesian Institute for Higher Education (BPTRI) was established in Jakarta consisting of three faculties: Medicine and Pharmacy, Letters, and Law. The institute produced its first 90 graduate students as medical doctors in the same year. When the Dutch colonial army occupied Jakarta in late 1945, the BPTRI moved to Klaten, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Malang. In 1946, the Dutch colonial government established the ''Nood Universiteit'' or Emergency University at Jakarta. In 1947, the name was changed to ''Universiteit van Indonesië'' (UVI) or ''Universitas Indonesia''. Following the Indonesian National Revolution, the government established a state university in Jakarta in February 1950. The name was ''Universiteit Indonesia'', comprising the BPTRI units and the former UVI, which was later changed into Universitas Indonesia (UI).

[[Image:No 18 Rektorat Universitas Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Universitas Indonesia rectorate building|297x297px]]
By 1950, UI was a multi-campus university, with faculties in Jakarta (Medicine, Law, and Letters), [[Bogor]] (Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine), [[Bandung]] (Engineering, Mathematics and Natural Sciences), [[Surabaya]] (Medicine and Dentistry), and [[Makassar]] (Economics and Law). The Surabaya campus became the [[University of Airlangga]] in 1954. In the following year, the Makassar campus became the [[University of Hasanuddin]]. In 1959, the Bandung campus became the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]]. The School for Physical Education, which was also in Bandung, became part of [[Padjadjaran University]] in 1960. In 1964, the Bogor campus became the [[Bogor Agricultural Institute]] and the Faculty of Teaching and Education in Jakarta became the Institute of Teaching and Education (now the [[State University of Jakarta]]). By 1965, UI consisted of three campuses, all in Jakarta: Salemba (Medicine, Dentistry, Economics, Engineering, Science and the Graduate School), Rawamangun (Letters, Law, Social Science and Psychology) and Pegangsaan (Public Health and parts of Medicine).

In 1987, several faculties from the Salemba and Rawamangun campuses moved to a newly built campus in the outskirts of Jakarta. The campus in southern Jakarta is known as the Depok campus (it is in the city of [[Depok]]).<ref name="Universitas Indonesia History"/>

In the year 2007-2008, Universitas Indonesia underwent substantial reform. Revenue was significantly increased from 800 billion to 1.6 trillion rupiah. The number of research publications has increased. This is also the case with the university's endowment fund.

The rector of the Universitas Indonesia (July 2007), Prof Dr der.soz. Gumilar Rusliwa Somantri, is the youngest leader among university presidents in Indonesia. He has been elected to and serves on the Board of Directors of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU).

According to the 2008 survey of ''Globe Asia'', UI ranked number first among the top universities in Indonesia.<ref>Indonesian University Rankings, ''Globe Asia'' magazine vol. 2 number 4, April 2008.</ref> This report has been supported by a leading Indonesian magazine ''[[Tempo magazine (Indonesia)|Tempo]]'', which carried out a survey and analysis to rank universities and education in Indonesia.<ref name="autogenerated1">Ranking Perguruan Tinggi Indonesia Naik, Tempo Interaktif http://www.tempo.co.id {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302120808/http://www.tempo.co.id/ |date=2006-03-02 }}, 14 Oktober 2008,</ref> Universitas Indonesia has improved its research collaboration with international partners.

In August 2008, the university won the Indonesia ICT award for the smart campus with best content and application. In terms of accessibility and connectivity, Universitas Indonesia has won an award because 90% of the university's area is covered by IT infrastructure and services with its 305 Mbit/s. connection to the Internet, and its 155 Mbit/s. connection to the Indonesia Higher Education Research Network ([[INHERENT|Inherent]]).<ref name="inaicta1">Daftar Pemenang Inaicta 2008, http://www.inaicta.web.id/static-myinaicta/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912063323/http://www.inaicta.web.id/static-myinaicta/ |date=2008-09-12 }}, August 2008</ref>

==Logo and philosophy==
The earliest form of the logo of Universitas Indonesia was created in 1952 by Sumaxtono (born as Sumartono), a student from the 1951 Art Department class, Faculty of Engineering, at the time known as the ''Fakulteit Teknik Universiteit Indonesia'', in Bandung.

The logo is the kala-makara, a symbol of the two sources of energy in nature. Kala is the energy from above (the power of the sun), while makara represents the energy from below (the power of the Earth). The two powers are combined and stylized into a symbol that represents the function of Universitas Indonesia as a source of knowledge.

The logo of Universitas Indonesia carries the following interpretation:

* The tree, which includes the buds and the branches, represents science and its branches, implying that the buds will soon flourish and turn into new branches of science. The buds will continue to blossom as long as the main tree is alive. By this, Sumaxtono intended to state that the branches of science will continuously grow.
* Water pouring down from the makara signifies the works of science.

The logo design and the meaning it carried were presented to Srihadi (a student from the 1952 class from the same department) in 1952. Prof. KRHT H. Srihadi Soedarsono Adhikoesoemo, M.A. who created the logo of [[Bandung Institute of Technology]], was not sure who authenticated this logo or when. He was sure, however, that it was printed on the cover of the book ''Universiteit Indonesia, Fakulteit Teknik, Bandung: Rentjana Untuk Tahun Peladjaran 1952-1953'' (Universitas Indonesia, Faculty of Engineering, Bandung: Course Plans for Academic Years 1952-1953), published by AID, Bandung, 120 pages, using the original design by Sumaxtono (without the pentagonal border).<ref>{{cite web|work=University of Indonesia|title=Logo & Philosophy|url=http://old.ui.ac.id/en/profile/page/coat-of-arms/logo-philosophy|accessdate=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027054830/http://old.ui.ac.id/en/profile/page/coat-of-arms/logo-philosophy|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Campuses ==

=== Salemba ===
The Salemba campus, located in Central Jakarta, is dedicated mostly to the faculties of Medicine and Dentistry. It adjoins with [[Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital|Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital]] (RSCM) as well as the University Dental Hospital. It houses parts of the postgraduate program, the Faculty of Law (Master of Law Science and Law Science Doctoral Program), Faculty of Economics (Extension and Master of Management programs), the School of Environmental Science (Master of Environmental Science and Environmental Science Doctoral Program), and the Faculty of Engineering (laboratories).<ref name="Universitas Indonesia History"/>

=== Depok ===
[[File:Monumen ui depok.jpg|thumb|Monument at UI Depok Campus|295x295px]]
The Depok campus, in Depok, just south of Jakarta, was built during the mid-1980s to accommodate the modernization of the university. It is now the main campus. Most of the faculties (Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Humanities, Pharmacy, Engineering, Psychology, Letters, Economics, Social Politics, Law, Computing, Nursing and Public Health) have been relocated here.<ref name="Universitas Indonesia History"/>

The Depok campus is alongside the Jakarta-Bogor commuter railway, offering students easy access to transport by rail. Students also benefit from the frequent commuter bus services connecting many parts of Jakarta to Depok.

Undergraduate teaching of the medical and dental faculties relocated to Depok in 2010.

The main library of the university is on the campus, along with other facilities such as the Student Services Center, Student Activities Center, gymnasium, stadium, hockey field, hotel (Wisma Makara), travel agent and the dormitory.

=== Sustainability ===
[[File:Kampus UI GoGreen.jpg|left|thumb|One of the green areas, near UI Auditorium]]
Universitas Indonesia maintains 75% of its area for reforestation. Over 20 kilometers of bicycle path have been created and shuttle buses are provided for the students and faculty. The bicycles and buses are to decrease the number of vehicles in the campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ui.ac.id/tentang-ui.html|title=Tentang UI|last=admin|date=2013-11-20|website=Universitas Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.okezone.com/read/2015/02/04/65/1101065/ini-dia-10-kampus-hijau-di-indonesia|title=Ini Dia 10 Kampus Hijau di Indonesia|last=Okezone|website=https://news.okezone.com/|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>

UI established the GreenMetric Ranking of World Universities<ref name="Greenmetric.ui.ac.id"/> in April 2010 to provide detailed profiles of participating universities who wish to make the necessary steps to promote sustainable operations. It is hoped that the rankings, when published, will promote a greater environmental awareness for all institutions of higher learning of the value of putting in places and systems that will have a positive impact on global warming and climate change, particularly those that help reduce carbon emissions through [[efficient energy use]], and alternative forms of transport, greening the campus and recycling.

The new library "crystal of knowledge" at Depok used a sustainable concept. Not only in green area and transportation, Universitas Indonesia has relocated nine massive African baobab trees aging over 100 years (one said to be 240 years old) to the Depok campus to prove the university commitment in going green.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://green.ui.ac.id/notice/archive/23 |title=Sustainability at Universitas Indonesia |publisher=Green.ui.ac.id |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528160140/http://green.ui.ac.id/notice/archive/23 |archive-date=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
