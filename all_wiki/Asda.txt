'''Asda Stores Ltd.''' ({{IPAc-en|'|æ|z|d|ə}}) trading as '''Asda''' is a British [[supermarket]] retailer, headquartered in [[Leeds]], England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://your.asda.com/section-contact-asda |title=Contact the right service team |publisher=Asda |accessdate=20 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722100737/http://your.asda.com/section-contact-asda |archive-date=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company was founded in 1949 when the Asquith family merged their retail business with the Associated Dairies company of Yorkshire. It expanded into the [[Southern England|south of England]] during the 1970s and 1980s, and acquired [[Allied Carpets]], 61 large [[Gateway Supermarket]]s and other businesses, such as [[MFI Group|MFI]], then sold off its acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets. It was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] until 1999 when it was acquired by the American retail giant [[Walmart]] for £6.7&nbsp;billion. Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] between 2003 and 2014 by market share, at which point it fell into third place. Since April 2019, it has regained its second-place position, behind [[Tesco]] and ahead of [[Sainsbury's]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/02/sainsburys-asda-uk-supermarket-aldi-lidl|title=Sainsbury's falls behind Asda to become UK's third biggest supermarket chain |date=2 April 2019|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="ASDA Second">{{cite news|title=Market share of grocery stores in Great Britain for the 12 weeks ending March 29, 2015 |work=[[Statista]] |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/279900/grocery-market-share-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117022207/http://www.statista.com/statistics/279900/grocery-market-share-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 January 2014 }}</ref>

Besides its core supermarkets, the company also offers a number of other services, including [[financial services]] and a [[mobile phone]] provider that uses the existing [[EE Limited|EE]] network. Asda's marketing promotions are usually based solely on price, and since 2015, like its parent company, Walmart, Asda has promoted itself under the slogan "Save Money. Live Better".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asda.com/save-money-live-better/|title=Save money. Live better|accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref> Since 1987, Asda has also had its property development subsidiary, McLagan Investments Ltd, which is based at the main Leeds head office site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1537690Z:LN|title=McLagan Investments|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>

As a wholly owned division of Walmart, Asda is not required to publish quarterly, half-yearly or full-yearly earnings, but many large UK subsidiaries of US companies submit accounts to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on a voluntary basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=421461&p=2885736|title=non-US companies|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>

In April 2018, [[Sainsbury's]] and Asda announced a merger plan that would have given the combined supermarkets an estimated 30% share of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] grocery market, however it was blocked by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43933517 |title=Sainsbury's and Asda in merger talks |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2018 |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="blocked">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48048596|title=Sainsbury's-Asda merger blocked by regulator|date=25 April 2019|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>

In October 2020, [[EG Group]] (led by the Issa brothers<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mustoe |first1=Howard |title=Who are Asda's new owners the Issa brothers? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54343391 |website=BBC News |accessdate=5 October 2020 |date=2 October 2020}}</ref>) announced its intention to acquire Asda in a deal worth almost £7&nbsp;billion which is subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority. [[Walmart]] will maintain a minority shareholding.

==History==
[[File:Asda House, Leeds (19th July 2014) 003.JPG|thumb|A bust of co-founder Peter Asquith outside Asda House in [[Leeds]]]]

===Early years===
The Asquith family were [[butcher]]s based in [[Knottingley]], [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]], West Yorkshire. In the 1920s, they expanded their business to seven butchers shops in the area. Their sons, Peter and Fred, later became founding members of Asda.<ref name=asquith>{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-asquith-1-2503706|title=Obituary: Peter Asquith|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

Around the same time, a group of [[West Riding]] dairy farmers, including the Stockdale family and Craven Dairies, joined together under the banner of J.W Hindell Dairy Farmers Ltd. The company diversified in 1949 to become Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd, with Arthur Stockdale as the managing director.<ref name=noel>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1453806/Sir-Noel-Stockdale.html|title=Obituary: Sir Noel Stockdale|date=9 February 2004|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===1960s & 1970s: Expansion===
====1960s slow expansion====
In 1963, the Asquith brothers converted an old [[Movie theater|cinema]] building, the Queens in [[Castleford]], into a self-service supermarket. Another followed in the old indoor market at [[Edlington]]. Both stores traded under the name of 'Queens'. Their next store was a purpose-built supermarket in [[South Elmsall]], the town of which Asda now has a distribution centre to this day.<ref name=asquith/>

In 1965, the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain. A merger was proposed and the Asquiths' business was joined with [[Noel Stockdale]]'s to form a new company, Asda ('''As'''quith + '''Da'''iries) (capitalised from 1985).<ref name=noel/>

By 1967, the company had set up a store in the North East of England in [[Billingham]], [[Teesside]], which is still trading to the present day. By 1969, Noel Stockdale bought out the Asquith brothers' stake and became chairman of the company.<ref name=noel/>

Asda took advantage of the abolition of [[retail price maintenance]] to offer large-scale, low-cost supermarkets. This was aided by the decision to acquire three struggling US-owned branches in the mid-1960s of the GEM retail group. The Government Exchange Mart stores in [[Preston, Lancashire]], [[Cross Gates, Leeds]] and West Bridgford had accumulated losses of £320,000 and offered to sell the stores for 20% of whatever Asda could recoup as losses from the [[Inland Revenue]]. They received the whole amount back. The rent was only 10 shillings (50p) per square foot on a 20-year lease, with no rent reviews, Asda increased GEM's £6,000 per week sales to around £60,000 per week in just six months with the new stores named as Asda.<ref name="outoftown">{{cite news|last=Kelly |first=Jon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23900465 |title=How first out-of-town superstore changed the UK |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/about-asda/the-history-of-asda |title=Asda through the years - ASDA.com |accessdate=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422102646/http://your.asda.com/about-asda/the-history-of-asda |archive-date=22 April 2015 }}</ref>

====1970s rapid expansion====
During the 1970s, with over 30 stores in the north of England, Asda began expanding south, with the opening of new stores in the [[Estover]] area of [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]] and [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://christchurchgosport.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/christ_church_history.pdf|title=Christ Church, Gosport: A history|page=22|year=2009|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 1978, Asda acquired [[Allied Carpets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/29/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness|title=Trapped in a shag pile time warp|date=29 August 1999|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1982, the first [[London]] store opened until 1982, in [[Park Royal]], near [[Ealing]]. The [[Isle of Dogs]] and [[Charlton, London]] stores followed on rapidly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://charltonchampion.co.uk/2016/02/18/goodbye-asda-hello-housing-new-greenwich-council-consultation-offers-clues-to-charlton-riverside-plans/|title=Goodbye Asda, hello housing? New Greenwich Council consultation offers clues to Charlton Riverside plans|date=18 February 2016|publisher=Charlton Champion|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===1980s & 1990s: Decline===
In 1984, Managing Director, John Hardman, made attempts to halt Asda's decline, which included the introduction of Asda branded products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hardman's race to catch up Asda's rivals|publisher=The Herald|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11922353.hardmans-race-to-catch-up-asdas-rivals-goes-on-apace/|date=11 July 1989|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 1985, Asda merged with MFI (Mullard Furniture Industries) and the group was renamed Asda-MFI Group plc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4649684/40-years-of-MFI.html|title=40 years of MFI|date=22 September 2006|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

Asda established its headquarters at "Asda House". The site was officially opened in 1988, by the then Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107408|title=Remarks visiting ASDA HQ ("we can make the best things in Britain")|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

By the end of the 1990s the 'Asdale'-named clothing range was replaced by the clothing ranges from the newly formed [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]] partnership with Asda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/george-surprises-asda-departure/12239?src_site=brandrepublic|title=George surprises Asda with departure|date=10 November 2000|publisher=Campaign Live|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

====Near bankruptcy and merger prospects====
With stores mainly based in the [[North of England]], the newly focused food retail group expanded further south in 1989 by purchasing the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705&nbsp;million. This significantly increased Asda's total selling area, but the company had borrowed heavily in order to fund the purchase - city estimates suggested that Asda had overpaid by around £300&nbsp;million for 61 of the largest Gateway stores, two undeveloped store sites and a distribution centre. That was far above the net book value of the locations, some of which were poorly sited. (Asda has subsequently relocated or rebuilt more than 30 of the original Gateway stores since the late 1990s.) The move left the company overstretched as a result, and by 1991, it found itself in serious financial trouble with over £1&nbsp;billion of debt; compounding the situation further was a declining customer base, which was mainly caused by Asda's focus on moving upmarket resulting in prices rising to levels significantly higher than competitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=800|title=ASDA/WAL-MART – A Corporate Profile|publisher=Corporate Watch|accessdate =6 April 2008}}</ref>

Eventually, a combination of flagging profits, a tremendous debt and a loss of customers left Asda in such an egregious financial situation that they came very close to breaching their banking covenants; at one point, they almost entered [[Administration in United Kingdom law|administration]]. The company's first response was to change its management; chairman John Hardman was ousted in June 1991 and was replaced by Patrick Gillam, and [[Archie Norman (businessman)|Archie Norman]] was appointed chief executive in October. Asda then completed a rights issue in November 1991 that raised £357&nbsp;million and cut the company's debts to £668&nbsp;million. In May 1992, Asda reduced their prices back to their traditional level (5-7% below competitors) and announced that they would eliminate over 500 management positions. In 1993, Asda completed a second rights issue that raised a further £347&nbsp;million and began selling off some of its assets; some stores were sold to competitors, and the [[Allied Carpets]] chain was notably sold to Carpetland. By 1995, the company had returned to profitability and had virtually wiped out its debt - this is cited as one of the most successful turnarounds in British retail history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asda Group Plc |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/asda-group-plc |website=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=16 June 2020}}</ref>

Norman succeeded Gillam as chairman upon the latter's retirement in 1996, appointing then-deputy [[Allan Leighton]] as chief executive, and began to remodel Asda's stores along the lines of [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/press_release/0,1014,cid%253D196099,00.html|title=Global powers of retail report – wal mart remains world's largest global retailer|website=Deloitte & Touche|accessdate=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> Leighton travelled to [[Bentonville, Arkansas]] to assess and photograph the systems and marketing deployed by Walmart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/492390/mt-interview-allan-leighton/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205095240/http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/492390/mt-interview-allan-leighton/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 December 2008 |title=Allan Leighton |website=Management Today |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=5 April 2008 }}</ref> In 1998, following the Walmart model, Asda began opening larger 'Hypermarket' (later 'Supercentre') stores as well as introducing pharmacies and cafes to its stores. At the same time, merger discussions were taking place between Asda and other retailers such as [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] and [[Kingfisher plc]]; both collapsed without an agreement being reached, but in 1999, a second round of discussions with Kingfisher later reached an agreement for a £5.4&nbsp;billion merger that would have both created the United Kingdom's largest multi-category retailer and enabled Asda to begin operating stores throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/asda-kingfisher-multi-billion-pound-merger/42283|title=Asda and Kingfisher in multi-billion pound merger|date=16 April 1999|publisher=Campaign Live}}</ref>

===2000s & 2010s: Walmart years===
A merger deal was abandoned when Walmart outbid Kingfisher to purchase Asda for £6.7&nbsp;billion, which was completed on 26 July 1999<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/368430.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wal-Mart bids for Asda | date=14 June 1999}}</ref> in a move that was initially speculated by British media outlets as a potential [[corporate raid]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Wal-Mart says 'no' to UK |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/331072.stm |accessdate=16 June 2020 |agency=BBC News |date=29 April 1999}}</ref> Shortly after the takeover, Norman resigned as chairman and left the company to pursue his political career; he was succeeded as chairman by Leighton.

In 2005, amid reported concerns within Walmart about a slippage in market share, partially due to a resurgent [[Sainsbury's]], Asda's chief executive, [[Tony De Nunzio]] left, and was replaced by [[Andrew James Bond|Andy Bond]]. In 2005, Asda expanded into Northern Ireland by purchasing 12 former [[Safeway Stores (Ireland)|Safeway stores]] from [[Morrisons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=41262|title=Asda acquires 12 NI Safeway stores|website=Northern Ireland News|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=6 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/06/12/story5576.asp|title = Asda eyes up the Republic|website= ThePost.ie|publisher=archives.tcm.ie|accessdate =25 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418152940/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/06/12/story5576.asp|archive-date=18 April 2009}}</ref>

Asda's [[property development]] arm, Gazeley Limited, was sold to Economic Zones World (EZW), a [[Dubai World]] subsidiary, in June 2008 for in excess of £300m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/dubai-world-buys-gazeley/3115513.article|title=Dubai World buys Gazeley|first=Jennifer|last=Rigby|date=10 June 2008|website=Property Week|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

In November 2008, there were reports that Asda was to buy Irish retailer [[Dunnes Stores]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/ireland/business/dunnes-urged-to-clarify-rumours-of-asda-takeover-14033905.html |title=Dunnes urged to clarify rumours of Asda takeover |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>

In April 2010, Asda announced plans to open over 100 new non-food stores as part of an ambitious five-year plan. These plans were mothballed shortly after because of the recession and the reining in of spending by consumers on non-food purchases.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/business-food-and-drink/2010/04/asda-stores-tesco-open-sales |title=Asda takes aim at Tesco with new stores |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

In August 2009, Walmart "sold" Asda for £6.9&nbsp;billion to their Leeds-based investment subsidiary Corinth Services Limited.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6527054/Wal-Mart-sells-Asda-for-6.9bn-in-group-restructuring.html|title=Wal-Mart 'sells' Asda for £6.9bn in group restructuring|date=8 November 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=11 November 2009 | first=Richard | last=Tyler| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091111001953/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6527054/Wal-Mart-sells-Asda-for-6.9bn-in-group-restructuring.html| archive-date= 11 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The deal was described as part of a "group restructuring" and meant Asda remained under the control of Walmart, since Corinth is itself a Walmart subsidiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retail-week.com/city/trading-update/asda-posts-flat-profits-and-is-sold-in-internal-walmart-deal/5007872.article|title=Asda posts flat profits and is 'sold' in internal Walmart deal|date=9 November 2009|website=Retail Week|publisher=Emap Ltd|accessdate=11 November 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112134131/http://www.retail-week.com/city/trading-update/asda-posts-flat-profits-and-is-sold-in-internal-walmart-deal/5007872.article| archive-date= 12 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

On 11 May 2010, [[Andy Clarke (businessman)|Andy Clarke]], a former manager of an Asda store, who was also the chief operating officer, was appointed as CEO.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7711304/Asda-promotes-Andy-Clarke-to-chief-executive.html |title=Asda promotes Andy Clarke to chief executive |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=11 May 2010 | first=James | last=Hall | date=11 May 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100514082258/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7711304/Asda-promotes-Andy-Clarke-to-chief-executive.html| archive-date= 14 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In May 2010, Asda bought the original [[Netto UK]] supermarket chain in a £778&nbsp;million deal. The deal provided the company with smaller stores that became part of the supermarket division formed in 2009, with most Netto stores being only one fifth of the size of a branch within the core Asda superstore format. In September 2010, Asda was required to sell 47 of the existing 194 Netto stores following a ruling by the [[Office of Fair Trading]]. The rebranding of Netto stores to Asda began in early 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/store-rebrand-brings-new-jobs-2693836|title=Store rebrand brings new jobs to Caernarfon|date=19 April 2013|work=Daily Post|accessdate=16 October 2020}}</ref>

In February 2011, Asda announced the purchase of six stores from [[Focus DIY]]; five of these were converted into supermarkets later that year.<ref name="retailgazette">{{cite news|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/articles/04434-asda-purchases-six-focus-diy-stores|publisher=retailgazette|date=27 May 2010|title=Asda purchases six Focus DIY stores|accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everythingaberystwyth.co.uk/strict-planning-regulations-may-scuttle-asda-plans/ |title=Plans To Open Aberystwyth ADSA Dealt Blow By Council |work=Everything Aberystwyth |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref>

In June 2016, it was announced that [[Andy Clarke (businessman)|Andy Clarke]], CEO since 2010, would be replaced by [[Sean Clarke]], the head of parent company Walmart's operations in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36515870|title=Asda chief Andy Clarke to be replaced by Sean Clarke|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/13/asda-boss-andy-clarke-bows-out/|title=Asda boss Andy Clarke bows out|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/asda-brings-in-walmart-boss-sean-clarke-to-take-over-as-chief-executive-a3270101.html|title=Asda brings in Walmart boss to take over as chief executive|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

In November 2017, Asda recruited Jesús Lorente, from French hypermarket retailer [[Carrefour]]. He became CMO (Chief Merchandising Officer), in January 2018, and was put in charge of the fresh food and general merchandise offer within all stores. After reportedly clashing with Roger Burnley and only six months in his post, Lorente left Asda at the end of July 2018.

====Abandoned merger with Sainsbury's====
In April 2018, [[Sainsbury's]] and Walmart announced negotiations about a possible merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, creating the largest supermarket chain in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tovey|first= Alan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/28/sainsburys-mulls-asda-tie-up-create-supermarket-giant/ |title=Sainsbury's in 'advanced' discussions over £10bn-plus merger with Asda to create supermarket giant |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 April 2018 |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref> Under the plans, Walmart would own 42% of the combined business,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coupe on creating a dynamic new player in UK retail | url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=10s&v=tHvvH0E7hdM |date=30 April 2018|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> which would be led by the existing chief executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe. The group would also open branches of [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] within Asda stores. The merger underwent intense scrutiny by a cross-party group of MPs, chairing select committees for the proposed merger, along with the Competition and Markets Authority, investigating the impact of how the deal could negatively affect the retail industry by a possible reduction of consumer choice for shoppers resulting in price rises, and of how suppliers, especially smaller, family-owned companies could be squeezed by the combined group. The CMA were inundated with complaints by suppliers and other major retailers of the damage they felt would be inflicted upon them if the deal was approved.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sainsbury's vows Asda deal will cut prices|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43945254|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2018}}</ref> On 25 April 2019 the CMA blocked the proposed merger, suggesting that it would increase prices for consumers and make competition unfair for the other UK retailers, Sainsbury's then announced that it was abandoning the merger.<ref name="blocked"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/219067/sainsbury-s-and-walmart-s-asda-abandon-merger-after-competition-watchdog-rejects-deal-219067.html|title=Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda abandon merger after competition watchdog rejects deal|date=25 April 2019|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===Present===
On 2 October 2020, it was announced Walmart had sold the majority of Asda to a consortium of [[Zuber Issa|Zuber]] and [[Mohsin Issa]] (25% each and the owners of [[EG Group]]) and private equity firm [[TDR Capital]] (50%) for £6.8bn.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54383131|title=Asda bought by billionaire Issa brothers in £6.8bn deal|website=bbc.com|date=2 October 2020|accessdate=2 October 2020}}</ref> Walmart had previously tried to sell Asda to  [[Sainsbury's|J.

In November 2020, Asda said that there was an increase of the Christmas sales as customers' demands for Christmas products started early. The sales grew 2.7% in the period to 30 September and the sales of frozen turkey crowns had increased by 230%.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davey|first=James|date=17 November 2020|title=Christmas comes early for Britain's Asda during pandemic|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-asda-outlook-idUKKBN27X1G2|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref>

===Asda Supercentres===
Following the takeover by Walmart, several "Asda Walmart Supercentres" have been opened, creating some of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. Since 2006, all new Supercentres have been solely branded as ''Asda Supercentre'' without the Walmart branding. The first Supercentre with a sales area of {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} opened in Patchway, Bristol in the summer of 2000. The first Scottish Supercentre opened in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/news/scotlands-first-asda-wal-mart-supercentre_id87409.aspx|title=UK: Scotland's first ASDA Wal-Mart supercentre|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> The [[Bletchley]], [[Milton Keynes]] Supercentre which opened in November 2005 is currently the largest Asda Supercentre with a net sales floor of over {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpsl.com/news.php?id=89 |title=Rose :: Latest News |publisher=Rpsl.com |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> This was preceded in June 2002 by the Eastlands, Manchester store which was the largest store at the time with a sales area of {{convert|110000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} but is currently the second largest Asda Supercentre, and the third largest is located in [[Minworth]], West Midlands, followed by Patchway.

===Asda Superstores===
Asda superstores are large supermarkets with a non-food offer slightly smaller than an Asda Supercentre. As of 31 October 2020, there are 341 superstores. Most superstores have a petrol filling station and dining and refreshment facilities for shoppers such as customer cafes, and selected stores have [[McDonald's]] franchise restaurants or "Express Diners" The [[Old Kent Road]], [[Scunthorpe]] and [[Colindale]] stores are trialling a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] franchise. There are currently no plans to roll the Subway franchise out across the chain.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/> {{Gallery

===Asda Supermarket===
In May 2010, Asda announced the purchase of the 193 UK stores of Danish discount retailer [[Netto (store)|Netto]] in a £778&nbsp;million deal. But the Competition Commission made them sell off 47 of the stores to other retailers. The remaining stores continued to trade as Netto stores until early 2011, when Asda integrated the stores into its supermarkets division, designated for shops smaller than {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10171193.stm|title=Asda to take over Netto stores in UK|publisher=BBC News |date=27 May 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100530083918/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10171193.stm| archive-date= 30 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> These former Netto stores form the core of the Asda Supermarket format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://retailanalysis.igd.com/news/news-article/t/asda-trials-new-smaller-supermarket-format/i/7803|title=Asda trials new smaller supermarket format|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Retail Analysis|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> As of 31 October 2020, there are 209 supermarkets.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

===Asda Living===
[[File:Asda Living - Crown Point Retail Park - geograph.org.uk - 1145714.jpg|thumb|right|An ''Asda Living'' branch in Leeds.]]
In October 2003, Asda launched a new format called '''Asda Living'''. This is the company's first "general merchandise" store, containing all its non-food ranges including clothing, home electronics, toys, homewares, health, and beauty products. With these stores they have linked up with [[Compass Group]] who operate the coffee shop Living Cafe within some of the stores. The first store with this format opened in [[Walsall]], West Midlands. As at 31 October 2020, there are 33 stores.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

===George stores===
In 2004, the George clothing brand was extended to a number of standalone George stores on the high street; the first George standalone store to open was in Preston. In 2008, all George standalone stores were closed due to high rental costs resulting in low profitability.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/2785581/Asda-calls-it-a-day-for-George.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Hall | title=Asda calls it a day for George | date=5 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2011, Asda announced its intention to establish a small number of pilot George stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/archives/press-centre/05/2011|title=News & Blogs|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> In January 2012 Asda announced that it had agreed to terms with two franchise partners to open international George stores. Through the agreement with SandpiperCI, based in the Channel Islands, the company will be responsible for opening George franchises in both Jersey and Guernsey, and through the Azadea Group, headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, the George franchise stores would open in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/archives/press-centre/01/2012|title=News & Blogs|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

===Asda Essentials===
In April 2006, Asda launched a new trial format called 'Asda Essentials' in a former [[Supermarket cooperative|Co-op]] store in [[Northampton]], followed by another in [[Pontefract]] a month later. This was the old Kwik-Save building for Pontefract.<ref name="essential">{{cite news|title=Asda's new stores prove not-so-Essential in the discount market|first=Julia|last=Finch|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 December 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/05/supermarkets.asda|accessdate=9 October 2008 }}</ref> The stores were modelled on France's [[Leader Price]] chain, with a smaller floorplate than Asda's mainstream stores and with a primary focus on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that were perceived to be at the "core" of a family's weekly shop with the aim being to challenge the dominance of Tesco and Sainsbury's in the convenience store market while at the same time addressing competition from discount supermarkets such as [[Aldi]], [[Lidl]] and [[Netto (store)|Netto]].<ref name="essential" /> On 6 December 2006, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets, while the range of branded products being carried was also being expanded due to customer demand.<ref name="essential" /> In January 2007 it was announced that the original Northampton trial store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igd.com/analysis/news/index.asp?nid=3468 |title=Asda Essentials trial continues despite store closure |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=11 January 2007 |publisher=IGD Retail Analysis |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004343/http://www.igd.com/analysis/news/index.asp?nid=3468 |archive-date=13 July 2011 }}</ref>

===Asda Petrol===
In 2012, Asda trialled a new standalone petrol filling station format (which means that they are not attached to or near an existing Asda store) at two locations in Sale, Greater Manchester and Leeds Bridge, which is located opposite head office. They include a small convenience store and click and collect facilities. The trial was a success and in 2014, a full roll out of this format was announced after a third site opened in Northolt, West London. In February 2015, 15 petrol filling stations were acquired from Rontec Ltd, and converted to the new format. Asda originally aimed to have at least 100 standalone forecourts by 2018. However, in October 2015, the company decided to slow the roll out down to address the problems associated with a major collapse of profits from its large store formats due to intense competition from its main rivals. But, the company is still continuing to add a combination of fully automated credit/debit card payment only petrol stations and petrol stations with traditional forecourt shops within the car parks of its existing store portfolio and to new store sites.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

Asda was also the first supermarket chain in the United Kingdom to sell petrol at its old Halifax store in 1967, which at the time was located inside a converted mill in Battinson Road which burnt down during a major fire in 1982, and subsequently reopened as a purpose-built store in 1983, without the petrol station. The store moved to a different site in 2004. Back then its forecourt fuel was supplied by discount Russian supplier Nafta, because the major oil companies would not supply fuel to be sold at discount prices. From the early seventies, oil companies such as Mobil, Shell and Texaco supplied fuel to Asda as more supermarkets started to sell fuel from car park forecourts. Since the mid-1990s Asda has supplied, along with its main supermarket rivals, its own fuel delivered by its own tankers to its petrol station forecourts.  As of June 2018, Asda operates 319 petrol stations in total, 18 of which are standalone and the others mostly within the car park area of its stores.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

Under the new Asda management team it was decided to reintroduce the Farm Stores brand on selected fresh food products, as part of the company's plans to return and reconnect to its core founding heritage. These products include fresh meat and produce. The Farm Stores brand was officially relaunched in April 2017. In 2018, Asda announced to scrap 5p carrier bags in all stores by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/05/asda-joins-wave-of-supermarkets-pledging-to-cut-plastic-waste|title=Asda joins wave of supermarkets pledging to cut plastic waste|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=5 February 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>

===George clothing===
Asda has its own range of clothing known as '''George''', which was created and trialled in selected stores in 1989, and officially launched and rolled out to the main superstore estate in 1990. It replaced the older Asdale/Asda clothing labels of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/design/article/554301/superbrand-case-studies-george/ |title=Superbrands case studies: George |publisher=Brand Republic |date=18 April 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118134305/http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/design/article/554301/superbrand-case-studies-george/ |archive-date=18 January 2013 }}</ref> This is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. Walmart also sells the George brand in Argentina, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the US (and in South Korea until Walmart pulled out of that market). George clothing is also sold at four stand alone dedicated stores in Malta, the first opening in 2013. The label is named after [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]], founder of [[Next (clothing)|Next]], who was its original chief designer. Davies himself parted company with Asda in 2000 and is no longer associated with the brand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4471919/Founder-George-Davies-walks-away-from-Asda.html |title=Founder George Davies walks away from Asda |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 November 2000 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2005, Asda stated that the George range was a £1.75&nbsp;billion business, including sales from Walmart stores in the United States and Germany. [[Mintel]] estimate that George is the fourth largest retailer of clothing in the United Kingdom, after [[Marks & Spencer]], the [[Arcadia Group]] and Next.<ref>[[Mintel]] Clothing Retailing – UK, July 2005</ref>

Asda was the first supermarket to stock [[wedding dress]]es. Part of the George line, they cost £60 while adult bridesmaid dresses ranged between £30 and £35, at launch.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/23/uasda.xml&sSheet=/portal/2006/01/23/ixportaltop.html Supermarket unveils £60 wedding dress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224021026/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2006%2F01%2F23%2Fuasda.xml&sSheet=%2Fportal%2F2006%2F01%2F23%2Fixportaltop.html |date=24 December 2007 }} ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London).

===Asda Money===
Asda has a [[financial services]] division, similar to those operated by [[Tesco]], [[Sainsbury's]] and other retailers. Asda simply [[White-label product|attaches its own brand to products provided by other companies]]. Services offered include car insurance (provided by Brightside Insurance Services), credit cards (provided by Creation Financial Services) and travel money bureaux (provided by [[Travelex]]). The financial services division of the organisation does not directly sell these services in store and instead uses the supplier of that product by telephone or online/postal application. Marketing and management of financial services is co-ordinated in house and many stores have a financial services co-ordinator, responsible for promoting the products and ensuring legal compliance. The Financial Services division is also responsible for [[gift card]]s, Christmas Saver and Business Rewards.<ref>

===Medicine===
Many larger stores have a pharmacy.  In July 2020 the company started an in-store virtual [[general practitioner]] service in partnership with health tech company [[Medicspot]].  It is to be launched at the Asda Supercentre in [[Stevenage]].  Real-time diagnostics - a connected stethoscope, pulse oximeter, blood pressure monitor, contactless thermometer, and a close inspection camera - will be available in the pharmacy and patients can consult a GP remotely without the need to book an appointment in advance.

The company was fined £850,000 in 2006 for offering 340 staff at a [[Dartford]] depot a pay rise in return for giving up a union [[collective bargaining agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Asda Guilty of Anti Trade Union Activity|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Asda-Wal-Mart-guilty-of-anti-trade-union-activity|date=14 February 2006|website=Food And Drink Europe|accessdate=3 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929025840/http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Asda-Wal-Mart-guilty-of-anti-trade-union-activity|archive-date=29 September 2011}}</ref>
Poor relations continued as Asda management attempted to introduce new rights and working practices shortly thereafter at another centre in [[Washington, Tyne and Wear]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Asda's Escalating dispute with GMB|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/asdas-escalating-dispute-with-gmb-turns-into-political-row-467136.html|date=20 February 2006|work=The Independent|accessdate=18 February 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090317211957/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/asdas-escalating-dispute-with-gmb-turns-into-political-row-467136.html| archive-date= 17 March 2009 | url-status= live| first=Barrie| last=Clement| location=London}}</ref>

Some compromise was reached by June of that year, when a five-day strike was called off after Asda management and the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB union]] reached an agreement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Asda Industrial Action Called Off|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5128260.stm|date=29 June 2006|work=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>

Relations have improved since, with both Asda and the GMB marking the death of a worker together on [[Workers' Memorial Day]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=GMB Members and Asda Bedford Mark International Workers' Memorial Day 2010 |url=http://www.gmb.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1027 |date=26 April 2010 |website=GMB |accessdate=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710044416/http://www.gmb.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1027 |archive-date=10 July 2010 }}</ref>

In 2013, tens of thousands of Asda workers across the UK were hit with a tax complication because of an anomaly in Asda's payroll system. Asda employees receive their pay every four weeks, which meant, according to their spokesperson, that once every 20 years they are paid 14 times a year rather than 13. Whilst most companies handle this properly, Asda's payroll system did not, which meant that workers had, through no fault of their own, paid less tax for the year than they should have. This resulted in most full-time and a small number of part-time workers receiving a demand from [[HM Revenue & Customs]] for between £72 and £160.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tax shock for thousands of Asda workers|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk/exclusive-tax-shock-for-thousands-of-asda-workers-1.113215|publisher=thecourier|accessdate=1 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925132343/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk/exclusive-tax-shock-for-thousands-of-asda-workers-1.113215|archive-date=25 September 2013}}</ref>

==Marketing==
[[File:Asda self service petrol station, Middleton, Leeds (3rd May 2015).JPG|thumb|right|An unmanned Asda petrol station in [[Middleton, Leeds]].]]
In the 'Asda price' campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=TA2532&advertiser=ASDA|title = Asda 'Thank You' TV ad – 30 sec advert|publisher=www.tellyads.com|accessdate =9 October 2008}}</ref> customers tap their trouser pocket twice, producing a 'chinking' sound as the coins that Asda's low prices have supposedly left in their pockets knock together. The pocket tap ads were launched in 1977 and over the next 30 years, a range of celebrities have been "tappers", including from 1978, actors [[Richard Beckinsale]], [[Paula Wilcox]] and [[James Bolam]]. And later, [[Julie Walters]], and football player [[Michael Owen]]. In the late 1970s, adverts also included Sitcom actor [[Leonard Rossiter]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/18/asda-pocket-tap-adverts|title=Asda brings back 'pocket tap' ads |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=15 July 2009| first=Mark| last=Sweney| date=18 March 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801194231/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/18/asda-pocket-tap-adverts| archive-date= 1 August 2009 | url-status= live}}

In 1980, ''Carry On'' actress [[Hattie Jacques]] appeared in the advert as a [[Crossing guard|school crossing patrol officer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uktvadverts.com/Home/Search.aspx?advert=5523 |title="Info for Superstores – Asda" at Vuktvadverts.com |publisher=Uktvadverts.com |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> Between 1981 and 1985, Asda used the slogan 'All Together Better' in conjunction with the 'Asda Price' pocket tap campaign in TV commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements. When the new green capitalised ASDA logo started to appear from 1985, in early 1986 onwards and until early 1989, two slogans were used. The first, 'You'd be off your trolley to go anywhere else', was replaced in 1987 by 'One trip and you're laughing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1OAL8zvco|title=One trip and you're laughing|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1989, and until late 1991, before the reintroduction of the pocket tap campaign, advertising for Asda had featured the [[Fairground Attraction]] song "[[Perfect (Fairground Attraction song)|Perfect]]" with the slogan 'It 'Asda be Asda', which was based upon the lyrics of the song. When the Asda Price slogan was reintroduced in 1992, the strapline Pocket the Difference (capitalised) was added alongside it. This was replaced by Permanently Low Prices, Forever in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/supermarket-set-boulder-go--3152424|title=Supermarket set to boulder go...|publisher=Coventry Live|date=28 January 2004|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In December 1997, the [[Spice Girls]] licensed their name and image to Asda for the creation of over 40 different Spice Items for Christmas 1997, including goods such as party supplies, official merchandise, and Spice Girl branded [[kids' meal]]s in the stores' restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/asda-signs-spice-girls/2038960.article |title=Asda signs Spice Girls &#124; Archive |publisher=Marketing Week |date=25 September 1997 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> The Spice Girls reportedly earned £1&nbsp;million from the deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/28946.stm |title=Spice sales not so hot |work=[[BBC News]] |date=10 November 1997 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

In the smiley face "rollback" campaign, also used by Walmart, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] smiley face bounced from price tag to price tag, knocking them down as customers watch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/01/06/asda-ploughs-300m-latest-rollback-campaign|title=Asda ploughs £300m into latest rollback campaign|date=6 January 2015|publisher=The Drum|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 2006, Asda advertising was themed around singing children and the slogan "More for you for less", and the previous tap of the trouser pocket advertising was reduced to a double-tap on a stylised 'A', still producing the 'chinking' sound.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

For Christmas 2007, Asda reintroduced the "That's Asda price" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=TA5261&advertiser=Asda|title = Asda 'Something Big' TV ad – 20 sec advert|publisher=www.tellyads.com|accessdate =9 October 2008}}</ref>

In 2008, the company refocused on price with a "Why Pay More?" campaign both on TV and in stores. Asda TV commercials in April 2009 focused on price comparisons between Asda and its rivals, using information from [[mySupermarket]]. The music being used in these adverts is the [[Billy Childish]] version of the classic ''[[Dad's Army]]'' theme tune. The old Asda jingle is not included in these,<ref>

Asda has been winner of ''[[The Grocer]]'' magazine "Lowest Price Supermarket" Award for the past 16 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/asda-was-always-cheapest-but-now-its-the-favourite/218842.article|title=Asda was always cheapest, but now it's the favourite|publisher=www.thegrocer.co.uk|date=18 June 2011|accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> and uses this to promote itself across the UK. In August 2005, rival supermarket chain [[Tesco]] challenged Asda's ability to use the claim that it was the cheapest supermarket in the country, by complaining to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Agency]]. The ASA upheld the complaint and ordered Asda to stop using it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4158368.stm |title=Asda made to drop low price claim|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News|date= 17 August 2005|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>

==Corporate social responsibility==

===Energy efficiency===
Asda was the top-performing supermarket in the [[CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme]] Performance League Table, coming in at 37 and beating [[Morrisons]] at 56, [[Tesco]] at 93, and [[Sainsbury's]] at 164.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crc.environment-agency.gov.uk/pplt/web/plt/public/2010-11/CRCPerformanceLeagueTable20102011 |title=2010/2011 – CRC Performance League Table |publisher=Crc.environment-agency.gov.uk |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>

===Ethical trading===
Asda has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which respects workers' rights for freedom of association and a living wage. Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of a living wage varies by country and the buying strategies of a major importer like Asda have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses from going elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cleanupfashion.co.uk/companies/asda.php |title = Clean Up Fashion; Asda Walmart |accessdate = 23 November 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220070605/http://www.cleanupfashion.co.uk/companies/asda.php |archive-date = 20 December 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Industry pressure groups such as [[Labour Behind the Label]] and [[War on Want]] have argued that Asda and other budget retailers use unethical labour practices in the developing world to keep UK prices low.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Victims|url=http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/13593-fashion-victims|date=15 December 2006|website=War on Want|accessdate=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314033909/http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/13593-fashion-victims|archive-date=14 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Victims II |url=http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/16360-fashion-victims-ii |date=1 December 2008 |website=War on Want |accessdate=18 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054854/http://waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/16360-fashion-victims-ii |archive-date=2 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers' Union]], representing UK farmers and growers, has argued that Asda and other major supermarkets have made large profits and kept consumer prices low "by squeezing suppliers' margins to the point where many of them have gone out of business".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfuonline.com/x16312.xml |title=Dismay at commitment to cheap food by ASDA |accessdate=30 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314022517/http://www.nfuonline.com/x16312.xml |archive-date=14 March 2012 }}</ref> Asda have also refused to sign up to and donate to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, to donate compensation to the families of workers in Bangladesh killed when their factory building in Rana Plaza collapsed in 2013. Instead, Asda donated an undisclosed sum to the poverty relief charity ''Building Relationships Across Communities'', who in turn pledged around £1.3m to the fund. Campaigners believe Asda is unwilling to set a precedent on indemnity pay for large scale industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-6a90-Rana-Plaza-One-year-on,-no-justice|title= One year on, no justice|work=Morningstar Online|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2009, Asda's [[Valentine's Day]] roses, sold at £2 for a dozen, were said to be ethically sourced by the supermarket. This claim went against research carried out by [[War on Want]].<ref>{{cite web|title=£2 Valentine flowers poverty alert|url=http://www.waronwant.org/news/press-releases/16464-p2-valentine-flowers-poverty-alert|date=13 February 2009|website=War on Want|accessdate=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216084007/http://waronwant.org/news/press-releases/16464-p2-valentine-flowers-poverty-alert|archive-date=16 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Call for boycott===
In October 2010, Chairman Andy Bond was a signatory to a controversial letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8069609/Osbornes-cuts-will-strengthen-Britains-economy-by-allowing-the-private-sector-to-generate-more-jobs.html |title=Osborne’s cuts will strengthen Britain’s economy by allowing the private sector to generate more jobs|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date= 18 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> which claimed that "The private sector should be more than capable of generating additional jobs to replace those lost in the public sector, and the redeployment of people to more productive activities will improve economic performance, so generating more employment opportunities." This was followed by calls by the pressure group ''Liberal Conspiracy'' for a [[boycott]] of Asda, as well as the companies represented by the other signatories to the letter on the grounds that "Companies that support the [[Spending Review|CSR]] are failed corporate citizens."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/10/24/why-im-boycotting-the-35-businesses-who-support-the-cuts/ |title=Why I'm boycotting the 35 businesses who support the cuts|first= Kate |last=Belgrave|website=Liberal Conspiracy|date= 24 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Dairy price fixing===
In December 2007, Asda, [[Sainsbury's]] and other retailers and dairy firms admitted to the [[price fixing]] of [[dairy product]]s between 2002 and 2003.<ref name="milk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm |title=Supermarkets admit milk price fix |work=BBC News |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> The price fixing operation was calculated to have cost consumers around £270&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dairy Price Fixing Firms Fined Millions|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/Asda-and-Sainsburys-Fined-Over-Dairy-Price-Fixing/Article/20071211296071?lid=ARTICLE_1296071_Asda%20and%20Sainsbury's%20Fined%20Over%20Dairy%20Price%20Fixing&lpos=Business_0

Asda commented, "''Everyone at Asda regrets what happened, particularly as we are passionate about lowering prices. Our intention was to provide more money for dairy farmers, who were under severe financial pressure at the time.''"<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm |title=Supermarkets admit milk price fix |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> In total, Asda was fined £18.21&nbsp;million by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] for its part in the [[cartel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/89-11#.UiYwetJciCc |title=OFT fines certain supermarkets and processors almost £50&nbsp;million in dairy decision - The Office of Fair Trading |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819154929/http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/89-11 |archive-date=19 August 2013 }}</ref>

===False and misleading advertising===
In 2010, a national press ad for Asda on a double-page spread was headed "The big Asda Rollback" with headings stating "Lower prices on everything you buy, week in week out" with equal prominence to a column headed "Lower prices than any other supermarket"; that the arrows underneath the heading "Lower prices than any other supermarket" compared prices at Asda with prices at Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons. The ASA ruled that in the context in which it appeared, it was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted either as referring to price reductions that had taken place within Asda or to price comparisons with the named competitors. In addition, because the ad did not explain that the price reductions had not necessarily taken place in the week that immediately preceded the ad, they concluded that the headings which stated the number of price reductions that had taken place in each product category were misleading. The ASA also concluded that the "Lower prices than any other supermarket" claim in the advert was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2010/9/Asda-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49062.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA disagreed, and referred to the claim "Everything is at least half price!" was likely to imply to viewers that all toys were included in the sale. As all toys were not included in the sale, and in the absence of a qualifying statement, the ad was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/1/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49580.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA ruled that a television advertisement in 2011 for the new Asda price guarantee was misleading in that the small on-screen text that stated "Exclusions apply" was not sufficient to warn viewers that the Asda price guarantee did not apply to non-grocery items.<ref name="asa.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/2/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49664.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA also ruled against two national press ads one which showed hardback and children's books and one that showed football related items with text stating "If your grocery shopping could have cost less elsewhere we'll give you the difference - Guaranteed!". Although each advert had "Exclusions apply" and that other text stated "If your grocery shopping could have cost less elsewhere we'll give you the difference", it felt that given the prominent appearance of the hardback and children's activity books and football related items and the prominent appearance of the logo "ASDA Price GUARANTEE" and "Guaranteed!", they considered the footnote and other text referred to above was not sufficient to warn readers that non-grocery items particularly those included in the advertisement were not included in the Asda price guarantee.<ref name="asa.org.uk"/>

Another advertisement from Asda, in which it featured World Cup related products and an Asda price guarantee was misleading as the World Cup related products were exclusive to Asda and not, therefore, available at Morrisons, Tesco or Sainsbury's.<ref name="asa.org.uk"/>

In 2009, the ASA challenged whether a press ad which showed a large green arrow bearing down on a smaller yellow arrow with a crumpled tip and "Asda 2955 products cheaper" should set out how the general price claims made in the ads could be verified by consumers. Because it was not possible for consumers or competitors to check the products and prices used in the comparison using mySupermarket.co.uk, and because the ads did not set out how consumers and competitors could check that information for themselves, the ASA concluded that the ads did not satisfy the criterion of verifiability as defined in the 2006 European Court of Justice ruling, and were therefore in breach of the advertising Codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/1/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_45639.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA ruled that, due to the significant limitations and qualifications to the basis of the price comparison which were not included in the ad, or in the terms and conditions on Asda's website, the approach taken in making the comparisons was unfair and misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/9/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_176272.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

A press ad, which appeared on 26 September 2011, was headlined "Only one supermarket is ... always 10% cheaper or we'll give you the difference guaranteed". However, at the top of the ad there was a banner that contained the claims "SALE", "Half Price", "Price Drop", "50% off", "1/2 price", "cheap" and that part of the headline claim "... always 10% cheaper" appeared in bold text in the middle of the ad. The ASA considered the banner, together with the headline was likely to be interpreted by consumers as claims that referred to the price of Asda goods. Since consumers could interpret that claim as one which guaranteed to refund the difference, should Asda not be the lowest on price, the ASA considered the presence of the claim "only one supermarket is always 10% cheaper" could create the impression that Asda were always 10% cheaper and would be interpreted as a 'lowest price' claim. The ASA therefore concluded that the advert was misleading. It also noted the footnote explaining the APG contradicted Asda's absolute claim that they were always the lowest on price, and that the disclaimer was also misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/3/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_175453.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, a four-page regional press wraparound included several maps and images of a proposed development in [[New Barnet]], and described the benefits the development would bring to the local area. The advert included a development site plan and map, which marked out the proposed Asda store, the existing Sainsbury store and the sites of the proposed, approved and existing Tesco stores. Because it was not clear that the marked-out area relating to the Asda store was for only the store floorspace, whereas the marked-out area relating to the Sainsburys store included store floorspace and additional buildings, and the marked-out area relating to the proposed Tesco area was not based on an approved plan, the ASA concluded the advertisement was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/11/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_47195.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>
