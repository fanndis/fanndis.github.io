A '''curfew''' is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/curfew|title=curfew - definition of curfew in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/curfew|title=Curfew - Define Curfew at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their houses or homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.

Curfews are a common element of control used in [[martial law]], though curfews can also be implemented for public safety in the event of a disaster or crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/curfew-laws.html|title=Curfew Laws|website=FindLaw}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "curfew" comes from the [[Old French]] phrase "''couvre-feu''", which means "cover fire". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as "curfeu", which later became the modern "curfew".<ref>{{OED|curfew}}</ref> Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William the Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Curfew|year=1726|encyclopedia=[[Bailey's dictionary|Bailey's Dictionary]]|url=https://archive.org/details/universaletymolo00bailuoft/page/n235/mode/2up?q=Curfew|page=235|edition=third}}</ref>

==Historical==
The first formal "curfew order" was introduced in 1918 by the British board of trade, which ordered shops and entertainment establishments to extinguish their lights by 10:30&nbsp;p.m. in order to save fuel during [[World War I]] <ref>{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Doyle (writer) |date=July 2012  |title=First World War Britain: 1914–1919 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=24 |isbn=9780747811299}}</ref>

==Types==
# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s. In recent times, curfews are imposed by many countries during medical [[epidemic|epidemics]] or [[pandemic|pandemics]] such as the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; see below.
# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].
# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a "curfew" time, also known as "last orders". In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}</ref>

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order under the ''Police Ordinance''. Under the [[State of emergency#Sri Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/5405822.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Wear - Late night youth curfew a success|work=bbc.co.uk|date=4 October 2006}}</ref> the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government's 'Anti-Yob'/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}</ref>

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk|date=12 March 2015}}</ref> A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem "[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|title=peak district local history, customs, wildlife, transport - Peakland Heritage|work=peaklandheritage.org.uk|access-date=2008-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100324/http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|archive-date=2008-12-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serves its original function.

===United States===

====Juvenile curfews====
Curfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.
Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state<ref>{{cite web|url=https://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/|title=Curfews in New York · 411 NY|website=411newyork.org}}</ref> and even by county or municipality. In some cities, there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.<ref>{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192
|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}</ref> but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|title=Curfews » City of Faribault, MN|work=faribault.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034013/http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/juvenile-curfew-laws-arrests/|title=Impact of juvenile curfew laws on arrests of youth and adults|date=November 29, 2011}}</ref> However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jjie.org/2013/10/14/op-ed-why-dont-youth-curfews-work/ |title=OP-ED: Why Don't Youth Curfews Work?|author= Mike Males |date= October 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/repealing-juvenile-curfew-laws-could-make-cities-safer/ 
|title=Repealing juvenile curfew laws could make cities safer|author=Jennifer L.

There are also concerns about [[racial profiling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_curfew_data_93_per.html|title=New Orleans curfew data: 93 percent of curfew arrestees are black|work=NOLA.com}}</ref> In response to concerns about racial profiling, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514002127/http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 }}</ref>

====Mall curfews====
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|title=Upscale Mall Enforces Teen Curfew & Dress Code|work=cbslocal.com|access-date=2013-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231600/http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|archive-date=2013-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northparkcenter.com/Code-of-Conduct|title=Code of Conduct - NorthPark Center|work=northparkcenter.com}}</ref> Such policies are known as ''mall curfews.'' Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as ''parental escort policies.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|title=Parental Escort Policy|work=mallofamerica.com|access-date=2013-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729010550/http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|archive-date=2014-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Curfews for all====
States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely [[inclement weather]] or [[political dissent|political unrest]]. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as [[elected official]]s, [[law enforcement]] personnel, [[first responder]]s, [[health care]] workers, and the [[mass media]].

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration. That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

In 2015, the city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]].

In 2020, citywide curfews were enacted in major cities all across the country due to [[George Floyd protests|protests]] regarding the [[killing of George Floyd]]. Countywide curfews were enacted for [[Los Angeles County, California]] and [[Alameda County, California]] as well. [[Arizona]] enacted a statewide curfew. Local ordinances and state statutes may make it unlawful for minors below a certain age to be on public streets, unless they are accompanied by a parent or an adult or on lawful and necessary business on behalf of their parents or guardians. For example, a Michigan state law provides that "[n]o minor under the age of 12 years shall loiter, idle or congregate in or on any public street, highway, alley or park between the hours of 10 o'clock p.m. and 6 o'clock a.m., unless the minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian, or some adult delegated by the parent or guardian to accompany the child." MCLA § 722.751; MSA § 28.342(1). Curfew laws in other states and cities typically set forth different curfews for minors of different ages.
