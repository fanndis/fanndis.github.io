== Family and early life==
Bondevik was born in [[Molde]], the son of Johannes Bondevik, a principal at the Christian [[folk high school]] Rauma folkehøyskole who also was a local politician for the Christian Democratic Party,<ref>[http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/article905241.ece Bondevik mistet faren] {{in lang|no}} ''[[Nettavisen]]'', 19 February 2007, retrieved 20 July 2013</ref> and Margit, née Hæreid. He became a theological candidate from [[MF Norwegian School of Theology]] in 1975.<ref>[[Erling Rimehaug]] in [[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]: [http://nbl.snl.no/Kjell_Magne_Bondevik/utdypning Kjell Magne Bondevik] {{in lang|no}} [[Store norske leksikon]], retrieved 20 July 2013</ref> In 1979 he was ordained as pastor in the (Lutheran) [[Church of Norway]].<ref name=Jones2011Fighting/> He is married to Bjørg Bondevik (née Rasmussen) and has three children: Bjørn (born 1972), Hildegunn (born 1973) and John Harald (born 1976). Kjell Magne Bondevik is the nephew of politician [[Kjell Bondevik]], the cousin of former bishop [[Odd Bondevik]] and brother in law of author and priest [[Eyvind Skeie]].<ref name=stjerneklart>Viggo Valle and Per Kristian Johansen (2 June 2008): [http://www.nrk.no/programmer/radio/stjerneklart/1.5872558 Stjerneklart med Kjell Magne Bondevik] {{in lang|no}} [[NRK]], retrieved 20 July 2013</ref>

==Political career==
In 2008, Bondevik said that he regards himself as a "[[Protests of 1968|68'er]]", and that he was "influenced by the radical wind of the time". While he remained in the movement of [[Norwegian Young Christian Democrats|Young Christian Democrats (Norway, KrFU)]], he claims to have "radicalized the organization to great despair in the party". He has also said that he would likely rather have "oriented" himself towards the [[Socialist People's Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]], had his radicalization of the Christian Democratic Party not gone through.<ref>Anfindsen, 2010, p. 249.</ref>

Representing the Christian Democratic Party, Bondevik was a member of the [[Storting]] (Parliament) from 1973 to 2005. He was his party's parliamentary leader in the periods of 1981–1983, 1986–1989, 1993–1997, 1997, and 2000–2001, and party leader from 1983 to 1995. In this position, he was succeeded by [[Valgerd Svarstad Haugland]]. He was also [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Jan P. Syse]]'s government of 1989–1990, [[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Church and Education]] in [[Kåre Willoch]]'s government 1983–1986, also Prime Minister Willoch's deputy 1985–1986, and [[state secretary]] at the Office of the Prime Minister during [[Lars Korvald]]'s government 1972–1973.

=== As Prime Minister===
Bondevik's first term as Prime Minister lasted from 17 October 1997 to 3 March 2000, in a [[coalition]] [[first cabinet Bondevik|cabinet]] consisting of the Christian Democratic Party, the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] and the [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberal Party]].

While serving his first term as Prime Minister, Bondevik attracted international attention in August 1998 when he announced that he was suffering from [[clinical depression|depressive episode]], becoming the highest ranking world [[leadership|leader]] to admit to suffering from a mental illness while in office. Upon this revelation, [[Anne Enger]] became acting Prime Minister for three weeks, from 30 August to 23 September, while he recovered from the depressive episode. Bondevik then returned to office. Bondevik received thousands of supportive letters, and said that the experience had been positive overall, both for himself and because it made mental illness more publicly acceptable.<ref name=Jones2011Fighting>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Ben|last2=Bondevik|first2=Kjell Magne|title=Fighting stigma with openness|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=December 2011|volume=89|issue=12|pages=862–863|doi=10.2471/BLT.11.041211|pmid=22271941|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-041211/en/index.html|accessdate=19 July 2013|pmc=3260893}}</ref><ref>[[BBC]] [[Newsnight]], 21 January 2008.</ref>

Bondevik's first cabinet was defeated by a [[motion of no confidence]] in March 2000 as a result of a dispute over the construction of gas-fired power stations<ref>{{Cite web|title=NORWAY: Row over gas-fired power stations topples Government|url=https://www.edie.net/news/0/NORWAY-Row-over-gas-fired-power-stations-topples-Government/2426/|access-date=2020-06-05|website=edie.net|language=en}}</ref> and was replaced by a [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] government led by [[Jens Stoltenberg]] until their defeat in the [[2001 Norwegian parliamentary election|2001 parliamentary election]]. Bondevik then formed his [[second cabinet Bondevik|second cabinet]], consisting of the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]], the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] and the [[Venstre (Norway)|Liberal Party]], which took office on 19 October 2001.

The second Bondevik government carried out reforms and left a booming economy; however, Bondevik was defeated in the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]], with 81 seats obtained for Bondevik's coalition and its supporters to the opposition [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|Red-Green Coalition]]'s 88.

Bondevik announced his retirement from national-level politics at the end of his term as prime minister, and did not seek re-election for his seat in parliament.

==Post-premiership==

The [[Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights]] was founded by Bondevik in January 2006. The purpose of the centre is to work for world [[peace]], [[human rights]] and inter-religious tolerance worldwide. The centre cooperates closely with the [[Carter Center]] in [[Atlanta]], the [[Kim Dae Jung Library]] in [[Seoul]] and the [[Crisis Management Initiative]] in [[Helsinki]].

On 31 October 2006, he published his memoir, called ''Et liv i spenning'' (''A life of excitement and tension'').

On 31 January 2017, he was the first high-ranking politician from another country detained and questioned in the United States as a result of President [[Donald Trump]]'s executive orders banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations, because of a diplomatic visit to Iran he had made in 2014.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/former-norway-pm-bondevik-held-washington-dulles-airport-2014-visit-iran?CMP=fb_gu Former Norway PM held at Washington airport over 2014 visit to Iran] [[The Guardian]].

==Awards and decorations==
Bondevik was awarded the [[Order of St. Olav|Grand Cross of St. Olav]] in 2004, the first sitting Norwegian Prime Minister to receive the Order of St. Olav in 80 years. The award happened due to a change in the Statutes of the Order with automatic awards to the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Government that stirred some debate and criticism.<ref name=stjerneklart/><ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2004/09/18/408659.html Orden på Bondevik] {{in lang|no}} ''[[Dagbladet]]'', retrieved 20 July 2013</ref> With the succeeding [[Jens Stoltenberg|Stoltenberg Government]], the practice was halted.<ref>[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/artikkel.php?artid=197383 Den siste ære] {{in lang|no}} ''[[Verdens Gang|VG]]'', retrieved 20 July 2013</ref>
