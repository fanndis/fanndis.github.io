==History==
{{Main|History of Oakland, California}}
{{Further|Timeline of Oakland, California}}

===Pre-incorporation===
The earliest known inhabitants were the Huchiun natives, who lived there for thousands of years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the [[Ohlone]] (a [[Miwok]] word meaning "western people").<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ |title = Ohlone Tribal Regions Map |access-date=April 15, 2007 |last=Milliken |first=Randall |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813110544/http://www.nativecc.com/OhloneTribalMap.html/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = August 13, 2007}}</ref> In Oakland, they were concentrated around [[Lake Merritt]] and [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], a stream that enters the San Francisco Bay at [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].

In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was colonized, along with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the King of Spain. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to [[Luis María Peralta]] for his [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]]. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411053608/http://oakland-california.co.tv/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2011 |title=Oakland-california.co.tv |publisher=Oakland-california.co.tv |access-date=April 19, 2012 }}</ref> Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons.

Adams, 1932 |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |access-date=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

According to [[Stanford University]] historian Albert Camarillo, the Peralta family struggled to keep their land after the incorporation of California into the United States after the [[Mexican–American War]]. Camarillo claims the family was the victim of targeted racial violence. He writes in ''Chicanos in California'', "They lost everything when squatters cut down their fruit trees, killed their cattle, destroyed their buildings, and even fenced off the roads leading to the rancho. Especially insidious were the actions of attorney [[Horace Carpentier]], who tricked Vicente Peralta into signing a 'lease' which turned out to be a mortgage against the 19,000-acre rancho. The lands became Carpentier's when Peralta refused to repay the loan he believed was fraudulently incurred. The Peraltas had no choice but to abandon the homesite they had occupied for two generations."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Camarillo |first1=Albert |title=Chicanos in California: A History of Mexican Americans in California |date=1979 |publisher=Boyd & Fraser |isbn=978-0878351282 |page=16 |edition=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/chicanosincalifo00albe |access-date=29 July 2020}}</ref>

=== Development of Chinatown ===
During the 1850s&mdash;just as gold was discovered in California&mdash;Oakland started growing and further developing because land was becoming too expensive in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hometown Chinatown : the history of Oakland's Chinese community|last=Armentrout|first=Ma, L. Eve|isbn=9781138862791|location=New York|oclc=898926053|date = 2015-02-27}}</ref> The Chinese were struggling financially as a result of the [[First Opium War]], the [[Second Opium War]], and the [[Taiping Rebellion]], so they began migrating to Oakland, many of whom were recruited to work on railroads. However, the Chinese struggled to settle because they were discriminated against by the white community and their living quarters were burned down on several occasions.<ref name="Iris">{{Cite book|title=The Chinese in America : A Narrative History |last=Iris |first=Chang |date=March 2004 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780142004173 |location=New York |oclc=55136302}}</ref> The majority of the Chinese migrants lived in unhealthy conditions in China and they often had diseases, so plague spread into San Francisco even though the Chinese were thoroughly inspected for diseases upon their arrival to San Francisco.<ref name="Iris"/>

===City beginnings===
[[File:1857 U.S. Coast Survey Map of San Antonio Creek and Oakland, California (near San Francisco) - Geographicus - SanAntonioCreek-uscs-1857.jpg|thumb|1857 Map of Oakland]]
In 1851, three men—[[Horace Carpentier]], Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Port of Oakland: 1850–1934|url=http://www.waterfrontaction.org/learn/wpa_hist_%201-6.pdf|website=waterfrontaction.org|page=1}}</ref> In 1852, the Town of Oakland was incorporated by the state legislature.<ref>[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1852/1852.PDF#page=13 ''Statutes of California'', 1852, p.180]</ref> During this time, Oakland had 75-100 inhabitants, two hotels, a wharf, two warehouses, and only cattle trails. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland.<ref>[https://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1854/1854.PDF#page=17 ''Statutes of California'', 1854, pp.183-187]</ref> Horace Carpentier was elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year.

The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] constructed the [[Oakland Long Wharf]] at Oakland Point, the site of today's [[Port of Oakland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|title=How Old Oakland's Historic Buildings Survived Decay (and Demolition)|last=Levi|first=Ryan|date=2019-05-09|website=KQED|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510034123/https://www.kqed.org/news/11745239/how-have-a-bunch-of-19th-century-victorians-survived-in-downtown-oakland|archive-date=May 10, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A number of [[horsecar]] and [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric [[streetcar]] set out from Oakland to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by [[Francis "Borax" Smith]] and consolidated into what eventually became known as the [[Key System]], the predecessor of today's publicly owned [[AC Transit]].

===1900–1950s===

==== Plague epidemic ====
Oakland was one of the worst affected cities in California that was impacted by the plague epidemic. [[Quarantine]] measures were set in place at the Oakland ports requiring the authorities at the port to inspect the arriving vessels for the presence of infected rats.<ref name="QuarantineNYT">{{cite news|title=QUARANTINE ORDERED AGAINST BUBONIC RATS|date=1925|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|103474660}}}}</ref> Quarantine authorities at these ports inspected over a thousand vessels per year for plague and yellow fever. By 1908, over 5,000 people were detained in quarantine.<ref name="howcommercespread">{{Cite book|title=Contagion : how commerce has spread disease|last=1964-|first=Harrison, Mark|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300123579|location=New Haven|oclc=785865143}}</ref> Hunters were sent to poison the affected areas in Oakland and shoot the squirrels, but the eradication work was limited in its range because the State Board of Health and the [[United States Public Health Service]] were only allotted about $60,000 a year to eradicate the disease. During this period Oakland did not have sufficient health facilities, so some of the infected patients were treated at home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A piece of my mind : a new collection of essays from JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2000|publisher=AMA Press|others=Young, Roxanne K.|isbn=9781579470821|location=Chicago|oclc=48003418|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pieceofmymindnew0000unse}}</ref>

The State Board of Health along with Oakland also advised physicians to promptly report any cases of infected patients.<ref name=":1" /> Yet, in 1919 it still resulted in a small epidemic of [[Pneumonic plague]] which killed a dozen people in Oakland.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=W.

==== Incorporation ====
[[File:Oakland Chevrolet factory c.1917.jpg|thumb|left|One day's output of 1917 automobiles at [[Chevrolet]]'s major [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] plant, now the location of [[Eastmont Town Center]]]]

At the time of incorporation in 1852, Oakland had consisted of the territory that lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902.

In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire.

In 1908 lawyer, former miner and newspaper owner Homer Wood (1880–1976) suggested to his friend Frank Bilger of Blake and Bilger Rock Quarry and Paving Company that he organize a gathering to establish a [[Rotary Club]] east of the bay. On November 27, 1908 Homer took a ferry across the bay in a driving rainstorm and met for lunch with Frank and twenty three other businessmen at the Hotel Metropole at 13th and Jefferson. This gathering became the first meeting of the Tri-City Rotary Club, renamed in 1911 The Rotary Club of Oakland, the third Rotary Club in the world. This group established the tradition of weekly meetings, something most clubs worldwide follow today.<ref>Hamilton, Linda Parker, ''The Rotary Club of Oakland, A Century of Service and Friendship'', Stories to Last. {{ISBN|978-0-615-57936-8}}</ref>

During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's [[Moore Dry Dock Company]] expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100&nbsp;million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.G.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] called on defense industries with government contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers came from around the country, especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as well as Missouri and Tennessee. [[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s representatives recruited [[sharecroppers]] and [[tenant farmers]] from rural areas to work in his shipyards. African Americans were part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] by which five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the [[Jim Crow]] South carried their racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers competing for the better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated.<ref name="sfgate.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/26/MNFUSA80E.DTL&hw=Betty+Reid+Soskin&sn=003&sc=552 | title=WWII meant opportunity for many women, oppression for others | first=Carolyne | last=Zinko | date=September 26, 2007 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Also migrating to the area during this time were many [[Mexican Americans]] from southwestern states such as [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], and [[Colorado]].

Despite the major increases in the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality before the law.

Oaklanders refer to their city's terrain as "the flatlands" and [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|"the hills"]]. Until recent waves of gentrification, these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and hills of the East Bay range.

Ruptures along the nearby [[San Andreas Fault]] caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |title=Modeling surface creep on the Hayward fault using rate-and-state friction |first1=David |last1=Schmidt |first2=Roland |last2=Bürgmann |year=1999 |work=The Berkeley Seismological Laboratory |publisher=The Regents of the University of California |access-date=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211802/http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar98_99/node22.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The city's greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater [[#Central business district|Central Business District]], [[Lake Merritt]], [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]], [[North Oakland, Oakland, California|North Oakland]], [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]], and the [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|Oakland Hills]]. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]]. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the [[Oakland Point, Oakland, California|Oakland Point]], and encompassing the [[Port of Oakland]].

Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to [[serpentine soil]]s and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including [[downtown Oakland|downtown]] and [[Grand Lake, Oakland, California|Grand Lake]].

The city of [[Piedmont, California|Piedmont]], incorporated in Oakland's central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city surrounded by the city of Oakland.

===Climate and Vegetation===

Oakland has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] with an average of 260 sunny days per year. In general, the city features warm, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. [[Lake Merritt]], a large [[estuary]] centrally located east of Downtown, was announced as the United States' first official wildlife refuge.

Based on data gathered by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |title=Relocation information: Oakland Facts |publisher=Chamber of Commerce |access-date=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903163216/http://www.oaklandchamber.com/relocation/facts.asp |archive-date=September 3, 2011 }} As published in 1993 by Rand McNally.</ref> Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters are mild and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] means the northern part of the city can have cooling [[San Francisco fog|maritime fog]]. It is far enough inland that the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].

The [[U.S. Weather Bureau]] kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was {{convert|104|°F}} on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was {{convert|24|°F}} on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" winds (similar to the [[Santa Ana winds]] of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with {{convert|38.65|in|mm|0}} and the driest year was 1910 with {{convert|12.02|in|mm|0}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|15.35|in|mm|0}} in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|4.27|in|0|}} on February 12, 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6332 |title=Oakland, California&nbsp;– Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=April 19, 2012}}</ref> Rainfall near the bayfront is only {{Convert|23|in}}, but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to {{Convert|30|in|disp=sqbr}}).

The higher rainfall in the hills supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump {{Convert|30|feet}} in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. [[Eucalyptus globulus|Australian eucalyptus trees]] have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come from a similar climate.

The [[National Weather Service]] today has two official weather stations in Oakland: [[Oakland International Airport]] and the [[Oakland Museum]] (established 1970).

=== Gentrification ===
As of 2020, the San Francisco-Oakland Metro shows indications of having the greatest intensity of gentrification nationally, with over 31% of eligible neighborhoods gentrifying. Gentrifying neighborhoods showed significant increases in median home value, median household income, percentage of college educated residents, but also in economic inequality. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Gentrification and Disinvestment 2020 » NCRC|url=https://ncrc.org/gentrification20/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=NCRC|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Historically low-income neighborhoods have been rapidly changed by new, higher-income residents as high-wage tech workers and expensive housing have continued to push lower-wage residents out of Oakland.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gentrification and Disinvestment 2020 » NCRC|url=https://ncrc.org/gentrification20/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=NCRC|language=en-US}}</ref> In West Oakland, for example, median household income rose from $80,700 to $86,300 between 2010 and 2017, while the percent of population with four-year degrees rose from one-third to nearly one-half, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-18|title=Oakland, S.F. neighborhoods fastest gentrifying in U.S.|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/oakland-s-f-neighborhoods-fastest-gentrifying-in-u-s|access-date=2020-11-03|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US}}</ref>

Oakland was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] bastion from the 1860s to the 1950s, with positions expressed by the Republican-oriented ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' newspaper. At the time, the GOP was more moderate than it has become in the 21st century, and some members belonged to a progressive tradition across the Northern Tier of states. In the 1960s, the majority of voters began to favor liberal policies and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QODLZe8XlDIC&pg=PA95 |title=Oakland Police Department |page=95 |first=Phil |last=McArdle |publisher=Arcadia |series=Images of America |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7385-4726-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bigdaddyjesseunr00boya_0 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigdaddyjesseunr00boya_0/page/61 61] |title=Big Daddy: Jesse Unruh and the Art of Power Politics |first=Bill |last=Boyarsky |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-92334-8}}</ref> Oakland has the second highest percentage of registered Democrats of any of the incorporated cities in Alameda County, with Berkeley coming in first.

{{main|Crime in Oakland, California}}

Substantial progress has been made in reducing the city's historically high crime rate. Gun crime is primarily concentrated in certain poor minority neighborhoods with nearly all homicides committed by criminals with guns. Oakland's crime rate had begun to escalate during the late 1960s; and by the end of the 1970s, during the drug wars, the city's per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of San Francisco or New York City.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mac Donald |first=Heather |title=Jerry Brown's No-Nonsense New Age for Oakland |work=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]] |location=New York |date=August 1999 |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |access-date=October 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827074841/http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a2.html |archive-date=August 27, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The primary factor in the rising crime rate has been the dramatic increase of street narcotics sales and use since the 1970s, with Oakland becoming a major west-coast hub for heroin and cocaine distribution. Subsequent battle for control over the lucrative narcotics trade incited gang conflicts and violence, with shootings becoming a regular occurrence. A concurrent rise in rape, robbery, burglary, auto-theft and other crimes occurred as well. Prior to 1960, there had been successful government-funded social programs whereby rebellious teens were enrolled in youth centers that would teach them proper values and improve their behavior. However, similar programs since then have been inconsistent.<ref name="Rosen 2007 255–270">{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Eva|author2=Sudhir Venkatesh |title=Legal Innovation and the Control of Gang Behavior|journal=[[Annual Review of Law and Social Science]]|date=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=255–270|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112724}}</ref>

By the 1970s, the police and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) used [[military tactics]] such as SWAT teams, infiltration and counter intelligence in an attempt to counter groups such as the Black Panthers (responsible for several police ambushes), the S.L.A. and organized drug gangs such as the "69 Mob", with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment.<ref name="Rosen 2007 255–270"/> During the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States,<ref name="sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com">{{cite news |title=Oakland Moves From 3rd To 5th In Most Dangerous City Survey |agency=[[Bay City News]] |publisher=[[CBS San Francisco]] |date=November 22, 2010 |url= http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2010/11/22/oakland-moves-from-3rd-to-5th-in-most-dangerous-city-survey/ |access-date=October 29, 2011}}</ref> but in the latter part of the decade, the homicide rate dropped four years in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%.

Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, although these districts have 44% of Oakland's residents.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spiker |first=Steve |last2=Garvey |first2=John |last3=Arnold |first3=Kenyatta |last4=Williams |first4=Junious |title=Homicides in Oakland |publisher=Urban Strategies Council |date=March 9, 2009 |url=http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |access-date=October 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003093648/http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf |archive-date=October 3, 2011 }}</ref>

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===

The [[Oakland Unified School District]] (OUSD), which covers the city except for Sheffield Village, operates most of Oakland's public schools. Due to financial troubles and administrative failures, it was in receivership by the state of California from 2002 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goleadershipcenter.org/2010/04/statement_from.php|title=Great Oakland Public Schools Leadership Center|work=goleadershipcenter.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925120052/http://www.goleadershipcenter.org/2010/04/statement_from.php|archive-date=September 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> {{as of|2015}}, the Oakland Unified School District includes 86 division-run schools and 32 charter schools; the district also manages several adult education programs. {{as of|2015}} there are 48,181 K–12 students; among division-run schools, there are 4,600 plus employees.<ref>{{cite web|title=OUSD Oakland Unified School District Fast Facts 2015-2015|url=http://www.ousd.org/cms/lib07/CA01001176/Centricity/Domain/1//OUSD%20District%20Docs/OUSD%20Fast%20Facts%202014-15.pdf|publisher=Oakland Unified School District|access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>

==== Funding ====
In 2017, the Oakland Unified School District has received funding from Pandora in partnership with Little Kids Rock, towards expanding music education programs within the schools. The result from these donations has given teachers from 20 additional Oakland- area schools the ability to participate in an eight-hour professional development workshop, and receive music education instruction from Little Kids Rock. The donation includes providing new instruments, that will benefit over 2000 Oakland students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.pandora.com/file/4247784/Index?KeyFile=390627585|title=Pandora – Press Release|website=press.pandora.com|access-date=2018-04-14}}</ref>

==Media==

{{Main|List of television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area}}
Oakland is served by major television stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The region's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Owned-and-operated station|O&O]], [[KTVU]] 2, is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at [[Jack London Square]] along with co-owned independent station [[KICU-TV]] 36 (licensed to San Jose). In addition, the city is served by various [[Template:San Francisco Radio|AM and FM]] radio stations as well; AM stations [[KKSF (AM)|KKSF]] 910, [[KMKY (AM)|KMKY]] 1310 and [[KNEW (AM)|KNEW]] 960 are licensed to Oakland.

Oakland was served by the [[Oakland Tribune]], which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The [[Tribune Tower (Oakland)|Tribune Tower]], which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00&nbsp;am, noon and 5:00&nbsp;pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDIANEWS_NEWSPAPER_CUTBACKS?SITE=WSAW&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=MediaNews combining most SF Bay area newspapers into 2 new brands, eliminating 120 jobs |author=Liedtke, Michael |date=August 23, 2011 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=August 27, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air and rail====

Oakland residents have access to the three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: [[Oakland International Airport]], [[San Francisco International Airport]], and [[San Jose International Airport]]. Oakland International Airport, within Oakland's city limits, is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic and international destinations. [[AC Transit]] provides 24-hour service to the airport, and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART's]] [[Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line|Coliseum–Oakland International Airport]] [[automated guideway transit]] line provides frequent service between the airport and [[Oakland Coliseum station]].

The city has regional and long-distance passenger train service provided by [[Amtrak]], with stations near [[Jack London Square]] and the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]]. Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'' has its western terminus at the nearby [[Emeryville (Amtrak station)|Emeryville station]].

Historically, the city was served by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] trains terminated at its Oakland depot, actually located within the city limits of Emeryville at 40th and San Pablo. [[Southern Pacific]] trains ended at the [[16th Street Station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/oakland/Railroads|title=Railroads|work=localwiki.org}}</ref> [[Western Pacific Railroad|Western Pacific]] trains ended at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the different railroads continued one more stop to a station at [[Oakland Pier]].<ref>"The California Zephyr" from "Streamliner Schedules", original reference from the 1950 Official Guide of railroads"</ref> From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco.

In July 2019, the City of Oakland Department of Transportation announced that it had issued official permits for the deployment of shared e-scooters to four companies: [[Bird (company)|Bird]], [[CleVR|Clevr]], Lime, and Lyft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2019/oakdot-announces-permits-for-shared-e-scooters|title=OakDOT Announces Permits for Shared E-Scooters|website=City of Oakland|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Oakland requires these operators to educate users on the correct and safe use of scooters, to distribute the scooters equitably throughout the city, to ensure accessibility, and to provide insurance and indemnification.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-02|title=Oakland OKs 3,500 rental e-scooters from Bird, Lime, Lyft, Clevr|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204063047/https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php|archive-date=December 4, 2019|access-date=2019-11-20|website=SFChronicle.com|language=en-US|ref=https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Oakland-OKs-3-500-rental-e-scooters-from-Bird-14067377.php}}</ref>

====Bridges, freeways, and tunnels====

Oakland is served by several major highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into three freeways at the [[MacArthur Maze]] freeway interchange: [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] (MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] and eventually to the [[California Central Valley]]; [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]; and the Eastshore Freeway ([[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]/I-580) runs north, providing connections to [[Sacramento]] and [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], respectively.
[[Interstate 980 (California)|Interstate 980]] (Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland before turning into [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. [[California State Route 13|State Route 13]] begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic valley in the [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair District]] before entering [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. A stub of a planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned.

[[File:Cypress structure.jpeg|thumb|Portion of the collapsed [[Cypress Street Viaduct|Cypress Viaduct]] from the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake]].]]

At the time of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] double-deck segment of the [[Nimitz Freeway]] collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1997–2001. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.

Two underwater tunnels, the [[Webster Street Tube|Webster]] and [[Posey Tube|Posey]] Tubes, connect the main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. In addition, the [[Park Street Bridge|Park Street]], [[Fruitvale Bridge|Fruitvale]], and High Street bridges connect Alameda to East Oakland over the [[Oakland Estuary]].

In the hills, the [[Leimert Bridge]] crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park Boulevard. The [[Caldecott Tunnel]] carries Highway 24 through the [[Berkeley Hills]], connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott has four bores.

===Freight rail===

Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP), and to a lesser extent by [[BNSF Railway]] (which now shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland).

Historically, Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal was actually in Emeryville), the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] (who built a pier adjacent to the SP's), and the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]] (eventually absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983).

===Shipping===

As one of the three major ports on the [[West Coast of the United States]], the [[Port of Oakland]] is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal container transfer]],<ref>''Initial Study: Intermodal Interface Demonstration Project, Port of Oakland, Oakland, California'', Earth Metrics and Korve Engineerning, December 20, 1989</ref> thereby displacing the [[Port of San Francisco]], which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|title=Port Of Oakland, Oakland Estuary|work=Glenn Franco Simmons|access-date=December 7, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208071321/http://www.glennfrancosimmons.com/port-oakland|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Utilities===

[[Public water supply|Water]] and [[sewage treatment]] are provided by [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]] (EBMUD). [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG & E) provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to [[Waste Management, Inc]]. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996#Stated objective|Telecommunications Act of 1996]].

Oakland tops the list of the 50 largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|title=What is the definition of sustainability, development and resources|work=Tech Stuffed|access-date=August 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723035943/http://www.sustainlane.us/articles/city_renewable_energy.jsp|archive-date=July 23, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
[[File:Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.jpg|thumb|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]]
Originating in Oakland, [[Kaiser Permanente]] is an [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]] to provide medical care for [[Kaiser Shipyards]] workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Consumer-driven health care: implications for providers, payers, and policymakers |last=Zendle |first=Les |author2=Regina E. Herzlinger  |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7879-5258-7 |page=661 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xtqchcsFYV8C&pg=PA661}}</ref> It is headquartered at One Kaiser Plaza in Downtown Oakland and maintains a large medical center in the [[Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, California|Piedmont Avenue]] neighborhood.

[[Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]], an East Bay hospital system, maintains its Summit Campus in the neighborhood known as "Pill Hill" north of downtown. Until 2000, it was the Summit Medical Center before merging with Berkeley-based Alta Bates. All campuses now operate under the [[Sutter Health]] network.

[[Alameda County Medical Center]] is operated by the [[Alameda County, California|county]] and provides medical services to county residents, including the [[Medically indigent adult|medically indigent]] who do not have [[health insurance]]. The main campus, [[Highland Hospital (Oakland, California)|Highland Hospital]] in East Oakland, is the [[trauma center]] for the northern area of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]].

[[Children's Hospital Oakland]] is the primary medical center specializing in [[pediatrics]] in the East Bay. It is a designated Level I pediatric trauma center and the only independent children's hospital in Northern California.

There are also several [[Community health center]]s in Oakland.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maizlish|first=Neil A.|date=1 July 2004|title=Glycemic Control in Diabetic Patients Served by Community Health Centers|journal=American Journal of Medical Quality|volume=19|issue=4|pages=172–179|doi=10.1177/106286060401900406|pmid=15368782|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0103671a12a20783ad5c6f98c97f091ef17857e2}}</ref> Some examples include Lifelong Medical Care, Asian Health Services, and Roots Community Health Center.
