'''Foundry United Methodist Church''' is a historic congregation of the [[United Methodist Church]], located on [[16th Street NW]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and founded in 1814.

==History==
Henry Foxall, the prominent owner of the Columbia Foundry (besides the church, also namesake of the [[Foundry Branch]]), contributed the land and funds for the construction of the first [[church (building)|church]] in 1814. By tradition, he made the contribution in gratitude for divine intervention after a thunderstorm prevented British soldiers from destroying the foundry during the [[Burning of Washington]].<ref name="aoc">{{citation|url=https://architectofthecapital.org/posts/2016/10/2/henry-foxall-early-defense-contract|date=October 30, 2016|title=Henry Foxall Was Washington's First Defense Contractor|first=Elliot|last=Carter|accessdate=2019-03-30|publisher=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref> Foxall, who later served as mayor of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], was an associate of [[Francis Asbury]], the founder of American Methodism, and became a lay preacher himself.

A simple brick church was constructed at 14th and G Streets, Northwest, and Stephen G. Roszel became its first preacher, in 1815. The name "Foundry Chapel" was first used in 1816, and the community became an independent charge in 1817.<ref name="timeline">{{citation|url=https://www.foundryumc.com/about/history|title=Timeline|publisher=Foundry United Methodist Church|accessdate=2019-03-30}}</ref> 

President [[Abraham Lincoln]] attended a January 18, 1863 service at Foundry, where visiting Bishop Matthew Simpson, raising funds for missionary work, proposed that Lincoln be made a life director of the Methodist Missionary Society.<ref name="timeline" /> His successor [[Andrew Johnson]] is also known to have attended.<ref name="umc" /> In 1877, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] became a member of the congregation, and he and his wife Lucy attended services regularly for the next four years. [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] was a devout Methodist and known for her support of the [[temperance movement]], and later nicknamed "Lemonade Lucy" as she did not serve alcohol at White House events.<ref name="umc">{{citation|url=https://www.umc.org/en/content/many-us-presidents-have-methodist-ties|title=Many US presidents have Methodist ties|date=February 15, 2019|publisher=United Methodist Church|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>

In June 1872, the church purchased land at 15th and R Streets NW, which was developed into the Fifteenth Street Methodist Church. Foundry and the Fifteenth Street church merged in 1903. Around this time, the church leaders sought to build a bigger church, and acquired the current parcel on 16th Street NW. The new church opened for worship on February 28, 1904, and was dedicated on April 10 of that year.

In 1924, [[Frederick Brown Harris]] was appointed pastor, a position he would have for more than 30 years, during which time he also served as the [[Chaplain of the Senate]], and became the longest-serving holder of that title.

Attendance reached an all-time high during [[World War II]]. Early in the American involvement in the war, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] attended a special interfaith service at Foundry on December 25, 1941.

[[J. Philip Wogaman]], previously of [[Wesley Theological Seminary]], became senior minister in 1992. In 1993, Foundry welcomed President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] as members; the Clintons would attend services there about half the weekends they were in Washington.<ref name="timeline" /> On June 7, 1995, the church voted to become a "[[Reconciling Ministries Network|Reconciling Ministry]]" for [[LGBT]] members, an effort which continued under Wogaman's successor, Dean Snyder.<ref name="wblade">{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/03/foundry-celebrates-20-years-as-reconciling-ministry/|title=Foundry celebrates 20 years as reconciling ministry|first=Peter|last=Rosenstein|work=[[The Washington Blade]]|date=June 3, 2015}}</ref> The church voted overwhelmingly in 2010 to allow same-sex marriages, placing it in conflict with the larger United Methodist Church.<ref name="pink">{{citation|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/08/washington-dc-methodist-church-approves-same-sex-marriages/|work=Pink News|title=Washington DC Methodist Church approves same-sex marriages|first=Christopher|last=Brocklebank|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>

==Music==
Foundry is known for its strong music program, which includes a children's choir, contemporary choir, and the 55-voice Foundry Choir. The Foundry Choir was selected to lead the opening communion service of the 1984 UMC [[General Conference (Methodism)|General Conference]], marking the bicentennial of [[Methodism]] in America.<ref name="dcago">{{citation|url=http://www.dcago.org/foundry-united-methodist.html|title=Foundry United Methodist|publisher=American Guild of Organists, District of Columbia Chapter|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> 

The [[organ (music)#Church|church organ]] is a [[Casavant Fr√®res|Casavant]] of 3,364 pipes and 60 ranks installed as part of the church's 1984 renovation.<ref name="organ">{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/02/25/eileen-guenther/69286694-e341-4600-b345-81322fdf4f9d/|title=Eileen Guenther|first=Ed|last=Mattos|date=February 25, 1985|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> A committee led by organist Eileen Guenther supervised its design and installation, choosing spots and voicing to reflect a focus on Classical and Romantic French literature.<ref name="dcago" /> Guenther gave its first performance in February 1985.<ref name="organ" />
