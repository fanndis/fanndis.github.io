The '''National Hockey League''' ('''NHL'''; {{lang-fr|Ligue nationale de hockey—LNH}}) is a professional [[ice hockey]] [[sports league|league]] in North America, currently comprising 31 teams: 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world,<ref name="premier">{{cite encyclopedia|title=National Hockey League |first=James |last=Marsh|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/national-hockey-league/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2006 |access-date=June 11, 2006}}</ref> and one of the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]].

The National Hockey League was organized on November 26, 1917, at the [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]] in [[Montreal]], after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in [[Renfrew, Ontario]].<ref>''The National Hockey League Official Record Book & Guide 2009'' 77th Edition, p. 9. New York: National Hockey League (2008)</ref> The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926.

At its inception, the NHL had four teams—all in Canada, thus the adjective "National" in the league's name. The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the [[Boston Bruins]] joined, and has since consisted of American and Canadian teams. From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the "[[Original Six]]". The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the [[1967 NHL expansion]]. The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979. Between 1991 and 2000, the NHL further expanded to 30 teams. It added its 31st team in 2017 and has approved the addition of a 32nd team in 2021.

The league's headquarters have been in [[New York City]] since 1989 when the head office moved from Montreal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Jack|title=Americans and Bettman have stolen Canada's game|url=https://calgaryherald.com/sports/opinion+americans+bettman+have+stolen+canada+game/7251426/story.html|access-date=January 31, 2018|work=[[Calgary Herald]]|date=September 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127034723/http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/opinion+americans+bettman+have+stolen+canada+game/7251426/story.html|archive-date=January 27, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> There have been four league-wide work stoppages in NHL history, all occurring after 1992.<ref name=JohnCollins>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aGY7pu.INAhA| publisher=Bloomberg L.P.| title=NHL Borrows From NFL as It Pursues Bigger TV Contract| first=Curtis| last=Eichelberger| date=May 29, 2009| access-date=June 29, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2020}}</ref> The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) considers the Stanley Cup to be one of the "most important championships available to the sport".<ref>{{cite web|title=Triple Gold Goalies... not|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=850|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|author=Podnieks, Andrew|date=March 25, 2008|access-date=June 17, 2017}}</ref> The NHL draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from approximately 20 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=QuantHockey.com |url=http://www.quanthockey.com/nhl/nationality-totals/active-nhl-players-2011-12-stats.html|access-date=November 19, 2012}}</ref> Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league, with an increasing percentage of American and European players in recent seasons.

{{NHLHistory}}
{{Main|History of the National Hockey League}}

===Early years===
The National Hockey League was established in 1917 as the successor to the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Founded in 1909, the NHA [[1910 NHA season|began play one year later]] with seven teams in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey. But by [[1916–17 NHA season|the NHA's eighth season]], a series of disputes with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] led team owners of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]], [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], and [[Quebec Bulldogs]] to hold a meeting to discuss the league's future.<ref name="mcfarlane_15_16">{{harvnb|McFarlane|1997|pp=15–16}}</ref> Realizing the NHA constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out, the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA, and on November 26, 1917, formed the National Hockey League. [[Frank Calder]] was chosen as its first president, serving until his death in 1943.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=159}}</ref>

The Bulldogs were unable to play, and the remaining owners created a new team in Toronto, the [[Toronto Arenas|Arenas]], to compete with the Canadiens, Wanderers and Senators.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=77}}</ref> The first games were played on December 19, 1917.<ref name="Jenish 2">{{cite book|last1=Jenish|first1=D'Arcy|title=The NHL : 100 years of on-ice action and boardroom battles|date=2013|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0385671460|page=16}}</ref> The [[Montreal Arena]] burned down in January 1918, causing the Wanderers to cease operations,<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Leagues and the Birth of the NHL |url=http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=his_EarlyLeagues |last=McFarlane |first=Brian |website=National Hockey League |access-date=January 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130110236/http://capitals.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page |archive-date=November 30, 2009 }}</ref> and the NHL continued on as a three-team league until the Bulldogs returned in 1919.<ref name="pincus24">{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=24}}</ref>

The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup, which was an interleague competition back then. Toronto won the first NHL title, and then defeated the [[Vancouver Millionaires]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) for the [[1918 Stanley Cup Finals|1918 Stanley Cup]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=197}}</ref> The Canadiens won the league title in 1919; however their Stanley Cup Final against the PCHA's [[Seattle Metropolitans]] was abandoned as a result of the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]] epidemic.<ref name="pincus23">{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=23}}</ref> Montreal in 1924 won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=33}}</ref> The [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]], won the regular season title in [[1924–25 NHL season|1924–25]] but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 bonus.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=35}}</ref> The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Toronto St. Patricks]] (formerly the Arenas) in the semi-final. Montreal was then defeated by the [[Victoria Cougars]] of the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) for the [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|1925 Stanley Cup]].

===The Original Six===
{{main|Original Six}}
The first [[NHL All-Star Game]] was held in 1934 to benefit [[Ace Bailey]], whose career ended on a vicious hit by [[Eddie Shore]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pincus|2006|p=47}}</ref> The second was held in 1937 in support of [[Howie Morenz]]'s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game.<ref>{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|p=120}}</ref>

The [[Great Depression]] and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league. The Pirates became the [[Philadelphia Quakers (NHL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] in 1930, then folded one year later. The Senators likewise became the [[St. Louis Eagles]] in 1934, also lasting only one year.<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=33}}</ref> The Maroons did not survive, as they suspended operations in 1938.<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=37}}</ref> The Americans were suspended in 1942 due to a lack of available players, and were never reactivated.<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=43}}</ref>

The league was reduced to six teams for the [[1942–43 NHL season]]: the Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. These six teams remained constant for 25 years, a period known as the Original Six. The league reached an agreement with the Stanley Cup trustees in 1947 to take full control of the trophy, allowing the NHL to reject challenges from other leagues that wished to play for the Cup.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Dan |author2=Zweig, Eric |author3=Duplacey, James |title=The Ultimate Prize: The Stanley Cup |year=2003 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |isbn=0-7407-3830-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ultimateprizesta0000diam/page/40 40] |url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateprizesta0000diam/page/40 }}</ref>

===Post-Original Six expansion===
By the mid-1960s, the desire for a network television contract in the U.S., and concerns that the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup, spurred the league to undertake its first [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion]] since the 1920s. The league doubled in size to 12 teams for the [[1967–68 NHL season|1967–68 season]], adding the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Minnesota North Stars]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[California Seals]] and [[St. Louis Blues]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|1991|p=175}}</ref> Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States,<ref>{{Harvnb|McKinley|2006|pp=194–195}}</ref> and the league responded by adding the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in [[1970–71 NHL season|1970]] along with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], who are both located on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].<ref>{{Harvnb |McFarlane |1990 |pp=106–107}}</ref> Two years later, the emergence of the newly founded [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) led the league to add the [[New York Islanders]] and [[Atlanta Flames]] to keep the rival league out of those markets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boer|2006|p=13}}</ref> In 1974, the [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Kansas City Scouts]] were added, bringing the league up to 18 teams.<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=115}}</ref>

The National Hockey League fought the WHA for players, losing 67 to the new league in its first season of [[1972–73 WHA season|1972–73]],<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=113}}</ref> including [[Bobby Hull]], who signed a ten-year, $2.5&nbsp;million contract with the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], the largest in hockey history at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=33}}</ref> The league attempted to block the defections in court, but a counter-suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL's [[reserve clause]] to be illegal, thus eliminating the elder league's monopoly over the players.<ref>{{Harvnb|McFarlane|1990|p=133}}</ref> Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues, leading to a 1979 [[NHL–WHA merger|merger agreement]] that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets, [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]] and [[Quebec Nordiques]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=214}}</ref> The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote, but a massive boycott of [[Molson Brewery]] products by fans in Canada caused the Montreal Canadiens, which was owned by Molson, to reverse its position, along with the Vancouver Canucks. In a second vote the plan was approved.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willes|2004|p=251}}</ref>

[[Wayne Gretzky]] played one season in the WHA for the [[Indianapolis Racers]] (eight games) and the [[Edmonton Oilers]] (72 games) before the Oilers joined the National Hockey League for the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80 season]].<ref name="LOHGretzky">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&page=bio&list=#photo |title=The Legends—Wayne Gretzky |access-date=January 18, 2010 |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123203450/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&page=bio&list=#photo |archive-date=November 23, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988, and set single season records for goals (92 in [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82]]), assists (163 in [[1985–86 NHL season|1985–86]]) and points (215 in 1985–86), as well as career records for goals (894), assists (1,963) and points (2,857).<ref name="LOHGretzky" /> He was traded to the Kings in 1988, a deal that dramatically improved the league's popularity in the United States.

A [[1994–95 NHL lockout|lockout]] at the start of the [[1994–95 NHL season|1994–95 season]] forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to just 48, with the teams playing only intra-conference games during the reduced season.<ref name="labour_history" /> The resulting [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) was set for renegotiation in 1998 and extended to September 15, 2004.<ref name="2004_lockout">{{Cite journal|title=The hockey lockout of 2004–05 |last=audohar |first=Paul D. |journal=Monthly Labor Review |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/12/art3full.pdf |date=December 2005}}</ref>

With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired on September 15, 2004, league commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]] of the players union and closed the league's head office.<ref name="2004_lockout" /> The league vowed to install what it dubbed "cost certainty" for its teams, but the Players' Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a [[salary cap]], which the union initially said it would not accept. The lockout shut down the league for 310 days, the longest in sports history, as the NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season.<ref name="2004_lockout" /> A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July 2005, including a salary cap. The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term, allowing the league to resume as of the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]].<ref name="2004_lockout" />

On October 5, 2005, the first post-lockout season took to the ice with all 30 teams. The NHL received record attendance in the 2005–06 season: an average of 16,955 per game.<ref name="season_review">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/hockey_features/season_review.html |title=A season to remember |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |first=John |last=Molinaro |date=April 20, 2006 |access-date=June 9, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618174146/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/hockey_features/season_review.html |archive-date=June 18, 2006 }}</ref> The League's TV audience was slower to rebound because of American cable broadcaster [[ESPN]]'s decision to drop the sport.<ref name="ibisworld">{{cite web|url=http://www1.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=107 |title=Super Bowl XLII versus the Economy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603025811/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=107 |archive-date=June 3, 2008 }}</ref> The league's post-lockout agreement with [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] gave the league a share of revenue from each game's advertising sales, rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights.

===Player safety issues===
Player safety has become a major issue, with concussions &ndash; a result from a hard hit to the head &ndash; being the primary concern. Recent studies have shown how the consequences of concussions can last beyond player retirement.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} This has significant effects on the league as elite players have suffered from the aftereffects of concussions, such as [[Sidney Crosby]] being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months, which adversely affects the league's marketability.<ref>{{cite news|author=Josh Hargreaves |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/crosby-discusses-lengthy-recovery-road-from-concussions-safety-of-the-game/article14118504/ |title=Crosby discusses lengthy recovery road from concussions, safety of the game |work=The Globe and Mail |date=September 5, 2013 |access-date=March 14, 2014 |location=Toronto}}</ref> In December 2009, [[Brendan Shanahan]] was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of senior vice-president of player safety.

To aid with removing high speed collisions on icing, which had led to several potential career-ending injuries such as Hurricanes' defenceman [[Joni Pitkänen|Joni Pitkanen]], the league mandated hybrid no-touch icing for the 2013–14 NHL season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wyshynski |first=Greg |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-players-approve-hybrid-icing-safety-trumps-subjectivity-231456246--nhl.html |title=NHL players approve hybrid icing, as safety trumps subjectivity &#124; Puck Daddy|work=Yahoo!

On November 25, 2013, ten former players (Gary Leeman, Rick Vaive, Brad Aitken, Darren Banks, Curt Bennett, Richie Dunn, Warren Holmes, Bob Manno, Blair Stewart and Morris Titanic) sued the league for negligence on protecting players from concussions. The suit came three months after the [[National Football League]] agreed to pay former players US$765&nbsp;million due to a player safety lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=437509 |title=Former NHL players sue league over concussions |publisher=The Sports Network |date=November 25, 2013 |access-date=March 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131131031/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=437509 |archive-date=January 31, 2014 }}</ref>

<!-- NHL Board of Governors redirects to this section; please fix that incoming redirect if this section header is changed. Thanks! -->
{{see also|List of NHL franchise owners}}
The Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the National Hockey League.

The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner, [[Jeremy Jacobs]]. The Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the league, and to uphold its constitution. Some of the responsibilities of the Board of Governors include:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/646798 |title=NHL's secret constitution revealed |work=Toronto Star |access-date=March 12, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Kevin |last=McGran |date=June 6, 2009}}</ref>

* hiring and firing of the commissioner.
* review and approve the purchase, sale, or relocation of any member club.
* review and approve the salary caps for member clubs.
* review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule.

The Board of Governors meets twice per year, in the months of June and December, with the exact date and place to be fixed by the Commissioner.

===Executives===
The chief executive of the league is [[NHL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]]. Some of the principal decision makers who serve under the authority of the commissioner include:
* Deputy Commissioner & Chief Legal Officer: [[Bill Daly]]
* Executive VP & CFO: Craig Harnett
* Chief Operating Officer: Steve McArdle
* Executive VP & Director of Hockey Operations: [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]]

{{anchor|2013 Conference Realignment}}

The NHL consists of 31 teams, 24 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada. The NHL divides the 31 teams into two conferences: the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] and the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. Each conference is split into two [[Division (sport)|divisions]]: the Eastern Conference contains 16 teams (eight per division), while the Western Conference has 15 teams (seven in the Central Division and eight in the Pacific Division). The current alignment has existed since the [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]].

The number of NHL teams held constant at 30 teams from the [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01 season]] when the [[Minnesota Wild]] and the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] joined the league as expansion teams, until 2017. That expansion capped a period in the 1990s of rapid expansion and relocation when the NHL added nine teams to grow from 21 to 30 teams, and relocated four teams mostly from smaller, northern cities to larger, more southern metropolitan areas ([[Minneapolis]] to [[Dallas]], [[Quebec City]] to [[Denver]], [[Winnipeg]] to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]). The league has not contracted any teams since the [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]] folded in 1978.

{{Main|Ice hockey}}
[[File:NHL Logo former.svg|left|upright|thumb|NHL logo, used from 1946 until 2005]]
Each National Hockey League regulation game is 60 minutes long. The game is composed of three 20-minute periods with an intermission between periods.<ref name="intermission">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule90.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817022955/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule90.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 17, 2000 |title=Time of match |website=National Hockey League |access-date=December 2, 2006 |year=2006 }}</ref> 
At the end of regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, three-on-three [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] period, in which whoever scores a goal first will win the game.

[[File:WeaverLankow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Los Angeles Kings]]' [[Mike Weaver (hockey)|Mike Weaver]] clearing the puck away from [[Calgary Flames]]' [[Daymond Langkow]], December 21, 2005.]]
If the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#North American shootout|shootout]]. Three players for each team in turn take a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden-death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/rules/a/shootout_debate_2.htm |title=How the NHL Shootout Works |access-date=August 4, 2008 |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Jamie |work=About.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519150726/http://proicehockey.about.com/od/rules/a/shootout_debate_2.htm |archive-date=May 19, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics; shootout statistics are tracked separately.

==Rules==
{{main|National Hockey League rules}}
The National Hockey League's rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world. The rules themselves have evolved directly from the [[First indoor hockey game|first organized indoor ice hockey game]] in Montreal in 1875, updated by subsequent leagues up to 1917, when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules. The NHL's rules are the basis for rules governing [[List of ice hockey leagues#Minor professional|most professional]] and [[Canadian Hockey League|major junior ice hockey leagues]] in North America. Infractions of the rules, such as [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], lead to a stoppage of play and subsequent [[face-off]]s, while more serious infractions leading to penalties to the offending teams. The league also determines the specifications for playing equipment used in its games.

The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game. The penalty shot was adopted from the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score. For the 2005–06 season, the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside. First, the league removed the "offside pass" or "two-line pass" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the centre line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<ref name="newoffside">{{Cite news|title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC sports |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 22, 2005 |access-date=June 10, 2006 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516050646/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html |archive-date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> Furthermore, the league reinstated the "tag-up offside" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<ref name="newoffside" /> The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<ref name="newoffside" /> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties and the increased prevalence of the [[neutral zone trap]]. Since 2005, when a team is guilty of [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing the puck]] they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following [[face-off]] (except to replace an injured player or re-install a [[extra attacker|pulled goaltender]]).<ref name="icing">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514155000/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule81.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |title=Icing |website=National Hockey League |access-date=March 1, 2013 |year=2005 }}</ref> Since 2013, the league has used ''hybrid icing'', where a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face-off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to. This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck.<ref name="icing" />

The league's rules differ from the rules of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), as used in tournaments such as the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]], which were themselves derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early 20th century.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}} In the NHL, [[Fighting in ice hockey|fighting]] leads to ''major penalties'' while IIHF rules, and most amateur rules, call for the ejection of fighting players.<ref name="major">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154838/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule27.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Major penalties |website=National Hockey League |access-date=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}</ref><ref name="fighting_iihf">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |title=Ice Hockey Essentials – International vs. NHL |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=June 26, 2006 |year=2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221192349/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/sports/icehockey/essentials/intlvsnhl.shtml |archive-date = February 21, 2006}}</ref> Usually, a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus [[short-handed]] for the duration of the penalty,<ref name="minor" /> but if the penalties are coincidental, for example when two players fight, both teams remain at full strength. Also, unlike minor penalties, major penalties must be served to their full completion, regardless of number of goals scored during the power play.<ref name="minor">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule26.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423154633/http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule26.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=Minor penalties |website=National Hockey League |access-date=June 8, 2006 |year=2005 }}</ref> The NHL and IIHF differ also in playing rules, such as icing, the areas of play for goaltenders, helmet rules, officiating rules, timeouts and play reviews.

The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players. Players are banned from [[gambling]] and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players. The league and the Players' Association agreed to a stringent anti-doping policy in the 2005 collective bargaining agreement. The policy provides for a twenty-game suspension for a first positive test, a sixty-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023064426/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=September 28, 2005 |access-date=January 2, 2007 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV }}</ref>

==Season structure==
{{Main|Season structure of the NHL}}
{{See also|List of NHL seasons}}
The National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]).

Teams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight [[exhibition game]]s. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.

During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. In the regular season, each team plays 82 games: 41 games each of home and road. Eastern teams play 28 games in their own geographic division—four against each of their seven other divisional opponents—and 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference. Western teams play 26 or 29 games in their own geographic division—four or five against each of their six or seven other divisional opponents—and 21 or 24 games against the six or seven remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference, with one cross-division intra-conference match-up occurring in four games. All teams play every team in the other conference twice—home and road.<ref>{{Cite news|title=NHL ramps up rivalries |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216 |author=CBC Sports Online |publisher=CBC.com |date=July 27, 2005 |access-date=June 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927195147/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/the-explainer-new-nhl-playoff-seeding-format-1.1871216/ |archive-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>

The league's regular season standings are based on a point system. Two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in overtime or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion, and the league's overall leader is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].

The Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points.<ref name="nhl_playoff_format">{{cite web|website=National Hockey League |title=Playoff formats |year=2005 |access-date=June 6, 2006 |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718071657/http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2001 }}</ref> The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Final. In all rounds, the higher-ranked team is awarded home-ice advantage, with four of the seven games played at this team's home venue. In the Stanley Cup Final, the team with the most points during the regular season has home-ice advantage.

==Entry Draft==
{{Main|NHL Entry Draft}}

The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven-round off-season [[Draft (sports)|draft]] held in late June. Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth (currently Fairmont) Hotel in Montreal. Amateur players from junior, collegiate, or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft. The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season, playoff results, and a draft lottery. The 15 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round, with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery. Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks, the order for the remaining non-playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs, the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non-division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs, then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals. Conference finalists receive the 28th and 29th picks depending on total points, with the Stanley Cup runner-up given the 30th pick and the Stanley Cup champions the 31st pick.

The most prestigious team award is the [[Stanley Cup]], which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]].

The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league. Since the formation of the league in 1917, they have 25 NHL championships (three between 1917 and 1925 when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition, twenty-two since 1926 after the Stanley Cup became the NHL's championship trophy). They also lead all teams with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (one as an NHA team, twenty-three as an NHL team). Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have three more.

The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955–56 to 1959–60.<ref name="list_stanley_cup">{{cite web|title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |access-date=June 26, 2006 |year=2006}}</ref> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all-time.<ref name="greatest team">{{cite web|title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |publisher=ESPN |date=December 31, 1999 |access-date=June 26, 2006}}</ref>

The next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cup championships, most recently in 1967. The Detroit Red Wings, with 11 Stanley Cup championships, are the most successful American franchise.

The same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The Stanley Cup, much like its Canadian Football League [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], which have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.

===Players===
There are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the [[goaltender]](s) for the team with the fewest goals against them.

The other player trophies are voted on by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] or the team general managers.<ref name="awards">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-awards-trophies |title=NHL trophies|website=National Hockey League |access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded. The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.

[[File:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|The [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]]]
In addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the [[Jack Adams Award]] as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.<ref name="awards" />

Players, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players, who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters, the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played. Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of the Soviet Bloc, political/ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared, leading to a large influx of players mostly from Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia into the NHL. Swedes, Finns, and other Western Europeans, who were always free to move to North America, came to the league in greater numbers than before.

Many of the league's top players in recent years have come from these European countries including [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Erik Karlsson]], [[Henrik Sedin]], [[Daniel Sedin]], [[Henrik Lundqvist]], [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]], [[Patrik Eliáš|Patrik Elias]], [[Zdeno Chára|Zdeno Chara]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Evgeni Malkin]], [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] and [[Alexander Ovechkin]].<ref name="Europe">{{Cite news|title=New world order: as the Olympics have shown, the influx of players from across the Atlantic brought changes to the NHL game |work=The Sporting News |date=February 25, 2002 |access-date=June 11, 2006 |first=Larry |last=Wigge |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_8_226/ai_83450464 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419061539/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_8_226/ai_83450464 |archive-date=April 19, 2006 }}</ref> European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more "skilled offensive players",<ref name="europe2">{{cite web|title=Canadians left behind as NHL goes for firepower |agency=The Canadian Press |date=June 27, 1999 |access-date=June 11, 2006 |first=Bill |last=Beacon |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyNHLDraft99/jun27_can.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070623032604/http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyNHLDraft99/jun27_can.html |archive-date=June 23, 2007 }}</ref> although recently{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league.<ref name="More Americans?">{{cite web|title=NHL landscape changes |website=IIHF |date=May 10, 2008 |access-date=May 13, 2008 |first=ANDREW |last=PODNIEKS |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/browse/2/article/nhl-landscape-changes.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&cHash=5abfb28b5e/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010456/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/browse/2/article/nhl-landscape-changes.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&cHash=5abfb28b5e%2F |archive-date=December 6, 2008 }}</ref> The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated into the NHL game.<ref name="Europe" />

Among its North American corporate sponsors, [[Kraft Heinz]] sponsors ''[[Kraft Hockeyville]]'', an annual competition in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of [[ice hockey]]. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL pre-season game. Two contests are held, one for communities across Canada and a separate competition for communities in the US.

At least two of the North American corporate sponsors have ties to [[List of NHL franchise owners|NHL franchise owners]]: the [[Molson family]], founders of [[Molson Brewery]], has owned the Montreal Canadiens for years, while [[SAP SE|SAP]] was co-founded by [[Hasso Plattner]], the current majority owner of the San Jose Sharks.

Many of these same corporate partners become the title sponsors for the league's All-Star and [[NHL outdoor games|outdoor games]].

===United States===
{{Main|History of the National Hockey League on United States television}}

Historically, the NHL has never fared well on American television in comparison to the other American professional leagues. The league's American broadcast partners have been in flux for decades, ranging from such networks as [[NHL on CBS|CBS]], [[NHL on SportsChannel America|SportsChannel America]], the [[NHL on USA|USA Network]], [[NHL on Fox|Fox]], [[NHL on ABC|ABC]], and [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]].

National U.S. television rights are currently held by [[NBC Sports]]; its current 10-year, US$2&nbsp;billion contract, which began in the [[2011–12 NHL season|2011–12 season]], extended and unified rights deals that were first established in the 2005–06 season, when [[Comcast]] acquired cable rights to replace ESPN, and [[NBC]] acquired broadcast television rights under a revenue-sharing agreement to replace [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].<ref name="nysun">{{cite news|first=Evan |last=Weiner |work=New York Sun |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34542 |title= Don't Believe the Gripe: The NHL Is Back |date=June 16, 2006 |access-date=June 19, 2006}}</ref> [[NBC Sports Network]] and the company negotiated a new, 10-year, unified rights deal worth nearly US$2&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |title=NBC/Versus To Air NHL Games for the Next Ten Years |author=Fang, Ken |date=April 19, 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |access-date=April 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018033414/http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |archive-date=October 18, 2011 }}</ref> Under this contract, NBCSN usually airs at least two regular season games per week, while NBC airs afternoon games on selected weekends. NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on [[CNBC]], [[USA Network]], [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]].

As in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market, and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them. These broadcasters include [[regional sports network]] chains. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.

The league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is ''[[NHL Tonight]]''. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters. 
The U.S. version simulcasts selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.

===Out-of-market packages===
The NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games. [[NHL Centre Ice]] in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=27197 |title=NHL Centre Ice (Canada) official website |website=National Hockey League |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> and [[NHL Center Ice]] in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26371 |title=NHL Center Ice United States official website |website=National Hockey League |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider.

The league also offers ''NHL.tv'' (branded as ''Rogers NHL GameCentre Live'' in Canada), which allows the streaming of out-of-market games over the internet, and has been coordinated by [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]] since 2016.<ref name="NHL-MLBAM-deal">{{cite web

In the United States, NHL.tv does not carry national games or in-market games, while Rogers NHL GameCentre Live does allow those in Canada to stream Sportsnet's national games.

===International===
Outside of Canada and the United States, NHL games are broadcast across Europe, in the Middle East, in Australia,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/fox-sports-1/default.htm |title = Fox Sports 1 [501] |publisher = Foxtel.com.au| access-date =April 9, 2010}}</ref> and in the Americas across Mexico, Central America, Dominican Republic, Caribbean, South America and Brazil, among others.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

NHL.tv is also available for people outside Canada and the United States to watch games online, but blackout restrictions may still apply if a game is being televised in the user's country. Those in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, where [[Viasat]] holds the NHL rights, must instead stream games from Viasat's [[Viaplay]] service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/subscribe|title=NHL.tv|publisher=NHL|access-date=September 26, 2019|quote=For international customers, blackout restrictions may apply to games that appear on an NHL partner network in your viewing area ...

==International competitions==
{{main|List of international games played by NHL teams}}
{{see also|List of international ice hockey competitions featuring NHL players}}
The National Hockey League has occasionally participated in international club competitions. Most of these competitions were arranged by the NHL or NHLPA. The first international club competition was held in [[Super Series '76|1976]], with eight NHL teams playing against the [[Soviet Championship League]]'s [[HC CSKA Moscow]], and [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow]]. Between 1976 and 1991, the NHL, and the Soviet Championship League would hold a number of exhibition games between the two leagues known as the [[Super Series]]. No NHL club had played a Russian-based club from the end of the Super Series in 1991 to 2008, when the New York Rangers faced [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] in the [[2008 Victoria Cup]].

In addition to the Russian clubs, NHL clubs had participated in a number of international club exhibitions and competitions with various European-based clubs. The first exhibition game to feature an NHL team against a European-based team (aside from clubs based in the former Soviet Union) was in December 1977, when the New York Rangers faced [[HC Kladno|Poldi Kladno]] of the [[Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League]]. In the 2000s the NHL had organized four [[NHL Challenge]] series between NHL, and European clubs. From 2007 to 2011, the NHL organized exhibition games prior to the beginning of the season, known as the NHL Premiere, between NHL clubs and teams from a number of European leagues. The [[List of international games played by NHL teams#2018 NHL Global Series|2018 NHL Global Series]] was the last NHL-organized club competition involving European teams. NHL clubs have also participated in IIHF-organized club tournaments. The most recent IIHF-organized event including an NHL club was the [[2009 Victoria Cup]], between the Swiss [[National League A]]'s [[ZSC Lions]], and the Chicago Blackhawks.

From 1998 to 2014, during the quadrennial [[Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic]] years, the NHL suspended its all-star game and expanded the traditional all-star break to allow NHL players to represent their countries in the Olympic ice hockey tournament; starting 2018, because the All-Star game is held in late January, there would be no Olympic break. Conversely, the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] are held every May at the same time as the Stanley Cup playoffs. Thus, NHL players generally only join their respective country's team in the World Championships if their respective NHL team has been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention, or did not make the playoffs.

In 2007, the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) formalized the "[[Triple Gold Club]]", the group of players and coaches who have won an Olympic gold medal, a World Championship gold medal, and the Stanley Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winner of three-team tourney to get Victoria Cup|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2863711|date=May 8, 2007|access-date=February 9, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref name="expands">{{cite web|title=Triple Gold Club expands to 22 |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |website=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=June 5, 2008 |access-date=February 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218074948/http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/article/triple-gold-club-expands-to-22/ |archive-date=February 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PR & Media Activities|url=http://www.iihf.com/100-years/100-years-of-ice-hockey/pr-media-activities.html|website=International Ice Hockey Federation|access-date=February 8, 2009}}</ref> The term had first entered popular use following the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], which saw the addition of the first Canadian members.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Welcome to the Triple Gold Club: Blake, Sakic, Shanahan: New members to elite club: Olympics, worlds, Stanley Cup|work=[[National Post]]|author=Barnes, Don|date=February 25, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Triple Gold Club awaits Canadian trio|author=Scanlan, Wayne|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=February 24, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Skating a fine line|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesColumnistsPreGames/buffery_dec26-sun.html|last=Buffery|first=Steve|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=December 26, 2001|access-date=February 9, 2009}}</ref>

As well as participating in the above international club competitions, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association organizes the [[World Cup of Hockey]]. Unlike the Ice Hockey World Championships and the Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation, the World Cup of Hockey is played under NHL-rules and not those of the IIHF. The tournament takes place prior to the NHL pre-season.<ref name=sn-wch2016>{{cite web|title=New-look World Cup of hockey back for 2016|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/new-look-world-cup-of-hockey-back-for-2016/|website=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref>

The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, along with [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]. The league is very prominent in Canada, where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports as alongside [[Canadian Football League|CFL]].<ref name="Canadian Press 2006-06-08">{{Cite news|agency=The Canadian Press |date=June 8, 2006 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060608.wsurvey8/BNStory/Sports/home |title=Survey: Canadian interest in pro football is on the rise |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=June 8, 2006 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Overall, hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues, the smallest revenue from television, and the least sponsorship.<ref name="affluent">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml |title=Champions of the Turnstiles |date=August 2004 |last=Markus |first=David |work=gsb.stanford.edu |access-date=June 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102214551/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml |archive-date=January 2, 2011 }}</ref>

The NHL holds one of the most affluent fan bases.<ref name="affluent"/> Studies by the Sports Marketing Group conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL's fan base is much more affluent than that of the [[PGA Tour]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910221&slug=1267313 |title=Sports: NBA Booming, But Football Is America's Favorite Sport |work=The Seattle Times |date=February 21, 1991 |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}} A study done by the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] in 2004, found that NHL fans in America were the most educated and affluent of the four major leagues. Further it noted that season-ticket sales were more prominent in the NHL than the other three because of the financial ability of the NHL fan to purchase them.<ref name="affluent" /> According to [[Reuters]] in 2010, the largest demographic of NHL fans was males aged 18–34.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6974VM20101008 |title=NHL pushes for growth on TV, online |date=October 8, 2010 |last=Klayman |first=Ben |agency=Reuters|access-date=May 23, 2011}}</ref>
The NHL estimates that half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. Beginning in 2008, the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this.

The debut of the [[NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]], an outdoor regular season NHL game held on [[New Year's Day]] 2008, was a major success for the league. The game has since become an annual staple of the NHL schedule. This, along with the transition to a national "Game of the Week" and an annual "Hockey Day in America" regional coverage, all televised on NBC, has helped increase the NHL's regular season television viewership in the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} These improvements led NBC and the cable channel [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] to sign a ten-year broadcast deal, paying US$200&nbsp;million per year for both American cable and broadcast rights; the deal will lead to further increases in television coverage on the NBC channels.

This television contract has boosted viewership metrics for the NHL. The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs saw the largest audience in the history of the sport "after a regular season that saw record-breaking business success, propelled in large part by the NHL's strategy of engaging fans through big events and robust digital offerings."<ref>"[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=531630 Stanley Cup Playoffs attract largest audience ever]", "NHL.com", June 14, 2010</ref> This success has resulted in a 66 percent rise in NHL advertising and sponsorship revenue. Merchandise sales were up 22 percent and the number of unique visitors on the NHL.com website were up 17 percent during the playoffs after rising 29 percent in the regular season.<ref>Klayman, Ben.
