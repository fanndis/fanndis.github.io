The '''Foreign Policy Association''' (formerly known as the '''League of Free Nations Association''') is a non-profit organization founded in 1918 dedicated to inspiring the American public to learn more about the world. The Foreign Policy Association aims to spread global awareness and understanding of foreign policy issues. The organization's current President & CEO is Dr. Noel V. Lateef.

==History==
The FPA was founded in 1918 as the "League of Free Nations Association". Under the chairmanship of journalist [[Paul Underwood Kellogg]], it was formed by 41 Americans to support US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s efforts to achieve a just peace, with his famous speech and proposal of the [[Fourteen Points]], which included the idea of a world organization, later to be called the [[League of Nations]]. It was also to increase support for United States membership in the world body that was then being discussed and laid out in the [[Versailles Treaty]] and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], with the "Big Four" representatives dominating the many representatives of the nations formerly at war: President Woodrow Wilson of the US, Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] of the [[United Kingdom]], Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] of the [[France]] and Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] of [[Italy]] following the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] ending combat in [[World War I]]. It also included future influential Americans from both sides of the political spectrum, [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].

Following the failure of the [[United States Senate]] to ratify the Treaty and membership in the League during various debate sessions with votes taken in 1919 and early 1920, and also later through the results of the [[1920 United States presidential election|Presidential Election of 1920]], it was later reconstituted in 1923 as the Foreign Policy Association with a commitment to the careful study of all sides of international questions affecting the US and to further spread that education and knowledge throughout an informed citizenry.

In the 1920s, it initiated Saturday luncheon discussions on foreign policy in New York City. The luncheon discussions grew popular and in 1938, 19 women formed its [https://www.off-the-record.org/ "Off-the-Record" lecture series] to learn more about international affairs.

In the 1940s, headed by [[Vera Micheles Dean]], the FPA pioneered international affairs radio discussions by broadcasting New York City meetings and weekly talks on the program "The World Today" over the [[National Broadcasting Company]]'s (NBC) radio network. Later, as the discussions among citizens spread, the FPA branches across America became the forerunners of the various independent membership councils with [[World Affairs Councils of America]] and foreign affairs or foreign policy councils founded in major large cities or regions of states in the 1950s and 60's, and some as late as the 1980s. These have become influential organizations of educated and curious concerned citizens in their own cities or regions, guided and led by academics or businesses with many international connections and have often had their meetings, lectures, seminars, and symposiums covered by the local media reaching a greater number of the public in those cities.

Meanwhile, the FPA's publications, ''"Foreign Policy Reports"'' (1925–1951), ''"Foreign Policy Bulletin"'' (1920–1961) and ''"Headline Series"'' (1935–present) became known and respected at the time for their clear and impartial analysis of foreign policy issues.

<blockquote>''“In a democracy the Government functions with the consent of the whole people. The latter must be guided by the facts. The Foreign Policy Association is performing a high duty in facilitating the lucid presentation of the facts of world problems and their impact upon the United States.”''
- [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], 1943</blockquote>

The heart of the FPAs outreach effort, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061102181433/http://www.fpa.org/info-url_nocat4705/info-url_nocat.htm ''Great Decisions'' program], was launched in 1954. The program has become the largest nonpartisan public education program on international affairs in the world. The FPA continued to undertake new educational challenges to improve the teaching of world affairs in the nation's schools in the 1960s when the forerunner of the FPA's ''"Citizen's Guide to U.S. Foreign Policy"'' was published.

<blockquote>''“The complexity and multiplicity of the foreign policy questions facing the U.S. today places a premium on intelligent understanding of the issues by the widest possible cross-section of citizens…I am particularly impressed with the approach which the Foreign Policy Association has taken.”''
- [[John F. Kennedy]], 1960</blockquote>

In the 1970s, ''Great Decisions'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032659/http://www.fpa.org/info-url_nocat4705/info-url_nocat.htm opinion ballots] were tabulated nationally for the first time. Every year, the results of the ballot tabulations are presented to the [[White House]], the Departments of [[United States Department of State|State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]], [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the nation's media. Today, the preparation of innovative study materials and teachers' guides, as well as workshops for teachers, are among FPA top priorities.

An updated version of the history of the Foreign Policy Association is presented in this [http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid9203612001?bclid=14056331001&bctid=1618618645 video] narrated by noted evening news program anchor [[Tom Brokaw]] from ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''. It builds on the well-documented history of the Foreign Policy Association's service to the American public and the US policymakers in various branches of government, including updates on currents FPA programs and meetings.

The Foreign Policy Association celebrated its 100th anniversary at a gala held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/the-foreign-policy-association-celebrates-100-years/|title=The Foreign Policy Association celebrates 100 years|last=NYSD STAFF|date=5 November 2018|website=New York Social Diary}}</ref>
