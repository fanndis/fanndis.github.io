A '''monoclonal antibody''' ('''mAb''' or '''moAb''') is an [[antibody]] made by [[cloning]] a unique [[white blood cell]].  All subsequent antibodies derived this way trace back to a unique parent cell. 

[[Monoclonal]] antibodies can have [[monovalent antibody|monovalent]] affinity, binding only to the same [[epitope]] (the part of an [[antigen]] that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, [[polyclonal antibodies]] bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different antibody secreting [[plasma cell]] lineages. [[Bispecific monoclonal antibodies]] can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes.

It is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to virtually any suitable substance; they can then serve to detect or purify it. This capability has become an important tool in [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], and [[medicine]].

== History ==
The role monoclonal antibodies have come to assume was first postulated by early 20th century [[immunologist]] [[Paul Ehrlich]], who proposed the idea of a medical ''Zauberkugel'', a "[[Magic bullet (medicine)|magic bullet]]". This would be a compound that could be made to selectively target a disease-causing organism, which would allow a toxin for that organism to be delivered along with it. He and [[Élie Metchnikoff]] received the 1908 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for this work.

In the 1970s, the B-cell cancer [[multiple myeloma]] was known. It was understood that these cancerous B-cells all produce a single type of antibody (a [[paraprotein]]). This was used to study the structure of antibodies, but it was not yet possible to produce identical antibodies specific to a given [[antigen]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tansey EM, Catterall PP | title = Monoclonal antibodies: a witness seminar in contemporary medical history | journal = Medical History | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 322–7 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7934322 | pmc = 1036884 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300036632 }}</ref>{{rp|324}}

Production of monoclonal antibodies involving human–mouse hybrid cells was first described by [[Jerrold Schwaber]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwaber J, Cohen EP | title = Human x mouse somatic cell hybrid clone secreting immunoglobulins of both parental types | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5416 | pages = 444–7 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4200460 | doi = 10.1038/244444a0 | s2cid = 4171375 }}</ref>  This work remains widely cited among those using human-derived [[hybridomas]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cambrosio A, Keating P | title = Between fact and technique: the beginnings of hybridoma technology | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–230 | year = 1992 | pmid = 11623041 | doi = 10.1007/BF00162840 | s2cid = 45615711 }}</ref>

In 1975, [[Georges J. F. Köhler|Georges Köhler]] and [[César Milstein]] succeeded in making fusions of myeloma cell lines with [[B cells]] to create [[hybridomas]] that could produce antibodies, specific to known antigens and that were immortalized.<ref name="Marks">{{cite web |last1=Marks |first1=LV |title=The Story of César Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies |url=https://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/index.php/exhibitions/milstein/monoclonals |website=WhatisBiotechnology.org |access-date=23 September 2020 }}</ref> They and [[Niels Kaj Jerne]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1984 for the discovery.<ref name=Marks/>

In 1988, [[Greg Winter]] and his team pioneered the techniques to [[Humanized antibody|humanize]] monoclonal antibodies,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riechmann L, Clark M, Waldmann H, Winter G | title = Reshaping human antibodies for therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 332 | issue = 6162 | pages = 323–7 | date = March 1988 | pmid = 3127726 | doi = 10.1038/332323a0 | bibcode = 1988Natur.332..323R | s2cid = 4335569 }}</ref> eliminating the reactions that many monoclonal antibodies caused in some patients.

===Hybridoma development===
{{further|Hybridoma technology}}

Much of the work behind production of monoclonal antibodies is rooted in the production of hybridomas, which involves identifying antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells (ASPCs) that produce antibodies specific to an antigen of interest and [[Cell fusion|fusing]] these cells with [[Multiple myeloma|myeloma]] cells.<ref name="Marks"/> Rabbit B-cells can be used to form a [[Rabbit Hybridoma|rabbit hybridoma]]. [[Polyethylene glycol]] is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes,<ref>Yang J1, Shen MH. Polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion. Methods Mol Biol. 2006; 325:59-66.</ref> but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize '''[[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase]] (HGPRT)''', an enzyme necessary for the [[salvage pathway|salvage synthesis]] of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the [[de novo synthesis|de novo purine synthesis]] pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to [[aminopterin]] (a [[folic acid]] analogue, which inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]], DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully [[auxotrophic]] for [[nucleic acids]], thus requiring supplementation to survive.

The selective culture medium is called [[HAT medium]] because it contains [[hypoxanthine]], aminopterin and [[thymidine]]. This medium is selective for fused ([[hybridoma]]) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the medium because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).

This mixture of cells is then diluted and clones are grown from single parent cells on microtitre wells. The antibodies secreted by the different clones are then assayed for their ability to bind to the antigen (with a test such as [[ELISA]] or Antigen Microarray Assay) or immuno-[[dot blot]]. The most productive and stable clone is then selected for future use.

The hybridomas can be grown indefinitely in a suitable cell culture medium. They can also be injected into mice (in the [[peritoneum|peritoneal cavity]], surrounding the gut). There, they produce tumors secreting an antibody-rich fluid called [[ascites]] fluid.

The medium must be enriched during ''in vitro'' selection to further favour hybridoma growth. This can be achieved by the use of a layer of feeder fibrocyte cells or supplement medium such as briclone. Culture-media conditioned by macrophages can be used. Production in cell culture is usually preferred as the ascites technique is painful to the animal. Where alternate techniques exist, ascites is considered [[ethics|unethical]].<ref>National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods of Producing Monoclonal Antibodies.

Different from traditional hybridoma technology, the newer technologies use molecular biology techniques to amplify the heavy and light chains of the antibody genes by PCR and produce in either bacterial or mammalian systems with [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] technology. One of the advantages of the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals in the laboratory.

===Purification===
After obtaining either a media sample of cultured hybridomas or a sample of ascites fluid, the desired antibodies must be extracted. Cell culture sample contaminants consist primarily of media components such as growth factors, [[hormone]]s and [[transferrin]]s. In contrast, the ''in vivo'' sample is likely to have host antibodies, [[protease]]s, [[nuclease]]s, nucleic acids and [[virus]]es. In both cases, other secretions by the hybridomas such as [[cytokine]]s may be present. There may also be bacterial contamination and, as a result, [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxins]] that are secreted by the bacteria. Depending on the complexity of the media required in cell culture and thus the contaminants, one or the other method (''in vivo'' or ''in vitro'') may be preferable.

The sample is first conditioned, or prepared for purification. Cells, cell debris, lipids, and clotted material are first removed, typically by centrifugation followed by [[filtration]] with a 0.45&nbsp;µm filter. These large particles can cause a phenomenon called [[membrane fouling]] in later purification steps. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially in cases where the desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. The sample is therefore concentrated by [[ultrafiltration]] or [[Dialysis (biochemistry)|dialysis]].

Most of the charged impurities are usually [[anions]] such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by [[ion exchange chromatography]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlasak J, Ionescu R | title = Heterogeneity of monoclonal antibodies revealed by charge-sensitive methods | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 468–81 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19075686 | doi = 10.2174/138920108786786402 }}</ref> Either [[Ion|cation]] exchange [[chromatography]] is used at a low enough [[pH]] that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or [[anion exchange chromatography]] is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their [[isoelectric point]] (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge, and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, [[albumin]] has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.

Transferrin can instead be removed by [[size exclusion chromatography]]. This method is one of the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low [[elution]] times.

A much quicker, single-step method of separation is [[protein A/G]] [[affinity chromatography]]. The antibody selectively binds to protein A/G, so a high level of purity (generally >80%) is obtained. However, this method may be problematic for antibodies that are easily damaged, as harsh conditions are generally used. A low pH can break the bonds to remove the antibody from the column. In addition to possibly affecting the product, low pH can cause protein A/G itself to leak off the column and appear in the eluted sample. Gentle elution buffer systems that employ high salt concentrations are available to avoid exposing sensitive antibodies to low pH. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin.

To achieve maximum purity in a single step, affinity purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an [[agarose]] support. If the antigen is a [[peptide]], it is commonly synthesized with a terminal [[cysteine]], which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as [[keyhole limpet hemocyanin|KLH]] during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing medium is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt elution buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.

===Antibody heterogeneity===
Product heterogeneity is common in monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant biological products and is typically introduced either upstream during expression or downstream during manufacturing. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

These variants are typically aggregates, [[deamidation]] products, [[glycosylation]] variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, as well as amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck A, Wurch T, Bailly C, Corvaia N | title = Strategies and challenges for the next generation of therapeutic antibodies | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Chimeric antibodies ===
{{Main|Chimeric antibodies}}

While mouse and human antibodies are structurally similar the differences between them were sufficient to invoke an immune response when [[murine]] monoclonal antibodies were injected into humans, resulting in their rapid removal from the blood, as well as systemic inflammatory effects and the production of [[Human_anti-mouse_antibody|human anti-mouse antibodies]] (HAMA).

Recombinant DNA has been explored since the late 1980s to increase residence times. In one approach, mouse DNA encoding the binding portion of a monoclonal antibody was merged with human antibody-producing DNA in living cells. The expression of this "[[Recombinant DNA|chimeric]]" or "humanised" DNA through [[cell culture]] yielded part-mouse, part-human antibodies.<ref name="Boulianne_1984">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boulianne GL, Hozumi N, Shulman MJ | title = Production of functional chimaeric mouse/human antibody | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5995 | pages = 643–6 | date = 1984 | pmid = 6095115 | doi = 10.1038/312643a0 | s2cid = 4311503 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chadd HE, Chamow SM | title = Therapeutic antibody expression technology | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 188–94 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11287236 | doi = 10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00198-1 }}</ref>

Monoclonal antibodies have been approved to treat [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Inflammation#Inflammatory disorders|inflammatory diseases]], [[macular degeneration]], [[transplant rejection]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[infection|viral infection]].

In August 2006, the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] reported that U.S. companies had 160 different monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials or awaiting approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>''PhRMA Reports Identifies More than 400 Biotech Drugs in Development.'' Pharmaceutical Technology, August 24, 2006. Retrieved 2006-09-04.</ref>

== Cost ==
Monoclonal antibodies are more expensive to manufacture than small molecules due to the complex processes involved and the general size of the molecules, this is all in addition to the enormous research and development costs involved in bringing a new chemical entity to patients. They are priced to enable manufacturers to recoup the typically large investment costs, and where there are no price controls, such as the United States, prices can be higher if they provide great value.  Seven [[University of Pittsburgh]] researchers concluded, "The annual price of mAb therapies is about $100,000 higher in oncology and hematology than in other disease states," comparing them on a per patient basis, to those for cardiovascular or metabolic disorders, immunology, infectious diseases, allergy, and ophthalmology.<ref name="pmid29461857">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernandez I, Bott SW, Patel AS, Wolf CG, Hospodar AR, Sampathkumar S, Shrank WH | title = Pricing of monoclonal antibody therapies: higher if used for cancer? | journal = The American Journal of Managed Care | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–112 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29461857 }}</ref>

== Applications ==

===Diagnostic tests===

Once monoclonal antibodies for a given substance have been produced, they can be used to detect the presence of this substance. Proteins can be detected using the [[Western blot]] and immuno [[dot blot]] tests. In [[immunohistochemistry]], monoclonal antibodies can be used to detect antigens in fixed tissue sections, and similarly, [[immunofluorescence]] can be used to detect a substance in either frozen tissue section or live cells.

===Analytic and chemical uses===

Antibodies can also be used to purify their target compounds from mixtures, using the method of [[immunoprecipitation]].

===Therapeutic uses===
{{Main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies act through multiple mechanisms, such as blocking of targeted molecule functions, inducing [[apoptosis]] in cells which express the target, or by modulating signalling pathways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Breedveld FC | title = Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies | journal = Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9205 | pages = 735–40 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10703815 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)01034-5 | s2cid = 43781004 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)01034-5/fulltext | author-link = Ferry Breedveld }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/29/5/130/3/#2|title=Monoclonal antibody therapy for non-malignant disease|year=2006|author=Australian Prescriber|journal=Australian Prescriber|volume=29|issue=5|pages=130–133|doi=10.18773/austprescr.2006.079|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==== Cancer treatment ====
One possible treatment for [[cancer]] involves monoclonal antibodies that bind only to cancer-cell-specific [[antigen]]s and induce an [[Cancer immunotherapy|immune response]] against the target cancer cell. Such mAbs can be modified for delivery of a [[toxin]], [[radionuclide|radioisotope]], [[cytokine]] or other active conjugate or to design [[bispecific antibody|bispecific antibodies]] that can bind with their [[Fragment antigen binding|Fab regions]] both to target antigen and to a conjugate or effector cell. Every intact antibody can bind to cell receptors or other proteins with its [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc region]].

====Autoimmune diseases====
Monoclonal antibodies used for [[autoimmune disease]]s include [[infliximab]] and [[adalimumab]], which are effective in [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[ankylosing spondylitis]] by their ability to bind to and inhibit [[TNF-α]].<ref name=Rang/> [[Basiliximab]] and [[daclizumab]] inhibit [[interleukin-2|IL-2]] on activated [[T cells]] and thereby help prevent acute [[organ rejection|rejection]] of kidney transplants.<ref name=Rang/> [[Omalizumab]] inhibits human [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) and is useful in treating moderate-to-severe allergic [[asthma]].
