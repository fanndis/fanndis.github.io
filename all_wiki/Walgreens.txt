'''Walgreen Company''', [[d/b/a]] '''Walgreens''', is an American company that operates as the second-largest [[Pharmacy (shop)|pharmacy store]] chain in the United States behind [[CVS Health]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/06/30/cvs-to-buy-all-of-targets-pharmacy-stores-a-win-win-for-both/#1b65050769d1|title=CVS to Buy All of Target's Pharmacy Stores -- A Win-Win For Both|first=Trefis|last=Team}}</ref> It specializes in filling prescriptions, health and wellness products, health information, and photo services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walgreens.com|title=Welcome to Walgreens - Your Home for Prescriptions, Photos and Health Information|website=www.walgreens.com}}</ref> As of August&nbsp;31, 2019, the company operated 9,277<!-- exact count changes regularly--> stores in the United States. It was founded in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1901. The Walgreens headquarters office is in the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago suburb]] of [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], Illinois<!--Specify state because some Chicago suburbs are in Indiana and Wisconsin-->.<!--Cited in headquarters section-->

In 2014, the company agreed to purchase the remaining 55% of Switzerland-based [[Alliance Boots]] that it did not already own to form a global business. Under the terms of the purchase, the two companies merged to form a new [[holding company]], [[Walgreens Boots Alliance]] Inc., on December 31, 2014. Walgreens became a subsidiary of the new company, which retains its Deerfield headquarters and trades on the [[Nasdaq]] under the symbol {{NasdaqSymbol|WBA}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linnane|first1=Ciara|title=Walgreen ticker changes to WBA after merger with Boots Alliance|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/walgreen-ticker-changes-to-wba-after-merger-with-boots-alliance-2014-12-31 |website=Market Watch|accessdate=December 31, 2014|date=December 31, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Company history===
[[File:Old "Walgreen" sign, San Antonio.JPG|thumb|Early "Walgreen Drugs" sign still in use in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]]]Walgreens began in 1901, with a small food front store on the corner of Bowen and Cottage Grove Avenues in Chicago, owned by [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]] native [[Charles Rudolph Walgreen|Charles R. Walgreen]].<ref>{{cite web
|url= http://www.walgreens.com/topic/about/companyhistory.jsp|title= Our History|publisher= Walgreens
|accessdate= March 6, 2008}}</ref> By 1913, Walgreens had grown to four stores on [[Chicago's South Side]]. It opened its fifth in 1915 and four more in 1916. By 1919, there were 20 stores in the chain. As a result of [[Prohibition in the United States|alcohol prohibition]], the 1920s were a successful time for Walgreens. Although alcohol was illegal, prescription whiskey was available and sold by Walgreens.<ref>{{cite news|title=When Cannabis Meets Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27pot.html|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

In 1922 the company introduced a [[malt]]ed [[milkshake]], which led to its establishing ice cream manufacturing plants. The next year, Walgreen began opening stores away from residential areas. In the mid 1920s, there were 44 stores with annual sales of $1,200,000 combined. Walgreens had also expanded by then into [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], and [[Wisconsin]].

By 1930 it had 397 stores with annual sales of [[US$]]4,000,000. This expansion partly was attributed to selling prescribed alcohol, mainly whiskey, which Walgreen often stocked under the counter, as accounted in Daniel Okrent's ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition''.<ref>Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (197)</ref> The stock market crash in October 1929 and the subsequent [[Great Depression]] did not greatly affect the company. By 1934, Walgreens was operating in 30 states with 601 stores.

After Charles Walgreen Sr. died in 1939, his son [[Charles Rudolph Walgreen Jr.|Charles R. Walgreen Jr.]] took over the chain until his retirement. The Charles R. Walgreen (Walgreen Jr.) years were relatively prosperous, but lacked the massive expansion seen in the early part of the century. Charles "Cork" R. Walgreen III took over after Walgreen Jr.'s retirement in the early 1950s and modernized the company by switching to [[barcode]] scanning. The Walgreen family was not involved in senior management of the company for a short time following Walgreen III's retirement.

In 1986, it acquired the MediMart chain from Stop & Shop.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3007/is_15_25/ai_n29055026/ | work=Chain Drug Review | title=Walgreens buys Medi Mart | year=2003}}</ref>

In 1995, Kevin P. Walgreen was made a vice-president and promoted to Senior Vice President of Store Operations in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.walgreens.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1108 |title= Kevin P.

On July 12, 2006, [[David Bernauer]] stepped down as CEO of Walgreens and was replaced by company president [[Jeff Rein]]. Holding degrees in accounting and pharmacy from the University of Arizona, Rein was a pharmacist, store manager, district manager, and treasurer prior to being named [[Chief Executive Officer]] and [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]]. Greg Wasson, former President of [[Walgreens Health Services]], was named President and Chief Operations Officer.

On October 10, 2008, Rein abruptly quit as CEO and was replaced by Alan G. McNally as Chairman and Acting CEO.<ref name="reinretires"> {{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/walgreen-ceo-exits-after-two-years-at-helm|title=Walgreen CEO quits after two years at helm|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=October 16, 2020}}</ref>

This development coincided with the invention of the [[Blender (device)|electric blender]] in the same year.

In November 2010 Walgreens filed a [[trademark infringement]] [[lawsuit]] against the [[Wegmans]] supermarket chain, claiming the "W" in the Wegman's logo is too similar to Walgreens'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walgreens sues Wegmans in logo dispute |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 6, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/AP0d26cbf8d065497781f4dc5f4336a3b3.html |accessdate=November 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222151/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP0d26cbf8d065497781f4dc5f4336a3b3.html |archive-date=November 8, 2010 }}</ref> The lawsuit was settled in April 2011, with Wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its "W" logo by June 2012, although the supermarket retains the right to use the "Wegmans" name in script.<ref name="auipb">{{cite web |url= http://www.ipbrief.net/2011/04/27/wegmans-settles-with-walgreens-over-war-of-w%E2%80%99s/|title= Wegmans Settles with Walgreens over War of W's|author= Richard Patterson|date= April 27, 2011|work= Intellectual Property Brief|publisher= American University|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> According to Jo Natale, Wegmans director of media relations, "The cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end."<ref name="walgreenpr">{{cite web|url=http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PressReleaseDetailView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&catalogId=10002&productId=720935 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505055539/http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PressReleaseDetailView?productId=720935&storeId=10052&catalogId=10002&langId=-1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2011 |title=Press Release: Wegmans Releases Statement on Lawsuit Resolution |accessdate=June 9, 2011 }}</ref>

The logo for the [[Washington Nationals]] baseball team is very similar to the Walgreens "W" (though it dates back to the 1960s iteration of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)#Washington Senators (1961–1971)|Washington Senators]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2011/05/06/the-law-of-the-letter-could-nats-curly-w-be-taken-away/|title=The Law of the Letter: Could Nats' Curly W Be Taken Away?|work=Washington City Paper|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> to date, Walgreens never challenged the Nationals' use of their "W" in a lawsuit.

==Store model==
[[File:Walgreens store.jpg|thumb|A Walgreens on Rt.1 South, Saugus, Massachusetts]]

Walgreens stores were once connected to local groceries. In Chicago, their flagship market, they teamed up with either [[Eagle Food Centers]] or [[Dominick's]] Finer Foods, usually with a "walkthru" to the adjoining store and often sharing personnel. This concept was instated to compete with the popular dual-store format used by chief competitor [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel-Osco]]/Albertsons-Sav-On. They eventually ended the relationship with Eagle and focused primarily on a connection to the Dominick's stores. PharmX-[[Rexall]] filled the vacated Walgreen locations joined to Eagle stores.

[[File:Washington Marriott.JPG|thumb|left|A Walgreens "corner drugstore", located in a [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott]] street-level retail space, on the corner of a heavily trafficked intersection in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In its 2009 business model, Walgreens are freestanding corner stores, with the entrance on the street with the most [[traffic flow]], figuratively making it a "corner drugstore" similar to how many independent pharmacies evolved. Many stores have a drive-through pharmacy.<ref>{{cite web

Most freestanding stores have a similar look and layout, including a bigger and more spacious layout than certain stores within major cities. Newer buildings have a more modern design to them compared to older stores. Stores within major cities, such as [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], could have multiple floors. Behind the front registers are [[tobacco products]] and [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]]. However, some stores do not sell these products, e.g., [[Alcohol laws of New Jersey|New Jersey]] stores that do not sell alcohol and [[Massachusetts]] stores that do not sell tobacco.<ref name=":0"/> Stores usually have a beauty counter located near the cosmetics, with busier stores having a [[Consultant|beauty consultant]]. All stores have a photo department, which is either behind the front register or in a separate part of the store. There are self-serve photo [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]] near the photo department, where customers can print photos and photo products. All stores have a [[pharmacy]], usually located in the back, where people can drop off and pick up [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]] as well as purchase certain drugs containing [[pseudoephedrine]].

In the 1980s Walgreens owned and operated a chain of casual family restaurants/[[pancake house]]s called [[Wag's]], an attempt to compete with [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] [[lunch counter]]s. The Wag's restaurants were very similar in concept to [[Denny's]], [[IHOP]], and Golden Bear. At the high point, it had over 100 locations. Walgreens sold most of these to [[Marriott Corp.]] in 1988,<ref>{{cite news

==Consumer record==
In February 2020, Walgreens agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a consumer protection lawsuit accusing the company of placing people’s health at risk by allowing an untrained person to handle over 745,000 prescriptions. (This included over 100,000 prescriptions of controlled substances.) The State of California, Alameda County and Santa Clara County all took part in the investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/03/walgreens-to-pay-7-5-million-to-settle-fake-pharmacist-lawsuit/|title=Walgreens to pay $7.5 million to settle fake pharmacist lawsuit |work=San Jose Mercury News}}</ref>

A San Jose, California, court in January 2018 allowed Walgreens to pay $2.25 million to resolve a consumer protection lawsuit brought by Bay Area prosecutors alleging that the company sold expired baby food, infant formula and over-the-counter drugs. The suit also alleged that Walgreens violated state law by charging more than the lowest posted or advertised price for items.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/30/bay-area-walgreens-settles-suit-claiming-it-sold-expired-baby-food/ |title=Walgreens settles lawsuit alleging it sold expired baby food in Bay Area |last=Green |first=Jason |work=The Mercury News |date=January 31, 2018 |accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref>

===Investor relations===
In September 2018 Walgreens agreed to pay $34.5 million to settle a [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigation on charges of misleading investors on financial targets. The SEC alleged that former CEO Greg Wasson and then-CFO Wade Miquelon acted "negligently" in giving financial estimates.<ref>{{cite web |last=LaVito |first=Angelica |title=Walgreens to pay $34.5 million to settle charges of misleading investors on financial targets |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/sec-charges-walgreens-and-2-former-execs-with-misleading-investors-on-earnings-goals.html |website=CNBC |accessdate=May 2, 2019 |language=en |date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Prescriptions===
[[File:Walgreenssign.jpg|thumb|right|A Walgreens in [[Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey]], which opened in 2006]]
As of June 2008, Walgreens "agreed to stop altering prescriptions without physician approval as part of a multi-state agreement to settle allegations of improper billing," reported the ''Knoxville News Sentinel'':<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jun/05/walgreens-agrees-stop-altering-perscriptions/ |work=Knoxville News Sentinel |title=Walgreens agrees to stop altering perscriptions &#91;sic&#93; |date=June 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmacyfraudsettlement.com/Walgreens/ |title=The Walgreens Case |publisher=Behn & Wyetzner }}</ref>

Walgreen Co. agreed to comply with state and federal laws on the matter, plus pay $35 million to the federal government, 42 states and the [[Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]].}}

"The compliance agreement will be in effect for five years. Walgreens did not admit liability, as part of the settlement," reported the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walgreens to pay $35 million to settle drug-fraud suit |url=http://www.suntimes.com/business/986995,wags060408.article |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=June 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607002953/http://www.suntimes.com/business/986995%2Cwags060408.article |archive-date=June 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 27, 2013 }}</ref>

===Medicaid===
Also in 2008, Walgreens "agreed to pay $35 million to the U.S. and 42 states and Puerto Rico for overcharging state Medicaid programs by filling prescriptions with more expensive dosage forms of ranitidine, a generic form of Zantac and fluoxetine, which is a generic form of Prozac."<ref name="Kell">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204409004577158743226473430.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=John | last=Kell | title=Lawsuit Says Walgreen, Par Pharma Overcharged | date=January 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009 Walgreens threatened to leave the Medicaid program, the state and federal partnership to provide health insurance coverage to the poor, in Delaware, over reimbursement rates. Walgreens was the largest pharmacy chain in the state and the only chain to make such a threat.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/04/walgreen-idUSN0422921420090604 | work=Reuters | title=UPDATE 1-Walgreen exiting Delaware Medicaid program | date=June 4, 2009}}</ref> The state of Delaware and Walgreens reached an agreement on payment rates and the crisis was averted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chaindrugreview.com/front-page/newsbreaks/reports-walgreens-reaches-medicaid-rx-deal-in-delaware|title=Reports: Walgreens reaches Medicaid Rx deal in Delaware|date=August 11, 2009|accessdate=June 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095610/http://www.chaindrugreview.com/front-page/newsbreaks/reports-walgreens-reaches-medicaid-rx-deal-in-delaware|archive-date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>

On April 20, 2012, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] announced that Walgreens agreed to pay $7.9 million in settlement.

===Use of proprietary drugs===
Walgreens was named in a lawsuit by the [[United Food and Commercial Workers|United Food and Commercial Workers Unions]] and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund in the Northern District Court of Illinois in January 2012. The suit alleges Walgreens and [[Par Pharmaceutical]] violated the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]<ref>[http://ifawebnews.com/2012/01/24/walgreen-par-sued-for-alleged-rico-violations-drug-overcharges/ Walgreen, Par sued for alleged RICO violations, drug overcharges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022003324/http://ifawebnews.com/2012/01/24/walgreen-par-sued-for-alleged-rico-violations-drug-overcharges/ |date=October 22, 2012 }}.

{{quote|The lawsuit alleges drugstore chain Walgreen and generic pharmaceutical maker Par established a partnership in which Par manufactured and/or marketed generic versions of antacid Zantac and antidepressant Prozac in dosage forms that weren't subject to private and governmental reimbursement limitations.

It further said Walgreen purchased those dosage forms from Par at a cost substantially higher than the widely prescribed dosage forms and then "systematically and unlawfully filled its customers' prescriptions with Par's more expensive products rather than the inexpensive dosage forms that were prescribed by physicians."}}

===Distribution of oxycodone===
In September 2012 the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) accused Walgreens of endangering public safety and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its [[Jupiter, Florida]], distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. In contrast, in 2011 the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011, this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Florida, a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is "an imminent danger to the public safety." All DEA licensees "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting into the hands of legitimate patients," said Mark Trouville, former DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper."

The Jupiter, Florida, distribution center, which opened in 2001, is one of 12 such distribution centers owned by Walgreens. Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter facility has been the largest distributor of oxycodone in the state of Florida, the DEA said. Over the past three years, its market share has increased, and 52 Walgreens are among the top 100 oxycodone purchasers in the state, the DEA said.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012/09/17/walgreens-and-oxycodone/57782912/1 Walgreens and Oxycodone – USATODAY.com].

In 2013 [[United States Attorney]] [[Wifredo Ferrer]] said Walgreens committed "an unprecedented number" of recordkeeping and dispensing violations. Walgreens was fined $80 million, the largest fine in the history of the Controlled Substances Act at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/11/walgreens-drug-oxycodone-license-80-million/2412451/|title=Walgreens to pay $80 million for oxycodone violations}}</ref>

===Sale of tobacco===
In common with other U.S. pharmacies (a major exception is [[CVS Pharmacy]]), Walgreens stocks [[tobacco products]] for sale to the public. Some campaigners in the United States advocate the [[Tobacco-Free Pharmacies|removal of tobacco from pharmacies]] owing to the [[Health effects of tobacco|health risks associated with smoking]] and the apparent contradiction of selling cigarettes alongside [[smoking cessation]] products and [[asthma medication]].<ref name=ANR>{{cite web|title=Tobacco-Free Pharmacies |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?id=615 |work=Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights |accessdate=July 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522033905/http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?id=615 |archive-date=May 22, 2010 }}</ref> Walgreens and other pharmacies who continue to sell tobacco products have been subject to criticism, and attempts have been made to introduce regional bans on the practice, which has taken place in the City and County of [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Rubenstein| first = Sarah| title = Cigarette Sales in Drugstores Come Under Fire| newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]]| date = July 29, 2008| url = https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/07/29/cigarette-sales-in-drugstores-come-under-fire/| accessdate = April 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last = Hussar, PhD| first = Daniel A.| title = Pharmacy cigarette sales must end| newspaper = Modern Medicine| date = March 1, 2009| url = http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/Modern+Medicine+Now/Pharmacy-cigarette-sales-must-end/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/585685| accessdate = April 16, 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714111244/http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/Modern+Medicine+Now/Pharmacy-cigarette-sales-must-end/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/585685| archive-date = July 14, 2011| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Walgreens defends its tobacco sales policy by reasoning that through selling tobacco in its outlets, it is more readily able to offer to customers advice and products for quitting smoking. As of December 2017, Walgreens changed its slogan from "At the corner of happy and healthy" and "On your way to Well" to "Trusted since 1901". As of January 1, 2019, with the commonwealth-wide prohibition of the sale of tobacco and similar products in pharmacies, Walgreens no longer sells those products in its Massachusetts locations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://countertobacco.org/massachusetts-becomes-6th-state-to-pass-tobacco-21-1st-state-to-prohibit-tobacco-sales-in-pharmacies/|title=Massachusetts becomes 6th state to pass Tobacco 21, 1st State to Prohibit Tobacco Sales in Pharmacies – Counter Tobacco|website=countertobacco.org|access-date=December 5, 2018}}</ref>

On October 7, 2019, Walgreens announced the end of sales for all [[e-cigarette]] products (including market leaders [[blu eCigs|blu]] and [[Juul]]) within the next few weeks, to be wound down in an 'orderly manner'.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/07/walgreens-kroger-ecigarette-sales-vaping/3902875002/|title=E-cigarette sales discontinued at Walgreens, Kroger as crisis continues|last=Bomey|first=Nathan|date=October 7, 2019|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>
===Theranos Partnership===
In 2013, Walgreens partnered with [[Theranos]] to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations in Arizona, providing Theranos with 150 million dollars via a blood test prepurchase agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/18/walgreens-blood-tests/|title=Walgreens to offer affordable and needle-free blood tests in more stores (updated)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=November 18, 2014|access-date=September 4, 2016|author=Moon, Mariella}}</ref> Although Theranos blood tests were previously used on drug trial patients for [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Pfizer]], both companies stated that there were no active projects with Theranos in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656196-theranos-ambitious-silicon-valley-firm-wants-shake-up-market-medical|title=Young blood|work=[[The Economist]]|date=June 27, 2015|access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Duhaime-Ross">{{Cite web|title = Theranos didn't work with the huge drug company it supposedly made money from, drug company says|last=Duhaime-Ross|first=Arielle|date=October 26, 2015|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9618390/Theranos-glaxosmithkline-denies-partnership-pfizer-blood-test|website = The Verge|accessdate = October 29, 2015}}</ref> In November 2016, Walgreen Co. filed suit against Theranos in a federal court in Delaware, for breach of contract, citing relevations of inaccurate blood tests, and incompetent analysis.

===Pricing and advertising===
[[Wisconsin]]'s [[Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection|Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection]] fined Walgreens over differences between shelf price and scanned price and for signage in 2012. In 2013, Walgreens paid a $29,241 fine.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Walgreens fined for price scanner inaccuracies| date = March 25, 2013 | url = https://www.channel3000.com/news/local-news/walgreens-fined-for-price-scanner-inaccuracies/158694113 | accessdate = March 3, 2018}}</ref>

The New York State Attorney General announced in April 2016 that a settlement was reached in complaint that Walgreens used misleading advertising and overcharged consumers. Walgreens would pay $500,000 in penalties, fees and costs, and change advertising and other practices.<ref>{{Cite news| last = HEATH| first = DAN| title = Walgreens fined over pricing issues |newspaper = PRESS REPUBLICAN| date = April 21, 2016 | url = http://www.pressrepublican.com/news/local_news/walgreens-fined-over-pricing-issues/article_ce288c0b-1f1e-5fc8-bd92-7f9c39c27a78.html | accessdate = March 4, 2018}}</ref>

A judge in Kansas City, Missouri, ordered Walgreens to pay a $309,000 fine for pricing discrepancies in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news| last = HEATH| first = DAN| title = Missouri judge fines Walgreens $309,000 in pricing case | newspaper = The Spokesman-Review| date = June 17, 2016 | url = http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/jun/17/missouri-judge-fines-walgreens-309000-in-pricing-c/ | accessdate = March 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Medication denied because of religious beliefs===
In June 2018 a staff pharmacist at a Walgreens in [[Peoria, Arizona]], refused to give a woman medication to end her pregnancy. The medication was prescribed by a doctor after tests revealed that the pregnancy would end in a miscarriage. The woman said she was left "in tears and humiliated". Walgreens responded that its policy "allows pharmacists to step away from filling a prescription for which they have a moral objection".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44591528|title=Pregnant woman 'humiliated' by Walgreens|last=Seales|first=Rebecca|date=June 24, 2018 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=June 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Walgreens/photos/a.305142443610.145906.117497138610/10155931214178611/ |title=Walgreens |publisher=[[Facebook]] |access-date=June 24, 2018}}</ref>
