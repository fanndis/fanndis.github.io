{{New York State Judiciary}}

The '''Supreme Court of the State of New York''' is the [[trial court|trial-level court]] of [[general jurisdiction]] in the [[New York (state)|New York State]] [[judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]]. (Its [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]] is also the highest intermediate appellate court.) It is vested with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, although outside New York City it acts primarily as a court of civil jurisdiction, with most criminal matters handled in [[New York County Court|County Court]].<ref name=budget>{{cite book|title=State of New York Judiciary Budget: FY 2014-15|page=18|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/admin/financialops/BGT14-15/2014-15-Budget.pdf}}</ref> 

The court is radically different from its counterparts in nearly all other states in that the Supreme Court is a trial court and is not the highest court in the state. The highest court of the State of New York is the [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]].  Also, although it is a trial court, the Supreme Court sits as a "single great tribunal of general state-wide jurisdiction, rather than an aggregation of separate courts sitting in the several counties or judicial districts of the state."<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6768289440139654524 Schneider v. Aulisi]'', 307 N.Y. 376, 384, 121 N.E.2d 375 (1954).</ref> There is a branch of the Supreme Court in each of [[List of New York counties|New York's 62 counties]].<ref name=budget/>  

==Jurisdiction==
[[File:NYC - New York County Supreme Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|[[New York County Courthouse]] at 60 Centre Street, viewed from across [[Foley Square]]]]

Under the New York State Constitution, the New York State Supreme Court has unlimited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases, with the exception of certain monetary claims against the State of New York itself. In practice, the Supreme Court hears civil actions involving claims above a certain monetary amount (for example, $25,000 in New York City) that puts the claim beyond the jurisdiction of lower courts.<ref name=guide1999p1-3>{{cite book|title=The New York State Courts: An Introductory Guide|publisher=[[New York State Office of Court Administration]]|year=2016|oclc=39042187|url=http://ww2.nycourts.gov/admin/NYCourts-IntroGuide.pdf|pages=1–3|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Civil actions about lesser sums are heard by courts of limited jurisdiction, such as the [[New York City Civil Court]], or the [[New York County Court|County Court]], [[New York District Court|District Court]], city courts, or [[New York justice courts|justice courts]] (town and village courts) outside New York City.<ref name=guide1999p1-3/>

The Supreme Court also hears civil cases involving claims for equitable relief, such as injunctions, specific performance, or rescission of a contract, as well as actions for a [[declaratory judgment]]. The Supreme Court also has [[exclusive jurisdiction]] of matrimonial actions, such as either contested or uncontested actions for a [[divorce]] or [[annulment]]. The court also has exclusive jurisdiction over "Article 78 proceedings" against a body or officer seeking to overturn an official determination on the grounds that it was [[arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable]] or contrary to law.<ref>[[Civil Practice Law and Rules]] article 78</ref>

In 1995, the New York Supreme Court established a trial level Commercial Division, beginning in New York County (Manhattan)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/comdiv/ny/newyork.shtml|title=Commercial Division - NY Supreme Court - New York County Home|website=www.nycourts.gov|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> and Monroe County (the 7th Judicial District<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/comdiv/7thdistrict.shtml|title=Commercial Division - NY Supreme Court - 7th Judicial District|website=www.nycourts.gov|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/comdiv/history.shtml|title=Supreme Court - Commercial Division - History|website=www.nycourts.gov|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> The Commercial Division has expanded to the 8th District (located in Buffalo), and the Albany, Kings, Nassau, Onondaga, Queens, Suffolk and Westchester County Supreme Courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/comdiv/|title=Commercial Division - NY Supreme Court - Home|website=www.nycourts.gov|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>  These are specialized [[Business courts|Business Courts]], with a defined jurisdiction focusing on business and commercial litigation. The jurisdictional amount in controversy required to have a case heard in the Commercial Division varies among these Commercial Division courts, ranging from $50,000 in Albany and Onondaga Counties to $500,000 in New York County, but the Commercial Division rules (Section 202.70) are otherwise uniform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.nycourts.gov/rules/trialcourts/202.shtml#70|title=PART 202.

With respect to criminal cases, the Criminal Branch of Supreme Court tries [[felony]] cases in the five counties of New York City, whereas they are primarily heard by the [[New York County Court|County Court]] elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|title=Governing New York State|page=172|first=Jeffrey M.|last=Stonecash|year=2001|edition=4th|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|isbn=0-7914-4888-6|lccn=00-032955|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAQJfQkxPFMC&pg=PA172}}</ref> Misdemeanor cases, and arraignments in almost all cases, are handled by lower courts: the [[New York City Criminal Court]]; the District Court in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] and the five western towns of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]; city courts; and justice courts, and so on.

==Structure==

===Appellate Division===
{{main|New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division}}
[[File:2nd Dept NY Supreme Court Pierrepont Monroe jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Second Department]]

Appeals from Supreme Court decisions, as well as from the Surrogate's Court, Family Court, and Court of Claims, are heard by the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]]. This court is intermediate between the New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals.

There is one Appellate Division, which for administrative purposes comprises four judicial departments.<ref>''Mountain View Coach Lines v. Storms'', 102 A.D.2d 663, 476 N.Y.S.2d 918 (2d Dept. 1984).</ref>

Decisions of the Appellate Division department panels are binding on the lower courts in that department, and also on lower courts in other departments unless there is contrary authority from the Appellate Division of that department.<ref name=notebook>{{cite book|title=New York Trial Notebook|first1=Edward L.|last1=Birnbaum|first2=Ariel E.|last2=Belen|first3=Carl T.|last3=Grasso|year=2012|edition=6th|pages=1–23|publisher=James Publishing|isbn=1-58012-104-7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=P8QOAKjF4zgC&pg=SA1-PA23}}</ref><ref>''Duffy v.

===Appellate terms===
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in each judicial department is authorized to establish "appellate terms".{{sfn|Galie|Bopst|2012|p=177}} An appellate term is an intermediate appellate court that hears appeals from the inferior courts within their designated counties or judicial districts, and are intended to ease the workload on the Appellate Division and provide a less expensive forum closer to the people.{{sfn|Galie|Bopst|2012|p=177}} Appellate terms are located in the First and Second Judicial Departments only.{{sfn|Galie|Bopst|2012|p=177}} (The [[New York County Court|County Court]] "appellate sessions" hear appeals from the inferior courts in the Third and Fourth Judicial Departments.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Practice of Law in New York State: An Introduction For Newly-Admitted Attorneys|page=6|author1=[[New York State Bar Association|NYSBA]] Committee on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar|author2=NYSBA Membership Committee|date=September 2012|publisher=[[New York State Bar Association]]|url=http://old.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Publications/ThePracticeofLawinNewYorkStatemembersonly/Practice_of_Law_2012-2013.pdf|ref={{harvid|Practice of Law|2012}}}}</ref>)

In New York City, the Appellate Term hears appeals from the [[New York City Civil Court]] and [[New York City Criminal Court|Criminal Court]]. In the Second Department outside New York City, it hears appeals from the Nassau and Suffolk County [[New York District Court|District Courts]], city courts, and justice (town and village) courts.

Appellate terms consist of between three and five justices of the Supreme Court, appointed by the [[Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts|Chief Administrative Judge]] with the approval of presiding justice of the appropriate appellate division. The court sits in three-judge panels, with two justices constituting a quorum and being necessary for a decision.{{sfn|Galie|Bopst|2012|p=177}} Decisions by the Appellate Term must be followed by courts whose appeals lie to it.<ref>28 NY Jur 2d, Courts and Judges § 220, at 274 [1997]</ref><ref>''Yellow Book of NY L.P. v.

A judge of the New York Supreme Court is titled "justice".

===Elections===
{{see also|Elections in New York}}

Supreme Court justices are elected.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Local Government Handbook|year=2009|edition=6th|publisher=[[New York State Department of State]]|ref={{harvid|Local Government Handbook}}|url=http://www.dos.ny.gov/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf|page=21}}</ref> Justices are nominated by judicial district nominating conventions, with judicial delegates themselves elected from assembly districts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Judicial Selection Methods in the State of New York: A Guide to Understanding and Getting Involved in the Selection Process|author=[[New York City Bar Association]] Council on Judicial Administration|date=March 2014|publisher=[[New York City Bar Association]]|pages=23–27|url=http://www2.nycbar.org/pdf/report/uploads/20072672-GuidetoJudicialSelectionMethodsinNewYork.pdf|ref={{harvid|NYC Bar|2014}}}}</ref> Some (political party) county committees play a significant role in their judicial district conventions, for example restricting nomination to those candidates that receive approval from a party screening committee.{{sfn|NYC Bar|2014|pp=16-18}} Sometimes, the parties [[Electoral fusion|cross-endorse]] each other's candidates, while at other times they do not and incumbent judges must actively campaign for re-election.

Lopez Torres|N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres]]'', which upheld the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system.

New York Supreme Court justices are elected to 14-year terms. A Supreme Court Justice's term ends, even if the 14-year term has not yet expired, at the end of the calendar year in which he or she reaches the age of 70. However, an elected Supreme Court Justice may obtain certification to continue in office, without having to be re-elected, for three two-year periods, until final retirement at the end of the year in which the Justice turns 76. These additional six years of service are available only for elected Supreme Court Justices, not for "Acting" Justices whose election or appointments were to lower courts.

===Assignments===

In many counties, the number of New York Supreme Court justices is fewer than the number of needed justices. For that reason, judges of the [[New York City Civil Court]], [[New York City Criminal Court]], [[New York Family Court]], and [[New York Court of Claims]] are designated as Acting Supreme Court Justices.

==History==
The New York Supreme Court is the oldest Supreme Court with general original jurisdiction. It was established as the Supreme Court of Judicature by the [[Province of New York]] on May 6, 1691.  That court was continued by the State of New York after independence was declared in 1776.  It became the New York Supreme Court under the New York Constitutional Convention of 1846.

In November 2004, the court system merged the operations of two separate criminal courts—the [[New York City Criminal Court|Bronx County Criminal Court]] and the Criminal Term of Bronx County Supreme Court—into a single trial court of criminal jurisdiction known as the Bronx Criminal Division.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bronx Criminal Division: Merger After Five Years|publisher=[[New York State Unified Court System]]|date=October 2009|oclc=491295164|url=https://www.nycourts.gov/publications/pdfs/BronxReport11-09.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Report on the Merger of the Bronx Supreme and Criminal Courts|publisher=[[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]|date=June 2009|url=http://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/20071735Merger_BronxSupreme_CriminalCourts.pdf}}</ref>
