==Documentary career==
''VIVA Magazine'' wrote of Brettkelly: ''“An extraordinary person who has led an extraordinary life… from Libya to Sudan, Afghanistan and China."'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.nz/article/fashion/award-winning-film-maker-pietra-brettkelly/|title=Inside Film-Maker Pietra Brettkelly's New Documentary Yellow Is Forbidden - Viva|last=Magazine|first=Viva|website=www.viva.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}<br> </blockquote>Brettkelly's work is recognised for its considered quietness, a cinema verite approach that allows her subjects to tell their stories.  She famously was one of the first journalists to interview Colonel Gadaffi, for her first feature documentary ''Beauty Will Save The World'' (2003), during the negotiations over the lifting of the UN embargoes on Libya.</ref>

Brettkelly's 2018 film, ''[[Yellow Is Forbidden]]'', premiered In Competition and Opening Weekend at Tribeca Film Festival. ''Vogue Magazine'' noted it as a ''“film that is … a celebration of how extraordinary women are"'';<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/guo-pei-yellow-is-forbidden-pietra-brettkelly|title="Yellow Is Forbidden" Is A Celebration Of How Remarkable Women Are|website=British Vogue|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> the film was selected for both the Best Foreign Language and Best Documentary sections of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' called it, ''"[a] deliciously intimate film ... a near visceral experience''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/from-bomber-jackets-to-bling-miff-struts-its-fashion-cred-20180716-h12r8g.html|title=From bomber jackets to bling, MIFF struts its fashion cred|last=Burns|first=Janice Breen|date=2018-07-20|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>”.

Brettkelly's film, ''[[A Flickering Truth]]'', which documents the unearthing of the Afghan Film Archive in Kabul, Afghanistan, premiered at the 2015 Venice Film Festival and Toronto Film Festival to critical acclaim. It received a four star review in The Guardian which described it as “an astounding film”. Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the film, describing it as ''"a documentary not just for archivists but for those who see film as a vital part of local culture"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-flickering-truth-venice-review-825061|title='A Flickering Truth': Venice Review|last=Young|first=Deborah|accessdate=2015-09-22}}</ref> while ''Indiewire'' writer Eric Kohn called the movie an ''"eye-opening documentary ... a moving navigation of Afghanistan’s past and present."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/memo-to-distributors-buy-these-2015-toronto-international-film-festival-movies-20150921|title=Memo to Distributors: Buy These 2015 Toronto International Film Festival Movies|last=Kohn|first=Eric|accessdate=2015-09-24}}</ref>"

Peter Debruge of ''Variety'' wrote that ''“Pietra Brettkelly’s enigmatic rendering…is not a straightforward artist’s profile, political commentary or domestic drama, but a poetic fusion of the three."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/the-art-star-and-the-sudanese-twins-1200548880/|title=The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins|last=Debruge|first=Peter|accessdate=2015-09-24}}</ref> ''Still in Motion'' (magazine)'s editor posited ''“I felt I was in the hands of a master storyteller.”''
