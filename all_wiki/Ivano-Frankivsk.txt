Administratively, it is designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]] within the [[oblast]], and together with a number of rural localities, is incorporated as [[Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2020|237686}}.

Built in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish [[Potocki family]], Stanisławów was annexed to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, after which it became the property of the State within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The fortress was slowly transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. After [[World War I]], for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Following [[Peace of Riga]], Stanisławów became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] at the onset of [[World War II]], the city was [[Soviet annexation of the western Ukrainian territories|annexed]] by the Soviet Union, only to be occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] two years later. With the liberation of Soviet Ukraine in 1944 and the [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|shifting of borders]], the Communist regime ran the city for the next four-and-a-half decades. A few years before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the blue-yellow flag was raised in the city as the symbol of an independent Ukraine.

A city visitor may find elements of various cultures intertwined within Ivano-Frankivsk, the Polish [[Ratusha (Ivano-Frankivsk)|city hall]], the Austro-Hungarian city's business center, the Soviet [[Panelák|prefabricated apartment blocks]] at the city's [[rural–urban fringe]], and others. Ivano-Frankivsk is also one of the principal cities of the [[Carpathian Euroregion]].

In 1962, on the city's 300th anniversary, it was renamed to honor the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]]. Due to the city's wordy name, unofficially it is sometimes called simply''' Franyk''' ({{lang|uk|Франик}})<ref>[http://franuk.com/ Informational portal of the Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219211420/http://franuk.com/ |date=2010-12-19 }} {{in lang|uk}}</ref> by its residents. Even though Ivano-Frankivsk is the officially accepted name, the city's original name has never been fully abandoned and/or forgotten and can be found throughout the city in all kinds of variations.

[[File:IvanFranko1886.jpg|thumb|100px|Ivan Franko]]
The name of the city was altered several times through the centuries. It was founded as Stanisławów; but in 1772 transliteration changed to Stanislau, in 1919 to Stanislaviv and again to Stanisławów. In 1939 transliteration changed to Stanislav, in 1941 to Stanislau, in 1944 again to Stanislav. And finally, on November 9, 1962, the name was officially changed by the First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]], reportedly as an honour to poet [[Ivan Franko]].

[[File:Ivano-FRANKIVSK (32).jpg|100px|thumb|Memorial plaque at the Regional Art Museum about the death of Stanislaw Potocki, son of Andrzej.]]

The town of Stanisławów was founded as a fortress in order to protect the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from [[List of Mongol and Tatar attacks in Europe|Tatar invasions]] and to defend the multi-ethnic population of the region in case of armed conflicts such as the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] of 1648. The fort was originally built next to Zabolotiv village (known since 1435),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.com.ua/stanislawow.html |script-title=uk:Замки і храми України |publisher=Castles.com |language=uk}}</ref> and Knyahynyn (1449).<ref name="nazarpanchyshyn.wordpress.com"/> The village of Zabolotiv and the land around it were purchased by [[Andrzej Potocki]] from another [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], Rzeczkowski. Stanisławów was issued by Potocki and his declaration establishing the city with [[Magdeburg rights]] on May 7, 1662; but the city and its rights, however, were not recognized by the Polish Crown until August 14, 1663, when [[John II Casimir Vasa|John Casimir]] had finally approved it. By 1672, the fortress had been rebuilt from wood to stone, brick, and mortar. Also a new large fortified Potocki palace was erected in the place of an older wood structure. Today this building serves as the [[military hospital]]. In the same year Jews were granted the right to become permanent residents, who could work, conduct commerce and travel in and out of the city as they pleased.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol2_00360.html Jewish Genealogy] – The Jewish Settlement from its Inception until 1772.</ref>

Originally the city was divided into two districts: [[Tysmenytsia]] and Halych. Sometime in 1817–1819 the neighbouring village of Zabolottya, that had a special status, was incorporated into the city as a new district, while Tysmenytsia district was divided into Tysmenytsia and Lysets districts. Each district had its main street corresponded with its name: Halych Street (Halych district), Tysmenytsia Street which today is [[Independence Street (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Independence Street]] (Tysmenytsia district), Zabolotiv Street – Mykhailo [[Hrushevsky Street (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Hrushevsky Street]] and Street of Vasylyanok (Zabolottya district), and Lysets Street – Hetman Mazepa Street (Lysets district). Later the city was split into six small districts: midtown where the rich [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s lived, pidzamche (subcastle), and four suburbs – Zabolotiv, Tysmenytsia, Halych and Lysets where the [[Plebs|plebeian]]s lived.<ref name="brief">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.history.iv-fr.net/article.php?id=941 Brief History of Ivano-Frankivsk]</ref>

All state affairs took place in the building of ''Dnister Hotel'' where the [[Act Zluky]] (Unification Act) was composed and signed on January 22, 1919 by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].<ref name=Yanyspeech>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/95353/ Yanukovych condemns attempts to undermine unity], [[Kyiv Post]] (21 January 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124113911/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/95353/ |date=January 24, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinion-times.com/okran2.php |title=The Day of Unity |publisher=opinion-times.com }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The same year it was subjected to the Polish–Ukrainian and the Romanian-Ukrainian skirmishes eventually being annexed by Poland as part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] as the centre of the [[Stanisławów Voivodeship]]. It was occupied by the [[Romania]]n army for the summer months from May 25 through August 21, 1919. During the [[Polish–Soviet War]] in 1920, the [[Red Army]] took over the city for a brief period. After the Soviet retreat, Ukrainian troops loyal to [[Symon Petliura|Symon Petlura]] occupied the city for a few days. At this period of history the city was in complete disorder.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol2_00364.html#part3 Jewish Genealogy] – Between the Two World Wars</ref>

In the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Red Army|Soviet forces]], the territory was captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in September 1939 and included into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. Between September 1939 and June 1941, the Soviet regime ordered thousands of inhabitants of the city to leave their houses and move to [[Siberia]], where most of them perished. Numerous people were taken out of the city prison and simply shot outside of the city when Soviet forces were leaving it in 1941. Ivano-Frankivsk was occupied by German forces from July 2, 1941 to July 27, 1944. There were more than 40,000 Jews in Stanisławów when it was occupied by the Nazi Germany on July 26, 1941. During the occupation (1941–44), more than 600 educated Poles and most of the city's Jewish population were murdered.<ref name="yadvashem">[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%202292.pdf yadvashem.org]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carmi |first1=Krystyna |title=The strange ways of providence in my life |date=2015 |publisher=CreateSpace |location=North Charleston, SC, USA |isbn=1507811462 |page=105}}</ref>

In early 1944, the city became part of the Soviet Union and was renamed 'Stanislav'. The Soviets forced most of the Polish population to leave the city, most of them settled in the [[Recovered Territories]]. During the post-war period the city was part of the [[Carpathian Military District]] housing the [[38th Army (Soviet Union)|38th Army]] (70th Motor Rifle Division) that participated in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Operation Dunai]].

[[File:Franyk.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Ivano-Frankivsk]]
The city is situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region northeast of the mountain range, sitting approximately {{convert|120|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/ukraineg.htm |title=UKRAINE : general data |publisher=Populstat.info |access-date=May 5, 2009}}</ref> One of the several main geographical features is the Vovchynets Hill also known as the Vovchynets Mountains. The hill reaches 300-{{convert|350|m|ft}} above the sea level and is part of the Pokuttya Highland ([[Highland (geography)|Upland]]). Around the hill [[Bystrytsia River]] branches into Bystrytsia of Nadvirna, Bystrytsia of Solotvyn, and Vorona. The last two rivers serve as a natural border between the ''Pokuttya Highland'' and ''Stanislav Basin''. The Vovchynets Hill is located just outside and northeast of Ivano-Frankivsk. Located southeast from the Stanislav Basin in the direction of the [[Prut]] Valley is the Khorosnen (Prut-Bystrytsia) Highland. The highest point of that highland is Mount Hostra, {{convert|425|m|ft}}.

The closest neighboring city is [[Tysmenytsia]], less than {{convert|10|km|mi}} to the east. Other cities that lie in the radius of {{convert|25|to|30|km|0|abbr=on}} are [[Tlumach]] (east), [[Nadvirna]] (south), [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]] (west), and [[Halych]] (north). The city also administers five adjacent villages that surround it: Mykytyntsi, Krykhivtsi, Vovchynets, Uhornyky, and Khryplyn.

Ivano-Frankivsk is home to a number of sports teams. Most notably, it was home to the football club [[FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk]] (Prykarpattya) that participated on the national level since the 1950s. Since 2007, the club only fields its youth team Spartak-93 and competes in the Children-Youth Football League of Ukraine. The former president of Spartak Anatoliy Revutskiy reorganized the local university ([[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|University of Oil and Gas]]) team in 2007 into the new "[[FSC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk|FSK Prykarpattia]]" with support of the city mayor Anushkevychus making it the main football club in the region and replacing Spartak. Previously during the interbellum period, the city was home to another football club based on the local Polish garrison and called [[Rewera Stanisławów]] (1908). That club competed at a regional level that had evolved at that period. With the start of [[World War II]], that club was disbanded. During the Soviet period among several others there was another club "Elektron" that successfully participated at a regional level around the 1970s.

The city also is the home to a [[futsal]] team, [[Urahan Ivano-Frankivsk|PFC Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk]], that competes in the [[Ukrainian Futsal Championship]]. They were the Ukrainian champions having won the 2010/11 season playoffs and therefore took part in the [[2011–12 UEFA Futsal Cup]] for the first time.

The city had an ice hockey team, [[Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk|HC Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk]], which previously played in the [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship]].

Ivano-Frankivsk is also the hometown of Ukrainian gymnasts; one of them is Dariya Zgoba who won gold on the uneven bars in the 2007 European Championships and became a finalist on the Beijing Olympics; the other one is [[Yana Demyanchuk]], who won gold on the [[balance beam]] at the 2009 European Championships.

Other clubs include:
* [[BC Hoverla|Hoverla Ivano-Frankivsk]] (basketball)
* [[Roland Ivano-Frankivsk]] (rugby)
