The '''Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions''' is the principal public agency for conducting criminal prosecutions in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is led by the '''Director of Public Prosecutions'''.

The agency was founded in 1974, assuming prosecutorial functions previously held by the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]. It is responsible for conducting reviews of files prepared by law enforcement agencies including [[Garda Síochána|An Garda Síochána]] and deciding whether to prosecute. It conducts prosecutions in courts in [[Dublin]] and directs State Solicitors for cases outside Dublin. It instructs outside counsel to appear in court.

== History ==
The original powers of prosecution were vested with the [[Attorney General of Ireland]] under the [[Ministers and Secretaries Acts|Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924]].<ref name="AGHist">{{cite web |title=Brief History |url=http://www.attorneygeneral.ie/ag/aghistory.html |website=attorneygeneral.ie |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref> Article 30.3 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] provides that:

{{Quote|text=All crimes and offences prosecuted in any court constituted under Article 34 of this Constitution other than a court of summary jurisdiction shall be prosecuted in the name of the People and at the suit of the Attorney General or some other person authorised in accordance with law to act for that purpose.}}

The Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 delegated the functions of the Attorney General to the Office of the Director of Prosecutions.<ref name="1974 Act">{{cite web |title=Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1974/act/22/enacted/en/print.html |website=Irish Statute Book |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref> The Act was introduced to [[Dáil Éireann]] by the [[Government of the 20th Dáil]]. It was introduced by [[John M. Kelly (politician)|John M. Kelly]], the [[Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach|Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach]] [[Liam Cosgrave]], with the stated dual aim of creating an impartial agency and to refocus the Office of the Attorney General to the provision of legal advice to the government. At the time, some politicians and members of the media suggested that there was "political patronage" given to barristers who were acting a prosecutors in trials. The new agency sought to address that.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dáil Éireann debate - Tuesday, 11 Jun 1974 |url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1974-06-11/43/ |website=Oireachtas.ie |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref> Most of the Act came into force on 18 September 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=S.I.

Eamonn Barnes was the first DPP, appointed in January 1975 and holding the role until September 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Release from Claire Loftus, Director of Public Prosecutions, on the death today of Eamonn M.

The impartiality and discretion of the role of the DPP is intended to be protected through [[security of tenure]]. Barnes said that maintaining independence during his term was the largest struggle.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Coulter |first1=Carol |title=New DPP is seen as astute lawyer with keen sense of public service |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-dpp-is-seen-as-astute-lawyer-with-keen-sense-of-public-service-1.226158 |accessdate=26 June 2020 |work=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref> During the process to appoint the successor to Barnes the government originally specified that the Director hold a seven-year term, which was later amended to original conditions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Impartial Prosecution |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/impartial-prosecution-1.226312 |accessdate=26 June 2020 |work=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref> The term was changed to ten years for the appointment of the third director.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gazette June 2012 |url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/globalassets/documents/gazette/gazette-pdfs/gazette-2012/june-lo-res-for-web.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2020 |work=Law Society Gazette}}</ref>

A unit devoted to tax offences was established in 2000 and a Special Financial Unit was established by the office in 2011 in response to the [[post-2008 Irish banking crisis]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Donohoe |first1=Miriam |title=DPP sets up new unit to tackle tax evasion |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/dpp-sets-up-new-unit-to-tackle-tax-evasion-1.1115552 |accessdate=26 June 2020 |work=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Annual Report 2016 |url=https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/28812/1/Office%20of%20the%20director%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions%20annual%20report.pdf |website=DPP |accessdate=26 June 2020 |page=4}}</ref>

The DPP published a report in 2019 which included responses to a report from the commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. There may need to be "significant reorganisation of the prosecution service" due to recommendations to remove prosecution decisions from the Gardaí.<ref>{{cite news |title=DPP’s office could face ‘significant reorganisation’ |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/dpps-office-could-face-significant-reorganisation-948146.html |accessdate=26 June 2020 |work=www.irishexaminer.com |date=4 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>
