'''Kenneth Harry Clarke, Baron Clarke of Nottingham''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|QC|PC}} (born 2 July 1940), often known as '''Ken Clarke''', is a British politician who served as [[Home Secretary]] from 1992 to 1993 and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1993 to 1997. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he was [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Rushcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Rushcliffe]] from [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] to [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] and was [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House of Commons]] between 2017 and 2019. The President of the [[Tory Reform Group]] since 1997, he identifies with [[economic liberalism|economically]] and [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] views.

Clarke served in the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinets]] of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] as [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]], [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]], [[Home Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He contested the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party leadership]] three times—in [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|1997]], [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|2001]] and [[2005 Conservative Party leadership election|2005]]—being defeated each time. [[Opinion poll]]s indicated he was more popular with the general public than with his party, whose generally [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] stance did not chime with his pro-European views. He returned to Cabinet in 2010 as [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] and [[minister without portfolio|Minister without Portfolio]].

[[September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs|The Conservative whip was withdrawn]] from him in September 2019 because he and 20 other MPs voted with the Opposition on a motion; for the remainder of his time in Parliament he sat as an [[independent politician|independent]], though still on the government benches. He stood down as an MP at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] and was thereafter appointed by [[Boris Johnson]] as a Conservative Member of the [[House of Lords]] in September 2020.

Clarke is President of the [[Conservative Group for Europe|Conservative Europe Group]], Co-President of the pro-[[EU]] body [[British Influence]] and Vice-President of the [[European Movement UK]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Structure of the European Movement UK | url = http://www.euromove.org.uk/index.php?id=6329 | access-date = 22 October 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090614082047/http://www.euromove.org.uk/index.php?id=6329 | archive-date = 14 June 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> Described by the press as a 'Big Beast' of British politics, his total time as a [[Minister (government)|minister]] is the fifth-longest in the modern era. He has spent over 20 years serving under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher, John Major and [[David Cameron]]. He was one of only five ministers ([[Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree|Tony Newton]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]], [[Patrick Mayhew]] and [[Lynda Chalker]] are the others) to serve throughout the whole 18 years of the Thatcher—Major Governments, which represents the longest uninterrupted ministerial service in Britain since [[Lord Palmerston]] in the early 19th century.

==Early life and education==
Clarke was born in [[West Bridgford]], [[Nottinghamshire]], and was christened with the same name as his father, Kenneth Clarke, a Nottinghamshire mining electrician and later a watchmaker and jeweller.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kenneth-clarke|title=The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP – GOV.UK|work=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|access-date=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718112912/https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kenneth-clarke|archive-date=18 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He won a scholarship to attend the independent [[Nottingham High School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/School-Days-Ken-Clarke/story-21206932-detail/story.html|title=My School Days: Ken Clarke|date=9 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811102726/http://www.nottinghampost.com/School-Days-Ken-Clarke/story-21206932-detail/story.html|archive-date=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> before going to read for a [[law degree]] at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with an [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|upper second honours degree]]. Clarke initially held [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] sympathies, and his grandfather was a [[Communism|Communist]], but while at Cambridge he joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

As Chairman of the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]] (CUCA), Clarke invited former British Fascist leader [[Sir Oswald Mosley]] to speak for two years in succession, prompting some [[Jewish]] students (including his future successor at the Home Office, [[Michael Howard]]) to resign from CUCA in protest.<ref>{{cite news | title = Howard's way | work = The Guardian | date = 27 March 2005 | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,9061,1446073,00.html | access-date = 24 September 2008 | location = London | first = Andrew | last = Anthony | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060112085706/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,9061,1446073,00.html | archive-date = 12 January 2006 | url-status = live }}</ref> Howard then defeated Clarke in one election for the presidency of the [[The Cambridge Union|Cambridge Union Society]], but Clarke subsequently became [[List of Presidents of The Cambridge Union|President of the Cambridge Union]] a year later, being elected on 6 March 1963 by a majority of 56 votes. Clarke opposed the admission of women to the Union, and is quoted as saying upon his election, "The fact that Oxford has admitted them does not impress me at all. Cambridge should wait a year to see what happens before any decision is taken on admitting them."<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=News in Brief |day_of_week=Thursday |date=7 March 1963 |page_number=5 |issue=55643 |column=B }}</ref>

In an early-1990s documentary, journalist [[Michael Cockerell]] played to Clarke some tape recordings of Clarke speaking at the Cambridge Union as a young man, and he displayed amusement at hearing his then-stereotypical [[upper class]] accent. Clarke is deemed one of the [[Cambridge Mafia]], a group of prominent Conservative politicians who were educated at Cambridge in the 1960s. After leaving Cambridge, Clarke was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1963 at [[Gray's Inn]], and "took silk" (was promoted to [[Queen's Counsel]]) in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Clarke_Kenneth.aspx |title= Kenneth Clarke |publisher= Conservative Party |access-date= 19 January 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130212055656/http://www.conservatives.com/People/Members_of_Parliament/Clarke_Kenneth.aspx |archive-date= 12 February 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==
Clarke sought election to the House of Commons almost immediately after leaving university. His political career began by contesting the Labour stronghold of [[Mansfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Mansfield]] at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] and [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] elections. In [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970]], just before his 30th birthday, he won the [[East Midlands]] constituency of [[Rushcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Rushcliffe]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], south of [[Nottingham]], from Labour MP [[Antony Gardner|Tony Gardner]]. From 2017 to 2019 he was [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]]. Following his expulsion from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in September 2019, he became the first Independent MP to hold the position of Father of the House since [[Clement Tudway]], who died in office as MP For [[Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Wells]] in 1815.

Clarke was soon appointed a Government [[whip (politics)|whip]], and served as such from 1972 to 1974; he, with the assistance of Labour rebels, helped ensure [[Edward Heath]]'s government won key votes on British entry into the [[European Communities]] (which later evolved into the [[European Union]]). Even though Clarke opposed the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as Conservative Party Leader in 1975, he was appointed as her Industry Spokesman from 1976 to 1979, and then occupied a range of ministerial positions during her premiership.

He is the subject of a [[portrait]] [[oil painting|in oil]] commissioned by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/james-lloyd/portrait-of-kenneth-clarke-mp/6558|title=Artwork – Portrait of Kenneth Clarke MP|access-date=28 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728080013/http://www.parliament.uk/worksofart/artwork/james-lloyd/portrait-of-kenneth-clarke-mp/6558|archive-date=28 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Murphy">{{cite news |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/exclusive-mps-splash-out-250000-of-public-money-on-vanity-portraits-9056130.html |title=MPs splash out £250,000 of public money on vanity portraits |last=Murphy |first=Joe |date=13 January 2014 |work= London Evening Standard |access-date=13 January 2014}}</ref>

=== Early ministerial positions ===
Clarke first served in the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] for [[Department for Transport|Transport]] (1979–81) and [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for [[Department for Transport|Transport]] (1981–82), and then [[Minister of State]] for [[Department of Health|Health]] (1982–85).

He joined the Cabinet as [[Paymaster-General]] and Employment Minister (1985–87) (his Secretary of State, [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young of Graffham]], sat in the Lords), and served as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and Minister of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] (1987–88) with responsibility for Inner Cities.  While in that position, Clarke announced the sale to [[British Aerospace]] of the [[Rover Group]], a new name for [[British Leyland]], which had been nationalised in 1975 by the Government of [[Harold Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/mar/29/rover-group-privatisation|title=Rover Group (Privatisation) (Hansard, 29 March 1988)|access-date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322182338/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/mar/29/rover-group-privatisation|archive-date=22 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Health Secretary ===
Clarke was appointed the first Secretary of State for [[Department of Health|Health]] when the department was created out of the former [[Department of Health and Social Security]] in July 1988.<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 552.</ref> Clarke, with backing from [[John Major]], persuaded Thatcher to accept the controversial "[[History of the National Health Service (England)#Thatcher government reforms|internal market]]" concept to the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]].<ref>Campbell, p. 552.</ref><ref name="profile">{{cite news | title = Contender: Kenneth Clarke | work = BBC News | date = 2 August 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4652729.stm | access-date = 24 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070923053943/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4652729.stm | archive-date = 23 September 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> Clarke claimed that he had persuaded Thatcher to introduce internal competition in the NHS as an alternative to her preference for introducing a system of compulsory health insurance, which he opposed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/19/kenneth-clarke-views-no-10 |title=Kenneth Clarke: I had a lot of views, but they didn't coincide with No 10's |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Rawnsley |date=19 July 2014 |work=The Observer |location=London |access-date=20 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720130636/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/19/kenneth-clarke-views-no-10 |archive-date=20 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

He told his biographer Malcolm Balen: "[[John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh|John Moore]] was pursuing a line which Margaret [Thatcher] was very keen on, which made everything compulsory medical insurance. I was bitterly opposed to that...The [[Health care in the United States|American system]] is...the world's worst health service – expensive, inadequate and with a lot of rich doctors".<ref>Malcolm Balen, ''Kenneth Clarke'' (London: Fourth Estate, 1994), p. 166.</ref> In her memoirs Thatcher claimed that Clarke, although "a firm believer in state provision", was "an extremely effective Health minister – tough in dealing with vested interests and trade unions, direct and persuasive in his exposition of government policy".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 614.</ref>

In January 1989, Clarke's White Paper ''Working for Patients'' appeared; this advocated giving hospitals the right to become self-governing [[NHS trust|NHS Trusts]], taxpayer-funded but with control over their budgets and independent of the [[Regional health authority (UK)|regional health authorities]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 552–553.</ref> It also proposed that doctors be given the option to become "[[GP Fundholding|GP fundholders]]". This would grant doctors control of their own budgets in the belief that they would purchase the most effective services for their patients. Instead of doctors automatically sending patients to the nearest hospital, they would be able to choose where they were treated. In this way, money would follow the patient and the most efficient hospitals would receive the greatest funding.<ref name="Campbell">Campbell, p. 553.</ref>

This was not well received by doctors and their trade union, the [[British Medical Association]], launched a poster campaign against Clarke's reforms, claiming that the NHS was "underfunded, undermined and under threat". They also called the new GP contracts "Stalinist". A March 1990 opinion poll commissioned by the BMA showed that 73% believed that the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands.<ref name="Campbell"/> Clarke later claimed that the BMA was "the most unscrupulous trade union I have ever dealt with and I've dealt with every trade union across the board".<ref name="Campbell"/> Although Thatcher tried to halt the reforms just before they were introduced, Clarke successfully argued that they were necessary to demonstrate the government's commitment to the NHS. Thatcher told Clarke: "It is ''you'' I'm holding responsible if ''my'' NHS reforms don't work".<ref name="Campbell"/>

=== Later ministerial positions ===
Just over two years later he was appointed Secretary of State for [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|Education and Science]] in the final weeks of Thatcher's Government, following [[Norman Tebbit]]'s unwillingness to return to Cabinet after the resignation of Sir [[Geoffrey Howe]]. Clarke was the first Cabinet Minister to advise Thatcher to resign after her victory in the first round of the November 1990 [[1990 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|leadership contest]] was less than the 15% winning margin required to prevent a second ballot; she referred to him in her memoirs as a ''candid friend'': "his manner was robust in the brutalist style he has cultivated: the candid friend".<ref>{{cite book|last=Thatcher|first=Margaret|title=The Downing Street Years|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-017056-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/914 914]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/914}}</ref>

Clarke came to work with [[John Major]] very closely, and quickly emerged as a central figure in his government. After continuing as Education Secretary (1990–92), where he introduced a number of reforms, he was appointed as [[Home Secretary]] in the wake of the Conservatives' victory at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]]. In May 1993, seven months after the impact of "[[Black Wednesday]]" had damaged [[Norman Lamont]]'s credibility as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], Major sacked Lamont and appointed Clarke in his place.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
At first, Clarke was seen as the dominant figure in Cabinet, and at the October 1993 Conservative Party Conference he defended Major from his critics by pronouncing "any enemy of [[John Major]] is an enemy of mine."

In the party leadership contest of 1995, when [[John Major]] beat [[John Redwood]], Clarke kept faith in Major and commented: "I don't think the Conservative Party could win an election in 1,000 years on this ultra right-wing programme".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995 | title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood | access-date=2 September 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913044302/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | archive-date=13 September 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Clarke enjoyed an increasingly successful record as Chancellor, as the economy recovered from the recession of the early 1990s and a new monetary policy was put into effect after Black Wednesday. He reduced the basic rate of income tax from 25% to 23%, reduced UK Government spending as a percentage of GDP, and reduced the budget deficit from £50.8 billion in 1993 to £15.5 billion in 1997. Clarke's successor, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]], continued these policies, which eliminated the deficit by 1998 and allowed Brown to record a budget surplus for the following four years. Interest rates, inflation and unemployment all fell during Clarke's tenure at [[HM Treasury]]. Clarke's success was such that Brown felt he had to pledge to keep to Clarke's spending plans and these limits remained in place for the first two years of the Labour Government that was elected in 1997.<ref name="profile"/>

===Single Currency: free hand and referendum pledge===
The matter of a [[referendum]] on Britain joining the planned [[Eurozone|euro]] - first raised by Margaret Thatcher in 1990 - was, after much press speculation, raised again at Cabinet by [[Douglas Hogg]] in the spring of 1996, very likely (in Clarke's view) with Major's approval; Clarke records that Heseltine spoke "with passionate intensity" at Cabinet against a referendum, believing both that referendums were pernicious and that no concession would be enough to please the Eurosceptics. Clarke, who had already threatened resignation over the issue, also opposed the measure and, although Clarke and Heseltine were in a small minority in Cabinet, Major once again deferred a decision. Major, Heseltine and Clarke eventually reached agreement in April 1996, in what Clarke describes as "a tense meeting … rather like a treaty session", that there would be a commitment to a referendum before joining the euro, but that the pledge would be valid for one Parliament only (i.e. until the general election after next), with the Government's long-term options remaining completely open; Clarke threatened to resign if this formula were departed from.<ref>Clarke 2016, pp.369-372</ref>

Clarke, writing in 2016 after the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit Referendum]], comments that he and Heseltine later agreed that they had separately decided to give way because of the pressure Major was under, and that the referendum pledge "was the biggest single mistake" of their careers, giving "legitimacy" to such a device.<ref>Clarke 2016, pp.369-372</ref>

In December 1996, after Foreign Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] had commented that it was unlikely that the government would join the euro, Clarke and Heseltine took to the airwaves – in apparent unison – to insist that the government retained a free choice as to whether or not to join, angering Eurosceptics.<ref>Crick 1997, pp.431-433</ref> When Tory Party Chairman, [[Brian Mawhinney, Baron Mawhinney|Brian Mawhinney]], was understood to have briefed against him, Clarke declared: "tell your kids to get their scooters off my lawn" – an allusion to [[Harold Wilson]]'s rebuke of Trades Union leader [[Hugh Scanlon]] in the late 1960s.

===Role as a backbencher===
After the Conservatives entered opposition in 1997, Clarke contested the leadership of the Party for the first time. In [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|1997]], the electorate being solely Tory Members of Parliament, he topped the poll in the first and second rounds. In the third and final round he formed an alliance with Eurosceptic [[John Redwood]], who would have become [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor]] and Clarke's deputy, were he to have won the contest. However, Thatcher endorsed Clarke's rival [[William Hague]], who proceeded to win the election comfortably. The contest was criticised for not involving the rank-and-file members of the Party, where surveys showed Clarke to be more popular. Clarke rejected the offer from Hague of a Shadow Cabinet role, opting instead to return to the [[backbenches]].

Clarke contested the party leadership for a second time in [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|2001]]. Despite opinion polls again showing he was the most popular Conservative politician with the British public,<ref name="profile"/> he lost in a final round among the rank-and-file membership, a new procedure introduced by Hague, to a much less experienced, but strongly Eurosceptic rival, [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. This loss, by a margin of 62% to 38%, was attributed to the former Chancellor's strong pro-European views being increasingly out-of-step with the party members' [[Euroscepticism]].<ref name="profile"/> His campaign was managed by [[Andrew Tyrie]].

Clarke opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. After choosing not to stand for the leadership after Duncan Smith departed in [[2003 Conservative Party leadership election|2003]] in the interests of party unity, he returned to fight the 2005 leadership election. He still retained huge popularity among voters, with 40% of the public believing he would be the best leader.<ref>{{cite news | title = Clarke is voter favourite&nbsp;— poll | work = BBC News | date = 5 September 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4216670.stm | access-date = 24 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213233527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4216670.stm | archive-date = 13 December 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref> He was accused by [[Norman Tebbit]] of being "lazy" whilst leadership rival [[Malcolm Rifkind|Sir Malcolm Rifkind]] suggested that Clarke's pro-European views could have divided the Conservative Party had Clarke won.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tories round on candidate Clarke | work = BBC News | date = 4 September 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4213544.stm | access-date = 24 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050911122220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4213544.stm | archive-date = 11 September 2005 | url-status = live }}</ref> In the event, Clarke was eliminated in the first round of voting by Conservative MPs. Eventual winner [[David Cameron]] appointed Clarke to head a Democracy Task Force as part of his extensive 18-month policy review in December 2005, exploring issues such as the reform of the [[House of Lords]] and party funding. Clarke is President of the [[Tory Reform Group]], a liberal, pro-European [[ginger group]] within the Conservative Party.

Clarke became known as "an [[Economic liberalism|economic]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberal]], an internationalist and a strong supporter of the European idea".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stadler|first=Liliane|date=6 December 2016|title=Ken Clarke's Kind of Blue|url=https://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/ken-clarkes-kind-blue/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723122946/https://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/ken-clarkes-kind-blue/|archive-date=23 July 2018|access-date=23 July 2018|website=OxPol}}</ref>

In 2006, he described Cameron's plans for a British Bill of Rights as "[[xenophobic]] and legal nonsense".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5120894.stm |title=Clarke slams Cameron rights plan |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2006 |access-date=19 October 2009}}</ref>

===Expenses scandal===
{{Main|United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal}}
On 12 May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Clarke had "flipped" his [[Council Tax]].  He had told the Parliamentary authorities that his main home was in the Rushcliffe constituency, enabling him to claim a second-home allowance on his London residence, leaving the taxpayer to foot the bill for Council Tax due on that property. However, he told [[Rushcliffe|Rushcliffe Borough Council]] in Nottinghamshire that he spent so little time at his constituency address that his wife Gillian should qualify for a 25% Council Tax (single person's) discount, saving the former Chancellor around £650 per year. Land Registry records showed that Clarke no longer had a mortgage on his Nottinghamshire home where he has lived since 1987. Instead he held a mortgage on his London property, which was being charged to the taxpayer at £480 per month.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5310015/MPs-expenses-Ken-Clarkes-council-tax-flip.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=MPs expenses: Ken Clarke's council tax 'flip' |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |date=12 May 2009 |access-date=9 April 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522212823/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5310015/MPs-expenses-Ken-Clarkes-council-tax-flip.html |archive-date=22 May 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Return to the frontbench===
In 2009, Clarke became Shadow Business Secretary in opposition to then-[[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Business Secretary]], [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]]. [[David Cameron]] described Clarke as about the only one able to challenge Mandelson and Brown's economic credibility. Two days later it was revealed that Clarke had warned in a speech a month earlier that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] could see David Cameron as a "[[right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist" if the Conservatives maintained Eurosceptic policies and that Obama would "start looking at whoever is in Germany or France if we start being [[isolationism|isolationist]]".<ref>{{cite news | title = Ken Clarke warns Barack Obama could see David Cameron as right wing nationalist | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 21 January 2009 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4309112/Ken-Clarke-warns-Barack-Obama-could-see-David-Cameron-as-right-wing-nationalist.html | access-date = 23 January 2009 | location = London | first1 = Robert | last1 = Winnett | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090124084224/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/4309112/Ken-Clarke-warns-Barack-Obama-could-see-David-Cameron-as-right-wing-nationalist.html | archive-date = 24 January 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' said "Clarke has in effect agreed to disagree with the Tories' official Eurosceptic line".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html |title=Interactive graphics – A Conservative Who's Who |work=Financial Times |location=London |access-date=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510014817/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19dff8ce-2089-11df-bf2d-00144feab49a.html |archive-date=10 May 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary===
[[File:Kenneth-clarke-hi-res.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Clark's portrait as Lord Chancellor, 2011]]
On 12 May 2010, Clarke's appointment as [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and [[Lord Chancellor]] was announced by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]] formed between the Conservative and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/liveevent/ |title=Election 2010 – Live coverage – General Election 2010 |work=BBC News |date=May 2010 |access-date=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313183641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/liveevent |archive-date=13 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> James Macintyre, political editor of ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'', argued that in this ministerial role he had instigated a process of radical reform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethosjournal.com/home/item/291-movers-and-shakers |title=Public service innovators |last=Macintyre |first=James |work=Ethos |publisher=Serco |location=Hook, Hants |year=2010 |access-date=17 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119213312/http://www.ethosjournal.com/home/item/291-movers-and-shakers |archive-date=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In June 2010, Clarke signalled an end to short prison sentences after warning it was "virtually impossible" to rehabilitate any inmate in less than 12 months. In his first major speech after taking office, Clarke indicated a major shift in penal policy by saying prison was not effective in many cases. This could result in more offenders being handed community sentences. Clarke, who described the current prison population of 85,000 as "astonishing", received immediate criticism from some colleagues in a Party renowned for its tough stance on law and order. He signalled that fathers who fail to pay child maintenance, disqualified drivers and criminals fighting asylum refusals could be among the first to benefit and should not be sent to prison.<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitehead |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7863613/David-Cameron-insists-short-prison-sentences-to-stay.html |title=David Cameron insists short prison sentences to stay |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 June 2010 |access-date=14 July 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703044919/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7863613/David-Cameron-insists-short-prison-sentences-to-stay.html |archive-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Clarke announced in February 2011 that the Government intended to scrutinise the relationship between the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and national parliaments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/20/kenneth-clarke-european-court-reform |title=Kenneth Clarke offers hope to Tory critics of human rights court |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |date=21 February 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London |page=8 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927191719/https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/20/kenneth-clarke-european-court-reform |archive-date=27 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2011, controversy related to Clarke's reported views on rape resurfaced after an interview on the radio station [[BBC 5 Live]], where he discussed a proposal to further reduce the sentences of criminals, including rapists, who pleaded guilty pre-trial.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13444770 |title= In full: Ken Clarke interview on rape sentencing |work= BBC News |date= 18 May 2011 |access-date= 20 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180717110248/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13444770 |archive-date= 17 July 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Minister without Portfolio===
[[File:Ken Clarke.jpg|thumb|Clarke in 2012]]
Following the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle, Clarke was moved from [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] to [[Minister without Portfolio]]. It was also announced that he would assume the role of roving [[Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy|Trade Envoy]] with responsibility for promoting British business and trade interests abroad, a position which he enjoyed.

In a widely circulated video clip, he referred to [[Theresa May]] as a "bloody difficult woman", joked that [[Michael Gove]], who was "wild", would "go to war with at least three countries at once" and characterised some of the utterances of [[Andrea Leadsom]] as "extremely stupid". Clarke added that Gove "did us all a favour by getting rid of Boris.

In February 2017, following the death of [[Gerald Kaufman|Sir Gerald Kaufman]], Clarke became [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]]. He was re-elected as an MP in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].

In December 2017, he voted along with fellow Conservative [[Dominic Grieve]] and nine other Conservative MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a "[[Meaningful vote#Alteration of Clause 9|meaningful vote]]" on any [[Brexit]] deal Britain agrees with the European Union.<ref name="Independent_Austin">{{cite news | last = Austin | first = Henry | title = Brexit vote: The 11 Tory rebel MPs who defeated the Government | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-tory-mps-rebel-theresa-may-government-defeat-who-were-they-list-a8108776.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 13 December 2017 | access-date = 19 June 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180619213817/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-tory-mps-rebel-theresa-may-government-defeat-who-were-they-list-a8108776.html | archive-date = 19 June 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

In September 2019, after Conservative Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] lost a number of key votes in the House of Commons, Clarke stated that it would be 'not inconceivable' for him to become Prime Minister leading a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|government of national unity]] in order to revoke Article 50 and prevent Brexit. Other politicians who were suggested for such a role at the time included [[Harriet Harman]], his female counterpart as Mother of the House of Commons. Lib Dem leader [[Jo Swinson]] supported the proposal, though Boris Johnson and [[Jeremy Corbyn]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], both dismissed the suggestion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49372525|title=Clarke: I wouldn't rule out becoming PM|date=16 August 2019|access-date=22 August 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821235649/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49372525|archive-date=21 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As it turned out, a vote of no-confidence was not in fact tabled against Boris Johnson's government and no such government of national unity was formed or took office.

Clarke is a sports enthusiast, being a supporter of both local clubs [[Notts County Football Club|Notts County]]<ref>The Notts County Miscellany by David Clayton, The History Press, 17 March 2017</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jun/04/sport.comment|title=Kenneth Clarke: I was there when . . .|first=Harcharan|last=Chandhoke|date=4 June 2001|access-date=17 June 2017|work=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202150817/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jun/04/sport.comment|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Nottingham Forest Football Club|Nottingham Forest]], who offered him a chair<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-forest-offer-chair-to-kenneth-clarke-1257471.html|title=Football: Forest offer chair to Kenneth Clarke|date=23 June 1997|access-date=17 June 2017}}</ref> and a former President of [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club]]. He is President of both [[Radcliffe Olympic F.C.|Radcliffe Olympic]] and the Radcliffe on Trent Male Voice Choir, and a keen follower of [[Formula One]] motorsport. He was involved with tobacco giant [[British American Tobacco]]'s Formula One team [[British American Racing]] (BAR) and has attended [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grands Prix]] in support of the BAR team. BAR was sold to [[Honda]] in 2005. He also appeared on the podium of the [[2012 British Grand Prix]] to present the first-place trophy to [[Mark Webber]].

He attended the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]] and jokingly claims to have been influential in persuading the linesman, [[Tofiq Bahramov]], to award a goal to [[Geoff Hurst]] when the [[England national football team|England]] striker had seen his shot hit the crossbar of opponents [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], leaving doubt as to whether the ball had crossed the line. Clarke's position in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] crowd was right behind the linesman at the time, and he shouted at the official to award a goal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chandhoke|first=Harcharan|title=I was there when...
