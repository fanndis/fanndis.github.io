==History==
Former [[NFL]] quarterback [[Rodney Peete]] and his wife actress [[Holly Robinson Peete]] established the HollyRod Foundation in 1997 in honor of Holly's father, late [[actor]] and television producer [[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]] who died of [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2002.<ref>"Matt Robinson." Daily Variety 2002. 14. Web. 11 Sep 2010. LexisNexis. Galileo. Retrieved at Georgia Southern University Henderson Library.</ref> He had been living with the disease since the age of 46. As it began to progress, the symptoms began to affect [[Matt Robinson (actor)|Robinson's]] ability to complete certain tasks in his daily life. Rodney, Holly, and the rest of their family stepped in to support him. During the time period of caring for her father Peete and her husband became inspired to help others suffering from the disease who lacked the financial means to pay for the associated costs. With this motive in mind, the HollyRod Foundation came into inception.

In 2000, after the Peetes' oldest son (3 years old at the time), Rodney 'RJ' Peete Jr., was diagnosed with autism, the HollyRod Foundation expanded its mission to bring awareness to this issue. [[Holly Robinson Peete]] has since become a recognizable international advocate for autism causes. She and her family have appeared on behalf of the HollyRod Foundation on various television shows, events, and print media including [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], [[World Autism Awareness Day]] events,<ref>[http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/holly_robinson_peete "Autism Speaks Names Actress and Advocate Holly Robinson Peete to Board of Directors"].
