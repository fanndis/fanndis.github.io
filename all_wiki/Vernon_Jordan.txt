'''Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr.''' (born August 15, 1935) is an American business executive and civil rights activist in the United States. After working for several [[Civil Rights Movement]] organizations, he was chosen by President [[Bill Clinton]] as a close adviser. Jordan has become known as an influential figure in American politics.

==Early life and education==
Vernon Jordan was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to Mary Jordan and Vernon E. Jordan Sr.; he has a brother, Windsor. He is the cousin of James Shaw, a musician who is professionally billed as [[The Mighty Hannibal]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p190055/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Mighty Hannibal |author=Duffy, John|publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>

Jordan grew up with his family in [[Atlanta]]'s [[Racial segregation in Atlanta|segregated]] society during the 1950s. He was an honor graduate of [[David Tobias Howard High School]]. Rejected for a summer intern's job with an insurance company after his sophomore year in college because of his race, he earned money for a few summers for college by working as a chauffeur to former city mayor [[Robert Maddox]], then a banker. Jordan graduated from [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], in 1957.<ref name="harbus online article">[http://www.harbus.org/2001/Vernon-Jordan-More-than-895/ Vernon Jordan: More than a "First Friend"], ''The Harbus Online,'' 12/03/2001</ref> In an interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', Jordan described his difficulties at DePauw as the only black student in a class of 400.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Vernon E.

Archive|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> He earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree at [[Howard University School of Law]] in 1960. He is a member of the [[Omega Psi Phi]] and [[Sigma Pi Phi]] fraternities.

==Legal career and activism==
Jordan returned to Atlanta to join the law office of [[Donald L. Hollowell]], a [[civil rights]] activist. The firm, including [[Constance Motley]], sued the [[University of Georgia]] for [[racism|racial discrimination]] in its admission policies. The suit ended in 1961 with a [[United States district court|Federal Court]] order demanding the admission of two African Americans, [[Charlayne Hunter]] and [[Hamilton E. Holmes]]. Jordan personally escorted Hunter past a group of angry white protesters to the university admissions office.

After leaving private law practice in the early 1960s, Jordan became directly involved in activism in the field, serving as the Georgia field director for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. From the NAACP, he moved to the [[Southern Regional Council]] and then to the [[Voter Education Project]].

In 1970, Jordan became executive director of the [[United Negro College Fund]].<ref name="UNCF History">[http://www.uncf.org/doc/UNCF_Impact_History.pdf An Historical Look At the Impact of the United Negro College Fund and its Member Institutions on American History], UNCF.</ref> He was president of the [[National Urban League]] from 1971 to 1981.

While still with the National Urban League, Jordan in 1981 said of the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration:

{{quote|I do not challenge the conservatism of this administration. I do challenge its failure to exhibit a compassionate conservatism that adapts itself to the realities of a society ridden by class and race distinction.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 July 1981, p. 17.</ref>}}

That year he resigned from the National Urban League to take a position as legal counsel with the Washington, D.C., office of the [[Dallas]] law firm of [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld]].

==Murder attempt==
On May 29, 1980, Jordan was shot and seriously wounded outside the Marriott Inn in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. He was accompanied by Martha Coleman at the time. Police thought initially that it might have been a domestic incident related to Coleman's life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore Hall|first=Sarah|title=Martha Coleman, the Shadowy Figure in the Vernon Jordan Case, Has Led a Troubled Life|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076730,00.html|work=People Magazine|date=June 16, 1980|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref> Then-president [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Jordan while he was recovering, an event that became the first story covered by the new network [[CNN]].<ref name="CNN broadcast">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWhgKuKvvPE&t=8m11s|title=CNN First Hour: June 1, 1980|date=June 11, 2012|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[Joseph Paul Franklin]] was acquitted in 1982 of charges of attempted murder.

==Clinton administration==

Jordan, a friend and political adviser to [[Bill Clinton]], served as part of Clinton's transition team in 1992–93, shortly after Clinton was elected [[President of the United States|president]]. In the words of ''The New York Times'':

{{quote|For Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jordan's roles have been manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled feathers (he put the president back in touch with [[Zoë Baird]] after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after Mr. Clinton was defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of [[Vincent W. Foster]] Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took Mr. Clinton in 1991 to the [[Bilderberg conference]] in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told [[Mike Espy]] he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win [[Warren Christopher]] a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. [[Colin L. Powell]] for a Cabinet job).<ref>R. W.

In 1998 Jordan helped [[Monica Lewinsky]], a former White House intern, after she left the White House.

Pbs.org.</ref> On October 1, 2003, a [[United States court of appeals]] rejected Jordan's claim for reimbursement for legal services related to assisting Clinton in scandals regarding Lewinsky and [[Paula Jones]]. Jordan asked the government to pay him $302,719, but he was paid only $1,215.<ref name="US Court of Appeals">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E2D81F3DF932A35753C1A9659C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJordan%2c%20Vernon%20E%2e%20Jr%2e "Washington: Request For Legal Fees Rejected"].
