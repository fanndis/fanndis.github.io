==Book contents==

She describes an idyllic life growing up in [[Midland, Texas]]. She calls the town "a place of ice cream sundaes…and Saturday morning pony rides." After relating the beginning of her relationship with George W. Bush, she recalls the jibe made by a neighbor that "Can you imagine? The most eligible bachelor in Midland marrying the old maid of Midland?"<ref name=ew/>

She expresses support for Bush administration decisions such as the [[Invasion of Iraq]]. She concludes, "I am proud that, as president, George acted on principle, that he put our country first and himself last."<ref name=tele/> She notes disagreements over some issues. She specifically recounts asking her husband "about not making gay marriage a significant issue" in the 2004 re-election campaign,<ref name=ew/> while '[[family values]]' in opposition to same-sex marriage was chosen as a defining Bush theme.

==Reviews==

[[Michiko Kakutani]] published a review in ''[[The New York Times]]''  in which she stated "For the most part, however, the White House portions of this book feel carefully prepared and vetted: Mrs. Bush lays out a predictable defense of her husband’s decision to invade Iraq and his decision not to visit New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Katrina, and she offers only the blandest portraits of administration figures like Dick Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and Karl Rove. In these chapters there is no daylight between Laura Bush and her highly groomed role as first lady.."<ref>[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/books/29book.html Laura Bush, a Lonely Texas Girl Far From Home] ''The New York Times'' 28 April 2010</ref>

[[Melissa Benn]] wrote a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and noted "''Spoken from the Heart'' perfectly fits the personal-is-political template. There is a lot of detail of designer dresses worn, official meals enjoyed, furniture and wallpaper restored, tours conducted and, of course, important political people encountered. Tony and Cherie are particular favourites, as is Nicolas Sarkozy, of all people. Vladimir Putin is given the occasional dressing down on the importance of democracy. Barack Obama is chided for his personal attacks on George during the 2008 campaign. Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and "Condi" Rice are all portrayed as utterly delightful."<ref>[https://amp.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/07/spoken-from-heart-laura-bush Spoken from the Heart by Laura Bush] ''The Guardian'' 7 August 2010</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' published a review by Tina Jordan. She wrote, "Anyone who wants to know what makes Laura Bush tick will come away disappointed." Jordan commented as well that Bush "seems almost a shadowy spectator in her own memoir", but Jordan praised the "sweetness and poignancy" of the first few sections of the book covering Bush's childhood and marriage.<ref name=ew>{{Cite news|title=Laura Bush's 'Spoken From the Heart': A Review|url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/05/04/laura-bushs-spoken-from-the-heart-a-review/|first=Tina|last=Jordan|date=May 4, 2010|accessdate=December 31, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

''[[Washington Post]]'' published a review by [[Ruth Marcus (journalist)|Ruth Marcus]] who wrote "Laura Bush's autobiography, "Spoken From the Heart," begins promisingly enough for anyone hoping to penetrate that [her] surface.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001834.html Ruth Marcus reviews Laura Bush's memoir, 'Spoken From the Heart'] ''Washington Post''.
