'''Simon Phillip Cowell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aʊ|əl}}; born 7 October 1959) is an English television personality, entrepreneur, entertainment manager, and record executive. He has judged on the British television talent competition series ''[[Pop Idol]]'' (2001–2003), ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor UK]]'' (2004–2010, 2014–2018) and ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' (2007–present), and the American television talent competition series ''[[American Idol]]'' (2002–2010), ''[[The X Factor (American TV series)|The X Factor US]]'' (2011–2013), and ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' (2016–present). Cowell is the principal, founder and chief executive of the British entertainment company [[Syco]].

After some success in the 1980s and 1990s as a record producer, talent scout and consultant in the UK music industry, Cowell came to public prominence in 2001 as a judge on ''Pop Idol'', a show which he and its creator [[Simon Fuller]] successfully pitched to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Controller of Entertainment [[Claudia Rosencrantz]]. Cowell subsequently created ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004) and ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), shows which have been sold around the world. In 2004 and 2010, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' named Cowell one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in the world.<ref name="Time100-2004">Poniewozik, James (26 April 2004).

In 2001, Cowell was given the role of judge on the [[Pop Idol (series 1)|first series]] of ''[[Pop Idol]]'', a show that he and the show creator [[Simon Fuller]] successfully pitched to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Controller of Entertainment [[Claudia Rosencrantz]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/spotlight/itv-simon-cowell-talks-strong-ties-with-brit-broadcaster-1201467913/|title=ITV: Simon Cowell Talks Strong Ties With Brit Broadcaster|publisher=Variety|date=7 April 2015}}</ref> Maggie Brown in ''The Guardian'' states, "the show became a seminal reality/entertainment format once on air that autumn".<ref name="Brown"/> Cowell's S Records signed the top two finishers of the first season of ''Pop Idol'', [[Will Young]] and [[Gareth Gates]], both of whom went on to have No 1 UK hits, and they were the top 2 best-selling singles of 2002 and the decade of 2000s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6917900/Will-Young-has-biggest-selling-single-of-the-decade.html |title=Will Young has biggest selling single of the decade |date=1 January 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref> He also became a judge on the first season of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002.

On 11 January 2010, Cowell's exit from ''American Idol'' was made official. By the time Cowell left ''American Idol'', the show was on its seventh consecutive season in its leadership among all primetime programmes in the United States, even lasting up to 2011 in the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|longest winning streak]] in the US overall viewership and demographics in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. The 2010 season was Cowell's last on the show, and he was replaced by [[Steven Tyler]].

Following the success of the ''Idol'' and ''X Factor'' franchises, Cowell, his company Syco, and its business partners developed a talent show format open to performers of any kind, not only singers, but also dancers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians, novelty acts, and so on. The origins of the ''[[Got Talent]]'' format can be traced to the British show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (British TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]''.

Cowell is the executive producer of ''America's Got Talent'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090707nbc03|title=Breaking News – Nbc'S Smash Hit Series 'America'S Got Talent' Heats Up The Summer!|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|date=7 July 2009|access-date=14 December 2009}}</ref> which debuted in June 2006, along with Fremantle producers of the [[Idols (franchise)|''Idol'' series]]. The show was a huge success for [[NBC]], drawing around 12&nbsp;million viewers a week and beating ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (American TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' on Fox (produced by rival and ''Idol'' creator [[Simon Fuller]]).

''Britain's Got Talent'' debuted on ITV in June 2007.<ref name="walesonline.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/2009/05/31/britian-s-got-talent-star-shaheen-destined-for-fame-91466-23752422/|title=Lifestyle – Britain's Got Talent star Shaheen Jafargholi 'destined for fame'|publisher=WalesOnline|access-date=14 December 2009|date=31 May 2009}}</ref> Cowell appeared as a judge alongside [[Amanda Holden]] and [[Piers Morgan]].

In 2014, ''Got Talent'' was named the world's most successful reality TV format by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', with spin-offs in over 68 countries. Cowell stated, “I am very proud that ''Got Talent'' is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen.

In 2015, Cowell launched ''[[La Banda (TV series)|La Banda]]'', his first US show since his stint with [[The X Factor (American TV series)|American ''The X Factor'']].

Cowell was also the executive producer of ''[[Grease Is the Word]]'' for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. This show set out to find performers to play Danny and Sandy in the 2007 West End revival of [[Grease (musical)|Grease]]. It was hosted by [[Zoë Ball]] and judged by Britons [[David Ian]] and [[Sinitta]] and Americans [[David Gest]] and [[Brian Friedman]]. The musical theatre casting concept had already been introduced by the BBC with the ratings hit ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?]]'', but Cowell's show was not the hoped-for success. He himself said, "It has been slaughtered by the critics – and rightly so. It is far too similar to our other formats."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23396758-i-slipped-up-on-grease-admits-cowell.do |title=I slipped up on Grease, admits Cowell |work=Evening Standard |location=UK |date=18 May 2007 |access-date=14 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530203640/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23396758-i-slipped-up-on-grease-admits-cowell.do |archive-date=30 May 2010 }}</ref>

Cowell collaborated with UK production company [[Shed Media]] to produce 2008 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] drama series ''[[Rock Rivals]]'', which is based on an ''X Factor'' type show. In 2011, Cowell also created his first game show, titled ''[[Red or Black?]]'' and hosted by [[Ant & Dec]], for ITV. Series 1 was broadcast from 3 to 10 September. The show was recommissioned by ITV for a second series in 2012, which aired weekly.

In 2013, Cowell, in partnership with [[YouTube]], launched a video-sharing competition called ''[[The You Generation]]''. In 2013, Simon was executive producer for ITV cookery series ''[[Food Glorious Food (TV series)|Food Glorious Food]]'', which was hosted by [[Carol Vorderman]].
