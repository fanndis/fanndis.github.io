The '''Order of Polonia Restituta''' ({{lang-pl|Order Odrodzenia Polski}}, {{lang-en|Order of the Rebirth of Poland}}) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[state decoration|state]] [[Order (decoration)|order]] established 4 February 1921. It is conferred on both [[military]] and [[civilian]]s as well as on [[alien (law)|foreigners]] for outstanding achievements in the fields of [[education]], [[science]], [[sport]], [[culture]], [[art]], [[economics]], [[national security|national defense]], [[social work]], [[civil service]], or for furthering good relations between countries.

The Order of Polonia Restituta is sometimes regarded as Poland's successor to the ''Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr'', known as the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]], established in 1765 by [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], the last King of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], to honor supporters of the Polish crown.

==History==
When Poland regained its independence from the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and [[Russian Empire]] in 1918, the new Polish government abolished the activities of the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov)]] in the country, due to the claimed abuses of its initial rules by the Russians, who often awarded their version to those who - according to the dominant view in newly independent [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] - had been responsible for the destruction of Poland and [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]].<ref name=Shackelford/>

Instead, the Order of Polonia Restituta was established on 4 February 1921 with [[Marshal]] [[Józef Piłsudski]] as first [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]], with the proclaimed aim of once again rewarding  the noble values that it originally stood for. The Marshal awarded the first recipients on 13 July 1921. The order became Poland's main honour bestowed on foreigners, awarded by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=Shackelford/>

After [[World War II]] both the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Communist [[People's Republic of Poland]], aligned with the [[Warsaw Pact]], awarded the order, though the versions differed slightly. Despite [[communist]] control, the order's prestige remained safe and it was even given to many people who were hardly model communists. The order was saved from abuse as it was simply passed over in favor of more traditional communist awards. During this time, the [[Order of Merit of Poland]] became the favored award for foreigners.<ref>{{citation |work=Polish Militaria. Scarcity Contributes to Value |author1=Prof. Dr. Zdzislaw P. Wesolowski |author2=Colonel, South Carolina State Guard Reserve |title=The History of Polish Decorations |url=http://www.virtuti.com/order/articles/virtuti.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001920/http://www.virtuti.com/order/articles/virtuti.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-22 |via=Internet Archive, 2011-07-11 |publisher=The Militaria Collector's Exchange |year=1997}}</ref>

On 22 December 1990 the Polish government-in-exile returned the rights to its version of the order to the new Polish state. Invalid awards have been revoked and today the remaining communist versions of the order hold the same status as any other issues.

Established on February 4th, 1923. Award for merit and acts of bravery. While technically outside the scope of this project. We include the Polonia Restitua as it was a newly created (1923) order to take the place of, and carry on the role of the Order of St. Stanislas (see above). The Order of St. Stanislas had been a native Polish Order, but had been so thoroughly associated with Russia -- the Russians awarded it generously -- that simply reviving it was unacceptable. Instead, the new Order Polonia Restitua was created, but using the same ribbon as the old St. Stanislas order (red with white side stripes) to carry on the tradition.}}</ref>  The goal was to preserve the tradition of the Order of Saint Stanislaus and its association with Polish history while changing the name which had become associated with Poland's oppression under the Russian Tsars.<ref name=Duren>{{cite book|last=Sabbat|first=Kazimierz, Mieczyslaw Sas-Skrowroński, Krzysztof Barbarski ; edited by Peter Bander van Duren|title=Polonia restituta|year=1989|publisher=Van Duren|location=Gerrouds Cross|isbn=9780905715346|pages=42–47}}</ref>

==Organisation==
Among Polish civilian awards, the Order is second only to the rarely awarded [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]]. Historically the order entitled its recipient to a state pension. As such, nominees for the award are evaluated by a special committee responsible for upholding the honour of the order.

The Chapter (''[[:pl:Kapituła Orderu Odrodzenia Polski|Kapituła]]'') of Polonia Restituta is composed of a [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] and eight members appointed by the Grand Master, who serve five year terms. Upon becoming elected the [[President of Poland]], the office-holder is automatically awarded the order and becomes the Grand Master of the Order Chapter. The names of new recipients are published in the ''[[Monitor Polski]]'', a publication required to provide announcements of legal decisions to the public. 

The Order of Polonia Restituta (''Polska Odrodzona'')  has five classes, categorized according to the [[Constitution of Poland]], [[:pl:Polski system orderowo-odznaczeniowy|Article 138]], as follows:
