A '''hung parliament''' is a term used in legislatures under the [[Westminster system]] to describe a situation in which no particular [[political party]] or pre-existing [[coalition]] (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an [[absolute majority]] of [[legislator]]s (commonly known as members or seats) in a [[parliament]] or other [[legislature]]. This situation is also known, albeit less commonly, as a '''balanced parliament''',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush|date=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm|work=BBC News|title=SNP puts case for hung parliament|date=2010-04-20}}</ref> or as a legislature under '''no overall control''',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507|work=Reuters|title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election?|date=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Hung up on 'no overall control'|first=Akash|last=Paun|date=2009-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron|title=Welcome to the era of no overall control|publisher=Newstatesman.com|accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref> and can result in a [[minority government]]. The term is not relevant in [[multi-party system]]s where it is rare for a single party to hold a majority.

In the Westminster system, in the circumstance of a hung parliament no party or coalition has an automatic [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to assume control of the [[executive branch|executive]] – a status usually known in parliamentary systems as "forming (a) government". It is possible that an absolute majority may still be gained through the formation of a new [[coalition government]], or the addition of previously unaffiliated members to a pre-existing coalition. However, a [[minority government]] may instead result: that is, the party that has the most members is allowed to form government without an absolute majority, provided that it has the express, ongoing support of unaffiliated members, such as [[minor parties]] and/or [[independent (politician)|independent]] legislators.

==Overview==
A normal objective of [[parliamentary system]]s – especially those requiring [[responsible government]], such as the [[Westminster system]] – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass  motions of [[confidence and supply]], especially [[Motion of no confidence|motions of no-confidence]] and [[budget bill]]s). If such motions fail, they normally result in the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]], it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term hung parliament is most often used of parliaments dominated by [[two-party system|two major parties or coalitions]]. [[General election]]s in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen by all parties and observers as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], the term "hung parliament" is usually used only with respect to the [[lower house]].

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislators elected by [[proportional representation]] or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the [[2005 German federal election|German federal election of 2005]] or the [[2018 Italian general election]]).

==History==
===Australia===
[[File:Australian House of Reps Sept 2010.svg|thumb|right|230px|The House of Representatives elected in 2010, with a 72-72 tie between the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition.]]
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the [[1940 Australian federal election|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections.<ref name="pgia">{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Government in Australia |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |year=2014 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=978-1783081219 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmvUAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>  At the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and the Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern.

In [[2016 Australian federal election|the 2016 federal election]] a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a [[2018 Wentworth by-election|by-election in 2018]].

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[1991 New South Wales state election|New South Wales in 1991]], Queensland in [[1998 Queensland state election|1998]] and [[2015 Queensland state election|2015]], [[1999 Victorian state election|Victoria in 1999]], [[1997 South Australian state election|South Australia in 1997]] and [[2002 South Australian state election|2002]], [[2008 Western Australian state election|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[2008 Australian Capital Territory general election|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[2010 Tasmanian state election|Tasmania in 2010]].

===Canada===
{{Further|Federal minority governments in Canada}}

Hung parliaments at either the federal and provincial level are an infrequent but not unusual occurrence in Canada. While most commonly referred to as minority governments, the term "hung parliament" has become increasingly common.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/10/18/minority-report-the-good-bad-and-ugly-of-canadas-hung-parliaments.html|title=Minority report: the good, bad and ugly of Canada's hung parliaments| publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2019-10-20|accessdate=2019-10-21| url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2020}} Four recent federal elections have resulted in hung parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]], and [[43rd Canadian Parliament|the 43rd]]).  Following all four elections the largest party ruled as a "[[minority government]]". Although Canadian minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 24-seat majority.

While most Canadian minority governments end in dissolution via non-confidence or a snap election call, there have been recent attempts to transition to a new government without returning to the ballot box. Most notably, the 40th Canadian government resulted in the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]]. While the Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], supported by The [[Bloc Québécois]], agreed to defeat the Conservatives in favour of a Liberal/NDP [[coalition government]]. On 4 December 2008, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] granted [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] a [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying and ultimately avoiding a vote of non-confidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html|title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper| publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205134535/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| archivedate=5 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref>

Hung assemblies within states and alliances between national and regional parties at sub-national level are common.

===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses [[Proportional representation#single transferable vote|PR-STV]], it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own.  
The last such occasion was 1977.  However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election.  Therefore, a "hung Dáil" (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament.  However he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power.  The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labour's collapse, to enter government again.  Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down.  Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style "Grand Coalition" similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there.  Many members of FF considered FG too [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass.  As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention.  The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD's abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority government could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government.  This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions.  
Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Electoral reform in New Zealand}}
Hung parliaments had a relatively uncommon place in New Zealand politics prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. Only on four occasions since the beginnings of party politics in [[1890 New Zealand general election|1890]] had a hung parliament occurred under the FPTP system: in [[1911 New Zealand general election|1911]], [[1922 New Zealand general election|1922]], [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928]] and [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] respectively. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two-party system, alternating between the long dominating [[New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand National Party]].<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bassett |first=Michael |title=Three Party Politics in New Zealand 1911–1931 |authorlink=Michael Bassett |year=1982 |publisher=Historical Publications |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-86870-006-1 |pages= 64–5}}</ref> From the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]] until the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 election]] no single party gained an outright majority in parliament.

===United Kingdom===
{{see|Parliament of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:UK House of Commons 2017-06-26.svg|thumb|right|230px|The House of Commons following the 2017 general election. No party had a majority.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[1886 United Kingdom general election|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|election of January 1910]], and that of [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[1929 United Kingdom general election|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been three general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]]. The second was the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57.<ref>[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament "General election 2010 results of a hung parliament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510024408/http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament/ |date=10 May 2010 }}, PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010</ref> The third one resulted from the [[snap election]] held in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017]] that had been called for by [[Theresa May]] in order to strengthen her majority heading into [[Brexit negotiations]] later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454|title=Election results 2017: UK wakes up to hung Parliament|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call [[snap election|early election]]s from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], then the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase "hung parliament" did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |author2=Stuart Wilks-Heeg |date=April 2010 |publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713091025/http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

==Consequences==
In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the [[2008 Western Australian state election|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support.  Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.<ref name="gpia">{{cite book |title=Government Politics in Australia |last=Fenna |first=Alan |author2=Jane Robbins |author3=John Summers |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU |isbn=978-1486001385 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>

===India===
In [[India]] if an election results in a 'hung assembly' in one of the state [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assemblies]] and no party is capable of gaining confidence then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs [[President's Rule]] is applied. In [[India]] there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures. However, invariably, the President of India in the case of Lok Sabha elections and the Governor of the state concerned, in the case of state elections, would attempt to give opportunities to the parties, starting with the one that got the maximum number of seats in the elections, to explore possibilities of forming a coalition government, before bringing in President's Rule.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in [[1911 New Zealand general election|1911]] when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] won fewer seats than the opposition [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] to resign, his replacement [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and [[William Massey]] formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in [[1922 New Zealand general election|1922]] the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928]], Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]] remain in office. In the next election in [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]], there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour's ever-increasing appeal as the [[Great Depression]] worsened.

[[1993 New Zealand general election|1993]] was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
<ref>{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}</ref> However National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third party candidates). Labour's Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] agreed to become [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]] remained in office, attempting to build a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over in a minority government.

In the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 UK general election]], another hung parliament occurred with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]], a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by [[Theresa May]] formed a minority government, supported by a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats per their policy of [[Abstentionism#In Northern Ireland|abstentionism]], so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[2003 National Assembly for Wales election|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat.

When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.<ref>[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.
