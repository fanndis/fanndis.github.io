'''Ukrainian''' ({{lang|uk|українська мова}} {{transl|uk|ukrayins'ka mova}} {{IPA-uk|ʊkrɐˈjinʲsʲkɐ ˈmɔwɐ|}}) is an [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]]. It is the [[official language|official state language]] of [[Ukraine]] and one of the three official languages in the [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized state]] of [[Transnistria]], the other two being [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the [[Cyrillic script]] (see [[Ukrainian alphabet]]).

Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the [[Old East Slavic]] of the early medieval state of [[Kyivan Rus']]. After the fall of the Kyivan Rus' as well as the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], the language developed into a form called the [[Ruthenian language]]. Along with Ruthenian, on the territory of modern Ukraine, the Kyiv version (izvod) of [[Church Slavonic]] was also used in liturgical services.<ref>Viktor Hrebeniuk.

From 1804 until the [[Russian Revolution]], the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the [[Russian Empire]], of which the [[Dnieper Ukraine|biggest part of Ukraine]] (Central, Eastern and Southern) was a part at the time.<ref name="schools">[https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee/page/216 Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (p. 217)</ref> It has always maintained a sufficient base in [[Western Ukraine]], where the language was never banned,<ref name="WUkraineL">[https://books.google.com/books?id=AP2Hh3LVGaUC&pg=PA309 Purism and Language: A Study in Modem Ukrainian and Belorussian Nationalism] by [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]], [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|087750-175-0}} (page 309)</ref> in its folk songs, [[kobzar|itinerant musicians]], and prominent authors.<ref name="WUkraineL"/><ref name="UkrGrammar30">[https://archive.org/details/contestedtongues00bila/page/76 Contested Tongues: Language Politics and Cultural Correction in Ukraine] by [[Laada Bilaniuk]], [[Cornell Univ.

The standard Ukrainian language is regulated by the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (''NANU''), particularly by its [[Institute for the Ukrainian Language]], Ukrainian language-information fund, and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies.

==Linguistic development of the Ukrainian language==

===Theories concerning the development of the Ukrainian language===
The first theory of the origin of Ukrainian language was suggested in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the middle of the 18th century by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. This theory posits the existence of a common language spoken by all [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic people]] in the time of the Rus'. According to Lomonosov, the differences that subsequently developed between [[Great Russian language|Great Russian]] and Ukrainian (which he referred to as [[Little Russia]]n) could be explained by the influence of the Polish and Slovak languages on Ukrainian and the influence of [[Uralic languages]] on Russian from the 13th to the 17th centuries.<ref>[http://feb-web.ru/feb/lomonos/texts/lo0/lo7/lo7-0812.htm Ломоносов М. В. Полное собрание сочинений. — Т. VII. Труды по филологии 1739-1758 гг. - М.; Л., 1952. — С. 83.]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another point of view developed during the 19th and 20th centuries by [[linguists]] of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Like Lomonosov, they assumed the existence of a common language spoken by East Slavs in the past. But unlike Lomonosov's hypothesis, this theory does not view "[[Polonization]]" or any other external influence as the main driving force that led to the formation of three different languages (Russian, Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) from the common [[Old East Slavic language]]. The supporters of this theory disagree, however, about the time when the different languages were formed.

Soviet scholars set the divergence between Ukrainian and Russian only at later time periods (14th through 16th centuries). According to this view, Old East Slavic diverged into Belarusian and Ukrainian to the west (collectively, the Ruthenian language of the 15th to 18th centuries), and [[Old Russian]] to the north-east, after the political boundaries of the [[Kyivan Rus']] were redrawn in the 14th century.

Some researchers, while admitting the differences between the dialects spoken by East Slavic tribes in the 10th and 11th centuries, still consider them as "regional manifestations of a common language" (see, for instance, the article by [[Vasyl Nimchuk]]).<ref>Nimchuk, Vasyl'. Періодизація як напрямок дослідження генези та історії української мови. Мовознавство. 1997.- Ч.6.-С.3–14; 1998.</ref>

In contrast, [[Ahatanhel Krymsky]] and [[Alexei Shakhmatov]] assumed the existence of the common spoken language of Eastern Slavs only in prehistoric times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/pivtorak/pivt.htm |title=Григорій Півторак. Походження українців, росіян, білорусів та їхніх мов |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref> According to their point of view, the diversification of the Old East Slavic language took place in the 8th or early 9th century.

Latest research suggests that Russian diverged from Ukrainian and Belorusian in the 6th century.<ref>Kassian, Alexei, Anna Dybo, «Supplementary Information 2: Linguistics: Datasets; Methods; Results» in: {{cite journal|last1=Kushniarevich|first1=A|last2=Utevska|first2=O|last3=Chuhryaeva|first3=M|last4=Agdzhoyan|first4=A|last5=Dibirova|first5=K|last6=Uktveryte|first6=I|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal Data|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|year=2015|pages=e0135820|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135820|pmid=26332464|pmc=4558026}}</ref>

However the above research did not take into account findings by Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak who stated that in the 11th century Novgorod language differed from Kyiv language (as well as other Slavic languages) much more than in later centuries, meaning that there was no common [[Old East Slavic]] language of Kyivan Rus' from which Ukrainian and Russian languages diverged, but that Russian language developed as convergence of Novgorod language and other Russian dialects, whereas Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belorusian]] were continuation of respective Kyiv and Polotsk dialects of Kyivan Rus'<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>.

Some Ukrainian features{{Which|date=September 2016}} were recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic as far back as the language can be documented.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shevelov, George Y.|date=1979|title=A historical phonology of the Ukrainian language|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/historical-phonology-of-the-ukrainian-language/oclc/5038718?page=citation|access-date=2020-08-02|website=www.worldcat.org|oclc=5038718}}</ref>

Ukrainian linguist [[Stepan Smal-Stotsky]] denies the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/istkult/ikult01.htm |title=Мова (В.В.Німчук). 1. Історія української культури |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref> Similar points of view were shared by [[Yevhen Tymchenko]], [[Vsevolod Hantsov]], [[Olena Kurylo]], [[Ivan Ohienko]] and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today's Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by [[George Shevelov]]'s phonological studies.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|date=1979|title=Юрій Шевельов.

===Origins and developments during medieval times===
As a result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] population north of the [[Black Sea]], lasting into the early [[Middle Ages]], the appearance of the voiced fricative γ(h) in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in [[Scythian language|Scythian]] and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*g'' and ''*gʰ''.<ref>Абаев В.

During the 13th century, when German settlers were invited to Ukraine by the princes of Galicia-Vollhynia, German words began to appear in the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under [[Poland]] not only through German colonists but also through the [[Yiddish|Yiddish-speaking]] Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include ''dakh'' (roof), ''rura'' (pipe), ''rynok'' (market), ''kushnir'' (furrier), and ''majster'' (master or craftsman).<ref name = "Concise Middle">History of the Ukrainian Language. R. Smal-Stocky. In ''Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia.''(1963). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 490–500</ref>

===Developments under Poland and Lithuania===
In the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus' (including Moscow) came under [[Tatar yoke]] until their unification under the Tsardom of [[Muscovy]], whereas the south-western areas (including [[Kyiv]]) were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. For the following four centuries, the language of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/zyzlex/zyz.htm |title=Лаврентій Зизаній. "Лексис". Синоніма славеноросская |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref> By the 16th century, a peculiar official language was formed: a mixture of  the liturgical standardised language of [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], with the influence of the last of these three gradually increasing, considering that the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the [[Szlachta|szlachta]], was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.<ref name=KostOstr>{{in lang|ru}} [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''Russian History in Biographies of its main figures'', Chapter ''[http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky]'' ([[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]])</ref> [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish rule and education]] also involved significant exposure to the [[Latin]] language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include ''zavzhdy'' (always; taken from old Polish word ''zawżdy'') and ''obitsiaty'' (to promise; taken from Polish ''obiecać'') and from Latin (via Polish) ''raptom'' (suddenly) and ''meta'' (aim or goal).<ref name="Concise Middle" />

Significant contact with [[Tatars]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] resulted in many [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language.  Examples include ''torba'' (bag) and ''tyutyun'' (tobacco).<ref name="Concise Middle" />

Due to heavy borrowings from Polish, German, Czech and Latin, early modern vernacular Ukrainian (''prosta mova'', "[[simple speech]]") had more lexical similarity with [[West Slavic languages]] than with Russian or Church Slavonic.<ref>Yaroslav Hrytsak.

[[File:Coins 1382.png|thumb|"Moneta Rvssiє" coined in 1382 based on [[groschen]]]]
===Rus' and Kingdom of Russia===
During the [[Khazar]] period, the territory of Ukraine was settled by Iranian (post-[[Scythian]]), Turkic (post-Hunnic, proto-Bulgarian), and Uralic (proto-Hungarian) tribes and Slavic tribes. Finally, the [[Varangian]] ruler of [[Novgorod]], called [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], seized Kyiv and established the political entity of [[Kyivan Rus']]. 

The era of Kyivan Rus' is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily [[Old Slavonic language|Old Slavonic]]. Literary records from Kyivan Rus' testify to substantial difference between [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (Rusyn) form of the Ukrainian language as early as Kyivan Rus' time.

Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (Rusyn); others term this era [[Old East Slavic]]. Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian. However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak, Novgorod people did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century, calling Rus' only [[Principality of Kiev|Kyiv]], [[Principality of Pereyaslavl|Pereiaslav]] and [[Principality of Chernigov|Chernihiv]] principalities<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref> (Kyivan Rus' state existed till 1240). At the same time as evidenced by the contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes of [[Kingdom of Russia]] and Kyiv called themselves "People of Rus'" - [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyny), and [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Galicia–Volhynia]] was called Kingdom of Rus.

Also according to Andrey Zaliznyak, in the 11th century Novgorod language differed from Kyivan language (as well as other Slavic languages) much more that later, meaning that there was no common [[Old East Slavic]] language of Kyivan Rus' from which Ukrainian and Russian languages diverged (as Soviet linguistics stated), but that Russian language developed as convergence of Novgorod language and South Russian dialects, whereas Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belorusian]] were continuation of respective Kyiv and Polotsk dialects of Kyivan Rus'<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>.

(Another reason for difference in Russian and Ukrainian languages is that after Kyivan Rus' period Russian language appropriated the Old Slavonic lexic on much larger scale while Ukrainian (and Belorusian) had more Polish and other Western languages influence)

After the fall of [[Galicia–Volhynia]], Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Poland]]. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language. Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy. By the 1569 [[Union of Lublin]] that formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural [[Polonization]] and visible attempts to [[colonization|colonize]] Ukraine by the Polish nobility. Many Ukrainian nobles learned the Polish language and adopted Catholicism during that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |title=The Polonization of the Ukrainian Nobility |publisher=Mywebpages.comcast.net |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602145938/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |archive-date=2002-06-02 }}</ref> Lower classes were less affected because literacy was common only in the upper class and clergy. The latter were also under significant Polish pressure after the [[Union of Brest|Union with the Catholic Church]]. Most of the educational system was gradually Polonized. In Ruthenia, the language of administrative documents gradually shifted towards Polish.

The [[Polish language]] has had heavy influences on Ukrainian (particularly in [[Western Ukraine]]). The southwestern Ukrainian dialects are [[Dialect continuum|transitional]] to Polish.<ref name="Hull">Geoffrey Hull, Halyna Koscharsky. "[http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/20:1-2/lexical-divide-ukrainian.pdf  Contours and Consequences of the Lexical Divide in Ukrainian]". ''Australian Slavonic and East European Studies''. Vol. 20, no. 1-2. 2006.  pp. 140–147.</ref> As the Ukrainian language developed further, some borrowings from [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] occurred. Ukrainian culture and language flourished in the sixteenth and first half of the 17th century, when Ukraine was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among many schools established in that time, the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium (the predecessor of the modern [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]), founded by the Ruthenian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Peter Mohyla]], was the most important. At that time languages were associated more with religions: Catholics spoke [[Polish language|Polish]], and members of the Orthodox church spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].

After the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], Ukrainian high culture went into a long period of steady decline. In the aftermath, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] and closed down later in the 19th century. Most of the remaining Ukrainian schools also switched to Polish or Russian in the territories controlled by these respective countries, which was followed by a new wave of [[Polonization]] and [[Russification]] of the native nobility. Gradually the official language of Ukrainian provinces under Poland was changed to Polish, while the upper classes in the Russian part of Ukraine used Russian.

During the 19th century, a revival of Ukrainian self-identification manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire [[Dnieper Ukraine]] and Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in Kiyv applied an old word for the Cossack motherland, ''Ukrajina'', as a self-appellation for the nation of Ukrainians, and ''Ukrajins'ka mova'' for the language. Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian was not merely a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.

However, in the Russian Empire expressions of Ukrainian culture and especially language were repeatedly persecuted for fear that a self-aware Ukrainian nation would threaten the unity of the empire. In 1804 Ukrainian as a subject and language of instruction was banned from schools.<ref name=schools/> In 1811 by the Order of the Russian government, the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] was closed. The Academy had been open since 1632 and was the first university in Eastern Europe. In 1847 the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] was terminated. The same year [[Taras Shevchenko]] was arrested, exiled for ten years, and banned for political reasons from writing and painting. In 1862 [[Pavlo Chubynsky]] was exiled for seven years to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The Ukrainian magazine ''[[Osnova]]'' was discontinued. In 1863, the tsarist interior minister [[Pyotr Valuyev]] proclaimed in [[Valuyevsky Ukaz|his decree]] that "there never has been, is not, and never can be a separate Little Russian language".<ref>[[s:ru:Валуевский циркуляр|Валуевский циркуляр]], full text of the Valuyev circular on [[Wikisource]] {{in lang|ru}}</ref> A following ban on Ukrainian books led to [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s secret [[Ems Ukaz]], which prohibited publication and importation of most Ukrainian-language books, public performances and lectures, and even banned the printing of Ukrainian texts accompanying musical scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/ohukr/ohu14.htm |title=XII.

For much of the 19th century the Austrian authorities demonstrated some preference for Polish culture, but the Ukrainians were relatively free to partake in their own cultural pursuits in [[Halychyna]] and [[Bukovyna]], where Ukrainian was widely used in education and official documents.<ref>[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/subtelny/istukr/17.htm#6 Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The suppression by Russia retarded the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, but there was a constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.

By the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Austro-Hungary#Dissolution of the Empire|collapse of Austro-Hungary]] in 1918, the former 'Ruthenians' or 'Little Russians' were ready to openly develop a body of national literature, institute a Ukrainian-language educational system, and form an independent state named Ukraine (the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], shortly joined by the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]). During this brief independent statehood the stature and use of Ukrainian greatly improved.<ref name=UkrGrammar30/>

====Speakers in the Russian Empire====
[[File:Ukrainian in Russian Empire 1897.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Ukrainian speakers in the Russian Empire (1897)]]
In the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language (''Русскій'') was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, '[[Little Russian]]'), what we known as Russian today (Великорусскій, '[[Great Russian]]'), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, 'White Russian').

The following table shows the distribution of settlement by native language (''"по родному языку"'') in 1897 in [[Russian Empire]] governorates (''[[guberniya]]s'') that had more than 100,000 Ukrainian speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php |title=Демоскоп Weekly – Приложение.

Although in the rural regions of the Ukrainian provinces, 80% of the inhabitants said that Ukrainian was their native language in the Census of 1897 (for which the results are given above), in the urban regions only 32.5% of the population claimed Ukrainian as their native language. For example, in [[Odessa]] (then part of the Russian Empire), at the time the largest city in the territory of current Ukraine, only 5.6% of the population said Ukrainian was their native language.<ref name=George>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2oqThmrFCfwC&pg=PA12&dq=Nikolayev+Ukrainian+language&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false Soviet Nationality Policy, Urban Growth, and Identity Change in the Ukrainian SSR 1923–1934] by George O. Liber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-521-41391-6}} (page 12/13)</ref> Until the 1920s the urban population in Ukraine grew faster than the number of Ukrainian speakers. This implies that there was a (relative) decline in the use of Ukrainian language. For example, in [[Kyiv]], the number of people stating that Ukrainian was their native language declined from 30.3% in 1874 to 16.6% in 1917.<ref name=George/>

===Soviet era===
[[File:Soviet UA class union.gif|upright=1.15|thumb|The Ukrainian text in this Soviet poster reads: "The Social base of the [[USSR]] is an unbreakable union of the workers, peasants and [[intelligentsia]]".]]

During the seven-decade-long [[Soviet era]], the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name=life>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false The Ukraine], [[Life (magazine)|Life]], 26 October 1946</ref> However, practice was often a different story:<ref name=life/> Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to discouragement.

Officially, there was no [[state language]] in the Soviet Union until the very end when it was proclaimed in 1990 that Russian language was the all-Union state language and that the constituent [[Soviet republics|republics]] had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |title=Law on Languages of Nations of USSR |publisher=Legal-ussr.narod.ru |date=1990-04-24 |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |archive-date=2016-05-08 }}</ref> Still it was implicitly understood in the hopes of minority nations that Ukrainian would be used in the Ukrainian SSR, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] would be used in the [[Uzbek SSR]], and so on. However, Russian was used in all parts of the Soviet Union and a special term, "a language of inter-ethnic communication", was coined to denote its status.

Soviet language policy in Ukraine may be divided into the following policy periods:

* [[Ukrainianization]] and tolerance (1921–1932)
* Persecution and Russification (1933–1957)
* [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] thaw (1958–1962)
* The [[Shelest]] period: limited progress (1963–1972)
* The [[Shcherbytsky]] period: gradual suppression (1973–1989)
* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[perestroika]] (1990–1991)

====Ukrainianization====
Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Russian Empire was broken up. In different parts of the former empire, several nations, including Ukrainians, developed a renewed sense of [[national identity]]. In the chaotic post-revolutionary years the Ukrainian language gained some usage in government affairs. Initially, this trend continued under the [[Bolshevik]] government of the Soviet Union, which in a political struggle to retain its grip over the territory had to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about many political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire, where it could always find allies.

[[File:Ukposter.jpg|left|thumb|The 1921 Soviet recruitment poster. It uses traditional Ukrainian imagery with Ukrainian-language text: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defense of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured."]]

The widening use of Ukrainian further developed in the first years of Bolshevik rule into a policy called [[korenizatsiya]]. The government pursued a policy of [[Ukrainianization]] by lifting a ban on the Ukrainian language{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}. That led to the introduction of an impressive education program which allowed Ukrainian-taught classes and raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone population. This policy was led by Education Commissar [[Mykola Skrypnyk]] and was directed to approximate the language to [[Russian language|Russian]]{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}. Newly generated academic efforts from the period of independence were co-opted by the Bolshevik government. The party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking but were encouraged to learn the Ukrainian language. Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized&nbsp;– in both population and in education.

The policy even reached those regions of southern [[Russian SFSR]] where the ethnic Ukrainian population was significant, particularly the areas by the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] and especially [[Kuban]] in the [[North Caucasus]]. Ukrainian language teachers, just graduated from expanded institutions of higher education in Soviet Ukraine, were dispatched to these regions to staff newly opened Ukrainian schools or to teach Ukrainian as a second language in Russian schools. A string of local Ukrainian-language publications were started and departments of Ukrainian studies were opened in colleges. Overall, these policies were implemented in thirty-five [[raions]] (administrative districts) in southern [[Russian SFSR|Russia]].

====Persecution and russification====
[[File:UkrSchool.jpeg|right|thumb|Anti-russification protest. The banner reads ''"Ukrainian School for Ukrainian kids!"''.]]

Soviet policy towards the Ukrainian language changed abruptly in late 1932 and early 1933, with the termination of the policy of Ukrainianization.  In December 1932, the regional party cells received a telegram signed by [[V. Molotov]] and Stalin with an order to immediately reverse the Ukrainianization policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The telegram condemned Ukrainianization as ill-considered and harmful and demanded to "immediately halt Ukrainianization in [[raion]]s (districts), switch all Ukrainianized newspapers, books and publications into Russian and prepare by autumn of 1933 for the switching of schools and instruction into Russian".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The following years were characterized by massive repression and discrimination for the Ukrainophones.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Western and most contemporary Ukrainian historians emphasize that the cultural repression was applied earlier and more fiercely in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} and were therefore anti-Ukrainian; others assert that Stalin's goal was the generic crushing of any dissent, rather than targeting the Ukrainians in particular.

Stalinist policies shifted to define Russian as the language of (inter-ethnic) communication. Although Ukrainian continued to be used (in print, education, radio and later television programs), it lost its primary place in advanced learning and republic-wide media. Ukrainian was demoted to a language of secondary importance, often associated with the rise in Ukrainian self-awareness and nationalism and often branded "politically incorrect".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The new Soviet Constitution adopted in 1936, however, stipulated that teaching in schools should be conducted in native languages.

Major repression started in 1929–30, when a large group of Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] was arrested and most were executed. In Ukrainian history, this group is often referred to as "[[Executed Renaissance]]" (Ukrainian: розстріляне відродження). "Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]" was declared  to be the primary problem in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ukrainian Nationalism in the Post-Stalin Era: Myth, Symbols and Ideology in Soviet Nationalities Policy |last=Farmer |first=K.C. |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |pages=241 }}</ref> The terror peaked in 1933, four to five years before the Soviet-wide "[[Great Purge]]", which, for Ukraine, was a second blow. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were liquidated, as were the "Ukrainianized" and "Ukrainianizing" portions of the Communist party. Soviet Ukraine's autonomy was completely destroyed by the late 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In its place, the glorification of Russia as the first nation to throw off the capitalist yoke had begun,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} accompanied by the migration of Russian workers into parts of Ukraine which were undergoing [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|industrialization]] and mandatory instruction of classic Russian language and literature. Ideologists warned of over-glorifying Ukraine's [[Cossack]] past,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} and supported the closing of Ukrainian cultural institutions and literary publications.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The systematic assault upon Ukrainian identity in culture and education, combined with effects of an artificial famine (''[[Holodomor]]'') upon the peasantry—the backbone of the nation—dealt Ukrainian language and identity a crippling blow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

This sequence of policy change was repeated in [[Western Ukraine]] when it was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In 1939, and again in the late 1940s, a policy of Ukrainianization was implemented. By the early 1950s, Ukrainian was persecuted and a campaign of Russification began.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

====Khrushchev thaw====
[[File:Rouble-1961-Paper-1-Reverse.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|While Russian was a de facto official language of the Soviet Union in all but formal name, all national languages were proclaimed equal. The name and denomination of [[Soviet ruble|Soviet banknotes]] were listed in the languages of all fifteen [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. On this 1961 one-ruble note, the Ukrainian for "one ruble", один карбованець (''odyn karbovanets`''), directly follows the Russian один рубль (''odin rubl`'').]]

After the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963). The [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s. Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as [[transfer of Crimea]] under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction.

Yet, the 1958 school reform that allowed parents to choose the language of primary instruction for their children, unpopular among the circles of the national intelligentsia in parts of the USSR, meant that non-Russian languages would slowly give way to Russian in light of the pressures of survival and advancement. The gains of the past, already largely reversed by the Stalin era, were offset by the liberal attitude towards the requirement to study the local languages (the requirement to study Russian remained). Parents were usually free to choose the language of study of their children (except in few areas where attending the Ukrainian school might have required a long daily commute) and they often chose Russian, which reinforced the resulting Russification. In this sense, some analysts argue that it was not the "oppression" or "persecution", but rather the ''lack of [[linguistic protectionism|protection]]'' against the expansion of Russian language that contributed to the relative decline of Ukrainian in the 1970s and 1980s. According to this view, it was inevitable that successful careers required a good command of Russian, while knowledge of Ukrainian was not vital, so it was common for Ukrainian parents to send their children to Russian-language schools, even though Ukrainian-language schools were usually available. While in the Russian-language schools within the republic, Ukrainian was supposed to be learned as a second language at comparable level, the instruction of other subjects was in Russian and, as a result, students had a greater command of Russian than Ukrainian on graduation. Additionally, in some areas of the republic, the attitude towards teaching and learning of Ukrainian in schools was relaxed and it was, sometimes, considered a subject of secondary importance and even a waiver from studying it was sometimes given under various, ever expanding, circumstances.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The complete suppression of all expressions of separatism or [[Ukrainian nationalism]] also contributed to lessening interest in Ukrainian. Some people who persistently used Ukrainian on a daily basis were often perceived as though they were expressing sympathy towards, or even being members of, the political opposition.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} This, combined with advantages given by Russian fluency and usage, made Russian the primary language of choice for many Ukrainians, while Ukrainian was more of a [[hobby]]. In any event, the mild liberalization in Ukraine and elsewhere was stifled by new suppression of freedoms at the end of the Khrushchev era (1963) when a policy of gradually creeping suppression of Ukrainian was re-instituted.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The next part of the Soviet Ukrainian language policy divides into two eras: first, the Shelest period (early 1960s to early 1970s), which was relatively liberal towards the development of the Ukrainian language. The second era, the policy of Shcherbytsky (early 1970s to early 1990s), was one of gradual suppression of the Ukrainian language.

====Shelest period====
The Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, [[Petro Shelest]], pursued a policy of defending Ukraine's interests within the Soviet Union. He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education. He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism.

====Shcherbytsky period====
The new party boss from 1972 to 1989, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels. His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985.

====Gorbachev and perebudova====
The management of dissent by the local [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communist Party]] was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, at the start of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] reforms [[Perestroika|perebudova]] and [[Glasnost|hlasnist’]] (Ukrainian for ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost''), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself.

Although Ukrainian still remained the native language for the majority in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified. In [[Donetsk]] there were no Ukrainian language schools and in [[Kyiv]] only a quarter of children went to Ukrainian language schools.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee/page/216 <!-- quote=1804. --> Eternal Russia:Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (page 218)</ref>

The Russian language was the dominant vehicle, not just of government function, but of the media, commerce, and modernity itself. This was substantially less the case for western Ukraine, which escaped the [[Holodomor|artificial famine]], [[Great Purge]], and most of [[Stalinism]]. And this region became the center of a hearty, if only partial, renaissance of the Ukrainian language during independence.

===Independence in the modern era===
[[File:Map12 b.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Fluency in Ukrainian (purple column) and Russian (blue column) in 1989 and 2001]]
[[File:Inf board metro.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Modern signs in the [[Kyiv Metro]] are in Ukrainian. The evolution in their language followed the changes in the language policies in post-war Ukraine. Originally, all signs and voice announcements in the metro were in Ukrainian, but their language was changed to Russian in the early 1980s, at the height of Shcherbytsky's gradual Russification. In the [[perestroika]] liberalization of the late 1980s, the signs were changed to bilingual. This was accompanied by bilingual voice announcements in the trains. In the early 1990s, both signs and voice announcements were changed again from bilingual to Ukrainian-only during the [[De-Russification|de-russification]] campaign that followed Ukraine's independence. Since 2012 the signs have been in both Ukrainian and English.]]
Since 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so. The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. In some cases the abrupt changing of the language of instruction in institutions of secondary and higher education led to the charges of [[Ukrainianization]], raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population. This transition, however, lacked most of the controversies that arose during the de-[[russification]] of the other former [[Soviet Republics]].

With time, most residents, including ethnic Russians, people of mixed origin, and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, started to self-identify as Ukrainian nationals, even those who remained [[Russophone]]. The Russian language, however, still dominates the print media in most of Ukraine and private radio and TV broadcasting in the eastern, southern, and, to a lesser degree, central regions. The state-controlled broadcast media have become exclusively Ukrainian. There are few obstacles to the usage of Russian in commerce and it is still occasionally used in government affairs.

Late 20th century [[Russia]]n politicians like [[Alexander Lebed]] and [[Mikhail Yur'ev]] still claimed that Ukrainian is a [[Russian language#Dialects|Russian dialect]].<ref name=YavlinskyUkr>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1w-3TCvbkioC&pg=PA35&dq=Ukrainian+Russian+dialect&hl=nl&ei=yOHfS-z5Ms-A-gaChd2aBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20Russian%20dialect&f=false Contemporary Ukraine: Dynamics of Post-Soviet Transformation] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[M.E.

In the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]], 67.5% of the country's population named Ukrainian as their native language (a 2.8% increase from 1989), while 29.6% named Russian (a 3.2% decrease). For many Ukrainians (of various ethnic origins), the term ''[[native language]]'' may not necessarily associate with the language they use more frequently. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Ukrainians consider the Ukrainian language ''native'', including those who often speak Russian. According to the official 2001 census data<ref>[http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010031943/http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/|date=10 October 2010}}</ref> approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded "Ukrainian" to the ''native language'' (''ridna mova'') census question, and roughly 25% responded "Russian". On the other hand, when the question "What language do you use in everyday life?" was asked in the sociological survey, the Kyivans' answers were distributed as follows:<ref>{{cite web | title=Welcome to Ukraine (See above) | url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72 | access-date=19 November 2005 }}</ref> "mostly Russian": 52%, "both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure": 32%, "mostly Ukrainian": 14%, "exclusively Ukrainian": 4.3%.

Ethnic minorities, such as Romanians, Tatars and Jews usually use Russian as their lingua franca. But there are tendencies within these minority groups to use Ukrainian. The Jewish writer [[Olexander Beyderman]] from the mainly Russian-speaking city of Odessa is now writing most of his dramas in Ukrainian. The emotional relationship regarding Ukrainian is changing in southern and eastern areas.

Opposition to expansion of Ukrainian-language teaching is a matter of contention in eastern regions closer to Russia&nbsp;– in May 2008, the [[Donetsk]] city council prohibited the creation of any new Ukrainian schools in the city in which 80% of them are [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120908120650/http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/25050 Ukraine council adopts Russian language], ''[[RussiaToday]]'', 21 May 2008</ref>

In 2019 a contentious bill was adopted by the Ukrainian parliament formalizing rules governing the usage of Ukrainian introducing penalties for violations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/parliament-passes-ukrainian-language-bill.html?cn-reloaded=1|title=Parliament passes Ukrainian language bill|author=Oleg Sukhov|date=25 April 2019|newspaper=Kyiv Post|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

==Literature and the Ukrainian literary language==
{{further|Ukrainian literature}}

The literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as "Old Ukrainian", but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the [[Ruthenian language]], and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as "Modern Ukrainian", but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian.

Influential literary figures in the development of modern Ukrainian literature include the philosopher [[Hryhorii Skovoroda]], [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], [[Mykola Kostomarov]], [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Franko]], and [[Lesia Ukrainka]]. The earliest literary work in the Ukrainian language was recorded in 1798 when [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], a playwright from [[Poltava]] in southeastern Ukraine, published his [[epic poem]], ''Eneyida'', a [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] in Ukrainian, based on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. His book was published in vernacular Ukrainian in a satirical way to avoid being censored, and is the earliest known Ukrainian published book to survive through Imperial and, later, Soviet policies on the Ukrainian language.

Kotlyarevsky's work and that of another early writer using the Ukrainian vernacular language, Petro Artemovsky, used the southeastern dialect spoken in the Poltava, Kharkiv and southern Kyiven regions of the Russian Empire. This dialect would serve as the basis of the Ukrainian literary language when it was developed by [[Taras Shevchenko]] and [[Panteleimon Kulish]] in the mid 19th century. In order to raise its status from that of a dialect to that of a language, various elements from folklore and traditional styles were added to it.<ref name = "Shevelov">George Shevelov. (1981). Evolution of the Ukrainian Literary Language. From ''Rethinking Ukrainian History.'' (Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky, John-Paul Himka, editors). Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, pp. 221–225.</ref>

The Ukrainian literary language developed further when the Russian state banned the use of the Ukrainian language, prompting many of its writers to move to the western Ukrainian region of Galicia which was under more liberal Austrian rule; after the 1860s the majority of Ukrainian literary works were published in Austrian Galicia.  During this period Galician influences were adopted in the Ukrainian literary language, particularly with respect to vocabulary involving law, government, technology, science, and administration.<ref name = "Shevelov"/>

==Current usage==
[[File:Ivan Franko Museum in Krivorivnia.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian language traffic sign for the Ivan Franko Museum in Kryvorivnia.]]
The use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic [[Ukrainians]] worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine (77.8% of the total population), the Ukrainian language is prevalent only in western and central Ukraine. In Kyiv, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking. The shift is believed to be caused, largely, by an influx of the rural population and migrants from the western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kyivans options to use the language they speak at home more widely in everyday affairs. Public signs and announcements in Kyiv are in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language of the urban population. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 88.1% of people living in Ukraine can communicate in Ukrainian.<ref name="d-m.com.ua">[http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm D-M.com.ua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302201528/http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm |date=2 March 2009 }}</ref>

Use of the Ukrainian language in Ukraine can be expected to increase, as the rural population migrates into the cities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, the rural Ukrainophones continue to prefer Russian. Interest in Ukrainian literature is growing rapidly, compensating for the periods when its development was hindered by either policies of direct suppression or lack of state support.

===Popular culture===

====Music====
Ukrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular [[Ukrainian rock]] bands, such as [[Okean Elzy]], [[Vopli Vidopliassova]], [[BoomBox (Ukrainian band)|BoomBox]], and others perform regularly in tours across [[Europe]], [[Israel]], [[North America]] and especially [[Russia]]. In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places in the charts, such as [[Enej]] from [[Poland]]. Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are [[The Ukrainians]] from the United Kingdom, [[Klooch]] from [[Canada]], [[Ukrainian Village Band]] from the United States, and the [[Kuban Cossack Choir]] from the [[Kuban]] region in [[Russia]].

The founders of this population primarily emigrated from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which used to be part of [[Austro-Hungary]] before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century.

===Grammar===
{{Further|Ukrainian grammar}}

Ukrainian is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[nominative-accusative language|nominative-accusative]], [[verb framing|satellite framed]] language. It exhibits [[T-V distinction]], and is [[null-subject language|null-subject]]. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/refdb/record/Stechishin-1958 |title=Stechishin-1958 |publisher=Wals.info |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref> Other [[word order]]s are common due to the free word order created by Ukrainian's [[inflection]]al system.

Nouns [[declension|decline]] for 7 [[grammatical cases|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], [[vocative]]; 3 [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], [[plural]]. [[Adjective]]s [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]].

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 2 [[grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]], [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]], 3 [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, third; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], and [[plural]]. Ukrainian verbs come in [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspect pairs]]: [[perfective aspect|perfective]], and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Pairs are usually formed by a [[prepositional]] prefix and occasionally a [[apophony|root change]]. The [[past tense]] agrees with its [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical gender|gender]], having developed from the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] [[participle]].

The Old East Slavic and Russian ''o'' in syllables ending in a consonant, often corresponds to a Ukrainian ''i'', as in ''pod'' &gt; ''pid'' (під, 'under'). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the ''o'' can re-appear as it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as ''rik'' (рік, 'year') ([[nominative case|nom]]): ''rotsi'' ([[locative case|loc]]) (році). Similarly, some words can have ''і'' in some declensions when most of the declension have ''o'', for example ''слово'' (nominative singular), ''слова'' (nominative plural) but ''слiв'' (genitive plural).

Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian ''na pervom etaže'' 'on the first floor' is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is ''na peršomu poversi'' (на першому поверсі). ''-omu'' is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in ''-im'' are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The ''kh'' of Ukrainian ''poverkh'' (поверх) has mutated into ''s'' under the influence of the soft vowel ''i'' (''k'' is similarly mutable into ''c'' in final positions).

===Phonology===
{{Further|Ukrainian phonology}}

[[File:Emma Andijewska, Vidsvity hrozy.ogg|thumb|The poem "Gleams of Thunderstorm" by Emma Andijewska being read in Ukrainian]]

The Ukrainian language has six vowels, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}.

A number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) and [[geminate consonant|long]], for example, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/lː/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/nː/}}.

The letter {{angle bracket|г}} represents [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, often transliterated as Latin ''h''. It is the [[Voiced consonant|voiced]] equivalent of English {{IPA|/h/}}. Russian speakers from Ukraine often use the soft Ukrainian {{IPA|/ɦ/}} in place of Russian {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which comes from northern dialects of Old East Slavic. The Ukrainian alphabet has the additional letter {{angle bracket|[[ґ]]}} for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which appears in a few native words such as {{Lang|uk|ґринджоли}}  ''gryndžoly'' 'sleigh' and {{Lang|uk|ґудзик}} ''gudzyk'' 'button'. However, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} appears almost exclusively in [[loan words]], and is usually simply written {{angle bracket|г}}. For example, loanwords from English on public signs usually use {{angle bracket|г}} for both English ''g'' and ''h''.

Another phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic {{angle bracket|[[в]]}} ''v/w''. While in standard Russian it represents {{IPA|/v/}}, in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes {{IPA|/w/}} (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within a word or at a word boundary, it denotes the allophone {{IPA|[u̯]}}, and like the off-glide in the English words "flow" and "cow", it forms a [[diphthong]] with the preceding vowel). Native Russian speakers will pronounce the Ukrainian {{angle bracket|в}} as {{IPA|[v]}}, which is one way to tell the two groups apart. As with {{angle bracket|г}} above, Ukrainians use {{angle bracket|в}} to render both English ''v'' and ''w''; Russians occasionally use {{angle bracket|у}} for ''w'' instead.

Unlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have [[final devoicing]].

===Alphabet===
{{Main|Ukrainian alphabet}}
{{Ukrainian alphabet}}

Ukrainian is written in a version of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 [[phoneme]]s; an apostrophe is also used.  Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied.

The modern Ukrainian alphabet is the result of a number of proposed alphabetic reforms from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in Ukraine under the Russian Empire, in Austrian Galicia, and later in Soviet Ukraine. A unified Ukrainian alphabet (the ''[[Skrypnykivka]]'', after [[Mykola Skrypnyk]]) was officially established at a 1927 international Orthographic Conference in [[Kharkiv]], during the period of [[Ukrainization]] in Soviet Ukraine.  But the policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the Soviet Ukrainian orthography diverged from that used by the [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]].  The Ukrainian letter [[Ge with upturn|ge]] ''ґ'' was banned in the Soviet Union from 1933 until the period of [[Glasnost]] in 1990.<ref>Magocsi 1996, pp 567, 570–71.</ref>

The letter щ represents two consonants {{IPA|[ʃt͡ʃ]}}. The combination of {{IPA|[j]}} with some of the vowels is also represented by a single letter ({{IPA|[ja]}} = я, {{IPA|[je]}} = є, {{IPA|[ji]}} or {{IPA|[jı̽]}} = ї, {{IPA|[ju]}} = ю), while {{IPA|[jɔ]}} = йо and the rare regional {{IPA|[jɨ]}} = йи are written using two letters. These [[iotated]] vowel letters and a special [[soft sign]] change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An [[apostrophe]] is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the [[yer]] in the Russian alphabet.

A consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long.

The phonemes {{IPA|[d͡z]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} do not have dedicated letters in the alphabet and are rendered with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] дз and дж, respectively. {{IPA|[d͡z]}} is equivalent to English ''ds'' in ''pods'', {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} is equivalent to ''j'' in ''jump''.

As in Russian, the [[acute accent]] may be used to denote vowel stress.

===Vocabulary===

''The Dictionary of Ukrainian Language'' in 11 volumes contains 135,000 entries.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Lexical card catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has 6 million cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.nas.gov.ua/institutes/ium/lb/Documents/LB-10.pdf|title=Лексикографічний Бюлетень|year=2004|access-date=June 2013}}</ref> The same Institute is going to publish the new ''Dictionary of Ukrainian Language'' in 13 volumes.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, можливість, ''mozhlyvist{{'}}'', "possibility", and Polish ''możliwość'', but Russian возможность, ''vozmozhnost{{'}}'').

===False friends with Russian===
{{also|Surzhyk}}
The standard Ukrainian language which is based on the Kyiv–Poltava dialect has a plethora of false friends with the standard Russian language which is based on the Moscow dialect. Many people intentionally or not use them, causing their language shift into what is known as [[Surzhyk]] where the meaning of some words mimicking Russian could be understood out of context rather than their literal meaning in Ukrainian.

==Classification and relationship to other languages==
[[File:Geographical distribution of extant Slavic and East Baltic languages 2015.png|right|400px|Ethnographic Map of Slavic and Baltic Languages]]
Ukrainian has varying degrees of [[mutual intelligibility]] with other Slavic languages and is considered to be most closely related to [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].<ref>Roland Sussex, Paul V. Cubberley. (2006). ''The Slavic languages .'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pg. 518</ref>

In the 19th century, the question of whether Ukrainian, [[Belorusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages are dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed, with the debate affected by linguistic and political factors.<ref name="classification145"/> The political situation ([[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] being mainly part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of [[Kyivan Rus']], which occupied large parts of these three nations, led to the creation of the common classification known later as the [[East Slavic languages]]. The underlying theory of the grouping is their descent from a common ancestor. In modern times, Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages.<ref>Bernard Comrie and Greville G. Corbett, ed.  1993.  ''The Slavonic Languages'' (Routledge).<br>Ethnologue, 16th edition.<br>Bernard Comrie.  1992.  "Slavic Languages," ''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'' (Oxford).  Vol. 3, pp. 452–456.</ref><ref>David Dalby. 1999/2000. ''The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities'' (The Linguasphere Observatory), Volume Two, pg. 442: "53-AAA-e, Russkiy+Ukrainska"</ref>

Until the 17th and 18th centuries (the time of national and language revival of Ukraine) the [[Ukrainians]] were predominantly peasants and [[petit bourgeois|petits bourgeois]]; as a result, the Ukrainian language was mostly vernacular and few earlier literary works from the period can be found. In the cities, Ukrainian coexisted with [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] — a literary language of [[religion]] that evolved from the [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] — and later [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], both languages which were more often used in formal writing and communication during that time.

===Differences between Ukrainian and other Slavic languages===
The Ukrainian language has the following similarities and differences with other Slavic languages:

*Like all Slavic languages with the exception of [[Russian language|Russian]], Belarusian, Slovak and Slovene, the Ukrainian language has preserved the Common Slavic [[vocative case]]. When addressing one's sister (''sestra'') she is referred to as ''sestro.'' In the Russian language the vocative case has been almost entirely replaced by the nominative (except for a handful of vestigial forms, e.g. ''Bozhe'' "God!" and ''Gospodi'' "Lord!").<ref name="comparison">J. B. Rudnyckyj. (1963) . The Position of the Ukrainian Language among the Slavic languages. In ''Ukraine: A concise Encyclopedia''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 445–448.</ref>
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all Slavic languages other than Russian, Slovak and Slovene, has retained the Common [[Slavic second palatalization]] of the velars *k, *g and *x in front of the secondary vowel *ě of the dative and locative ending in the female [[declension]], resulting in the final sequences -cě, -zě, and -sě. For example, ''ruka'' (hand) becomes ''ruci'' in Ukrainian. In Russian, the dative and locative of ''ruka'' is ''ruke.''
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Serbian, Croatian and Slovene, has developed the ending -''mo'' for first-person plurals in verbs (''khodymo'' for "we walk").<ref name="comparison"/> In all cases, it resulted from lengthening of the Common Slavic -''mŭ''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}{{dubious|date=April 2014}}
*The Ukrainian language, along with Russian and Belarusian, has changed the Common Slavic word-initial ''ye''- into ''o'', such as in the words ''ozero'' (lake) and ''odyn'' (one).<ref name="comparison"/>
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian, Belarusian and southern Russian dialects, has changed the Common Slavic "g" into an "h" sound (for example, ''noha'' – leg).<ref name="comparison"/>
*The Ukrainian language, in common with some northern Russian and Croatian dialects, has transformed the Common Slavic ''yě'' into ''i'' (for example, ''lis'' – forest).<ref name="comparison"/>
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovene and Serbian, has simplified the Common Slavic ''tl'' and ''dl'' into ''l'' (for example, ''mela'' – she swept").<ref name="comparison"/>
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all modern Slavic languages other than Bulgarian and Macedonian, does not use [[Article (linguistics)|articles]].
*Other Slavic o in closed syllables, that is, ending in a consonant, in many cases corresponds to a Ukrainian i, as in pod > pid (під, 'under'). This also includes place names such as Lviv (Львів in Ukrainian) - Lwów in Polish and Львов (Lvov) in Russian.

Unlike all other Slavic languages, Ukrainian has a [[synthetic future]] (also termed [[inflectional future]]) tense which developed through the erosion and cliticization of the verb 'to have' (or possibly 'to take'): ''pysa-ty-mu'' (infinitive-future-1st sg.) ''I will write''.<ref name="Languages of Europe">Bernd Kortmann, Johan van der Auwera (2011). The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide, Volume 2. p. 103</ref> Although the inflectional future (based on the verb 'to have') is characteristic of [[Romance languages]], Ukrainian linguist A. Danylenko argues that Ukrainian differs from Romance in the choice of auxiliary, which should be interpreted as 'to take' and not 'to have.' He states that Late Common Slavic (LCS) had three verbs with the same root *em- : 
* a determined imperfective LCS *jęti : *jĭmǫ 'to take' (later superseded by numerous prefixed perfectives) 
* an indetermined imperfective LCS *jĭmati : jemljǫ 'to take' (which would not take any prefixes)
* an imperfective LCS *jĭměti : *jĭmamĭ 'to hold, own, have' 
The three verbs became conflated in East Slavic due to morphological overlap, in particular of iměti ‘to have’ and jati ‘to take’ as exemplified in the Middle Ukrainian homonymic imut’ from both iměti (&lt; *jĭměti) and jati (&lt; *jęti). Analogous grammaticalization of the type take (‘to take,’ ‘to seize’) > future is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].<ref name="Danylenko">Andrii Danylenko. Is There Any Inflectional Future in East Slavic? A Case of Ukrainian against Romance Reopened. Journal of the Slavic Research Center at Hokkaido University, 2007. PP. 147 - 177.</ref>
