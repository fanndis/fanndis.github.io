'''Profit''', in [[accounting]], is an [[income]] distributed to the [[ownership | owner]] in a [[Profit (economics) | profitable]] [[market production]] process ([[business]]). Profit is a measure of [[profitability]] which is the owner's major interest in the income-formation process of market production. There are several profit measures in common use.

Income formation in market production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income generated is always distributed to the stakeholders of production as [[economic value]] within the review period. The profit is the share of income formation the owner is able to keep to themselves in the income distribution process. Profit is one of the major sources of [[economics | economic]] [[well-being]] because it means incomes and opportunities to develop production. The words "income", "profit" and "earnings" are synonyms in this context.

==Measurement of profit==
There are several important profit measures in common use. Note that the words ''earnings'', ''profit'' and ''income'' are used as substitutes in some of these terms.
* '''[[Gross profit]]''' equals sales [[revenue]] minus [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS), thus removing only the part of expenses that can be traced directly to the production or purchase of the goods. Gross profit still includes general (overhead) expenses like R&D, S&M, G&A, also interest expense, taxes and extraordinary items.
* '''[[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization]]''' (EBITDA) equals sales revenue minus cost of goods sold and all expenses except for interest, amortization, depreciation and taxes. It measures the cash earnings that can be used to pay interest and repay the principal. Since the interest is paid before income tax is calculated, the debt holder can ignore taxes.
* '''[[Earnings before interest and taxes]]''' (EBIT) or '''operating profit''' equals sales revenue minus cost of goods sold and all expenses except for interest and taxes. This is the surplus generated by operations. It is also known as Operating Profit Before Interest and Taxes (OPBIT) or simply Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT).
* '''[[Earnings before taxes]]''' (EBT) or '''net profit before tax''' equals sales revenue minus cost of goods sold and all expenses except for taxes. It is also known as pre-tax book income (PTBI), net operating income before taxes or simply pre-tax income.
* '''[[Net income]]''' or '''earnings after tax''' or '''net profit after tax''' equals sales revenue after deducting all expenses, including taxes (unless some distinction about the treatment of extraordinary expenses is made). In the US, the term '''[[net income]]''' is commonly used. '''Income before extraordinary expenses''' represents the same but before adjusting for extraordinary items.
* '''[[Retained earnings]]''' equals earnings after tax minus payable [[dividend]]s.

To accountants, '''economic profit''', or EP, is a single-period metric to determine the value created by a company in one period—usually a year. It is earnings after tax less the ''equity charge'', a risk-weighted cost of capital. This is almost identical to the economists' definition of economic profit.

There are analysts who see the benefit in making adjustments to economic profit such as eliminating the effect of amortized goodwill or capitalizing expenditure on brand advertising to show its value over multiple accounting periods. The underlying concept was first introduced by [[Eugen Schmalenbach]], but the commercial application of the concept of adjusted economic profit was by Stern Stewart & Co. which has trade-marked their adjusted economic profit as '''[[Economic Value Added]]''' (EVA).

'''Optimum profit''' is a theoretical measure and denotes the "right" level of profit a business can achieve. In the business, this figure takes account of [[marketing]] strategy, [[Positioning (marketing)|market position]], and other methods of increasing returns above the competitive rate.

Accounting profits should include economic profits, which are also called [[economic rent]]s. For instance, a [[monopoly]] can have very high economic profits, and those profits might include a rent on some natural resource that a firm owns, whereby that resource cannot be easily duplicated by other firms.
