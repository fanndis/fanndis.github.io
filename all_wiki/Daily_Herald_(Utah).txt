==History==
The earliest predecessor of the ''Daily Herald'', the ''Provo Daily Times'', was founded in 1873. It was the first newspaper to be published in Provo, when Utah was still a frontier territory. The paper eventually changed its name to the ''Enquirer'', and then to the ''Provo Post''. A competitor, the ''Utah County Democrat'', was founded in 1898 and renamed the ''Provo Herald'' in 1909. In 1924 the ''Provo Post'' and the ''Provo Herald'' merged, forming a final foundation for the later ''Daily Herald''.{{refn|group="Note"|Even though the official name of the newspaper is the ''Daily Herald'' and "Provo" has not been part of the official name for nearly a century, local residents (and others) still frequently refer to the newspaper as the "'''Provo Daily Herald'''".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/55781999-79/herald-lee-daily-departments.html.csp|title=Provo Daily Herald cuts staff in newsroom, other departments|last=Beebe|first=Paul|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|quote=The Provo Daily Herald newspaper announced. . .|date=6 Feb 2013|access-date=11 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/author/9042/Dick-Harmon.html|title=Dick Harmon|quote=He previously worked for. . . the Provo Daily Herald for 26 years.|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705363292/Provo-Daily-Herald-reporter-named-Lockharts-chief-deputy.html?pg=all|title=Provo Daily Herald reporter named Lockhart's chief deputy|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|quote=A Provo Daily Herald reporter and blogger will serve as deputy chief. . .|date=20 Dec 2010|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/article/6ea88f2827e55f4e472e13ae1740b48e/hazmat-crew-snuffs-out-chemical-spill-in-provo|title=Hazmat crew snuffs out chemical spill in Provo|newspaper=newsdaily|agency=[[Associated Press]]|quote=Provo Fire Battalion Chief Tom Augustus told the Provo Daily Herald that. . .|date=18 Apr 2013|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://milagrosutah.com/provo-daily-herald-milagros-mexican-food-utah|title=Provo Daily Herald Milagros Mexican Food|last=Tuomisto|first=Dave|publisher=Milagros|quote=The Provo Daily Herald is having their annual “Best Of” voting.|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/blog-25-5879-video-provo-daily-herald-burns-competition.html|title=Video: Provo Daily Herald Burns Competition|last=Peterson|first=Eric|newspaper=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]]|publisher=Copperfield Publishing, IncCopperfield Publishing, Inc|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|quote=The Provo Daily Herald sends a clear message. . .|date=21 Jun 2011|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref> 
}} The company was purchased in 1926 by James G. Scripps, eldest son of newspaper magnate [[E. W. Scripps]]. [[Scripps League Newspapers]] held the newspaper until 1996, when it was sold to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer]], which held it for almost a decade.<ref>{{cite news |author= Times Wire Services |date= May 7, 1996 |title= Pulitzer to Purchase Scripps Newspapers |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-07/business/fi-1356_1_daily-herald |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> In 2005 Pulitzer was sold to [[Lee Enterprises]].<ref name="About"/>

In February 2009, the ''Daily Herald'' announced it would discontinue five weekly papers that had covered northern Utah County: the ''American Fork Citizen'', ''Pleasant Grove Review'', ''Lehi Free Press'', ''Lone Peak Press'' and ''Orem Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705283104/Provo-Herald-is-halting-5-weeklies.html?pg=all|title=Provo Herald is halting 5 weeklies|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=6 Feb 2009|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Herald to discontinue print editions of North County weeklies|newspaper=Daily Herald |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/herald-to-discontinue-print-editions-of-north-county-weeklies/article_0adee376-a77c-5a6a-9a99-ff6ced5984f6.html |publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=[[Provo, Utah]]|date=6 Feb 2009|access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref> Subscribers to those papers, which were published every Thursday and had a combined circulation of 5,800, instead began receiving Thursday issues of the Herald, leading to a higher subscription count that day. At that time the weekly papers in southern Utah County were not affected.  However, by January 2011, it announced that it would entirely discontinue the weekly newspapers that covered southern Utah County (''Springville Herald'', ''Spanish Fork Press'', and ''Nebo Reporter'') and incorporate their content into daily publication of the ''Daily Herald''.<ref>{{cite news|title=South County weekly news goes daily|newspaper=Daily Herald |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south-county-weekly-news-goes-daily/article_9b5ea704-2995-11e0-95d5-001cc4c002e0.html |publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=[[Provo, Utah]]|date=26 Jan 2011 |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref>  By April 2013, the online editions of all the northern Utah County publications, except the ''American Fork Citizen'' have been discontinued. However, an online edition of ''The Pyramid'' ([[Mount Pleasant, Utah|Mount Pleasant]] in [[Sanpete County, Utah|Sanpete County]]) is also published.<ref>{{cite web |title=Daily Herald Sites |newspaper=Daily Herald|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|location=[[Provo, Utah]]|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/sites/|access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref>

In February 2013, the ''Daily Herald'' announced that it would no longer publish a daily opinion page.  This change came shortly after 10 percent of its workforce, including the executive editor, was laid off.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/55877006-79/daily-herald-opinion-community.html.csp|title=Provo Daily Herald ends daily opinion page|last=Horiuchi|first=Vince|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=21 Feb 2013|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref> As of May 2013, a replacement executive editor, nor an interim executive editor, had not been identified, leaving the possibility that the position may be permanently eliminated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/55833660-79/daily-editor-executive-wright.html.csp|title=Provo Daily Herald lays off executive editor|last=Horiuchi|first=Vince|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|date=14 Feb 2013|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref>
