The '''University of California, Santa Cruz''' ('''UC Santa Cruz''' or '''UCSC''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  It is one of 10 campuses in the [[University of California]] system. Located 75 miles (120&nbsp;km) south of San Francisco at the edge of the coastal community of Santa Cruz, the campus lies on {{convert|2001|acres|ha}} of rolling, forested hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean and [[Monterey Bay]].

Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz began with the intention to showcase progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. The residential college system consists of ten small colleges.

UC Santa Cruz is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=110714 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref>

==History==

=== Prior to campus development ===
Prior to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonization]], the Uypi tribe of the Awaswas Nation lived in what is now the campus of UCSC, who spoke [[Mutsun language|Mutsun Costanoan]] of the [[Ohlone]] peoples. During Spanish colonization, members of the tribe were taken to [[Mission Santa Cruz]] as slaves.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Howell|first=Rennea|title=Library Guides: UCSC Campus History & Current Affairs : Welcome!|url=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/ucsc-campus-history/welcome|access-date=2020-09-23|website=guides.library.ucsc.edu|language=en}}</ref> During this time, the missionaries of Mission Santa Cruz burned down a part of the forest to build a vineyard on top of what is now the Great Meadow.

After the [[California Gold Rush]], many mining firms came to the area with the [[Cowell Lime Works]] operating on the entirety of the campus, which operated til the 1920s.

===Site selection and campus planning===
Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Board of Regents]] in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].<ref name="City council hasn't told">{{Cite news| last = Doyle | first = William T.| title = What the city council has not told us about university expansion| newspaper = Santa Cruz Sentinel| publisher = MediaNews Group| date = October 1, 2006| url = http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=42181| access-date =February 19, 2010}}</ref>  During the mid-1950s, there was widespread public sentiment in favor of the establishment of a new UC campus somewhere south of the [[University of California, Berkeley|original campus]] at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. In 1957, the [[California State Senate]] passed a resolution asking the Regents to consider the [[Monterey Peninsula]], and that same year, the [[California State Assembly]] passed its own resolution asking the Regents to consider the [[Santa Clara Valley]].<ref name="Stadtman_Pages412413">{{cite book|last1=Stadtman|first1=Verne A.|title=The University of California, 1868–1968|url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad|url-access=registration|date=1970|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/412 412–413]}}</ref> In December 1959, the Regents voted to focus their site selection process on the [[Almaden Valley, San Jose|Almaden Valley]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (i.e., within the Santa Clara Valley and the larger region now known as [[Silicon Valley]]), but the public announcement of the Regents' decision immediately caused property values throughout that area to increase to the extent where the Regents could no longer afford to buy the necessary land.<ref name="Stadtman_Pages412413" />  After another year of study, the Regents finally selected Santa Cruz as the location of the next UC campus.<ref name="Stadtman_Pages412413" />

However, Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus.<ref name="McHenry UCSC origins">{{Cite book| last = McHenry | first = Dean E.| editor1-last = Spedding Calciano | editor1-first = Elizabeth| title = Volume II The University of California, Santa Cruz: Its Origins, Architecture, Academic Planning and Early Faculty Appointments 1958–1968| publisher = UC Santa Cruz | year = 1974 | page = 59| url = http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p265101coll13/id/3700 | format = PDF |access-date=February 19, 2010}}</ref> The formal design process for the Santa Cruz campus began in the late 1950s, culminating in the Long Range Development Plan of 1963.<ref name="1963 LRDP">{{cite web| title = Long Range Development Plan, University of California Santa Cruz| publisher = UC Santa Cruz Campus Planning Committee| date = October 21, 1963| url = http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| access-date = February 19, 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624040556/http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| archive-date = June 24, 2010| df = mdy-all}}</ref> 

Planning the new UC campus was just as hard as picking the site. The first plan was to build the campus on what is now the Great Meadow, so it would be close to the existing city of Santa Cruz.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page246">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA246|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>  The second plan, conceived by [[Thomas Church (landscape architect)|Thomas Church]],  put the colleges into the [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forest at the top of the hill above the Great Meadow.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page246" />  This was clearly the better idea, but presented the problem of how to place the colleges inside the forest.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page246" />  The original design for College One ([[Cowell College]]) scattered its buildings among the trees, which was sarcastically compared by one regent to "a series of motels on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]]."<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page246" />  Having recently visited [[Aigues-Mortes]], Kerr was inspired by the layout of that medieval town to suggest concentrating each college's buildings into distinct clusters in the forest, and that is how UC Santa Cruz was actually built.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page247">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA247|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>  

Construction started by 1964, and the university was able to accommodate its first students (albeit living in trailers on what is now the East Field athletic area) in 1965. The campus was intended to be a showcase for contemporary architecture, progressive teaching methods, and undergraduate research.<ref name="UC Regents history">{{cite web| title = Santa Cruz: Historical Overview| work = University of California History Digital Archives| publisher = Regents of the University of California| date = June 18, 2004| url = http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~ucalhist/general_history/campuses/ucsc/overview.html| access-date = February 19, 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090612233818/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~ucalhist/general_history/campuses/ucsc/overview.html| archive-date = June 12, 2009| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Stadtman">{{Cite book| last = Stadtman | first = Verne A.| title = The Centennial Record of the University of California, 1868–1968| publisher = Regents of the University of California | year = 1967| url = http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb&brand=calisphere| chapter = Santa Cruz | pages= 503–504| chapter-url = http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div01036&toc.depth=1&toc.id=div01036&brand=calisphere | access-date =February 19, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Burchyns 45 years">{{Cite news| last = Burchyns  | first = Tony| title = It's been 45 years since UCSC was founded – and Santa Cruz was irrecoverably changed| newspaper = Santa Cruz Sentinel| publisher = MediaNews Group| date = June 25, 2006| url = http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=39666| access-date =February 19, 2010}}</ref> According to founding chancellor [[Dean McHenry]], the purpose of the distributed college system was to combine the benefits of a major [[research university]] with the intimacy of a smaller college.<ref name="Burns">{{Cite journal| last = Burns| first = Jim| title = Dean E.

===The "Santa Cruz dream"===

In his memoirs, Kerr ruefully recounted the myriad errors made by himself and McHenry in launching the new campus.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page265" /> They had created Santa Cruz as the "most experimental" of the UC campuses, but opened it just in time for their cherished "Santa Cruz dream" to die amidst the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page265" />  Santa Cruz quickly became the "counterculture campus" where students and faculty either "[[Substance intoxication|mellowed out]]" among the redwood trees or turned into "[[Student activism|activist-radical[s]]]".<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page282">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA282|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref> For example, when Kerr came to deliver an address at UC Santa Cruz's first commencement exercises in 1969, the ceremony was hijacked by students who denounced Kerr and McHenry for having "planned and created Santa Cruz as a capitalist-imperialist-fascist plot to divert the students from their revolution against the evils of American society and, in particular, against the horrors of the [[Vietnam War]]."<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page286">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA286|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref> The students then tried to award an honorary degree to [[Huey P. Newton]] (who was in jail at the time, although he went on to earn his bachelor's and doctorate degrees at Santa Cruz).<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page286" /> Kerr later recalled this episode of "[[guerrilla theatre]]" as "one of the worst afternoons of my life."<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page287">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA287|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref>  

During the 1970s, the quality of UC Santa Cruz's incoming freshman classes deteriorated as [[Me generation]] students increasingly chose to matriculate at less experimental UC campuses in order to major in subjects such as engineering and business administration (both absent from Santa Cruz).<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page283">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA283|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref> Another major factor behind the decrease in quality was a series of "grisly murders" around Santa Cruz,<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page283" /> which at the time was labeled the "murder capital of the world".<ref name="Dowd">{{cite news |last1=Dowd |first1=Katie |title='Murder capital of the world': The terrifying years when multiple serial killers stalked Santa Cruz |url=https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/santa-cruz-kemper-mullin-frazier-murders-12841990.php |access-date=14 October 2020 |work=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications|date=19 April 2018}}</ref>  The average SAT scores of UC Santa Cruz's incoming students dropped from 1250 in the early 1970s to 1050 by the early 1980s.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page283" />

===Sinsheimer Reforms===

A series of major reforms were implemented by Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer (1977-1987) at the cost of making Santa Cruz less experimental and more conventional.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page284">{{cite book|last1=Kerr|first1=Clark|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520223677|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&pg=PA284|access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="Savage">{{cite news |last1=Savage |first1=David G. |title='60s School Strives for '80s Image |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Times Mirror |date=23 November 1984 |page=1}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers.</ref><ref name="White">{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Dan |title=An indelible mark |url=https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/10/an-indelible-mark/ |access-date=1 September 2020 |work=UC Santa Cruz Magazine |publisher=Regents of the University of California |date=October 2017}}</ref>  In 1981, after a two-year battle, the faculty narrowly voted to give students the option of receiving [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] for the first time, in lieu of Santa Cruz's traditional [[narrative evaluation]]s.<ref name="Savage"/> By the fall of 1984, 45% of Santa Cruz students were already majoring in the sciences, and that year, the campus offered [[computer engineering]] as a major for the first time (in order to take advantage of its proximity to Silicon Valley), followed by [[business economics]] a year later.<ref name="Savage"/> In May 1985, Sinsheimer, a molecular biologist, welcomed several scientists to Santa Cruz for one of the first meetings at which the idea of a [[Human Genome Project]] was discussed.<ref name="Berg">{{cite journal |last1=Berg |first1=Paul |title=Origins of the Human Genome Project: Why Sequence the Human Genome When 96% of It Is Junk? |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |date=October 2006 |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1086/507688 |pmid=16960796 |pmc=1592577 }}</ref> 

Sinsheimer got Santa Cruz involved in [[College athletics in the United States|intercollegiate athletics]] for the first time as part of [[NCAA Division III]].  In 1981, he supported student athletes' preference for the [[sea lion]] as the campus [[mascot]], but was forced to back down in 1986 when the student body voted to support the [[banana slug]] instead.<ref name="White" /> 

By the early 1990s, the campus was still inefficient in that average teaching loads were still light compared to other UC campuses, but SAT scores had stopped falling, the faculty was performing good research, and the campus was beginning to rise in university rankings.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page284" />  In 1997, an engineering school was finally launched.<ref name="ClarkKerr_Page284" /> 

In 2019, the University of California, Santa Cruz was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), the most prestigious alliance of American research universities.<ref>https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/press-releases/three-leading-research-universities-join-association-american-universities</ref> Along with [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]], UC Santa Cruz was the youngest university to gain admittance to the AAU.<ref>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-santa-cruz-joins-association-american-universities</ref>

===2020 strike action===
{{main|2020 Santa Cruz graduate students' strike}}
On December 9, 2019, over 200 graduate student-workers initiated a wildcat strike by withholding Fall quarter grades with the following demands: (1) a COLA (cost of living adjustment) of $1,412/month to address the housing crisis in Santa Cruz, (2) a promise of non-retaliation against those participating in the strike, and (3) a cap on tuition for undergraduate students, to ensure that the increase in graduate student-worker pay would not increase the rent-burden and precarity of their students.<ref>https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2020/01/08/more-than-12000-fall-grades-missing-as-strike-continues-at-uc-santa-cruz/</ref> On February 10, 2020, graduate student-workers responded to disciplinary threats from UCSC administrators with a full teaching strike.<ref>https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2020/02/10/ucsc-graduate-students-go-on-strike/</ref> UCSC administrators' called in police from various counties to protect and serve. 17 students were arrested, and several were injured, but UCSC denied the claims of police brutality and excessive force.<ref>https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2020/02/12/at-least-17-arrests-as-ucsc-students-stand-off-against-police/</ref> On February 27, 2020, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara joined the strike.<ref>https://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ucd-students-make-demands-as-support-grows-for-strike/</ref><ref>https://keyt.com/news/education/2020/02/27/ucsb-graduate-students-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/</ref> On February 28, 2020, 54 graduate student-workers were terminated<ref>http://triton.news/2020/02/breaking-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students-on-strike-receive-termination-letter/</ref> and continued strikes shut down the campus for at least one day the following week.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/03/06/cola4all-shuts-down-uc-santa-cruz |title=#COLA4ALL Shuts Down UC Santa Cruz |first=Colleen |last=Flaherty |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=March 6, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>

===Impact on Santa Cruz===
Although the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] already exhibited a strong [[conservation ethic]] before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s together with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=27810|title=35 years later, students' environmental report seems prescient|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=February 3, 2008|last=Seals|first=Brian|date=July 10, 2005}}</ref> The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc.<ref name="Burchins3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40020|title=1980s ushered in discussion of UCSC expansion that continues today |newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=February 2, 2008|date=July 9, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}</ref> A large and growing population of politically [[progressivism|liberal]] UCSC [[alumnus|alumni]] changed the electorate of the town from predominantly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Honig|first=Tom|title=Santa Cruz was once Reagan country|date=June 4, 2004|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]}}</ref> to markedly [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]], consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both [[town and gown]].

===Expansion plans===
Plans for increasing enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 faculty and staff by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Marshall | first=Carolyn | title=As College Grows, a City Is Asking, 'Who Will Pay?' | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/us/19campus.html | date=January 27, 2007 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | access-date=January 16, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40191|title=Tie-dyed philosophy majors of the past make way for pencil-protected science majors|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=February 2, 2008|date=July 16, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}</ref> City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.<ref name="bookwalter">{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|title=Suits over UCSC growth settled: City, county, neighbors reach deal; university agrees to concessions over roads, water and housing|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=August 9, 2008|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=September 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815200839/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|archive-date=August 15, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intended to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in [[Silicon Valley]].

==Campus==
[[File:UCSC & Santa Cruz Aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|UCSC & Santa Cruz aerial view. The Great Meadow is the undeveloped area between city and university]]
The {{convert|2000|acre|ha|adj=on}} UCSC campus is located {{convert|75|mi|km}} south of San Francisco, in the Ben Lomond Mountain ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Elevation varies from {{convert|285|ft|m}} at the campus entrance to {{convert|1195|ft|m}} at the northern boundary, a difference of about {{convert|900|ft|m}}. The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open [[meadow]], locally known as the Great Meadow. To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] groves. The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park<ref>{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Harvey West Park |url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/harvey.html|access-date=May 4, 2006}}</ref> and the [[Pogonip (park)|Pogonip open space preserve]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Pogonip|url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/pogo.html|access-date=May 4, 2006}}</ref> on the north by [[Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry Cowell Redwoods SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=546|access-date=May 4, 2006}}</ref> near the town of [[Felton, California|Felton]], and on the west by [[Gray Whale Ranch]], a portion of [[Wilder Ranch State Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilder Ranch SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=549|access-date=May 4, 2006}}</ref> 
The campus is built on a portion of the [[Cowell Lime Works|Cowell Family ranch]], which was purchased by the University of California in 1961.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=11341|title=The original City on a Hill|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=February 5, 2008|last=Redfern|first=Cathy|date=September 2, 2001
}}</ref> The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails. The heavily forested area has allowed UC Santa Cruz to operate a [[RV park|recreational vehicle park]] as a form of student housing.<ref>{{cite web| title=UC Santa Cruz – University Family Student Housing| url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| access-date=October 27, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026004728/http://housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| archive-date=October 26, 2006| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2017 the University finished building the Coastal Science Facility for the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.

[[File:Bridge across ravine at UCSC.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge across ravine.]]
A number of [[shrines]], dens and other student-built curiosities are scattered around the northern campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the university razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|title='An Unnatural History of UCSC' traces the evolution of a magical campus setting – Santa Cruz Sentinel|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|date=April 13, 2008|access-date=April 12, 2008|last=Baine|first=Wallace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413062824/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|archive-date=April 13, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173AF931A25752C0A964958260

Creeks traverse the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.<ref>{{cite web | title=UCSC Walking Map | url=http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html |access-date=March 15, 2011 |archive-date=September 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901143913/http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html }}</ref> At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.<ref>{{cite web | title=Flickr: Oaks Path Night | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/exitfromreality/55520898/ |access-date=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

There are a number of natural points of interest throughout the UCSC grounds. The "Porter Caves" are a popular site among students on the west side of campus. The entrance is located in the forest between the [[Porter College]] meadow and Empire Grade Road. The caves wind through a set of caverns, some of which are challenging, narrow passages. Tree Nine is another popular destination for students. A large [[Douglas fir]] spanning approximately {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, Tree Nine is located in the upper campus of UCSC behind [[College Nine]]. The tree had been a popular climbing spot for many years but due to environmental corrosion and fear of student injuries, UC ground services sawed off the limbs to make it nearly impossible to climb.<ref>Tovin Lapan, [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 "UCSC attempts to stop students from climbing campus favorite 'Tree Nine' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520114146/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 |date=May 20, 2013 }} ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' , October 3, 2010</ref> Less experienced tree-climbers also frequent Sunset Tree located on the east side of the meadow behind the UCSC Music Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|title=UCSC Campus Field Trip|date=April 17, 2001|access-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417170443/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|archive-date=April 17, 2001|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|title=Empire Cave|date=April 20, 2001|access-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420140510/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|archive-date=April 20, 2001|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The UCSC campus is also one of the few homes to [[Mima Mounds]] in the United States. They are rare in the United States and in the world in general.

==Academics==
[[File:UCSC farm rows.jpg|left|thumb|Organic farm rows]]
The university has five academic divisions: Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical & Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences. Together, they offer 65 graduate programs, 64 undergraduate majors, and 41 minors.<ref>{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz – Academic Programs|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/academics/|access-date=August 28, 2020}}</ref>

Popular undergraduate majors include Art, [[Business management|Business Management Economics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Molecular biology|Molecular and Cell Biology]], [[Physics]], and [[Psychology]].<ref>{{cite web

Interdisciplinary programs, such as Computational Media, Feminist Studies, [[Environmental studies|Environmental Studies]], Visual Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, Critical Race & Ethnic Studies, and the [[History of Consciousness]] Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.

A joint program with [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|UC Hastings]] enables UC Santa Cruz students to earn a bachelor's degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven.  The "3+3 BA/JD" Program between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco accepted its first applicants in fall 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/|title=3 Plus 3|website=3plus3.ucsc.edu|access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref>  UCSC students who declare their intent in their freshman or early sophomore year will complete three years at UCSC and then move on to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum. Credits from the first year of law school will count toward a student's bachelor's degree. Students who successfully complete the first-year law course work will receive their bachelor's degree and be able to graduate with their UCSC class, then continue at UC Hastings afterwards for two years.

Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level [[natural science]] research component with the appointment of plant physiologist [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] as the first provost of [[Crown College, University of California, Santa Cruz|Crown College]]. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714160609/http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archive-date=July 14, 2006|title=Kenneth V.

==Residential colleges==
The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the university's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the "[[residential college|residential college system]]" outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see [[University of California, Santa Cruz#History|History]], above). Upon admission, all undergraduate students have the opportunity to choose one of ten colleges, with which they usually stay affiliated for their entire undergraduate careers.<ref name="collegesection">

There are cases where some students switch college affiliations as each college holds a different graduation ceremony. Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.<ref name="collegesection"/> The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.<ref name="collegesection"/> Other universities with similar college systems include [[Rice University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty [[provost (education)|provost]], who is the nominal head of his or her college.<ref name="collegesection"/> An incoming first-year student will take a mandatory "core course" within his or her respective college, with a curriculum and central theme unique to that college.<ref name="collegesection"/> College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.<ref name="collegesection"/> Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments. Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges.

For the fall 2019 term, UCSC offered admission to 28,808 freshmen out of 55,866 applicants, an acceptance rate of 51.6%. The entering freshman class had an average high school [[GPA]] of 3.57, and the middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores were 590-680 for evidence-base reading and writing, 600-710 for math, while the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] Composite range was 24–30.<ref name="CDS2019"/>

===Grading===
For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique [[Grading in the United States|student evaluation]] system. With the exception of the choice of letter grades in science courses the only [[grade (education)|grades]] assigned were "pass" and "no record", supplemented with [[narrative evaluation]]s. Beginning in 1997, UCSC allowed students the option of selecting letter grade evaluations, but course grades were still optional until 2000, when faculty voted to require students receive letter grades. Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades. {{As of|2010}}, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure. Still, some professors write evaluations for all students while some would write evaluations for specific students upon request.<ref>
{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/02/24/MN88561.DTL|title=UC Santa Cruz To Start Using Letter Grades|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |access-date=February 2, 2008|last=Schevitz|first=Tanya|date=February 24, 2000}}</ref> Students can still elect to receive a "pass/no pass" grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading. A grade of C and above would receive a grade of "pass". Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a "pass/no pass" basis. Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now "graded", most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.<ref>{{cite web|title=UCSC Discover – Academics

==Library==
[[File:McHenry Library stacks, University of California Santa Cruz.jpg|thumb|McHenry Library stacks]]
The [[McHenry Library]] houses UCSC's arts and letters collection, with most of the scientific reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library. The McHenry Library was designed by [[John Carl Warnecke]].<ref name="Clark"/> In addition, the colleges host smaller libraries, which serve as quiet places to study.  The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the papers of [[Anaïs Nin]], the papers and drawings of [[Beat poet]] [[Kenneth Patchen]], the largest collection of [[Edward Weston]] photographs in the country, the [[mycology]] book collection of composer [[John Cage]], a large collection of works by [[Satyajit Ray]], the [[Hayden White]] collection of 16th-century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive. The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to [[Lick Observatory]] dating back to 1870.<ref>{{cite web

===Grateful Dead archive===
In 2008, UCSC agreed to house the [[Grateful Dead]] archives at the [[McHenry Library]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/us/24grateful.html?_r=1&oref=slogin

UCSC students are known for political activism.

UC Santa Cruz is also well known for its [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2,000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual "[[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]". Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark pot holiday

The 2007 event attracted a total of 5,000 participants. The university does not condone the gathering, but has taken steps to regulate the event and ensure security for all participants. On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the number of buses that could drive through campus.<ref>{{Cite news|title=UCSC takes security measures for '4/20|date=April 18, 2008|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|last=Brown|first=J.M.|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|access-date=April 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091023/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|archive-date=November 20, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|title=Police: Pot-smoking event in UCSC meadow 'a moral slap in the face|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|access-date=April 23, 2008|date=April 22, 2008|last=Ragan|first=Tom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208215646/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|archive-date=February 8, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Another well known tradition is what is known as "[[First Rain]]". Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain.

===Housing===
Most of the UCSC undergraduate housing is affiliated with one of the ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, [[gender-neutral housing|gender-neutral]] and substance-free floors are also available.

All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.

In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services | url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | access-date=April 16, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404191759/http://housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | archive-date=April 4, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Greek life===
UCSC is home to few fraternities and sororities. The first Greek organization on campus, [[Theta Chi]], was given colony status on January 10, 1987 and chartered on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like [[Theta Chi]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student groups like P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxucsc.com/history.html|date=August 31, 2011|access-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831231223/http://oxucsc.com/history.html|archive-date=August 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Greek life at UCSC includes fraternities [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Phi Zeta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Pi Alpha Phi]], and [[Delta Lambda Psi]], the nation's first gender neutral queer Greek organization. Sororities that are members of the [[National Panhellenic Council]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz include [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]. Recently in June 2016 the Theta Xi chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] was chartered to bring a third National sorority to UC Santa Cruz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kappaalphatheta.org/whatsnew/index.cfm?entryId=86CC0556-DDF7-2DE8-A1591D25B14DFC64|title=Kappa Alpha Theta - What's New - Kappa Alpha Theta Welcomes UC Santa Cruz!|website=Kappaalphatheta.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>  Sororities on campus include [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Pi Alpha]], [[Tri Chi]], [[Sigma Omicron Pi]], [[Kappa Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]] and [[Alpha Psi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/studentorgs/rso-glo/glolist.html|title=List of Greek Organizations|website=soar.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608000750/http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/studentorgs/rso-glo/glolist.html|archive-date=June 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most recent Greek lettered organization added to the campus was [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority, which chartered its chapter Gamma Phi as of Spring 2016.

Aside from social fraternities and sororities on campus, there are also a number of professional organizations as well. There are [[Kappa Gamma Delta]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kgdatucsc.org|title=Kappa Gamma Delta- UC Santa Cruz, Zeta Chapter|website=KGD|access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref> a prehealth sorority, [[Sigma Mu Delta]], a prehealth fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a coed service fraternity, [[Phi Alpha Delta]], a pre-law fraternity, and [[Delta Sigma Pi]], a co-ed professional business fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|title=UCSC Discover - Student Life|date=May 31, 2010|access-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531010536/https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|archive-date=May 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Sustainability==
Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. In 2006, a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Sustainability Office|url=http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|work=Sustainability Office|publisher=UCSC Sustainability Office|access-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060403/http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|archive-date=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Athletics==
{{main|UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs}}
[[File:UCSC East Field.jpg|thumb|East Field]]
UCSC competes in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as an Independent member. There are fifteen [[varsity team|varsity]] sports – men's and women's basketball, tennis, soccer, volleyball, swimming, cross country and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and women's golf. UCSC teams have been Division III nationally ranked in tennis, soccer, men's volleyball, and swimming. The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of club teams. It has won several club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.

In 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.
