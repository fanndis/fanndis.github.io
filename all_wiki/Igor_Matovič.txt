'''Igor Matovič''' (born 11 May 1973) is a Slovak politician serving as [[Prime Minister of Slovakia]] since 2020.

Born in [[Trnava]], he studied at [[Comenius University]] and went into the publishing business. Elected to the [[National Council (Slovakia)|National Council]] in [[2010 Slovak parliamentary election|2010]] on the [[Freedom and Solidarity]] party list, Matovič founded the [[Ordinary People (Slovakia)|Ordinary People]] (Obyčajní ľudia) movement in 2011, which ran on an [[anti-corruption]] ticket and was politically to the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]]. His anti-corruption campaigning has been marked out by "publicity stunts to shine a light on alleged graft"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Reuters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/slovakia-president-appoints-centre-right-coalition-government|title=Slovakia president appoints centre-right coalition government|date=21 March 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=24 March 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> particularly focusing on [[parliamentary privilege]]s and bribery.

Matovič was reelected in [[2020 Slovak parliamentary election|2020]], his party obtaining a sufficient number of seats to enter into a [[coalition government]] with three other centrist and right-wing parties. Matovič's choices for his [[Government of Slovakia|cabinet]] were accepted by President [[Zuzana Čaputová]] and he was appointed Prime Minister on 21 March 2020.

==Early life and business career==
Igor Matovič was born in Trnava on 11 May 1973. In 1993, he began to study at the Faculty of Management at [[Comenius University]], graduating in 1998. He founded a business in 1997 and worked as the chief executive of Trnava publishing house regionPRESS from 2002 to 2010. Matovič later transferred the business to his wife, Pavlína (née Repaska).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kirschbaum |first1=Stanislav J. |title=Historical Dictionary of Slovakia |date=2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-8030-6 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzefAgAAQBAJ&q=Igor+Matovi%C4%8D+1973&pg=PA213 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=noviny>{{cite news |title=Igor Matovič |url=https://www.webnoviny.sk/osobnosti/igor-matovic/ |accessdate=20 March 2020 |work=Webnoviny.sk}}</ref> ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' described him as an "eccentric self-made millionaire and former media boss" who had become "a media-savvy but unpredictable politician".<ref name="AFP" />

==Political career==
In 2010, Matovič founded the [[Ordinary People (Slovakia)|Ordinary People]] (Obyčajní ľudia) civic movement, which was generally [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] and emphasized [[anti-corruption]]. Matovič advertised the civic movement using free leaflets distributed by his family's press company.<ref name="noviny" /> Along with three other OĽaNO MPs, he first won election at the [[2010 Slovak parliamentary election|2010 election]] on the [[Freedom and Solidarity]] (SaS) list. He sat in the SaS [[caucus]] until February the following year, when he supported the opposition [[Direction – Social Democracy|Smer]]'s proposed restrictions on [[Multiple citizenship]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Coalition loses another MP |author=Michaela Terenzani-Stanková |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/41611/2/coalition_loses_another_mp.html |newspaper=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Matovič's opposition to the government's position led to SaS being dropped from the coalition. In 2011, [[Iveta Radičová]]'s government fell apart, which led to [[2012 Slovak parliamentary election|new elections in 2012]]. Led by Matovič, Ordinary People was reconstituted into OĽaNO (Ordinary People and Independent Personalities), an independent political party. OĽaNO won 8.55% and 16 seats. He stayed in the opposition as he was unwilling to work with [[Smer-SD]].<ref name="noviny" />

As leader of OĽaNO, Matovič attracted attention by campaigning against corruption. To oppose [[parliamentary immunity]], he parked his car on a pedestrian crossing and showed his parliamentary pass to police who tried to tow it;<ref name=parking>{{cite news |title= Matovič zaparkoval na priechode, mobilizoval pred referendom |url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/5551364/matovic-zaparkoval-na-priechode-mobilizoval-pred-referendom.html |accessdate=20 November 2020 |work=SME |date=16 September 2010}}</ref> to oppose corruption, he took a [[polygraph]] test stating that he had never accepted bribes.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news |last1=Cameron |first1=Rob |title=Europe's Mr Ordinary prepares for power |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51718395 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=BBC News |date=4 March 2020}}</ref> However, [[Robert Fico]] accused Matovič of impropriety in effecting a fictitious sale of the regionPRESS business for 122&nbsp;million [[Slovak koruna]] to employee Pavel Vandák, who supposedly got the money from an internal account.  Matovič denies this.<ref name="noviny" />

==Prime Minister of Slovakia==
Matovič's party OĽaNO got the plurality of votes in the [[2020 Slovak parliamentary election]] on 29 February 2020, winning 53 seats in the 150-member National Council with 25.02% of the vote.<ref name=AFP>{{cite news |title=Slovakia election: seismic shift as public anger ousts dominant Smer-SD party |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/slovakia-election-centre-right-olano-wins-poll-on-anti-graft-platform |accessdate=20 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=1 March 2020}}</ref> Corruption was a major issue in the election, which helped Matovič, who had long positioned himself as an anti-corruption activist.<ref>{{cite news |title=Slovakia: the end of Smer's rule, the triumph of Igor Matovič |url=https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2020-03-02/slovakia-end-smers-rule-triumph-igor-matovic |accessdate=20 March 2020 |work=OSW Centre for Eastern Studies |date=2 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> On 13 March, Matovič announced he had reached an agreement for a governing coalition with the other centrist and right-wing parties [[We Are Family (Slovakia)|We Are Family]], [[Freedom and Solidarity]] and [[For the People (Slovakia)|For the People]], though they had not agreed upon a common governing program.

In July 2020, Matovič admitted to plagiarizing his masters' thesis after an investigation from ''[[Denník N]]'' found that entire pages and charts were lifted from the sources. He said he would step down after all his election promises were fulfilled.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prime Minister Matovič is a plagiarist too |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22448506/prime-minister-matovic-is-a-plagiarist-too.html |accessdate=18 July 2020 |work=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=16 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Comenius University in Bratislava confirmed the plagiarism of the master's thesis.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aj škola si prezrela Matovičovu diplomovku.

Sociologist of the [[Bratislava Policy Institute]], Michal Vašečka, stated that "Matovič has started to transform the anger of the society into a [[Class conflict|class war]]: city vs. countryside, educated vs. uneducated, common people vs. the elites." He suggested that [[political polarization]] would result.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sirotnikova |first1=Miroslava German |title=Jan Kuciak: A Murder That Changed Slovakia |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/08/05/jan-kuciak-a-murder-that-changed-slovakia/ |accessdate=5 August 2020 |work=Balkan Insight |date=5 August 2020}}</ref>
