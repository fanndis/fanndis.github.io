'''Horst Kasner''' (né '''Horst Kaźmierczak'''; 6 August 1926, [[Berlin]] – 2 September 2011, [[Templin]]) was a German Protestant theologian and father of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

==Biography==
Kasner was born as Horst Kaźmierczak in 1926, the son of a policeman in the [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]] suburb of [[Berlin]], where he was brought up. His father [[Ludwig Kasner|Ludwig Kaźmierczak]] (born 1896 in [[Poznań|Posen]], [[German Empire]] - died 1959 in Berlin) was born out of wedlock to Anna Kazmierczak and Ludwik Wojciechowski, ethnic [[Poles]] and citizens of the German Empire from the Poznań area.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/familiegeschichte-der-kanzlerin-merkel-hat-polnische-wurzeln-1.1623363 Merkel hat polnische Wurzeln] Süddeutsche Zeitung, 13 March 2013</ref> Ludwig was mobilised into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]] in 1915 and sent to France, where he was taken prisoner of war and joined the Polish [[Haller's Army]] fighting on the side of [[World War I Allies|Entente]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Merkels-Opa-kaempfte-gegen-Deutsche-Die-Wurzeln-der-Aniola-Kazmierczak-article10353776.html|title=Merkels Opa kämpfte gegen Deutsche|first=n-tv|last=Nachrichten|website=n-tv.de|accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref> Together with the army he returned to Poland to fight in the [[Polish-Ukrainian war]] and the [[Polish-Soviet war]].<ref>[http://poznan.gazeta.pl/poznan/1,36037,13607990,Dziadek_Angeli_Merkel_byl_w_armii_Hallera__Walczyl.html#TRrelSST ''Dziadek Angeli Merkel był w armii Hallera.

Little is known about Horst Kasner's [[World War II|wartime]] service, and he was held as a prisoner of war at the age of 19. During his high school years he was a member of the [[Hitler Youth]], with the last service position of a troop leader.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} From 1948 he studied theology, first in [[Heidelberg]] then in [[Hamburg]]. It was in Hamburg that he got to know and later married Herlinde Jentzsch,<ref name=TrauerHKlautSZ>{{cite web|url=http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/angela-merkel-trauert-um-ihren-vater-923754.html|title=Angela Merkel trauert um ihren VaterStreng, arbeitsam und zurückhaltend: Horst Kasner hat die Kanzlerin geprägt.

==Migration to the German Democratic Republic==

Several weeks after the birth of their daughter, the family moved from Hamburg to [[East Berlin]]. The [[Inner German border|interior border]] was not yet completely closed, but most German migration was in the opposite direction (see also: [[Berlin Wall#Emigration westward in the early 1950s|Berlin Wall]]). In the first five months of 1954, 180,000 people had fled the GDR, and during the building of the border defenses between 1949 and 1961, around 2.5 million had left.

Kasner moved to the East according to the wishes of Youth Pastor Hans-Otto Wölber, [[List of bishops of Hamburg#State Bishops of Hamburg (1933–1976)|the later (1964–1983) Bishop of Hamburg]], who feared a shortage of pastors in the East would work against the church. Kasner found a pastor's position with the [[Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg|Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] and the family moved to a rectory in the village of Quitzow near [[Perleberg]]. Pastors took various positions in their willingness to cooperate with the communist authorities.

==Pastor in Templin==

Three years later in 1957, Kasner moved to the small Brandenburg town of [[Templin]]. There, at the request of [[Albrecht Schönherr]], then [[superintendent (ecclesiastical)|General Superintendent]] for the Sprengel (ecclesiastical region) [[Eberswalde]], he took a development position in the religious education office. Schönherr, in a 2004 interview, indicated he made the appointment "due to the good working conditions and Kasner's abilities as a pedagogue." The location of the continuing education buildings was the Waldhof, a complex of church buildings erected outside the center of Templin, which from 1958 on, also housed a facility for the mentally handicapped.

Their daughter Angela had been born on 17 July 1954.  Marcus Kasner, who has grown up to become a [[physicist]],<ref name=spiegel462009>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html|date=9 November 2009|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)|volume=46/2009|title=Die Schläferin|author=Alexander Osang|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref> was born on 7 July 1957 and a second daughter, Irene, on 19 August 1964.

Kasner was regarded as a religious leader and idealist who did not oppose the church governance or the policies of the Socialist party, unlike Schönherr and Hanfried Müller (members of the Weissensee Work Group (''Weißenseer Arbeitskreis'') standing in opposition to dominant national-conservative trend of Berlin-Brandenburg bishop [[Otto Dibelius]]). From a perspective of governance, Kasner was considered one of the more "progressive" forces. His nickname during GDR times, quoted repeatedly in the press, was "Red Kasner." He was the longtime director of the pastoral college in a key position within the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg. All theologians were required as part of their education and training to spend some time as a vicar with their second theological examination in Templin. In this context there is little record of any pressure put on pastors to conform to the system. Theologian Richard Schröder wrote in 2004:

<blockquote>For me, Kasner was always trustworthy and certainly no conformist. The Pastor's College in Templin was always for us a window on the West through means of Western lecturers and Western literature. The theological speakers were not handpicked to toe the line.</blockquote>

Kasner took trips abroad as part of the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]] and was given the privilege of travelling to the West either by company car or private vehicle, which could be procured through Genex. On the other hand, his wife, Herlind, was forbidden to do so due to her position as a GDR teacher. A recruitment effort by the Stasi is presumed to have failed. Unlike the children in other pastors’ families, the higher education of the Kasner children was not impeded.

From the late 1960s onwards, Kasner criticised the social order of West Germany:  he did not support [[German reunification|reunification]].

Kasner's regular interlocutors in terms of church politics were [[Wolfgang Schnur]] and Clemens de Maizière, the father of the later last GDR prime minister [[Lothar de Maizière]]. Schnur, later chairman of the opposition party [[Democratic Awakening]], was a member of the Synod (cf. [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]]) of the [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Mecklenburg]] and temporarily vice president of the Synod of the [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] and the Synod of the Federation of the Protestant Churches in the GDR (''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR''). He was, alongside the Synod of the Berlin-Brandenburg Church, one of the earliest members of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union in East Germany]]. Also negotiating alongside Kasner, Schnur, and de Maizière with the East German government from 1979 to 1988 and its state secretary for church affairs, [[Klaus Gysi]].

After ''[[Die Wende]]'', Kasner advocated against further military use of the so-called Bombodrom, a military allotment in northern [[Brandenburg]] and fell out of good relations with Lothar de Maizière when the latter's association with the Stasi was exposed.
