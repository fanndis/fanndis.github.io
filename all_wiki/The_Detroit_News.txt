'''''The Detroit News''''' is one of the two major newspapers in the U.S. city of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].  The paper began in 1873, when it rented space in the rival ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''{{'s}} building.  ''The News'' absorbed the ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' on February 1, 1919, the ''[[Detroit Journal]]'' on July 21, 1922, and on November 7, 1960, it bought and closed the faltering ''[[Detroit Times]]''. However, it retained the ''Times''' building, which it used as a printing plant until 1975, when a new facility opened in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights.]] The ''Times'' building was demolished in 1978.<ref name=times>{{cite web|title=Detroit Times Building|publisher=Buildings of Detroit|accessdate=October 29, 2010|url=http://www.buildingsofdetroit.com/places/times|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026134611/http://buildingsofdetroit.com/places/times|archivedate=October 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The street in downtown Detroit where the Times building once stood is still called "[[Times Square (Detroit)|Times Square]]."  The Evening News Association, owner of ''The News'', merged with [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] in 1985.

At the time of its acquisition of ''The News'', Gannett also had other Detroit interests, as its outdoor advertising company, which ultimately became [[Outfront Media]] through a series of mergers, operated many billboards across Detroit and the surrounding area, including advertising displays on [[Detroit Department of Transportation]] and [[Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority]] buses, with its only competitor, primarily along [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit#Freeways|Metro Detroit's freeway network]], being 3M National Advertising (now [[Lamar Advertising]]).

''The News'' claims to have been the first newspaper in the world to operate a [[radio]] station, station 8MK, which began broadcasting August 20, 1920.  8MK is now CBS-owned [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]].  In 1947, it established Michigan's first television station, WWJ-TV, now [[WDIV-TV]]; it has been a primary NBC affiliate since sign-on, owing to WWJ-AM's ties with the NBC Radio Network.

In 1989, the paper entered into a 100-year [[joint operating agreement]] with the rival ''Free Press'', combining business operations while keeping separate editorial staffs.  The combined company is called the [[Detroit Media Partnership]] (DMP). The ''Free Press'' moved into ''The News'' building in 1998 and until May 7, 2006, the two published a single joint weekend edition. Today, ''The News'' is published Monday–Saturday, and has an editorial page in the Sunday ''Free Press''.

The Detroit News has an online version, including a separate site for connections from EU countries which does not track personal information.

''The Detroit News'' has won three [[Pulitzer Prize]]s.

==History==
[[File:Detnews.png|thumb|left|Former ''Detroit News'' logo, used for marketing]]
[[File:Telegraphic Department, The Detroit News (1918).jpg|thumb|right|Telegraphic dispatches to the paper exceeded 75,000 words a day in 1918<ref>{{cite web|title=The Detroit News: Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-Three, Nineteen Hundred and Seventeen, a Record of Progress|publisher=Franklin Press|date=1918|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924015423563#page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref>]]
''The Detroit News'' was founded by [[James E. Scripps]], who, in turn, was the older half-brother and one-time partner of [[Edward W. Scripps]]. The paper's eventual success, however, is largely credited to Scripps' son-in-law, [[George Gough Booth]], who came aboard at the request of his wife's father. Booth went on to construct Michigan's largest newspaper empire, founding the independent [[Booth Newspapers]] chain (now owned by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I. Newhouse]]'s [[Advance Publications]]) with his two brothers.

''The Detroit News'' building was erected in 1917. It was designed by [[architect]] [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]], who included a faux-stone concrete building with large street level arches to admit light. The arches along the east and south side of the building were bricked-in for protection after the [[12th Street Riot]] in 1967. The bricked-in arches on the east and south ends of the building were reopened during renovations required when the ''Free Press'' relocated its offices there 20 years later.

In 1931, ''The Detroit News'' made history when it bought a three-place [[Pitcairn PCA-2]] auto-gyro as a camera aircraft which could take off and land in restricted places and semi-hover for photos.  It was the ancestor of today's well-known news helicopter.<ref name=hover>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA632|title=Hover Plane and Camera Join News Staff|magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=October 1931|page=632}}</ref> In 1935 a single [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]] was purchased and modified by Lockheed as a news camera plane for ''The Detroit News''. To work in that role, a pod was built into the frontal leading edge of the right-wing about {{convert|8|ft|m|spell=in}} out from the fuselage. This pod had a glass dome on the front and a mounted camera. To aim the camera the pilot was provided with a primitive grid-like gun sight on his windshield.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA513|title=Flying Camera Aimed Like a Machine Gun|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=April 1935|page=513}}</ref>

July 13, 1995, [[Newspaper Guild]] employees of the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''The News'' along with pressmen, printers and [[Teamsters]], working for the "Detroit Newspapers" distribution arm, [[Detroit newspaper strike of 1995–97|went on strike]]. Approximately half of the staffers crossed the picket line before the unions ended their strike in February 1997.  The strike was resolved in court three years later, with the journalists' union losing its unfair labor practices case on appeal.  Still, the weakened unions remain active at the paper, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction.

August 3, 2005, Gannett announced that it would sell ''The News'' to [[MediaNews Group]] and purchase the ''Free Press'' from the [[Knight Ridder]] company.  With this move, Gannett became the managing partner in the papers' joint operating agreement. On May 7, 2006, the combined Sunday ''Detroit News and Free Press'' were replaced by a stand-alone Sunday ''Free Press''. On December 16, 2008, Detroit Media Partnership announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only. On other weekdays the paper sold at newsstands would be smaller, about 32&nbsp;pages, and redesigned. This arrangement went into effect on March 30, 2009.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/business/media/31paper.html|author1=Richard Pérez-Peña|author2=Mary Chapman|name-list-style=amp|title=Detroit's Daily Papers Are Now Not So Daily|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

''The News'' has significantly lower print circulation than the ''Free Press'' (over 100,000&nbsp;fewer copies, according to the Knight Ridder 2004 Annual Report).

In February 2014, the DMP announced its offices along with those of ''The News'' and the ''Free Press'' would move from the West Lafayette building to six floors in both the old and new sections of the former [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building|Federal Reserve building]] at 160 West Fort Street.  The partnership expected to place signs on the exterior similar to those on the former offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Press, News moving to new home in core of downtown Detroit|url=https://www.freep.com/article/20140219/BUSINESS06/302190176/detroit-free-press-building-moves-federal-reserve|author1=Ann Zaniewski|author2=John Gallagher|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224182729/https://www.freep.com/article/20140219/BUSINESS06/302190176/detroit-free-press-building-moves-federal-reserve|archivedate=February 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=aguilar>{{cite news|title=Detroit News, Free Press, DMP will occupy 6 floors in old Federal Reserve building|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140423/BIZ03/304230078|author=Louis Aguilar|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=May 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425194807/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140423/BIZ03/304230078|archivedate=April 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The move took place October 24–27, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=News moving out, leaving century of memories behind|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/neal-rubin/2014/10/23/rubin-detroit-news-memories/17817013/|author=Neil Rubin|date=October 24, 2014|newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

Editorially, ''The News'' is considered more [[conservative]] than the ''Free Press.''  However, it considers itself [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].  In an editorial statement printed in 1958, ''The News'' described itself as consistently conservative on economic issues and consistently liberal on civil liberties issues.  It has never endorsed a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] for [[president of the United States|president]], and has only failed to endorse a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] presidential candidate four times: twice during the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] era; in 2004, when it refused to endorse [[George W. Bush]] for re-election; and in 2016, when it endorsed Libertarian Party nominee [[Gary Johnson]] rather than Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]].<ref name=winkler>{{cite news|author=Claudia Winkler|date=October 28, 2004|title='For President: None of the Above': 'The Detroit News' Completes Its Retreat from Principle to Mush|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/843jadvr.asp|newspaper=[[The Weekly Standard]]|accessdate=April 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031042147/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/843jadvr.asp|archivedate=October 31, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Endorsement: Libertarian Gary Johnson for President|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=September 29, 2016|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/09/28/endorse-johnson-president/91254412/}}</ref>
