It was during this period San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure. Civil Engineer [[Michael O'Shaughnessy]] was hired by San Francisco Mayor [[James Rolph]] as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the [[Stockton Street Tunnel]], the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]], the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]], the [[San Francisco Fire Department Auxiliary Water Supply System|Auxiliary Water Supply System]], and new sewers. San Francisco's streetcar system, of which the J, K, L, M, and N lines survive today, was pushed to completion by O'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927. It was the [[Hetch Hetchy|O'Shaughnessy Dam]], [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]], and [[Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct]] that would have the largest effect on San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco – M.M.

==Geography==
[[File:San Francisco Peninsula by Sentinel-2, 2019-03-11.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Peninsula]]

San Francisco is located on the [[West Coast of the United States]] at the north end of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and [[San Francisco Bay]] within its boundaries. Several picturesque [[islands of San Francisco Bay|islands]]—[[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco|Treasure Island]] and the adjacent [[Yerba Buena Island]], and small portions of [[Alameda (island)|Alameda Island]], [[Red Rock Island]], and [[Angel Island, California|Angel Island]]<!--Alameda island is capitalized correctly; "island" is not part of the proper noun and is used here to distinguish the island from the [[municipality]], which also includes of Bay Farm Island, Balena Bay, Coast Guard Island, etc. -->—are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited [[Farallon Islands]], {{convert|27|mi|km}} offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a "seven-by-seven-mile square", a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly {{convert|232|sqmi|km2}}.

San Francisco's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina]], [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]], and [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]], as well as large sections of the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]], sit on areas of [[Land reclamation|landfill]].

West of downtown, across [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness Avenue]], lies the large [[Western Addition, San Francisco|Western Addition]] neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after [[World War II]]. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including [[Hayes Valley, San Francisco|Hayes Valley]], [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|the Fillmore]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]], which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its [[Japanese American]] residents were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed and interned]] during World War II. The Western Addition survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] with its [[Victorian house|Victorians]] largely intact, including the famous "[[Painted Ladies]]", standing alongside [[Alamo Square]]. To the south, near the geographic center of the city is [[Haight-Ashbury]], famously associated with 1960s [[hippie]] culture. The Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques<ref>{{cite news |title=The Haight |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/sf/haight/ |access-date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> and a few controversial chain stores,<ref>{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |title=Haight-Ashbury Journal; Love and Hate Linger in Ex-Hippie District |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/13/us/haight-ashbury-journal-love-and-hate-linger-in-ex-hippie-district.html?sec=&spon= |work=The New York Times |date=October 13, 1988 |access-date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> although it still retains some [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] character.

In the south-east quadrant of the city is the [[Mission District]]—populated in the 19th century by [[Californio]]s and working-class immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Scandinavia. In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from [[Mexican American|Mexico]] began to predominate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qualityoflife-themovie.com/website/mission.html |title=Quality of Life (film website) |work=Mission District History |author=Morgan, Benjamin (Director) |year=2007 |access-date=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to [[Twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]] professionals. [[Noe Valley, San Francisco|Noe Valley]] to the southwest and [[Bernal Heights, San Francisco|Bernal Heights]] to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children. East of the Mission is the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood, a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco. West of the Mission, the area historically known as [[Eureka Valley, San Francisco|Eureka Valley]], now popularly called [[The Castro, San Francisco|the Castro]], was once a working-class Scandinavian and Irish area. It has become North America's first [[gay village]], and is now the center of [[homosexuality|gay]] life in the city.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Castro |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/sf/castro/ |access-date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> Located near the city's southern border, the [[Excelsior District, San Francisco|Excelsior District]] is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco. The predominantly African American [[Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and controversial [[urban renewal]] projects.

The construction of the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]], and nearby affluent [[Forest Hill, San Francisco|Forest Hill]] and [[St. Francis Wood, San Francisco|St. Francis Wood]]. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to [[Golden Gate Park]] lies the vast [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]], a large middle-class area with a predominantly Asian population.<ref>{{cite news

The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond]], also a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] immigrants. Together, these areas are known as [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco|The Avenues]]. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.

Because of its sharp topography and maritime influences, San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct [[microclimate]]s. The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20% variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city. They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]]; for those who live on the eastern side of the city, San Francisco is sunnier, with an average of 260 clear days, and only 105 cloudy days per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Because of its unique city-county status, the local government is able to exercise jurisdiction over certain property outside city limits. [[San Francisco International Airport]], though located in [[San Mateo County]], is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco's largest jail complex (County Jail No. 5) is located in San Mateo County, in an [[unincorporated area]] adjacent to [[San Bruno, California|San Bruno]]. San Francisco was also granted a perpetual leasehold over the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] and [[drainage basin|watershed]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] by the [[Raker Act]] in 1913.<ref name="CityCounty"/>

San Francisco serves as the regional hub for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]], the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|Federal Reserve Bank]], and the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. Until [[Base Realignment and Closure|decommissioning]] in the early 1990s, the city had major military installations at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco|Treasure Island]], and [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard|Hunters Point]]—a legacy still reflected in the annual celebration of [[Fleet Week]].

[[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] begins at the approach to the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay. [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] connects to the western terminus of Interstate 80 and provides access to the south of the city along San Francisco Bay toward [[Silicon Valley]]. Northward, the routing for U.S. 101 uses arterial streets to connect to the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the only direct automobile link to [[Marin County]] and the North Bay.

As part of the retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and installation of a suicide barrier, starting in 2019 the railings on the west side of the pedestrian walkway were replaced with thinner, more flexible [[slat (aircraft)|slats]] in order to improve the bridge's aerodynamic tolerance of high wind to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.
