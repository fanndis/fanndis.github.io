Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]'' regarding [[employment discrimination]]. Two years after the Supreme Court decided that [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] does not allow employers to be sued for pay discrimination more than 180 days after an employee's first paycheck, the [[United States Congress]] passed a fair pay act in her name to remedy this issue, the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]]. She has since become a women's equality activist, public speaker, and author. In 2011, Ledbetter was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/lilly-ledbetter/ |title=Ledbetter, Lilly |website=National Women’s Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ledbetter was born Lilly McDaniel in [[Jacksonville, Alabama]], and graduated from [[Jacksonville High School (Alabama)|Jacksonville High School]] in 1956. Her father J.C. McDaniel was a mechanic at the [[Anniston Army Depot]]. After graduating from high school, Lilly McDaniel married Charles Ledbetter and had two children, Vicky and Phillip. She remained married until Charles's death in December 2008. Ledbetter worked at [[Jacksonville State University]] in Jacksonville, Alabama, as the Assistant Director-Financial Aid from May 1974 to December 1975.

In 1979, Lilly Ledbetter was hired by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], working as a supervisor. After working for Goodyear for nineteen years, Ledbetter received an anonymous note revealing that she was making thousands less per year than the men in her position. Only as she neared retirement did she learn she was being paid significantly less than male colleagues with similar seniority and experience. This letter led her to file a sex discrimination case against Goodyear<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=http://www.lillyledbetter.com/ |title=Lilly Ledbetter |website=www.lillyledbetter.com |access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> for paying her significantly less than her male counterparts.<ref name="lily"/> She successfully sued Goodyear but the judgment was reversed on appeal by the Eleventh Circuit. The lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled against her because she did not file suit 180 days from the date of the discriminatory policy that led to her reduced paycheck, though the paycheck itself was issued during the 180-day period. The Supreme Court did not consider the issue of whether a plaintiff's late discovery of a discriminatory action would excuse a failure to file within the 180-day period because her attorneys conceded it would have made no difference in her case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/wed-october-31-2012-lilly-ledbetter/ |title=Interview with Stephen Colbert |date=October 31, 2012 |access-date=June 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="scotus"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www2.tbo.com/business/breaking-news-business/2009/oct/22/equal-pay-crusader-says-shell-always-be-second-cla-ar-60881/ |title=Equal pay crusader says she'll always be 'second-class citizen' |author=Lindsay Peterson |newspaper=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=Oct 22, 2009 |access-date=June 5, 2012}}</ref> In dissent, [[United States]] [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote:
<blockquote>Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear Tire and Rubber]]’s plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially, Ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15&nbsp;male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.<ref name="scotus">{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1074.pdf |title=Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., No.&nbsp;05-1074, decided May 2007}}</ref></blockquote>
In response, Congress later passed legislation, called the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]], that restarted the 180-day clock every time a discriminatory paycheck was issued.

== Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 ==
Subsequently, [[111th United States Congress|the 111th United States Congress]] passed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] in 2009 to loosen the timeliness requirements for the filing of a discrimination suit so long as any act of discrimination, including receipt of a paycheck that reflects a past act of discrimination, occurs within the 180-day period of limitations. The act sought to reverse the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.|Ledbetter v. Goodyear]]'', which restricted the time period for filing pay discrimination claims, making it more difficult for workers to file a complaint. Under this bill, every discriminatory paycheck or other compensation can be filed, unrestricted from a time period for filing a claim of pay discrimination.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-110hrpt237/pdf/CRPT-110hrpt237.pdf |title=Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 |id=Report 110–237 |publisher=110th Congress of the United States of America, 1st Session |department=House of Representatives |collaboration=Committee on Education and Labor |author1=Miller, George |place=Washington, DC |date=July 18, 2007 |access-date=12 May 2020 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office}}</ref>

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]’s first official piece of legislation as president. He said: “When I came into office, we passed something called the Lilly Ledbetter Act, named after a good friend of mine, Lilly Ledbetter, who had worked for years and found out long into her work that she had been getting paid all these years less than men, substantially. She brought suit. They said, well, it’s too late to file suit because you should have filed suit right when it started happening. She said, I just found out. They said, it doesn’t matter. So we changed that law to allow somebody like Lilly, when they find out, to finally be able to go ahead and file suit.”<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/14/lilly-ledbetter-barack-obama-and-the-famous-anonymous-note/ |title=Lilly Ledbetter, Barack Obama and the famous 'anonymous note' |last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=2015-05-14 |newspaper=Washington Post |access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>
