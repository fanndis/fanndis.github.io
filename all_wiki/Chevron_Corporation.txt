'''Chevron Corporation''' is an American multinational [[List of oil exploration and production companies|energy corporation]]. One of the [[Standard Oil#Successor companies|successor companies]] of [[Standard Oil]], it is headquartered in [[San Ramon, California]], and active in more than 180 countries. Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the [[Petroleum|oil]], natural gas, including [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and [[Petroleum#Extraction|production]]; [[refining]], marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and [[power generation]]. Chevron is one of the world's largest companies; {{as of|2020|March|lc=y}}, it ranked fifteenth in the [[Fortune 500]] with a  yearly revenue of $146.5 billion and market valuation of $136 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fortune 500|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2020/|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Fortune|language=en}}</ref> In the 2020 [[Forbes Global 2000]], Chevron was ranked as the 61st -largest public company in the world. <ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.forbes.com/companies/chevron/#7a2677d21e13 | title= Forbes Global 2000 |access-date = 31 October 2020}}</ref> It was also one of the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]] that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.

==History==

===Predecessors===
[[File:Big Oil.svg|thumb|right|Chart of the major energy companies dubbed "Big Oil" sorted by latest published revenue]]
One of Chevron's early predecessors, '''Star Oil''', discovered oil at the [[Pico Canyon Oilfield]] in the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] north of Los Angeles in 1876. The 25 barrels of oil per day well marked the discovery of the Newhall Field, and is considered by geophysicist [[Marius Vassiliou]] as the beginning of the modern oil industry in California.<ref name="Vassiliou2009"/> Energy analyst [[Antonia Juhasz]] has said that while Star Oil's founders were influential in establishing an oil industry in California, Union Mattole Company discovered oil in the state eleven years prior.<ref name="Juhasz2009">{{cite book|author=Antonia Juhasz|title=The Bush Agenda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROTr9RCRr8IC&pg=PA106|access-date=August 9, 2013|date=October 6, 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-197761-9|pages=106–}}</ref>

In September 1879, [[Charles N. Felton]], Lloyd Tevis, George Loomis and others created the '''Pacific Coast Oil Company''', which acquired the assets of Star Oil<ref name="Vassiliou2009"/> with $1&nbsp;million in funding.<ref name="Karliner1997">{{cite book|author=Joshua Karliner|title=The Corporate Planet: Ecology and Politics in the Age of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CHLmPx2PJ0C&pg=PA61|access-date=August 8, 2013|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-87156-434-4|pages=61–}}</ref> Pacific Coast Oil became the largest oil interest in California<ref name="Karliner1997"/> by the time it was acquired by [[Standard Oil]] for $761,000 in 1900.<ref name="Vassiliou2009">{{cite book|author=M.

Another predecessor, [[Texas Fuel Company]], was founded in 1901, in [[Beaumont, Texas]] as an oil equipment vendor by "Buckskin Joe". The founder's nickname came from being harsh and aggressive.<ref name="Juhasz2009"/> Texas Fuel worked closely with Chevron. In 1936, it formed a joint venture with California Standard named [[Caltex]], to drill and produce oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="HallRamírez-Pascualli2012">{{cite book|author1=Charles A. S.

===Formation of the Chevron name===
[[File:Standardgasstation.jpg|thumb|A Chevron station branded under the Standard name in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]]]]
In 1911, the federal government broke Standard Oil into several pieces under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. One of those pieces, Standard Oil Co. (California), went on to become Chevron. It became part of the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", which dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century. In 1926, the company changed its name to Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL).<ref>{{cite news|title=Chevron drops the Texaco from its name|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-05-10/business/17371722_1_chevron-and-texaco-san-ramon-s-chevron-oil-industry|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=May 2, 2011|first=David R.|last=Baker|date=May 10, 2005}}</ref> By the terms of the breakup of Standard Oil, at first Standard of California could use the Standard name only within its original geographic area of the Pacific coast states, plus Nevada and Arizona; outside that area, it had to use another name. 

Today, Chevron is the owner of the [[Standard Oil]] trademark in 16 states in the western and southeastern United States.  Since [[United States trademark law|American trademark law]] operates under a use-it-or-lose-it rule,<ref name="Fishman">{{cite book |last=Fishman |first=Stephen |title=Trademark: Legal Care for Your Business & Product Name |date=2016 |publisher=Nolo |location=Berkeley |isbn=9781413322941 |page=238 |edition=11th |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trademark/uJy_DAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA238&printsec=frontcover |access-date=2 October 2020}}</ref> the company owns and operates one Standard-branded Chevron station in each state of the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thesledgehammer.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/a-not-so-standard-chevron-station/ |title=A Not-So-Standard Chevron Station |access-date=November 11, 2018 |first=Brian |last=Lutz |date=February 18, 2009 }}</ref>  However, its status in Kentucky is unclear after Chevron withdrew its brand from retail sales from Kentucky in July 2010.<ref name="CSPNet">{{cite web |last=Abcede|first=Angel|url=http://www.cspnet.com/fuels-news-prices-analysis/fuels-news/articles/eastern-withdrawal-chevron |title=Eastern Withdrawal for Chevron &#124; CSP Daily News / Magazine &#124; Petroleum – CSP Information Group, Inc. – news for convenience & petroleum retailing |publisher=Cspnet.com |date=December 7, 2009 |access-date=January 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030175906/http://www.cspnet.com/fuels-news-prices-analysis/fuels-news/articles/eastern-withdrawal-chevron |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Eigelbach">{{cite news |last1=Eigelbach |first1=Kevin |title=Chevron's exit from Kentucky opens door for other gas brands |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2010/07/19/story1.html |work=Louisville Business First |publisher=American City Business Journals |date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>

The Chevron name came into use for some of its retail products in the 1930s. The name '''Calso''' was also used from 1946 to 1955, in states outside its native West Coast territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/landscape/dating/gas_stations/calso_chevron.php|title=Chevron and Calso|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaspumps.info/gallery/v/globes/Std+of+Cali/Calso+Gasoline.jpg.html|title=Vintage Calso Gasoline / Standard Oil of California pump|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

Standard Oil Company of California ranked 75th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>

In 1933, [[Saudi Arabia]] granted California Standard a concession to find oil, which led to the discovery of oil in 1938. In 1948, California Standard discovered the world's largest oil field in Saudi Arabia, [[Ghawar Field]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The King of Giant Fields|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_King_of_Giant_Fields/d311f583.aspx|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> California Standard's subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, grew over the years and became the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1944. In 1973, the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO. By 1980, the company was entirely owned by the Saudis, and in 1988, its name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company—[[Saudi Aramco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aramcoservices.com/Who-We-Are/Our-History.aspx|title=Our History – Aramco Services Company|website=www.aramcoservices.com|language=en|access-date=February 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212120354/http://www.aramcoservices.com/Who-We-Are/Our-History.aspx|archive-date=February 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Standard Oil of California and [[Gulf Oil]] merged in 1984, which was the largest merger in history at that time. To comply with [[U.S. antitrust law]], California Standard divested many of Gulf's operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States. (The refinery is currently owned by [[Sunoco]].) Among the assets sold off were Gulf's retail outlets in Gulf's home market of [[Pittsburgh]], where Chevron lacks a retail presence but does retain a regional headquarters there as of 2013, partially for [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]]-related drilling.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/chevron-acquires-kmart-property-in-moon-for-possible-regional-headquarters-685784/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Chevron acquires Kmart property in Moon for possible regional headquarters – Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first1=Mark | last1=Belko | first2=Erich | last2=Schwartzel | date=May 1, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Standard Oil of California also took the opportunity to change its legal name to '''Chevron Corporation''', since it had already been using the well-known "Chevron" retail brand name for decades. Chevron would sell the Gulf Oil trademarks for the entire U.S. to [[Cumberland Farms]], the parent company of [[Gulf Oil LP]], in 2010 after Cumberland Farms had a license to the Gulf trademark in the Northeastern United States since 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vermontbiz.com/news/january/gulf-oil-acquires-brand-rights-entire-us|title=Gulf Oil acquires brand rights for entire US|work=Vermont Business Magazine|date=January 13, 2010|access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

In 1996 Chevron transferred its natural gas gathering, operating and marketing operation to [[Dynegy|NGC Corporation]] (later Dynegy) in exchange for a roughly 25% equity stake in NGC.<ref name="Chevron-Corp-Nov-1996-10-Q">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/923/9341096000011/filing-main.htm |title=Chevron Corp, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Nov 8, 1996 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date =March 24, 2013}}</ref> In a merger completed February 1, 2000, Illinova Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. and Chevron's stake increased up to 28%.<ref name="Chevron-Corp-Mar-2000-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1904/9341000000003/filing-main.htm |title=Chevron Corp, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 6, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date =March 24, 2013}}</ref> However, in May 2007, Chevron sold its stake in the company for approximately $985&nbsp;million, resulting in a gain of $680&nbsp;million.<ref name="Chevron-Corp-May-2007-8-K">{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/623/0000950134-07-012387.pdf |title=Chevron Corp, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 25, 2007 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date =March 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Chevron's Profit Rises 24%, With Help From Its Refineries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/28/business/28chevron.html |newspaper = The New York Times |agency=Reuters|access-date=May 2, 2011| date=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

===Environmental damage in Ecuador===
{{main|Lago Agrio oil field}}
[[File:Texaco in Ecuador.jpg|thumb|right|Oil pollution in Lago Agrio, November 2007]]
Texaco and Gulf Oil began operating in the Oriente region of Ecuador in 1964 as a consortium.<ref>Juan Forero [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103233560 "Rain Forest Residents, Texaco Face Off In Ecuador"].  NPR, April 30, 2009. Retrieved December 17, 2012</ref> Texaco operated the [[Lago Agrio oil field]] from 1972 to 1993 and the Ecuador state oil company continued to operate the same oil fields after Texaco left. In 1993, Texaco was found responsible for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste and they spent $40m cleaning up the area during the 1990s.  In 1998, the Ecuadorean government signed an agreement with Texaco accepting the clean-up as complete and absolving Texaco of any further responsibility. That same year, an Ecuadorean scientific team took water and soil samples after Texaco left and found petroleum hydrocarbons at unsafe levels in almost half.  The clean up was called "a sham" by critics.{{who|date=March 2015}}<ref name=finally/>

In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Chevron was filed in Ecuadorian court for $28&nbsp;billion by indigenous residents, who accused Texaco of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging {{convert|18|e9USgal|m3}} of [[produced water|formation water]] into the [[Amazon rainforest]] without any [[environmental remediation]].<ref>Bogumil Terminski [http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Bogumil_Terminski-Oil-Induced_Displacement_and_Resettlement_Social_Problem_and_Human_Rights_Issue.pdf "Oil-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Social Problem and Human Rights Issue"].

In April 2015, [[Amazon Watch|AmazonWatch]] released videos reportedly sent from a whistleblower inside Chevron.  The videos purportedly show employees and consultants finding petroleum contamination at sites in the Ecuadorean Amazon that the company claimed was cleaned up years earlier. These videos were confirmed as legitimate by Chevron legal counsel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1815389-letter-showing-chevron-asked-for-videos-back.html|title=Letter Showing Chevron Asked for Videos Back}}</ref> According to the company, the videos show routine testing to establish the perimeter of oil pits.  The company further stated that it is not possible to determine from the videos whether the sites shown are the responsibility of Chevron or its former partner, Petroecuador.  According to Amazon Watch, the videos contain a map confirming that the sites are Chevron's, and contain footage of interviews with villagers known to live in the area for which Chevron is responsible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/10/leaked-videos-suggest-chevron-covering-up-amazon-pollution.html|title=Videos Suggest Cover-up of Amazon pollution – Al Jazeera America}}</ref>

In September 2018, an international tribunal ruled in favor of Chevron Corp finding that Ecuador had violated its obligations under international treaties.  The tribunal held that a $9.5&nbsp;billion pollution judgment by Ecuador's Supreme Court against Chevron "was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on claims that had been already settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier."  Ecuador's attorney general plans to appeal the tribunal's ruling saying, "It worries us that the tribunal is asking a country to lift a sentence of one of its courts that was issued as part of a dispute between private parties."<ref>{{cite news |title=International tribunal rules in favor of Chevron in Ecuador case |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chevron-ecuador/international-tribunal-rules-in-favor-of-chevron-in-ecuador-case-idUSKCN1LN1WS |newspaper=Reuters |access-date=September 21, 2018|date=September 7, 2018 }}</ref>

Chevron continues to take oil from the Amazon region at large. El Segundo (CA), Pascagoula (MS), and Richmond (CA) refineries all process Amazonian oil.

Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries. Major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs. Because no other companies were willing to place large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format NiMH battery technology for automobiles. Boschert concludes that "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline.

===''KS Endeavor'' explosion===
The ''KS Endeavor'' [[jackup rig]] exploded on January 16, 2012, while drilling an exploration well for Chevron in the Funiwa field in Nigeria.  The explosion resulted in the death of two of the 154 workers on board and a fire that burned for 46 days before the well was sealed on June 18. According to a Reuters news report, workers on the KS Endeavor were ignored by Chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing from the drilling borehole.  A senior worker said the blowout was triggered by a massive build-up of pressure.  A witness said that rig engineers advised Chevron to stop drilling and evacuate staff but Chevron told them to continue with drilling. Expecting an explosion, the rig manager, one of the two that later died, kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use.  A witness reported: "This is the reason so many of us survived because we were all aware that it was going to happen, but just didn't know when."
In an email response to Reuters, Chevron said it did not receive requests to evacuate the rig and that staff on board had the right to call a halt to work if they believed conditions were unsafe.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/11/us-chevron-nigeria-idUSBRE86A0OP20120711 | work=Reuters | title=Exclusive: Riggers sought evacuation before deadly Chevron blast | date=July 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name=upstream170112>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Upstream (newspaper)|Upstream Online]]|publisher=[[NHST Media Group]]|title=Chevron prepares to drill Nigeria relief well|url=http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article298359.ece|first=Kathrine|last=Schmidt|date=January 17, 2012|access-date=January 24, 2012|id={{subscription required}}}}</ref>

===Polish gas exploration===
Chevron has experienced protests aimed at the company by local communities in Southern [[Poland]] when they started gas exploration in the region. Their complaint is that Chevron didn't provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in Poland, and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders. The landholders of the region view Chevron's presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region.  As well, potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers.  Another of the residents' primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking. In response to some of the protests, Chevron has sued some of the protesters from [[Żurawlów]] for disrupting their operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,14910068,Blokuja_badania_ws__lupkow__Chevron_pozywa_mieszkancow.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160357/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1%2C114883%2C14910068%2CBlokuja_badania_ws__lupkow__Chevron_pozywa_mieszkancow.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015|title=Blokuj badania ws. ³upków?

According to gas and oil expert Andrzej Szczesniak, one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between Polish and American law. In the USA property owners typically receive 15–20% from the income of gas exploration.  In Poland, the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property, with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue. This is the result of outdated, Communist Era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if they can get a 'kick back' from a larger company.<ref>Polish TVP interview and material about gas exploration in Poland, first broadcast in Wiadomosci, on November 7, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eko-unia.org.pl/ekounia/index.php/de/strona-glowna/lupki/wiadomosci/765-przez-upki-premier-tusk-moe-straci-dziak|title=Przez łupki premier Tusk może stracić działkę|access-date=September 20, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403174306/http://www.eko-unia.org.pl/ekounia/index.php/de/strona-glowna/lupki/wiadomosci/765-przez-upki-premier-tusk-moe-straci-dziak|archive-date=April 3, 2015}}</ref>

===Argentina agreement and protests===
After the 2012 decision of the Argentine government to regain control of the biggest oil company of the country, [[YPF]], the search for foreign investors for exploitation of unconventional oil started. Finally in 2013, YPF and Chevron signed an agreement for the [[Vaca Muerta oil field]], the world's second-largest shale gas deposit. In August 2013, the Congress of Neuquén province approved the agreement, while between 5,000<ref name="csmonitor.com">{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2013/0903/Protests-against-Chevron-highlight-Argentine-energy-woes |title=Protests against Chevron highlight Argentine energy woes - CSMonitor.com |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=September 3, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-227831-2013-08-29.html|title=Página/12 :: Economía :: Balas, gases y represión|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> and 10,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Masiva-Neuquen-acuerdo-Vaca-Muerta_0_983901657.html|title=Masiva marcha en Neuquén en contra del acuerdo por Vaca Muerta|work=Clarin.com|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> workers, students and indigenous people protested outside the legislature.

===Public Eye Lifetime Award===
In 2015, Chevron received the ''Lifetime Award'' of the [[Public Eye on Davos]] for what the sponsors called Chevron's responsibility for environmental disaster in the Amazon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publiceye.ch/case/chevron/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104061134/http://publiceye.ch/case/chevron/ |archive-date=November 4, 2015 |title=Public Eye Awards |website=publiceye.ch |publisher=Public Eye |access-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The same group cited the company in 2006 in the category "Environment" for oil soiling in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonas]] in Ecuador.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publiceye.ch/en/media/press-release/the_public_eye_awards_2006_go_to_chevron_disney_and_citigroup/ |title=''The Public Eye Awards 2006'' go to Chevron, Disney and Citigroup |date=January 25, 2006 |website=publiceye.ch |publisher=Public Eye |access-date=March 27, 2017}}</ref> A Chevron spokesperson commented that the award was "nothing more than a stunt to distract attention from the fact that the lawsuit against Chevron in Ecuador has been proven to be meritless and the product of unprecedented fraud" and pointed to a U.S. court finding that the plaintiff's lawyers had committed "mail and wire fraud, money laundering, witness tampering and obstruction of justice."

===Global warming===
In a letter Chevron Corp. argued that under current disclosure rules companies are already required to disclose material risks including climate-change risk, during part of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s consultation process, noting that its "2015 [[Form 10-K]] included a significant discussion of the potential risks of additional [[greenhouse gas]] emissions [[delegated legislation|regulation]] following the outcome of the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Accord]]."<ref>{{cite news |author=Elena Cherney |title=Companies Might Have to Disclose Their Carbon-Related Risks; New regulations could require firms to disclose risks tied to climate change |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-might-have-to-disclose-their-carbon-related-risks-1473820113 |newspaper=[[WSJ]] |date=September 13, 2016 |access-date=September 27, 2016}}</ref>

Chevron was found to have contributed 43.35bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent since 1965 in an analysis made by the Climate Accountability Institute.<ref>{{cite news |author=Matthew Taylor and Jonathan Watts |title=Revealed: the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 9, 2019 |access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

== Chevron and computer games ==
In the summer of 1992, [[Maxis]], the creators of [[SimCity]], started a division within their company called Maxis Business Simulations (MBS), which was responsible for making serious professional simulations that looked and played like Maxis games. The first project for MBS was to make a game about an oil refinery for Chevron, eventually named [[SimRefinery]]. Since oil refineries are incredibly complicated process plants, Chevron wanted Maxis to make them a game like SimCity, as a training tool to teach employees at their oil refinery in Richmond, California how the refinery worked. SimRefinery was finished in the fall of 1992 and handed over to Chevron. While Chevron's training specialists praised the game's training effectiveness, SimRefinery did not get widespread use within the company and was eventually discontinued.<ref>https://obscuritory.com/sim/when-simcity-got-serious/</ref> In June 2020, a working copy of SimRefinery was recovered and uploaded to the [[Internet Archive]], giving the public their first chance to play the historic game.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-05|title=SimRefinery recovered|url=https://obscuritory.com/sim/simrefinery-recovered/|access-date=2020-07-14|website=The Obscuritory|language=en-US}}</ref>
