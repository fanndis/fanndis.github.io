Motorola designed and sold [[wireless network]] equipment such as cellular transmission [[base station]]s and signal [[amplifier]]s. Motorola's home and broadcast network products included [[set-top box]]es, [[digital video recorder]]s, and network equipment used to enable video broadcasting, computer telephony, and [[high-definition television]]. Its business and government customers consisted mainly of wireless voice and broadband systems (used to build private networks), and public safety communications systems like [[Project 25|Astro]] and [[Dimetra]]. These businesses (except for [[set-top box|set-top boxes, wireless networks]], and [[cable modem]]s) are now part of Motorola Solutions. Google sold Motorola Home (the former [[General Instrument]] cable businesses) to the [[Arris International|Arris Group]] in December 2012 for US$2.35 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/google-seen-selling-it-mobility-unit-to-lenovo-for-about-3-billion/|title=After Big Bet, Google Is to Sell Motorola Unit|first=Claire Cain Miller and David|last=Gelles|access-date=June 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917005543/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/google-seen-selling-it-mobility-unit-to-lenovo-for-about-3-billion/|archive-date=September 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Motorola's [[Mobile phone|wireless telephone]] handset division was a pioneer in cellular telephones. Also known as the Personal Communication Sector (PCS) prior to 2004, it pioneered the "mobile phone" with [[Motorola DynaTAC|DynaTAC]], "flip phone" with the [[Motorola MicroTAC|MicroTAC]], as well as the "clam phone" with the [[Motorola StarTAC|StarTAC]] in the 1990s. It had staged a resurgence by the 2000s with the [[Motorola Razr|Razr]], but lost market share in the second half of that decade. Later it focused on smartphones using [[Google]]'s open-source [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system. The first phone to use the newest version of Google's open source OS, Android 2.0, was released on November 2, 2009 as the [[Motorola Droid]] (the GSM version launched a month later, in Europe, as the Motorola Milestone).

The handset division (along with cable [[set-top box]]es and [[cable modem]]s divisions, which would later be sold to Arris Group) was later spun off into the independent [[Motorola Mobility]]. On May 22, 2012, [[Google]] CEO [[Larry Page]] announced that Google had closed on its deal to acquire Motorola Mobility.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/weve-acquired-motorola-mobility.html |title=We've acquired Motorola Mobility |publisher=Google Official Blog |access-date=May 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522150027/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/weve-acquired-motorola-mobility.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> On January 29, 2014, Page announced that, pending closure of the deal, Motorola Mobility would be acquired by Hong Kong-based technology company [[Lenovo]] for US$2.91 billion (subject to certain adjustments).<ref>[https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0129.html Lenovo to Acquire Motorola Mobility from Google – Investor Relations – Google] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131073905/http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0129.html |date=January 31, 2014 }}.

==History==
Motorola started in [[Chicago, Illinois]], as '''Galvin Manufacturing Corporation''' (at 847 West Harrison Street)<ref>Mahon, Morgan E. ''A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950'' (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), p.111.</ref> in 1928 when brothers [[Paul Galvin (businessman)|Paul V.]] and Joseph E. Galvin purchased the bankrupt Stewart Battery Company's battery-eliminator plans and manufacturing equipment at auction for $750. Galvin Manufacturing Corporation set up shop in a small section of a rented building. The company had $565 in working capital and five employees. The first week's payroll was $63.

The company's first products were the [[battery eliminator]]s, devices that enabled battery-powered radios to operate on household electricity. Due to advances in radio technology, battery-eliminators soon became obsolete.  Paul Galvin learned that some radio technicians were installing sets in cars, and challenged his engineers to design an inexpensive car radio that could be installed in most vehicles. His team was successful, and Galvin was able to demonstrate a working model of the radio at the June 1930 Radio Manufacturers Association convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He brought home enough orders to keep the company in business.[[File:Motorola Model 50XC (1940).jpg|thumb|Motorola Model 50XC (1940) radio, made of [[Catalin]]]]

Paul Galvin wanted a brand name for Galvin Manufacturing Corporation's new car radio, and created the name “Motorola” by linking "motor" (for motorcar) with "ola" (from [[Victrola]]), which was also a popular ending for many companies at the time, e.g. [[Moviola]], [[Crayola]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The naming origin of Motorola |date=January 25, 2013|work=HighNames.com |access-date=May 16, 2015 |url=http://highnames.com/motorola-naming-origin/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530013925/http://highnames.com/motorola-naming-origin/ |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The company sold its first Motorola branded radio on June 23, 1930, to Herbert C. Wall of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for $30. Wall went on to become one of the first Motorola distributors in the country. The Motorola brand name became so well known that Galvin Manufacturing Corporation later changed its name to Motorola, Inc.<ref>Harry Mark Petrakis, The Founder’s Touch: The Life of Paul Galvin of Motorola (Chicago: McGraw-hill, 1965), 58-93; “Sound in Motion,” Motorola Solutions History, accessed November 5, 2014,</ref>

Galvin Manufacturing Corporation began selling Motorola car-radio receivers to police departments and municipalities in November 1930. The company's first public safety customers (all in the U.S. state of Illinois) included the Village of River Forest, Village of Bellwood Police Department, City of Evanston Police, Illinois State Highway Police, and Cook County (Chicago area) Police with a one-way radio communication.<ref>“Calling All Cars,” Motorola Solutions History, accessed November 5, 2014, http://www.motorolasolutions.com/US-EN/About/Company+Overview/History/Explore+Motorola+Heritage/Calling+All+Cars {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110171348/http://www.motorolasolutions.com/US-EN/About/Company+Overview/History/Explore+Motorola+Heritage/Calling+All+Cars |date=November 10, 2014 }}.</ref>
In the same year, the company built its research and development program with [[Daniel E. Noble|Dan Noble]], a pioneer in [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radio and semiconductor technologies, who joined the company as director of research. The company produced the hand-held [[SCR-536|AM SCR-536]] radio during [[World War II]], which was vital to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] communication. Motorola ranked 94th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>

Motorola went public in 1939,<ref>Motorola Solutions History, “A Legacy of Innovation: Timeline of Motorola History Since 1928.”</ref>  and became Motorola, Inc. in 1947. At that time Motorola's main business was producing and selling televisions and radios.

===Post World War II===
[[File:Motorola Tube Box.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Motorola vacuum tube carton]]
[[File:Motorola television advertisement, 1951.ogg|thumb|An advertisement for Motorola televisions from 1951]]

In October 1946, Motorola communications equipment carried the first calls on [[Illinois Bell]] telephone company's new car [[Mobile radio telephone|radiotelephone]] service in [[Chicago]]. The company began making televisions in 1947, with the model VT-71 with 7-inch [[cathode ray tube]]. In 1952, Motorola opened its first international subsidiary in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada to produce radios and televisions. In 1953, the company established the [[Motorola Foundation]] to support leading universities in the United States.

In 1955, years after Motorola started its research and development laboratory in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], to research new solid-state technology, Motorola introduced the world's first commercial high-power [[germanium]]-based [[transistor]]. The present "batwing" logo was also introduced in 1955 (having been created by award-winning Chicago graphic designer [[Morton Goldsholl]] in late 1954).

Beginning in 1958, with [[Explorer 1]] Motorola provided radio equipment for most [[NASA]] space-flights for decades, including the 1969 Moon landing. A year later it established a subsidiary to conduct licensing and manufacturing for international markets. Motorola created numerous products for use by the government, public safety officials, business installments, and the general public.

In 1960, it introduced the world's first large-screen portable (19-inch), transistorized, cordless television. According to the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th-anniversary edition), Motorola had 14,000 employees worldwide of which at least 5,823 employees in 6 plants were located in Illinois. The company headquarters were at 9401 West Grand Avenue in Franklin Park and it listed TV receivers, stereo hi-fi equipment as the products at this plant made by 1,700 employees. The Communications Division was in Chicago at 4545 West Augusta Blvd. where 2,000 employees made electronic communications equipment. The Military Electronics Division was at 1450 North Cicero Avenue, Chicago where 923 employees made microwave and industrial equipment. Two more Chicago locations were listed at 4900 West Flourney Street and at 650 North Pulaski but no employee count was listed for these. The last plant was listed in Quincy, Illinois at 1400 North 30th Street where 1,200 employees made radio assemblies for both home and automobile.<ref>{{cite book|title=Illinois Manufacturers Directory|publisher=Manufacturers' News|location=[[Chicago]]|date=1962|page=1108}}</ref>

In 1963, it introduced the first rectangular color picture tube. In 1964, the company opened its first Research and development branch outside of the United States, in Israel, under the management of Moses Basin. The modular [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand was introduced in 1967.

In 1969, [[Neil Armstrong]] spoke the famous words "[[Neil Armstrong#First Moon walk|one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind]]" from the [[Moon]] on a Motorola transceiver.<ref name="money.cnn.com">{{cite web | url=https://money.cnn.com/2009/09/28/technology/motorola_google_android.fortune/index.htm | website=[[CNNMoney.com]] | title=Motorola gets in the game | date=September 28, 2009 | first=Jessi | last=Hempel | access-date=May 30, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620081747/http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/28/technology/motorola_google_android.fortune/index.htm | archive-date=June 20, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1973, Motorola introduced its first microprocessor, the 8-bit [[MC6800]], used in automotive, computing and video game applications.<ref>"Motorola: 75 Years of Intelligent Thinking", 2003, page 42</ref> That same year, Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita, the parent company of [[Panasonic]].

In 1976, Motorola moved its headquarters to the Chicago suburb of [[Schaumburg, Illinois]].

In 1980, Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the [[MC68000]], led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]], [[Atari Corp.|Atari]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], and [[Hewlett Packard]].<ref>"Motorola - A Journey Through Time & Technology” pages 75 – 79</ref>

In September 1983, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approved the [[DynaTAC 8000X]] telephone, the world's first commercial cellular device. By 1998, cell phones accounted for two-thirds of Motorola's gross revenue.<ref>John F. Mitchell, Time Magazine Milestones section, July 6, 2009, p.17</ref> The company was also strong in [[semiconductor]] technology, including [[integrated circuits]] used in computers. In particular, it is known for the [[Motorola 6800 family|6800 family]] and [[Motorola 68000 family|68000 family]] of [[microprocessor]]s and related peripheral ICs; the processors were used in [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]], and [[Apple Macintosh]] personal computers and in the early [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[laser printer]]s, and some 6800-family peripheral devices were used in the [[IBM PC]] series of personal computers.<ref>These include the MC6845 CRT Controller&mdash;used in the MDA and CGA adapters and the PCjr and emulated in the EGA, MCGA, and VGA&mdash;and the MC146818 real-time clock in the IBM AT.</ref> The [[PowerPC]] family was developed with [[International Business Machines|IBM]] and in a partnership with Apple (known as the [[AIM alliance]]). Motorola also has a diverse line of communication products, including [[satellite]] systems, [[Digital data|digital]] [[cable television|cable]] boxes and [[modems]].

In 1986, Motorola invented the [[Six Sigma]] quality improvement process. This became a global standard. In 1990 [[General Instrument Corporation]], which was later acquired by Motorola, proposed the first all-digital [[High-definition television|HDTV]] standard. In the same year, the company introduced the Bravo numeric pager which became the world's best-selling pager.

In 1991, Motorola demonstrated the world's first working-prototype digital cellular system and phones using [[GSM]] standard in [[Hanover]], Germany. In 1994, Motorola introduced the world's first commercial digital radio system that combined paging, data and cellular communications and voice dispatch in a single radio network and handset. In 1995, Motorola introduced the world's first two-way [[pager]] which allowed users to receive text messages and e-mail and reply with a standard response.

In 1995, Motorola introduced the two-way pager.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1997, to optimize cell phone production with room for future growth, production was moved from Arlington Heights, Illinois to the new giant factory in Harvard, Illinois. Later with Motorola losing market share, phone assembly was moved to Fort Worth, Texas. closing the Harvard facility.

In 1998, Motorola was overtaken by [[Nokia]] as the world's biggest seller of mobile phone handsets.<ref name="money.cnn.com"/>

On September 15, 1999, Motorola announced it would buy [[General Instrument]] in an $11-billion stock swap. General Instrument had long been the No. 1 cable TV equipment provider, supplying cable operators with end-to-end hybrid fiber coax cable solutions. This meant that GI offers all cable TV transmission network components from the head-end to the fiber optic transmission nodes to the cable set-top boxes and cable modems, now at the availability of Motorola.  GI's acquisition created the Broadband Communications Sector (BCS).

In 1999, Motorola separated a portion of its semiconductor business—the Semiconductor Components Group (SCG)-- and formed [[ON Semiconductor]], whose headquarters are located in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web

In June 2000, Motorola and [[Cisco]] supplied the world's first commercial [[GPRS]] cellular network to [[BT Cellnet]] in the United Kingdom. The world's first GPRS cell phone was also developed by Motorola. In August 2000, with recent acquisitions, Motorola reached its peak employment of 150,000 employees worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motorola layoffs|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-06-28/business/0206280288_1_motorola-ceo-christopher-galvin-brian-modoff|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 28, 2002|access-date=January 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109234520/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-06-28/business/0206280288_1_motorola-ceo-christopher-galvin-brian-modoff|archive-date=January 9, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  Two years later, employment would be at 93,000 due to layoffs and spinoffs.

In 2001, Motorola sold the RFID badge reader business to HID.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.securitysales.com/access/hid-acquires-motorolas-indala-rfid-access-control-business1/ |title=HID Acquires Motorola's Indala RFID Access Control Business |date=October 31, 2001 |work=Security Sales & Integration}}</ref> Motorola Solutions would reenter the same market later.

In 2002, Motorola introduced the world's first wireless [[cable modem]] [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] which combined a high-speed cable modem [[router (computing)|router]] with an [[ethernet switch]] and wireless home gateway.

In 2003, Motorola introduced the world's first handset to combine a [[Linux]] [[operating system]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] technology with "full [[PDA]] functionality".

In January 2004, [[Chris Galvin]] - the last descendant of the company founders, exited the company after being ousted from his CEO position and replaced by [[Ed Zander]]. Shortly after, the Galvin family divested their involvement with the company the family founded, selling their stock in Motorola.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/September-2014/What-Happened-to-Motorola/|title=What Happened to Motorola|first=Ted C. |last=Fishman|date=August 25, 2014|website=[[Chicago Magazine]]}}</ref>

In 2004, Motorola divested its whole semiconductor business to form [[Freescale Semiconductor]].

===Motorola, post-split===

The process to split Motorola into successor companies began in 2008, driven by Motorola investor [[Carl Icahn]]. Though the split was originally planned for 2009, it was not actually executed until 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/40897532|title=Motorola to Officially Split into Two Firms Tuesday|date=January 3, 2011|website=www.cnbc.com|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426033944/https://www.cnbc.com/id/40897532|archive-date=April 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2011, Motorola split into two separate companies, each still using the word '''Motorola''' as part of its name. One company, [[Motorola Solutions]] (using a blue version of the Motorola logo), is based in downtown Chicago after moving recently from Schaumburg Il, and concentrates on police technologies, radios, and commercial needs. The other company, [[Motorola Mobility]] (using a red logo and owned by Lenovo), is based in Chicago (formerly at 600 US-45, Libertyville, Illinois), and is the mobile handset producer.  The split was structured so that Motorola Solutions was the legal successor of the original Motorola, while Motorola Mobility was the spin-off. Despite this, the motorola.com [[domain name]] is the website for Motorola Mobility, whereas Motorola Solutions's website is motorolasolutions.com.

2011, Motorola Solutions exited the Cellular Network business selling the Arlington Heights Illinois based division to (at the time) Nokia Siemens Networks for $1.2Billion.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motorola-nokia-idUSTRE66I24P20100719]

On August 15, 2011, Google announced that it would purchase Motorola Mobility for about $12.5 billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/googles-motorola-acquisition-nail-in-the-android-patent-coffin/54967 |title=Google's Motorola acquisition: Nail in the Android patent coffin? |work=ZDNet |access-date=February 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411174440/http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/googles-motorola-acquisition-nail-in-the-android-patent-coffin/54967 |archive-date=April 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On October 30, 2014, Google sold off Motorola Mobility to Lenovo. The purchase price was approximately US$2.91 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including US$1.41 billion paid at close: US $660 million in cash and US$750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (subject to a share cap/floor). The remaining US$1.5 billion was paid in the form of a three-year promissory note.<ref name="Google-Lenovo">{{cite web |url=https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0129.html |title=Lenovo to Acquire Motorola Mobility from Google |access-date=September 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224061637/https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0129.html |archive-date=December 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>
After the purchase, Google maintained ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobility patent portfolio, including current patent applications and invention disclosures, while Lenovo received a license to the portfolio of patents and other intellectual property. Additionally, Lenovo received over 2,000 patent assets, as well as the Motorola Mobility brand and trademark portfolio.<ref name="Google-Lenovo" />

*'''Enterprise Mobility Solutions''': Headquarters was located in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]]; consisted of communications offered to government and public safety sectors and enterprise mobility business. Motorola developed analog and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications products and systems, mobile computing, advanced data capture, wireless infrastructure and RFID solutions to customers worldwide.
*'''Home & Networks Mobility''':  Headquarters was located in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]]; produced end-to-end systems that facilitate uninterrupted access to digital entertainment, information and communications services via wired and wireless mediums. Motorola developed digital video system solutions, interactive set-top devices, voice and data modems for digital subscriber line and cable networks, broadband access systems for cable and satellite television operators, and also wireline carriers and wireless service providers.
*'''Mobile Devices''': Headquarters was located in [[Libertyville, Illinois]]; designs wireless handsets, but also licenses much of its intellectual properties. This includes cellular and wireless systems and as well as integrated applications and [[Bluetooth]] accessories.

==Commercial management==
===Spin-offs===

====Television and radio manufacturing====
In 1974, Motorola divested itself of its television and radio-manufacturing division, which included the [[Quasar (brand)|Quasar]] brand of electronics. This division was acquired by [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], already known under its [[Panasonic]] brand in North America, where it was looking to expand.

====Iridium and Celestri satellite constellations====
{{Main|Iridium Communications}}
Motorola developed the global communication network using a set of 77 satellites. The name iridium was selected as the 77 satellites match the [[atomic number]] of the element [[iridium]].

The business ambitions behind this project and the need to raise venture capital to fund the project led to the creation of the '''Iridium company''' in the late 1990s. While the technology was proven to work, Iridium failed to attract sufficient customers and it filed for bankruptcy in 1999. Obligations to Motorola and loss of expected revenue caused Motorola to divest the [[ON Semiconductor|ON Semiconductor (ONNN)]] business August 4, 1999, raising about $1.1&nbsp;billion. Motorola manufactured two [[satellite phone]] handsets for this network – the 9500 and 9505 as well as transceiver units. Some of these are still in production by an OEM but sold under the Iridium brand.

With the bankruptcy of Iridium, the fact Iridium was setup as an independent company and was not a part of Motorola. With this, a court found Motorola not liable to the people that tried to put Motorola "on the hook" for liabilities in the bankruptcy.

The Iridium communications network is still up and running owned by the company Iridium Communications Inc.

Motorola attempted to follow the Iridium system with an envisioned [[Celestri]] constellation, to offer global, broadband "Internet in the sky" services. However, this effort was not successful, and the Celestri system was never built.

====Government and defense====
Due to declines in business in 2000 and 2001, Motorola spun off its government and defense business to [[General Dynamics]]. The business deal closed in September 2001. Thus GD Decision Systems was formed (and later merged with General Dynamics C4 Systems) from Motorola's Integrated Information Systems Group.

====Semiconductor====
On August 4, 1999, Motorola, Inc.'s Semiconductor Components Group, manufacturing Motorola's discrete, standard analog and standard logic devices was spun off, recapitalized and established as an independent company named [[ON Semiconductor]].  The new company began trading on the [[NASDAQ]] on April of the following year.

On October 16, 2004, Motorola announced that it would spin off its Semiconductor Products Sector into a separate company called [[Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.]]. The new company began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on July 16 of the following year.

On December 7, 2015, Freescale Inc. was sold to [[NXP Semiconductor]], a former [[Philips]] semiconductors European company.<ref>Dana Mattioli and Gillian Tan, Wall Street Journal.

====Automotive====
On January 29, 1988, Motorola sold its [[Arcade (village), New York|Arcade, New York]] facility and automotive alternators, electromechanical speedometers and tachometers products to [[Prestolite Electric]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Detailed History|url=http://www.prestolite.com/pgs_about/about_us_timeline.php|publisher=Prestolite Electric Inc|access-date=June 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323140651/http://www.prestolite.com/pgs_about/about_us_timeline.php|archive-date=March 23, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2006, Motorola completed the sale of its automotive business to [[Continental AG]]. Motorola's automotive unit had annual sales of $1.6&nbsp;billion (€1.33&nbsp;billion) and employed 4,504. The division's products included [[telematics]] systems - like GM's OnStar used for vehicle navigation and safety services, engine and transmission control electronics, vehicle control, electronics and sensors used in steering, braking, and power doors and [[power window]]s.

====Biometrics====
In 2000, Motorola acquired Printrak International Inc.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/printrak-a-motorola-company "Printrak a Motorola Company"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117192109/http://www.answers.com/topic/printrak-a-motorola-company |date=January 17, 2012 }} answers.com.

====Split====
On March 26, 2008, Motorola's board of directors approved a split into two different publicly traded companies. This came after talk of selling the handset division to another corporation. These new companies would be the business units of the current [[Motorola Mobile Devices]] and Motorola Broadband & Mobility Solutions. Originally it was expected that this action would be approved by regulatory bodies and complete by mid-2009, but the split was delayed due to company restructuring problems and the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008–2009 extreme economic downturn]].<ref>Reardon, M.: [http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10078987-94.html "As losses return, Motorola delays its split"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805225536/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10078987-94.html |date=August 5, 2009 }}, "CNET News", October 30, 2008.

The official split occurred at around 12:00&nbsp;pm EST on January 4, 2011. The two new companies are called [[Motorola Mobility]] (presently a Subsidiary of [[Lenovo]]; cell phone and cable television equipment company) and [[Motorola Solutions]] ({{New York Stock Exchange|MSI}}; Government and Enterprise Business). Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola, Inc., as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off.<ref name="google1"/> Motorola Solutions retains Motorola, Inc.'s pre-2011 stock price history, though it retired the old ticker symbol of "MOT" in favor of "MSI."

=====Motorola Mobility deal by Google=====
On August 15, 2011, seven months after Motorola Mobility was spun off into an independent company, [[Google]] announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5&nbsp;billion,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/google-agrees-to-acquire-motorola-mobility/2011/08/15/gIQABmTkGJ_blog.html |title=Google agrees to acquire Motorola Mobility |author=Tsukayama, Hayley |date=August 15, 2011 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113035358/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/google-agrees-to-acquire-motorola-mobility/2011/08/15/gIQABmTkGJ_blog.html |archive-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://investor.google.com/releases/2011/0815.html |title=Google to Acquire Motorola Mobility |date=August 15, 2011 |publisher=[[Google]] |access-date=August 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817101741/http://investor.google.com/releases/2011/0815.html |archive-date=August 17, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe.

According to the filing, Google senior vice president Andy Rubin first reached out to [[Motorola Mobility]] in early July 2011 to discuss the purchase by some of Google's competitors of the patent portfolio of Nortel Networks Corp., and to assess its potential impact on the Android ecosystem.

Google boosted its offer for Motorola Mobility by 33% in a single day in early August, even though Motorola wasn't soliciting competing bids. The aggressive bidding by Google showed that<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/09/14/google-outbid-itself-by-33-percent-in-motorola-mobility-acquisit/|title=Google outbid itself by 33 percent in Motorola Mobility acquisition, SEC filing reveals|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> the search engine company was under considerable pressure to beef up its patent portfolio to protect its promising Android franchise from a growing number of legal challenges.

According to the filing, Google and Motorola began discussions about Motorola's patent portfolio in early July, as well as the "intellectual property litigation and the potential impact of such litigation on the Android ecosystem".

Although the two companies discussed the possibility of an acquisition after the initial contact by Mr. Rubin, it was only after Motorola pushed back on the idea of patent sale that the acquisition talks picked up steam.

The turning point came during a meeting on July 6. At the meeting, Motorola Mobility CEO [[Sanjay Jha (businessman)|Sanjay Jha]] discussed the protection of the Android ecosystem with Google senior vice president [[Nikesh Arora]], and during that talk Jha told Arora that "it could be problematic for Motorola Mobility to continue to exist as a stand-alone entity if it sold a large portion of its patent portfolio".

In connection with these discussions, the two companies signed a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement that allowed Google to do due diligence on the company's patent portfolio.

On July 21 and 23, Jha met with Arora and Rubin to discuss strategic options between the two companies, agreeing to continue to discuss a potential sale.

===Environmental record===
Motorola, Inc., along with the Arizona Water Co. has been identified as the sources of [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) contamination that took place in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. The malfunction led to a ban on the use of water that lasted three days and affected almost 5000 people in the area. Motorola was found to be the main source of the TCE, an industrial solvent that can cause cancer. The TCE contamination was caused by a faulty blower on an air stripping tower that was used to take TCE from the water, and Motorola has attributed the situation to operator error.<ref>{{cite news |last=Balazs |first=Diana |url=https://azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/05/09/20080509sr-pvwater0510-ON.html |title=Companies trying to prevent PV water pollution |work=The Arizona Republic |date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>
