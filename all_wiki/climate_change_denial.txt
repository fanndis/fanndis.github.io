Since the late 1970s, [[Petroleum industry|oil companies]] have [[ExxonMobil climate change controversy|published research]] broadly in line with the standard views on global warming.  Despite this, oil companies organized  a climate change denial campaign to disseminate public disinformation for several decades, a strategy that has been compared to the [[Tobacco industry playbook|organized denial of the hazards of tobacco smoking]] by the [[tobacco industry]], and often even carried out by the same individuals who previously spread the tobacco industry's denialist propaganda.<ref name="NYT-20151105"/><ref name="TG-20150708"/><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/28/shell-knew-oil-giants-1991-film-warned-climate-change-danger 'Shell knew': oil giant's 1991 film warned of climate change danger], ''The Guardian''</ref>

This allowed them to question climate science and climate policies based on it and to promote political inaction and inertia. …. footnote 1. I shall use "climate sceptics" here in the sense of "climate deniers", although there are obvious differences between scepticism and denial (see Shermer, 2010; Kemp, et al., 2010).

The terminology emerged in the 1990s. Even though all scientists adhere to [[scientific skepticism]] as an inherent part of the process, by mid November 1995 the word "skeptic" was being used specifically for the minority who publicized views contrary to the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]].

Implicit denial occurs when people who accept the scientific community's consensus on the answers to the central questions of climate change on the intellectual level fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action.

In December 2014, an open letter from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] called on the media to stop using the term "skepticism" when referring to climate change denial. They contrasted scientific skepticism—which is "foundational to the scientific method"—with denial—"the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration"—and the behavior of those involved in political attempts to undermine climate science.

The executive director of the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] said that while there was reasonable skepticism about specific issues, she felt that denier was "the most accurate term when someone claims there is no such thing as global warming, or agrees that it exists but denies that it has any cause we could understand or any impact that could be measured."<ref name="MMfA 20150622">{{cite web | title=NY Times Public Editor: We're "Moving In A Good Direction" On Properly Describing Climate Deniers | website=Media Matters for America | date=22 June 2015 | url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/06/22/ny-times-public-editor-were-moving-in-a-good-di/204089 | access-date=2 July 2015}}</ref>

In response to increasing public awareness of the greenhouse effect in the 1970s, conservative reaction built up, denying environmental concerns which could lead to government regulation. With the 1981 [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]], global warming became a political issue, with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research, particularly climate-related, and stop funding for {{co2}} monitoring. Reagan appointed as [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[James B. Edwards]], who said that there was no real global warming problem. Congressman [[Al Gore]] had studied under Revelle and was aware of the developing science: he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from 1981 onwards, with testimony by scientists including Revelle, [[Stephen Schneider]] and [[Wallace Smith Broecker]]. The hearings gained enough public attention to reduce the cuts in atmospheric research.<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Govt.htm#S7 Global Warming Becomes a Political Issue (1980–1983)]; "In 1981, Ronald Reagan took the presidency with an administration that openly scorned their concerns. He brought with him a backlash that had been building against the environmental movement. Many conservatives denied nearly every environmental worry, global warming included. They lumped all such concerns together as the rants of business-hating liberals, a Trojan Horse for government regulation." For details, see [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Kfunds.htm#M_29_ Money for Keeling: Monitoring CO2]</ref> A polarized party-political debate developed. In 1982 [[Sherwood B. Idso]] published his book ''Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe?'' which said increases in {{co2}} would not warm the planet, but would fertilize crops and were "something to be encouraged and not suppressed", while complaining that his theories had been rejected by the "scientific establishment". An [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report in 1983 said global warming was "not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years", with potentially "catastrophic" consequences.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qX8yCpETS-IC&pg=PA141|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 30 June 2009|isbn = 978-0-674-04497-5|first = Spencer R.|last = Weart}}</ref> The Reagan administration reacted by calling the report "alarmist", and the dispute got wide news coverage. Public attention turned to other issues, then the 1985 finding of a polar [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] brought a swift international response.

The timing was right, and the media leaped on the story. Hansen's statements, especially that severe warming was likely within the next 50 years, got on the front pages of newspapers and were featured in television news and radio talk shows…. The story grew as the summer of 1988 wore on. Reporters descended unexpectedly upon an international conference of scientists held in Toronto at the end of June. Their stories prominently reported how the world's leading climate scientists declared that atmospheric changes were already causing harm, and might cause much more; the scientists called for vigorous government action to restrict greenhouse gases."</ref> These facts encouraged discussion about new laws concerning environmental regulation, which was opposed by the fossil fuel industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Environmentalist organizations continued… lobbying and advertising efforts to argue for restrictions on emissions. The environmentalists were opposed and greatly outspent, by industries that produced or relied on fossil fuels. Industry groups not only mounted a sustained and professional public relations effort but also channeled considerable sums of money to individual scientists and small conservative organizations and publications that denied any need to act against global warming."</ref>

From 1989 onwards industry-funded organisations including the [[Global Climate Coalition]] and the [[George C. Marshall Institute]] sought to spread doubt among the public, in a strategy already developed by the tobacco industry.<ref name="tobacco-approach" /><ref name="marshall">{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "The technical criticism most widely noted in the press came in several brief "reports"—not scientific papers in the usual sense—published between 1989 and 1992 by the conservative George C. Marshall Institute. The anonymously authored pamphlets … [claimed] that proposed government regulation would be "extraordinarily costly to the U.S. economy," they insisted it would be unwise to act on the basis of the existing global warming theories … In 1989 some of the biggest corporations in the petroleum, automotive, and other industries created a Global Climate Coalition, whose mission was to disparage every call for action against global warming."</ref><ref name="tobacco-docs">{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}: "Millions of pages of documents released during tobacco litigation … show the crucial role that scientists played in sowing doubt about the links between smoking and health risks. These documents … also show that the same strategy was applied not only to global warming, but to a laundry list of environmental and health concerns, including asbestos, secondhand smoke, acid rain, and the ozone hole."</ref> A small group of scientists opposed to the consensus on global warming became politically involved, and with support from conservative political interests, began publishing in books and the press rather than in scientific journals.<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Scientists noticed something that the public largely overlooked: the most outspoken scientific critiques of global warming predictions did not appear in the standard peer-reviewed scientific publications. The critiques tended to appear in venues funded by industrial groups, or in conservative media like the Wall Street Journal."</ref> This small group of scientists included some of the same people that were part of the strategy already tried by the tobacco industry.<ref name="merchants of doubt"/> [[Spencer Weart]] identifies this period as the point where legitimate skepticism about basic aspects of climate science was no longer justified, and those spreading mistrust about these issues became deniers.<ref name="Weart p46">{{harvnb|Weart|2011|p=46}}: "Scientists continually test their beliefs, seeking out all possible contrary arguments and evidence, and finally publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, where further attempts at refutation are encouraged. But the small group of scientists who opposed the consensus on warming proceeded in the manner of lawyers, considering nothing that would not bolster their case, and publishing mostly in pamphlets, books, and newspapers supported by conservative interests. At some point they were no longer skeptics—people who would try to see every side of a case—but deniers, that is, people whose only interest was in casting doubt upon what other scientists agreed was true."</ref> As their arguments were increasingly refuted by the scientific community and new data, deniers turned to political arguments, making personal attacks on the reputation of scientists, and promoting ideas of a [[Global warming conspiracy theory|global warming conspiracy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2011|pp=47}}: "As the deniers found ever less scientific ground to stand on, they turned to political arguments. Some of these policy arguments were straightforward, raising serious questions about the efficacy and expense of proposed carbon taxes and emission-regulation schemes. But leading deniers also resorted toad hominem tactics… On each side, some people were coming to believe that they faced a dishonest conspiracy, driven by ideological bias and naked self-interest"</ref>

With the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 fall of communism]] and the [[environmental movement]]'s international reach at the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio Earth Summit]], the attention of [[Conservatism in the United States#Think tanks and foundations|U.S. conservative think tanks]], which had been organised in the 1970s as an intellectual counter-movement to socialism, turned from the "red scare" to the "green scare" which they saw as a threat to their aims of private property, free trade market economies and global capitalism. As a counter-movement, they used [[environmental skepticism]] to promote denial of the reality of problems such as loss of [[biodiversity]] and climate change.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|pp=349–385}}: "Environmental skepticism encompasses several themes, but denial of the authenticity of environmental problems, particularly problems such as [[biodiversity loss]] or climate change that threaten ecological sustainability, is its defining feature"</ref>

In 1992, an EPA report linked [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] with lung cancer. The tobacco industry engaged the [[APCO Worldwide]] public relations company, which set out a strategy of [[astroturfing]] campaigns to cast doubt on the science by linking smoking anxieties with other issues, including global warming, in order to turn public opinion against calls for government intervention. The campaign depicted public concerns as "unfounded fears" supposedly based only on "junk science" in contrast to their "sound science", and operated through [[front organization|front groups]], primarily the [[Advancement of Sound Science Center]] (TASSC) and its Junk Science website, run by [[Steven Milloy]]. A tobacco company memo commented "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy." During the 1990s, the tobacco campaign died away, and TASSC began taking funding from oil companies including Exxon. Its website became central in distributing "almost every kind of climate-change denial that has found its way into the popular press."<ref name="requiem">{{harv|Hamilton|2011|pp=104–106}}: "the tactics, personnel, and organisations mobilised to serve the interests of the tobacco lobby in the 1980s were seamlessly transferred to serve the interests of the fossil-fuel lobby in the 1990s. [[Frederick Seitz]] … the task of the climate sceptics in the think tanks and PR companies hired by fossil fuel companies was to engage in 'consciousness lowering activities', to 'de-problematise' global warming by describing it as a form of politically driven panicmongering."

In the 1990s, the Marshall Institute began campaigning against increased regulations on environmental issues such as [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], second-hand smoke, and the dangers of [[DDT]].<ref name="marshall" /><ref name="requiem" /><ref name="merchants of doubt">{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}</ref> In each case their argument was that the science was too uncertain to justify any government intervention, a strategy it borrowed from earlier efforts to downplay the health effects of tobacco in the 1980s.<ref name="tobacco-approach" /><ref name="tobacco-docs" /> This campaign would continue for the next two decades.<ref>{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010|p=105}}: "As recently as 2007, the George Marshall Institute continued to insist that the damages associated with acid rain were always "largely hypothetical," and that "further scientific investigation revealed that most of them were not in fact occurring." The Institute cited no studies to support this extraordinary claim."</ref>

These efforts succeeded in influencing public perception of climate science.<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Public support for environmental concerns, in general, seems to have waned after 1988."</ref> Between 1988 and the 1990s, public discourse shifted from the science and data of climate change to discussion of politics and surrounding controversy.<ref>{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "A study of American media found that in 1987 most items that mentioned the greenhouse effect had been feature stories about the science, whereas in 1988 the majority of the stories addressed the politics of the controversy.

The campaign to spread doubt continued into the 1990s, including an advertising campaign funded by [[coal industry]] advocates intended to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact,"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|title=Pro-Coal Ad Campaign Disputes Warming Idea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/08/business/pro-coal-ad-campaign-disputes-warming-idea.html|access-date=1 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 1991}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "Individual companies and industry associations—representing petroleum, steel, autos, and utilities, for instance—formed lobbying groups … [the Information Council on the Environment's] game plan called for enlisting greenhouse doubters to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact," and to sow doubt about climate research just as cigarette makers had about smoking research … The coal industry's Western Fuels Association paid Michaels to produce a newsletter called World Climate Report, which has regularly trashed mainstream climate science."</ref> and a 1998 proposal written by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] intending to recruit scientists to convince politicians, the media and the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant environmental regulation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Environmental Communication and the Public Sphere |publisher=Sage |pages=311–312 |quote=to recruit a cadre of scientists who share the industry's views of climate science and to train them in public relations so they can help convince journalists, politicians and the public that the risk of global warming is too uncertain to justify controls on greenhouse gases}}</ref> The proposal included a [[US$]]&nbsp;5,000,000 multi-point strategy to "maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours on [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], the media and other key audiences", with a goal of "raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing scientific wisdom'".<ref>Cushman, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/26/us/industrial-group-plans-to-battle-climate-treaty.html?scp=2&sq=climate%20science%20and%20to%20train%20them%20&st=cse&pagewanted=print "Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty"], ''The New York Times'', 25 April 1998.

Quote:  Russell S. Vose, chief of the climate science division at NOAA's Asheville center, pointed out in an interview that while the corrections do eliminate the recent warming slowdown, the overall effect of the agency's adjustments has long been to raise the reported global temperatures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by a substantial margin. That makes the temperature increase of the past century appear less severe than it does in the raw data. If you just wanted to release to the American public our uncorrected data set, it would say that the world has warmed up about 2.071 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880," Dr. Vose said. "Our corrected data set says things have warmed up about 1.65 degrees Fahrenheit. Our corrections lower the rate of warming on a global scale."</ref>]] -->

Some climate change denial groups say that because {{CO2}} is only a trace gas in the atmosphere (roughly 400ppm, or 0.04%, 4 parts per 10,000) it can only have a minor effect on the climate. Scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect, and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase.<ref name="trace">{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas, so changes in CO2 are irrelevant."</ref> The scientific consensus, as summarized by the [[IPCC fourth assessment report]], the U.S. Geological Survey, and other reports, is that human activity is the leading cause of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels accounts for around 30 billion tons of {{CO2}} each year, which is 130 times the amount produced by volcanoes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: " According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually—more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce."</ref> Some groups allege that water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas, and is left out of many climate models.<ref name="trace" /> While water vapor is a [[greenhouse gas]], the very short atmospheric lifetime of water vapor (about 10 days) compared that of {{CO2}} (hundreds of years) means that  {{CO2}} is the primary driver of increasing temperatures; water vapour acts as a feedback, not [[Radiative forcing|a forcing]], mechanism.<ref>{{cite blog|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/|title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing?|date=6 April 2005|website=RealClimate|first=David|last=Archer|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> Water vapor has been incorporated into climate models since their inception in the late 1800s.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate… Nevertheless, within this dynamic, the CO2 remains the main driver… of the greenhouse effect."</ref>

Climate denial groups may also argue that global warming stopped recently, a [[global warming hiatus]], or that global temperatures are actually decreasing, leading to [[global cooling]]. These arguments are based on short term fluctuations, and ignore the long term pattern of warming.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 3: Global warming stopped a decade ago; Earth has been cooling since then."</ref>

These groups often point to natural variability, such as sunspots and cosmic rays, to explain the warming trend.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too."</ref> According to these groups, there is natural variability that will abate over time, and human influences have little to do with it. These factors are already taken into account when developing climate models, and the scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the observed warming trend.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures."</ref>

At a May 2018 meeting of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]], Alabama's Representative [[Mo Brooks]] claimed that sea level rise is caused not by melting glaciers but rather by coastal erosion and silt that flows from rivers into the ocean.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Scott|title=Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise|access-date=17 May 2018|publisher=Science|date=17 May 2018}}</ref>

Climate change denial literature often features the suggestion that we should wait for better technologies before addressing climate change, when they will be more affordable and effective.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 7: [[Technological fix]]es, such as inventing energy sources that don't produce CO2 or geoengineering the climate, would be more affordable, prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint."</ref>

=== Conspiracy theories ===

Global warming conspiracy theories have been posited which allege that the scientific consensus is illusory, or that climatologists are acting on their own financial interests by causing undue alarm about a changing climate.<ref>{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 5: Climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data.

In 2004 [[Stefan Rahmstorf]] described how the media give the misleading impression that climate change was still disputed within the scientific community, attributing this impression to PR efforts of climate change skeptics. He identified different positions argued by climate skeptics, which he used as a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of climate change skepticism:<ref name="Rahmstorf 2004">Rahmstorf, S., 2004, [http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Other/rahmstorf_climate_sceptics_2004.pdf The climate sceptics: Weather Catastrophes and Climate Change—Is There Still Hope For Us?] (Munich: PG Verlag) pp 76–83 [note: numbering not shown in original]</ref> Later the model was also applied on denial.<ref name="auto"/>

A few of them even deny that the rise in the atmospheric {{CO2}} content is anthropogenic [while others argue that] additional {{CO2}} does not lead to discernible warming [and] that there must be other—natural—causes for warming.

The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems.<ref name="ncse-pillars">{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2010}}: "The first pillar of climate change denial—that climate change is bad science—attacks various aspects of the scientific consensus about climate change … there are climate change deniers:

A study assessed the public perception and actions to climate change, on grounds of belief systems, and identified seven psychological barriers affecting the behavior that otherwise would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental stewardship. The author found the following barriers: cognition, ideological world views, comparisons to key people, costs and momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and inadequate behavioral changes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The dragons of inaction: psychological barriers that limit climate change mitigation and adaptation|year=2011|author=Gifford R.|s2cid=8356816|journal=Am Psychol|doi=10.1037/a0023566|pmid=21553954|volume=66|issue=4|pages=290–302}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lejano|first=Raul P.|date=2019-09-16|title=Ideology and the Narrative of Climate Skepticism|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=100|issue=12|pages=ES415–ES421|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0327.1|bibcode=2019BAMS..100S.415L|issn=0003-0007|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Responding to climate denial - the role of emotions and persuasive argument ===
An [[The Irish Times|Irish Times]] article notes that climate denial "is not simply overcome by reasoned argument," because it is not a rational response. Attempting to overcome denial using techniques of persuasive argument, such as supplying a missing piece of information, or providing general scientific education may be ineffective. A person who is in denial about climate is most likely taking a position based on their feelings, especially their feelings about things they fear.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/parenting/how-to-turn-climate-change-denial-into-acceptance-and-action-1.4058069|title=How to turn climate-change denial into acceptance and action|last=Sharry|first=John|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>

=== Farmers and climate denial ===
Seeing positive economic results from efforts at climate-friendly agricultural practices, or becoming involved in intergenerational stewardship of a farm may play a role in turning farmers away from denial.

It has been suggested that climate change can conflict with a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] view because it is "unsolvable" at the national level and requires collective action between nations or between local communities, and that therefore populist nationalism tends to reject the science of climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate denial and the populist right|url=https://www.iied.org/climate-denial-populist-right|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|access-date=4 March 2017|date=15 November 2016}}</ref>

This approach to downplay the significance of climate change was copied from [[tobacco lobbyists]]; in the face of scientific evidence linking tobacco to [[lung cancer]], to prevent or delay the introduction of regulation. Lobbyists attempted to [[Discrediting tactic|discredit]] the scientific research by creating doubt and manipulating debate.

Former [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] president [[Frederick Seitz]], who, according to an article by Mark Hertsgaard in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', earned about [[US$]]585,000 in the 1970s and 1980s as a consultant to [[R.J.

Marshall Institute alleged to have made efforts to "downplay" global warming. Seitz stated in the 1980s that "Global warming is far more a matter of politics than of climate." Seitz authored the [[Oregon Petition]], a document published jointly by the Marshall Institute and [[Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine]] in opposition to the [[Kyoto protocol]]. The petition and accompanying "Research Review of Global Warming Evidence" claimed:

<blockquote>
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. … We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase. Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed. This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution.<ref name="denial_ind_guardian" />
</blockquote>

George Monbiot wrote in ''The Guardian'' that this petition, which he criticizes as misleading and tied to industry funding, "has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth." Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the eventual rejection of the Kyoto protocol in the US.<ref>{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "The work by McCright and Dunlap has highlighted the effectiveness of organized climate sceptic groups in influencing US policy making in the 1990s and early 2000s, including their central role in the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the US Congress"</ref>

Monbiot has written about another group founded by the tobacco lobby, [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC), that now campaigns against measures to combat global warming. In again trying to [[Astroturfing|manufacture the appearance of a grass-roots movement]] against "unfounded fear" and "over-regulation," Monbiot states that TASSC "has done more damage to the campaign to halt [climate change] than any other body."<ref name="denial_ind_guardian" />

Among papers expressing a position on AGW, an overwhelming percentage (97.2% based on self-ratings, 97.1% based on abstract ratings) endorses the scientific consensus on AGW.|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C |doi-access=free }}</ref> Some organizations promoting climate change denial have asserted that scientists are increasingly rejecting climate change, but this notion is contradicted by [[Surveys of scientists' views on climate change#John Cook et al., 2013|research showing that 97%]] of published papers endorse the scientific consensus, and that percentage is increasing with time.<ref name="Cook" />

Social psychologist Craig Foster compares climate change denialists to flat-earth believers and the reaction to the latter by the scientific community. Foster states, "the potential and kinetic energy devoted to counter the flat-earth movement is wasteful and misguided... I don't understand why anybody would worry about the flat-earth gnat while facing the climate change mammoth... Climate change denial does not require belief. It only requires neglect."<ref name="Foster">{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Craig|title=Flat-Earth Anxieties Reflect Misplaced Priorities|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|year=2018|volume=42|issue=3|pages=10–11}}</ref>

In 2016, Aaron McCright argued that [[anti-environmentalism]]—and climate change denial specifically—has expanded to a point in the US where it has now become "a central tenet of the current [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] identity."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jan/07/era-of-climate-science-denial-is-not-over-study-finds |title=Era of climate science denial is not over, study finds |author=Graham Redfearn |date=7 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian }}</ref>

On the other hand, global oil companies have begun to acknowledge the existence of climate change and its risks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil Company Positions on the Reality and Risk of Climate Change|url=http://www.uwosh.edu/es/climate-change/oil-company-positions-on-the-reality-and-risk-of-climate-change|website=Environmental Studies|publisher=University of Oshkosh—Wisconsin|access-date=27 March 2016}}</ref> Still top oil firms are spending millions lobbying to delay, weaken or block policies to tackle climate change.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report|title=Top oil firms spending millions lobbying to block climate change policies, says report|last=Laville|first=Sandra|date=22 March 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Manufactured climate change denial is also influencing how scientific knowledge is communicated to the public.  According to climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]], "...universities and scientific societies and organizations, publishers, etc.—are too often risk averse when it comes to defending and communicating science that is perceived as threatening by powerful interests..."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_csicon_speaker_michael_mann|title=An Interview with CSICon Speaker Michael Mann |author=Mark Boslough |author-link=Mark Boslough|date=20 October 2017 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/the-real-reason-some-scientists-downplay-the-risks-of-climate-change|title=The real reason scientists downplay the risks of climate change {{!}} Dale Jamieson, Michael Oppenheimer and Naomi Oreskes|last1=Jamieson|first1=Dale|date=25 October 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2019|last2=Oppenheimer|first2=Michael|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Oreskes|first3=Naomi}}</ref>
