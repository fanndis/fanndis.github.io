'''Mississippi''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Mississippi.ogg|ˌ|m|ɪ|s|ᵻ|ˈ|s|ɪ|p|i}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Deep South]] region of the [[United States]]. Mississippi is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|32nd largest]] and [[List of U.S. states by population|34th-most populous]] of the 50 U.S. states. Mississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Mexico]], to the southwest by [[Louisiana]], and to the northwest by [[Arkansas]]. Mississippi's western boundary is largely defined by the [[Mississippi River]]. [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] is both the state's [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and largest city. [[Jackson metropolitan area, Mississippi|Greater Jackson]] is the state's most populous [[Metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan area]], with an estimated population of 580,166 in 2018.

On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|20th state]] admitted to the Union. By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top [[cotton]]-producing state and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved persons]] accounted for 55% of the state population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/161/cotton-in-a-global-economy-mississippi-1800-1860 |title=Cotton in a Global Economy: Mississippi (1800-1860) {{!}} Mississippi History Now|website=mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> Mississippi declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]] on March 23, 1861, and was one of the seven original [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], which constituted the largest slaveholding states in the nation. Following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], it was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=The A to Z of the Civil War and Reconstruction |last=Richter, William L.

Until the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the 1930s, [[African Americans]] were a majority of Mississippi's population. Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the [[civil rights movement]], including the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]] by white students objecting to desegregation, the 1963 assassination of [[Medgar Evers]], and the 1964 [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|Freedom Summer murders]] of three activists working on voting rights. With large areas of agriculture and rural towns, Mississippi frequently ranks low among states in measures of health, education, and development, and high in measures of poverty.<ref name="America's Health Rankings">{{cite web|url=http://www.americashealthrankings.org/MS|title=Mississippi Annual State Health Rankings—2013 |website=americashealthrankings.org|access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statemaster.com/graph/edu_per_of_peo_who_hav_com_hig_sch_inc_equ-completed-high-school-including-equivalency |title=Percent of People Who Have Completed High School (Including Equivalency) statistics—states compared—Statemaster|access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990–2010|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=August 6, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/|title=Sub-national HDI—Subnational HDI—Global Data Lab|website=globaldatalab.org|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> In 2010, 37.3% of Mississippi's population was African American, the [[List of U.S. states and territories by African-American population|highest percentage of any state]].

Mississippi is almost entirely within the [[Gulf Coastal Plain|Gulf coastal plain]], and generally consists of [[Plain|lowland plains]] and low hills. The northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. Mississippi's highest point is [[Woodall Mountain]] at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the [[Cumberland Plateau]]; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] classification.

== Etymology ==
The state's name is derived from the [[Mississippi River]], which flows along and defines its western boundary. European-American settlers named it after the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''misi-ziibi'' ({{Lang-en|Great river}}).

== Geography ==
[[File:Map of Mississippi NA.png|thumb|upright=1.35]]
[[File:Wolf-River-swamp-North-Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Bottomland hardwood swamp near [[Ashland, Mississippi|Ashland]]]]

Mississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by [[Louisiana]] and a narrow coast on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and [[Arkansas]].

In addition to its namesake, major rivers in Mississippi include the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]], the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], the [[Yazoo River]], the [[Pascagoula River]], and the [[Tombigbee River]]. Major lakes include [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], [[Arkabutla Lake|Arkabutla]], [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis]], and [[Grenada Lake|Grenada]], with the largest being Sardis Lake.

Mississippi is entirely composed of [[lowland]]s, the highest point being [[Woodall Mountain]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], {{cvt|807|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest point is sea level at the [[Gulf Coast]]. The state's mean elevation is {{cvt|300|ft|m}} above sea level.

Most of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The [[coastal plain]] is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the [[Fall Line]] Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown [[loess]] soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth uplands, a geology that extend into the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Alabama Black Belt]].

The coastline includes large bays at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow [[Mississippi Sound]], which is partially sheltered by [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois Island]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|East and West Ship Islands]], [[Deer Island (Mississippi)|Deer Island]], [[Round Island (Mississippi)|Round Island]], and [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]].

The northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi |Vicksburg]]. The region has rich soil, partly made up of [[silt]] which had been regularly deposited by the [[Flood plain|flood waters]] of the Mississippi River.

Areas under the management of the [[National Park Service]] include:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ms}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Montgomery County (Mississippi)2.jpg|thumb|[[Montgomery County, Mississippi|Montgomery County]] in autumn]]

Mississippi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with long, hot and humid summers, and short, mild winters. Temperatures average about {{cvt|81|°F}} in July and about {{cvt|42|°F}} in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near [[Mississippi Sound]] is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from {{cvt|-19|°F}}, in 1966, at [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] in the northeast, to {{cvt|115|°F}}, in 1930, at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] in the north. Heavy snowfall rarely occurs, but isn't unheard of, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]]. Yearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in the northwest, gets about {{cvt|50|in}} of precipitation annually and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], in the south, about {{cvt|61|in}}. Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional in the southern part of the state.

The late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the southern part of the state. [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state. Both caused nearly total [[storm surge]] destruction of structures in and around [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].

As in the rest of the [[Deep South]], thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 [[tornado]]es annually; the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year. Two of the five deadliest tornadoes in United States history have occurred in the state. These storms struck [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], in southwest Mississippi (see [[The Great Natchez Tornado]]) and [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], in the northeast corner of the state. About seven F5 tornadoes have been recorded in the state.

===Ecology, flora, and fauna===

[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|Leaving Alabama on I-20/59]]
[[File:Clark creek natural area ms.jpg|thumb|Clark Creek Natural Area, Wilkinson County]]

Mississippi is heavily forested, with over half of the state's area covered by wild or cultivated trees. The southeastern part of the state is dominated by [[longleaf pine]], in both uplands and lowland [[flatwoods]] and [[pitcher plant|Sarracenia]] [[bogs]]. The Mississippi Alluvial Plain, or [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]], is primarily farmland and aquaculture ponds but also has sizeable tracts of [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]], [[Salix nigra|willows]], [[bald cypress]], and [[oak]]s. A belt of [[loess]] extends north to south in the western part of the state, where the Mississippi Alluvial Plain reaches the first hills; this region is characterized by rich, mesic mixed hardwood forests, with some species [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] from Appalachian forests.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Delcourt|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Delcourt|first2=Paul A.|title=The Blufflands: Pleistocene pathway into the Tunica Hills|journal=The American Midland Naturalist|date=1975|volume=94|issue=2|pages=385–400|jstor=2424434|doi=10.2307/2424434}}</ref> Two bands of historical [[prairie]], the [[Jackson Prairie]] and the [[Black Belt in the American South|Black Belt]], run northwest to southeast in the middle and northeastern part of the state. Although these areas have been highly degraded by conversion to agriculture, a few areas remain, consisting of grassland with interspersed woodland of [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern redcedar]], [[oak]]s, [[hickory|hickories]], [[Maclura pomifera|osage-orange]], and [[Celtis|sugarberry]]. The rest of the state, primarily north of [[Interstate 20]] not including the prairie regions, consists of mixed pine-hardwood forest, common species being [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pine]], [[oak]]s (e.g., [[Quercus nigra|water oak]]), [[hickory|hickories]], [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweetgum]], and [[elm]]. Areas along large rivers are commonly inhabited by [[bald cypress]], [[Nyssa aquatica|water tupelo]], [[Planera aquatica|water elm]], and [[Carya aquatica|bitter pecan]]. Commonly cultivated trees include loblolly pine, longleaf pine, [[Quercus pagoda|cherrybark oak]], and cottonwood.

There are approximately 3000 species of [[vascular plants]] known from Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCook|first1=Lucile M.|last2=Kartesz|first2=John|title=A preliminary checklist of the plants of Mississippi|url=http://www.herbarium.olemiss.edu/checklist.html|website=University of Mississippi—Pullen Herbarium|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323092319/http://www.herbarium.olemiss.edu/checklist.html|archive-date=2018-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2018, a project funded by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] aims to update that checklist of plants with museum ([[herbarium]]) [[plant collecting|vouchers]] and create an online [[atlas]] of each species's distribution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnolia grandiFLORA: The digital herbarium for Mississippi|url=http://mississippiplants.org/|website=Magnolia grandiFLORA|publisher=Mississippi Herbarium Consortium|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>

Mississippi also has a rich [[freshwater mussel]] fauna, with about 90 species in the primary family of native mussels ([[Unionidae]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Robert L.|last2=Slack|first2=William T.|last3=Hartfield|first3=Paul D.|title=The freshwater mussels (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Unionidae) of Mississippi|journal=Southeastern Naturalist|date=2005|volume=4|issue=1|pages=77–92|jstor=3878159|doi=10.1656/1528-7092(2005)004[0077:TFMMBU]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> Several of these species were extirpated during the construction of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

===Ecological problems===
====Flooding====

Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile [[floodplain]] in the Mississippi Delta. The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built [[levees]] along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.

From 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.<ref>{{cite book|first=David R. |last=Roediger|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|location=New York|publisher=Verso|year=1999|page=146|isbn=978-1859842409}}</ref> Before the [[American Civil War]], the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.

Flooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth. The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882. Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war.<ref name="John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11">{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880–1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|pages=10–11}}</ref> In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties.

In 1879, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[Mississippi River Commission]], whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees. Both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century. By 1882, levees averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood that year.<ref name="John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11"/> After the 1882 flood, the levee system was expanded. In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties; also included were some counties in [[Arkansas]] which were part of the Delta.<ref name="about the levee">{{cite web|url=http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |title=About the levee: Physical development of a levee system |publisher=Leveeboard.org |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142502/http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |archive-date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>

Flooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912–1913, causing heavy damage to the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although U.S. participation in [[World War I]] interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880–1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|page=50|isbn=978-0313289637}}</ref> Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which broke through the levees. There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington]] and [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] counties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon|date=1999|title=The Final Frontiers|page=70}}</ref>

Even as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.

==History==

{{Main|History of Mississippi}}

Near 10,000 BC [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref name="guy_prentice">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202132723/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |archive-date=December 2, 2007 }}
</ref> Paleo-Indians in the South were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age. In the [[Mississippi Delta]], Native American settlements and agricultural fields were developed on the natural levees, higher ground in the proximity of rivers. The Native Americans developed extensive fields near their permanent villages. Together with other practices, they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole.<ref name="bio">{{cite journal |url=http://southernspaces.org/2010/bioregional-approach-southern-history-yazoo-mississippi-delta |title=Bioregional Approach to Southern History: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta |author=Mikko Saikku |date=January 28, 2010 |journal=Southern Spaces |accessdate=September 9, 2015|doi=10.18737/M7QK5T }}</ref>

After thousands of years, succeeding cultures of the [[Woodland period|Woodland]] and [[Mississippian culture]] eras developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which surplus supported the development of specialized trades. Both were [[Mound builder (people)|mound builder]] cultures. Those of the [[Mississippian culture]] were the largest and most complex, constructed beginning about 950&nbsp;AD. The peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. Their large earthworks, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, still stand throughout the [[Mississippi River Valley|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River Valley|Ohio River]] valleys.

Descendant [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the Mississippian culture in the Southeast include the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]]. Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns) include the [[Natchez people|Natchez]], the [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]], and the [[Biloxi people|Biloxi]].

The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World.

===Colonial era===

{{Main|New France|Louisiana (New France)|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|New Spain|West Florida|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Spanish West Florida}}

In April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at ''[[Fort Maurepas]]'' (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of present-day [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] on the Gulf Coast. It was settled by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]]. In 1716, the French founded [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi River (as ''[[Fort Rosalie]]''); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area. The French called the greater territory "[[Louisiana (New France)|New France]]"; the Spanish continued to claim part of the [[Gulf coast]] area (east of [[Mobile Bay]]) of present-day southern [[Alabama]], in addition to the entire area of present-day [[Florida]].
[[File:Pushmataha high resolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Pushmataha]], Choctaw Principal Chief]]

Through the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), mostly [[multiracial]] descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their [[mixed-race]] children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of ''[[plaçage]]''. With this [[social capital]], the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.

After Great Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec. After the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of [[West Florida]]. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of [[East Florida]] in the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]], and in 1822 both were merged into the [[Florida Territory]].

===United States territory===

{{Main|Seminole Wars|Adams–Onís Treaty|Organic act#List of organic acts|Mississippi Territory}}

After the [[American Revolution]] (1765–83), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. The [[Mississippi Territory]] was [[Territories of the United States|organized]] on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to the United States. Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.

From 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands ([[Treaty of Doak's Stand]]) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans. The latter were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Wynne|title=Mississippi (On-The-Road Histories)|year=2007|page=12|isbn=978-1566566667}}</ref> New settlers kept encroaching on Choctaw land, and they pressed the federal government to expel the Native Americans. On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed between the U.S. Government and the [[Choctaw]]. The Choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in Mississippi and Alabama, for compensation and [[Indian Removal|removal]] to reservations in [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma). This opened up land for sale to [[European-American]] migrant settlement.

Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the states to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership. They were the second major Native American ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas during rather than join the removal).<ref name="us_citizenship">

Many slaveholders brought enslaved [[African Americans]] with them or purchased them through the domestic slave trade, especially in [[New Orleans]]. Through the trade, an estimated nearly one million slaves were forcibly transported to the [[Deep South]], including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke up many slave families of the Upper South, where planters were selling excess slaves. The Southerners imposed slave laws in the Deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.

Plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers, where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes. This is also where early towns developed, linked by the [[steamboats]] that carried commercial products and crops to markets. The remainder of Native American ancestral land remained largely undeveloped but was sold through treaties until 1826, when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.choctawnation.com/sites/default/files/2015/09/29/1826_Refusal_of_Chickasaws_and_Choctaws_original.pdf |title=1826 Refusal of Chickasaws and Choctaws | website=choctawnation.com }}</ref>

The forced migration of the Choctaw, together with other southeastern tribes removed as a result of the Act, became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].

When [[King Cotton|cotton was king]] during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners—especially those of the Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and free labor gained through their holding enslaved African Americans. They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for [[secession]]. Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.

By 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons. Fewer than 1000 were [[free people of color]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |title=Historical Census Browser |publisher=Fisher.lib.virginia.edu |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |archive-date=August 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The relatively low population of the state before the Civil War reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the riverfronts, which formed the main transportation corridors.

[[File:Legislature of the State of Mississippi (1890).png|thumb|The legislature of the State of Mississippi in 1890]]

On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the [[Union (Civil War)|Union]], and it was one of the founding members of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Civil War]], and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s long siege of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.

In the postwar period, [[freedmen]] withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations. The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership. They created independent black Baptist congregations. By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] of black churches.<ref name="campbell"/>

In addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (established in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 19th century) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (established in New York City), sent [[missionaries]] to the South in the postwar years. They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South. Southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as well.<ref name="campbell">{{cite book|author=James T.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the first Mississippi constitutional convention in 1868, with delegates both black and white, framed a constitution whose major elements would be maintained for 22 years.<ref name="dubois"/> The convention was the first political organization in the state to include African-American representatives, 17 among the 100 members (32 counties had black majorities at the time). Some among the black delegates were [[freedmen]], but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the North. The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for [[suffrage]] or for office, a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.<ref name="dubois">{{cite book|first=W. E. B. |last=DuBois |title=Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880|location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |year=1998 |page=437}}</ref> Under the terms of Reconstruction, Mississippi was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870.

Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile bottomland that had not been developed before the Civil War, 90 percent of the land was still frontier. After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/>

Around the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were [[African American]].<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/> But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor.<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/>

Democrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the "white line" campaign, based on asserting [[white supremacy]]. Democratic whites were well armed and formed [[paramilitary]] organizations such as the [[Red Shirts (southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to suppress black voting. From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known "riots" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks. They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many. A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed. In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up. Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and [[lynching|lynched]] known black leaders, destroying local political organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wharton|first=V. L.|date=1941|title=The Race Issue in the Overthrow of Reconstruction in Mississippi: A Paper Read before the American Historical Association, 1940|journal=Phylon|volume=2|issue=4|pages=362–370|doi=10.2307/271241|jstor=271241}}</ref> Seeing the success of this deliberate "[[Mississippi Plan]]", South Carolina and other states followed it and also achieved white Democratic dominance. In 1877 by a national compromise, the last of federal troops were withdrawn from the region.

Even in this environment, black Mississippians continued to be elected to local office. However, black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to "eliminate the nigger from politics", according to the state's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor, [[James K. Vardaman]].<ref name=NRMcMillenP43>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIN1gR92_SIC&pg=PA41|title=Dark Journey: Black Mississippians in the Age of Jim Crow|first=Neil R.|last=McMillen|page=43|chapter=The Politics of the Disfranchised|date=1990|isbn=978-0-252-06156-1}}</ref> It erected barriers to voter registration and instituted electoral provisions that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most black Mississippians and many poor whites.

The loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of African Americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century. Together with imposition of [[Jim Crow]] and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to [[boll weevil]] infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/>

===20th century to present===

In 1900, blacks made up more than half of the state's population. By 1910, a majority of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and become [[sharecropper]]s. By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty.<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/> Starting about 1913, tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the [[Northern United States|North]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial cities such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]]. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910–1940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.

Blacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches. In 1923, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] stated "the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man".<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/ref/collection/leader/id/9763|title=The Louisville Leader.

In the early 20th century, some industries were established in Mississippi, but jobs were generally restricted to whites, including child workers. The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants. The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work.

By 1900, many white ministers, especially in the towns, subscribed to the [[Social Gospel]] movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day. Many strongly supported [[Prohibition]], believing it would help alleviate and prevent many sins.<ref>[http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/16188 Randy J. Sparks.

African-American Baptist churches grew to include more than twice the number of members as their white Baptist counterparts. The African-American call for social equality resonated throughout the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s.

The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] from the South started in the 1940s, lasting until 1970. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century, African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs. The Second Great Migration included destinations in the [[Western United States|West]], especially [[California]], where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher-paying jobs to both African Americans and whites.

Blacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: [[gospel music]], [[country music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.

So many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 United States Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> The whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890, preventing most blacks from voting, even if they were well educated. Court challenges were not successful until later in the century. After World War II, African-American veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the United States and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights.

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration. In 1954 the state had created the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism. [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'') that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. They used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists, including teachers and other professionals. Techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing.

In the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish [[Freedom Schools]]. The [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was established to challenge the all-white Democratic Party of the [[Solid South]]. Most white politicians resisted such changes. Chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its sympathizers used violence against activists, most notably the [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] in 1964 during the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign. This was a catalyst for Congressional passage the following year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Mississippi earned a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary state.<ref>[http://www.southernspaces.org/2006/mississippi-metaphor-state-region-and-nation-historical-imagination Joseph Crespino, "Mississippi as Metaphor: State, Region and Nation in Historical Imagination", ''Southern Spaces'', October 23, 1996], accessed October 1, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.queenspress.com/archives/nfp/2002/1018/nfp.htm Michael Schenkler, "Memories of Queens College and an American Tragedy", ''Queens Press'', October 18, 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117094449/http://www.queenspress.com/archives/nfp/2002/1018/nfp.htm |date=January 17, 2013 }}, accessed March 15, 2008</ref>

After decades of disenfranchisement, African Americans in the state gradually began to exercise their right to vote again for the first time since the 19th century, following the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, which ended ''de jure'' segregation and enforced constitutional voting rights. Registration of African-American voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party fielded some candidates. Teacher [[Robert G. Clark, Jr.|Robert G. Clark]] of Holmes County was the first African American to be elected to the State House since Reconstruction. He continued as the only African American in the state legislature until 1976 and was repeatedly elected into the 21st century, including three terms as Speaker of the House.<ref name="msu">[http://lib.msstate.edu/collins/speakers/clark/ "Robert G.

In 1966, the state was the last to repeal officially statewide [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol]]. Before that, Mississippi had taxed the illegal alcohol brought in by [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s. Governor [[Paul B. Johnson, Jr.|Paul Johnson]] urged repeal and the sheriff "raided the annual [[Junior League]] [[Mardi Gras]] ball at the Jackson Country Club, breaking open the liquor cabinet and carting off the Champagne before a startled crowd of [[nobility]] and high-ranking state officials".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842449,00.html "Mississippi: Bourbon Borealis"], ''Time'', February 11, 1966.</ref>

On August 17, 1969, [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the Mississippi coast, killing 248 people and causing US$1.5&nbsp;billion in damage (1969 dollars).

Mississippi ratified the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], in March 1984, which had already entered into force by August 1920; granting women the right to vote.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Spruill | first1 = Marjorie Julian | last2 = Spruill Wheeler | first2 = Jesse | title = Mississippi Women and the Woman Suffrage Amendment | publisher = Mississippi Historical Society | url = http://www.mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/articles/245/mississippi-women-and-the-woman-suffrage-amendment | accessdate = August 25, 2018}}</ref>

In 1987, 20 years after the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled in 1967's ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' that a similar Virginian law was unconstitutional, Mississippi repealed its ban on interracial marriage (also known as [[miscegenation]]), which had been enacted in 1890. It also repealed the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]]-era [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in 1989. In 1995, the state symbolically ratified the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which had abolished slavery in 1865. Though ratified in 1995, the state never officially notified the [[Archivist of the United States|Federal Archivist]], which kept the ratification unofficial until 2013, when Ken Sullivan contacted the office of [[Secretary of State of Mississippi]], [[Delbert Hosemann]], who agreed to file the paperwork and make it official.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mississippi-finally-ratifies-slavery-ban-article-1.1267133 |title=After oversight, Mississippi ratifies 13th Amendment abolishing slavery almost 150 years after its adoption |newspaper=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/02/mississippi-officially-abolishes-slavery-ratifies-13th-amendment/ |title=Mississippi Officially Abolishes Slavery, Ratifies 13th Amendment |publisher=ABC News |date=February 7, 2013 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/18/mississippi-fixes-oversight-formally-ratifies-13th-amendment-on-slavery/ |title=Mississippi fixes oversight, formally ratifies 13th Amendment on slavery |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory civil rights laws, which had been enacted in 1964, the same year as the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts.

The end of legal segregation and [[Jim Crow]] led to the integration of some churches, but most today remain divided along racial and cultural lines, having developed different traditions. After the Civil War, most African Americans left white churches to establish their own independent congregations, particularly Baptist churches, establishing state associations and a national association by the end of the century. They wanted to express their own traditions of worship and practice.<ref>{{cite news |author=John Blake |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/08/04/segregated.sundays/index.html |title=Segregated Sundays |publisher=CNN |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> In more diverse communities, such as [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], some churches have multiracial congregations.<ref name="NYTrace"/>

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Mississippi was 2,976,149 on July 1, 2019, a 0.30% increase since the [[2010 United States Census|2010]] census.<ref name="PopEstUS"/> The state's economist characterized the state as losing population as job markets elsewhere have caused 3.2 per 1000 to migrate recently.<ref>Pender, Geoff. (February 16, 2017). "13 things you need to know about the state economy". [http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/16/state-economic-briefing/97993092/ Clarion Ledger website] Retrieved February 17, 2017.</ref>

From 2000 to 2010, the [[United States Census Bureau]] reported that Mississippi had the highest rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population.<ref name="NYTrace">[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/us/20race.html?_r=0 Susan Saulny, "Black and White and Married in the Deep South: A Shifting Image"], ''The New York Times'', March 20, 2011, accessed October 25, 2012</ref> In addition, Mississippi led the nation for most of the last decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of [[racial segregation]]. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.

As the demographer [[William H. Frey]] noted, "In Mississippi, I think it's [identifying as mixed race] changed from within."<ref name="NYTrace"/> Historically in Mississippi, after [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, the major groups were designated as black (African American), who were then mostly enslaved, and white (primarily European American). [[Matthew Snipp]], also a demographer, commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race: "In a sense, they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed."<ref name="NYTrace"/>

After having accounted for a majority of the state's population since well before the Civil War and through the 1930s, today [[African American]]s constitute approximately 37.8 percent of the state's population. Most have ancestors who were [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]], with many forcibly transported from the Upper South in the 19th century to work on the area's new plantations. Some of these slaves were mixed race, with European ancestors, as there were many children born into slavery with white fathers. Some also have Native American ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28000.html |title=Mississippi QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314192234/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28000.html |archive-date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> During the first half of the 20th century, a total of nearly 400,000 African Americans left the state during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], for opportunities in the North, Midwest and West.

===Ancestry===

At the 2010 U.S. census, the racial makeup of the population was:
*59.1% [[White American]] (58.0% [[non-Hispanic white]], 1.1% [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Hispanic]])
*37.0% [[African American]] or Black
*0.5% [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] and [[Alaska Native]]
*0.9% [[Asian American]]
*1.1% [[Multiracial American]]
*1.4% Other

Ethnically, 2.7% of the total population, among all racial groups, was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28000.html |title=Mississippi QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101115449/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28000.html |archive-date=November 1, 2012 }}</ref> As of 2011, 53.8% of Mississippi's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html|title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|last=Exner|first=Rich|date=June 3, 2012|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref> For more information on racial and ethnic classifications in the United States see [[race and ethnicity in the United States Census]].

Americans of [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[English American|English]] and [[Scottish American|Scottish]] ancestry are present throughout the state. It is believed that there are more people with such ancestry than identify as such on the census, in part because their immigrant ancestors are more distant in their family histories. [[English American|English]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]] and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] are generally the most under-reported ancestry groups in both the [[South Atlantic States]] and the [[East South Central States]]. The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] estimated that a minimum 20% of Mississippi's population is of [[English American|English]] ancestry, though the figure is probably much higher, and another large percentage is of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] ancestry. Many Mississippians of such ancestry identify simply as [[American ancestry|American]] on questionnaires, because their families have been in North America for centuries.<ref>[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.602–645</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Dominic Pulera|title=Sharing the Dream: White Males in Multicultural America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&pg=PA57|year=2004|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-1643-8|page=57}}</ref> In the 1980 census 656,371 Mississippians of a total of 1,946,775 identified as being of [[English American|English]] ancestry, making them 38% of the state at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |title=Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980—Table 3 |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>

The state in 2010 had the highest proportion of African Americans in the nation. The African-American percentage of population has begun to increase due mainly to a younger population than the whites (the [[total fertility rate]]s of the two races are approximately equal). Due to patterns of settlement and whites putting their children in private schools, in almost all of Mississippi's public school districts, a majority of students are African American. African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern [[Mississippi Delta|Yazoo Delta]], and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. These are areas where, historically, African Americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the Civil War, or worked on cotton plantations and farms.<ref>James C. Cobb, ''The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity'' (1994) p. 244</ref>

People of [[French American|French Creole]] ancestry form the largest demographic group in [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock County]] on the Gulf Coast. The African-American; [[Choctaw]], mostly in [[Neshoba County]]; and [[Chinese American]] portions of the population are also almost entirely native born.

The Chinese first came to Mississippi as [[indentured|contract workers]] from [[Cuba]] and [[History of Chinese Americans#California Gold Rush|California]] in the 1870s, and they originally worked as laborers on the cotton plantations. However, most Chinese families came later between 1910 and 1930 from other states, and most operated small family-owned groceries stores in the many small towns of the Delta.<ref>{{Cite journal | jstor=25163098| title=Somewhere between White and Black: The Chinese in Mississippi| journal=OAH Magazine of History| volume=10| issue=4| pages=33–36| last1=Wong| first1=Vivian Wu| date=Summer 1996| doi=10.1093/maghis/10.4.33}}</ref> In these roles, the ethnic Chinese carved out a niche in the state between black and white, where they were concentrated in the Delta. These small towns have declined since the late 20th century, and many ethnic Chinese have joined the exodus to larger cities, including Jackson. Their population in the state overall has increased in the 21st century.<ref>Thornell, John G. 2008.

===Language===

In 2000, 96.4% of Mississippi residents five years old and older spoke only English in the home, a decrease from 97.2% in 1990.<ref name="city-data.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Mississippi-Languages.html|title=Mississippi—Languages|website=city-data.com|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref> English is largely [[Southern American English]], with some South Midland speech in northern and eastern Mississippi. There is a common absence of final /r/, particularly in the elderly natives and African Americans, and the lengthening and weakening of the diphthongs /aɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ as in 'ride' and 'oil'. South Midland terms in northern Mississippi include: tow sack (burlap bag), dog irons (andirons), plum peach (clingstone peach), snake doctor (dragonfly), and stone wall (rock fence).<ref name="city-data.com"/>

===Religion===

Under French and Spanish rule beginning in the 17th century, European colonists were mostly [[Roman Catholics]]. The growth of the cotton culture after 1815 brought in tens of thousands of Anglo-American settlers each year, most of whom were Protestants from Southeastern states. Due to such migration, there was rapid growth in the number of Protestant churches, especially [[Methodist]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]].<ref name=religion>{{cite web|url=http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/96/religion-in-mississippi |title=Mississippi History Now—Religion in Mississippi |publisher=Mshistory.k12.ms.us |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008142628/http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/96/religion-in-mississippi |archive-date=October 8, 2010 }}</ref>
[[File:Liberty baptist church amite county ms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liberty, Mississippi|Liberty]] Baptist Church,  [[Amite County]]]]

The revivals of the [[Great Awakening]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries initially attracted the [[Plain Folk of the Old South|"plain folk"]] by reaching out to all members of society, including women and blacks. Both slaves and free blacks were welcomed into Methodist and Baptist churches. Independent black Baptist churches were established before 1800 in Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Georgia, and later developed in Mississippi as well.

In the post-Civil War years, religion became more influential as the South became known as the "[[Bible Belt]]".

Since the 1970s, fundamentalist conservative churches have grown rapidly, fueling Mississippi's conservative political trends among whites.<ref name=religion/> In 1973 the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] attracted numerous conservative congregations. As of 2010, Mississippi remained a stronghold of the denomination, which originally was brought by Scots immigrants. The state has the highest adherence rate of the PCA in 2010, with 121 congregations and 18,500 members. It is among the few states where the PCA has higher membership than the PC(USA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1305_d.asp|title=Presbyterian Church in America—Religious Groups—The Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>

Mississippi's rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees, and ditching and draining the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities.<ref name="Solomon Final Frontiers">John Otto Solomon,''The Final Frontiers, 1880–1930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands''.

Before the Civil War, Mississippi was the fifth-wealthiest state in the nation, its wealth generated by the labor of slaves in cotton plantations along the rivers.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Mississippi Almanac Entry |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_MISSISSIPPI.html?ex=1162094400&en=27939e8b35b285fa&ei=5070 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526202008/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_MISSISSIPPI.html?ex=1162094400&en=27939e8b35b285fa&ei=5070 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 26, 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=July 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 12, 2010 }}, The New York Times Travel Almanac (2004)</ref>
Slaves were counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value. By 1860, a majority—55 percent—of the population of Mississippi was enslaved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/sate.php |title=Historical Census Browser |publisher=Fisher.lib.virginia.edu |accessdate=July 30, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Ninety percent of the Delta bottomlands were undeveloped and the state had low overall density of population.

Largely due to the domination of the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] economy, focused on the production of [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[cotton]], the state's elite was reluctant to invest in infrastructure such as roads and railroads. They educated their children privately. [[Industrialization]] did not reach many areas until the late 20th century. The planter [[aristocracy]], the elite of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for their own benefit, making only private improvements. Before the war the most successful planters, such as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]], owned riverside properties along the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the Mississippi Delta. Away from the riverfronts, most of the Delta was undeveloped frontier.

During the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, died from wounds and disease, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500&nbsp;million, of which $218&nbsp;million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177&nbsp;million.<ref>W. E. B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 432</ref>

Poor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 437</ref> It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. 432, 434</ref>

Blacks cleared land, selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement for them and their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.<ref name="Willis Forgotten Time"/>

After the Civil War, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912–1913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.<ref name="Solomon Final Frontiers"/>

It was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer-term plans for levees in the upper Delta.<ref name="about the levee"/> Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke through and caused massive flooding of {{convert|27000|sqmi|km2}} throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages. With the Depression coming so soon after the flood, the state suffered badly during those years. In the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], hundreds of thousands of African Americans migrated North and West for jobs and chances to live as full citizens.

===Entertainment and tourism===

The legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for the state. Gambling towns in Mississippi have attracted increased tourism: they include the Gulf Coast resort towns of [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and the Mississippi River towns of [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi|Tunica]] (the third largest gaming area in the United States), [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].

Before [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck the Gulf Coast, Mississippi was the second-largest gambling state in the Union, after [[Nevada]] and ahead of [[New Jersey]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} An estimated $500,000 per day in tax revenue was lost following Hurricane Katrina's severe damage to several coastal casinos in Biloxi in August 2005.<ref>[http://www.biloxi.ms.us/katrinastats.html Katrina Stats].

On August 30, 2007, a report by the [[United States Census Bureau]] indicated that Mississippi was the poorest state in the country. Major cotton farmers in the Delta have large, mechanized plantations, and they receive the majority of extensive federal subsidies going to the state, yet many other residents still live as poor, rural, landless laborers. The state's sizable poultry industry has faced similar challenges in its transition from family-run farms to large mechanized operations.<ref>Stuesse, Angela and Laura Helton.

===Federal subsidies and spending===

With Mississippi's fiscal conservatism, in which [[Medicaid]], [[American welfare state|welfare]], [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]], and other social programs are often cut, eligibility requirements are tightened, and stricter employment criteria are imposed, Mississippi ranks as having the second-highest ratio of spending to tax receipts of any state. In 2005, Mississippi citizens received approximately $2.02 per dollar of taxes in the way of federal spending. This ranks the state second-highest nationally, and represents an increase from 1995, when Mississippi received $1.54 per dollar of taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/38.html |title=Tax Foundation |publisher=Tax Foundation |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> This figure is based on federal spending after large portions of the state were devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]], requiring large amounts of federal aid from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). However, from 1981 to 2005, it was at least number four in the nation for federal spending vs. taxes received.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://taxfoundation.org/article/federal-taxes-paid-vs-federal-spending-received-state-1981-2005| title=Federal Taxes Paid Vs Federal Spending Received State 1981–2005| date=2007-10-19}}</ref>

A proportion of federal spending in Mississippi is directed toward large federal installations such as [[Camp Shelby]], [[John C. Stennis Space Center]], [[Naval Air Station Meridian|Meridian Naval Air Station]], [[Columbus Air Force Base]], and [[Keesler Air Force Base]]. Three of these installations are located in the area affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]].

==Politics and government==

[[File:Governors of Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Five Governors of Mississippi in 1976, from left: [[Ross Barnett]], [[James P. Coleman]], [[William L. Waller]], [[John Bell Williams]], and [[Paul B. Johnson Jr.]]]]

As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Mississippi's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive and judicial power. Executive authority in the state rests with the Governor, currently [[Tate Reeves]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]). The lieutenant governor, currently [[Delbert Hosemann]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]), is elected on a separate ballot. Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the heads of major executive departments are elected by the citizens of Mississippi rather than appointed by the governor.

Mississippi is one of five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years (the others are [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Virginia]]). Mississippi holds elections for these offices every four years, always in the year preceding presidential elections.

===Laws===

===Political alignment===

[[File:United States presidential election in Mississippi, 2016.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]

Mississippi led the South in developing a [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising]] constitution, passing it in 1890. By raising barriers to voter registration, the state legislature disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites, excluding them from politics until the late 1960s. It established a one-party state dominated by white Democrats.

In the 1980s whites divided evenly between the parties. In the 1990s those voters shifted their allegiance to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], first for national and then for state offices.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander P. Lamis|title=Southern Politics in the 1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LukDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT425|year=1999|publisher=LSU Press|page=425|isbn=9780807166772}}</ref> Most blacks were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] under the state's 1890 constitution and discriminatory practices, until passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and concerted grassroots efforts to achieve registration and encourage voting.

In 2019, a lawsuit was filed against an 1890 election law known as The Mississippi Plan, which requires that candidates must win the popular vote and a majority of districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763510668/black-voters-sue-over-mississippis-jim-crow-era-election-law|title=Black Voters Sue Over Mississippi's Jim Crow-Era Election Law|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Air===

Mississippi has six airports with commercial passenger service, the busiest in Jackson ([[Jackson-Evers International Airport]]) and one in Gulfport ([[Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport]])

===Roads===

Mississippi is the only American state where people in cars may legally consume beer. Some localities have laws restricting the practice.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Owen |title=Riding in Cars with Beers |url=https://www.theawl.com/2016/04/riding-in-cars-with-beers/ |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=28 April 2016}}</ref> In 2018, the state was ranked number eight in the Union in terms of impaired driving deaths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Woodell |first1=Brody |title=Which states have the MOST and the LEAST drunk driving deaths |url=https://wqad.com/2018/12/20/which-states-have-the-most-and-the-least-drunk-driving-deaths/ |publisher=WQAD |accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>

==Education==

[[File:NYA-"Lee County Training School(Negro)"-Tupelo, Mississippi-students at work in library - NARA - 195369.tif|thumb| ]]

Until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, Mississippi had a small number of schools and no educational institutions for [[African Americans]]. The first school for black students was not established until 1862.

During Reconstruction in 1871, black and white Republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free [[public education]] in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools. In the early 20th century, there were still few schools in rural areas, particularly for black children. With seed money from the [[Julius Rosenwald]] Fund, many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children. Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.<ref>James D. Anderson,''[[The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935]]''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, pp. 160–161</ref>

Blacks and whites attended segregated and separate [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s in Mississippi until the late 1960s, although such segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in its 1954 ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. In the majority-black Mississippi Delta counties, white parents worked through [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]] to set up private [[segregation academies]], where they enrolled their children. Often funding declined for the public schools.<ref name="bolton178"/>

But in the state as a whole, only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. They have had to work to have their interests and children represented.<ref name="bolton178">Bolton, Charles C. ''The Hardest Deal of All: The Battle Over School Integration in Mississippi, 1870–1980''. University Press of Mississippi, 2005, pp. 136, 178–179. {{ISBN|1604730609}}, 9781604730609.</ref>

In the late 1980s Mississippi's 954 public schools enrolled about 369,500 elementary and 132,500 [[secondary school|secondary]] students. Some 45,700 students attended [[private school]]s.

In the 21st century, 91% of white children and most of the black children in the state attend public schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolton|year=2005|title=The Hardest Deal of All|pages=178–179}}</ref> In 2008, Mississippi was ranked last among the fifty states in academic achievement by the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]]'s ''Report Card on Education'',<ref name="alec">{{cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/am/pdf/education/2008_report_card/mississippi08.pdf |title=Report Card on Education |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407120218/http://www.alec.org/am/pdf/education/2008_report_card/mississippi08.pdf |archive-date=April 7, 2011 }}</ref> with the lowest average [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] scores and sixth-lowest spending per pupil in the nation. In contrast, Mississippi had the 17th-highest average [[SAT (examination)|SAT]] scores in the nation. As an explanation, the Report noted that 92% of Mississippi high school graduates took the ACT, but only 3% of graduates took the SAT, apparently a self-selection of higher achievers. This breakdown compares to the national average of high school graduates taking the ACT and SAT, of 43% and 45%, respectively.<ref name="alec"/>

Generally prohibited in the [[Western world|West]] at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Mississippi, with 31,236 public school students<ref>Please note this figure refers to only the number of students paddled, regardless of whether a student was spanked multiple times in a year, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be substantially higher.</ref> paddled at least one time circa 2016.<ref name="CORPUN_US_SCHOOL" /> A greater percentage of students were [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] in Mississippi than in any other state, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.<ref name="CORPUN_US_SCHOOL">{{cite web|url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title= Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] | last = Farrell | first = Colin | date=February 2016|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref>

In 2007, Mississippi students scored the lowest of any state on the National Assessments of Educational Progress in both math and science.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Study Compares States' Math and Science Scores With Other Countries' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/education/14students.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon | date=November 14, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}, ''The New York Times'' (2007)</ref>

[[Jackson, MS|Jackson]], the state's capital city, is the site of the state residential school for deaf and hard of hearing students. [[Mississippi School for the Deaf|The Mississippi School for the Deaf]] was established by the state legislature in 1854 before the civil war.

==Culture==

[[File:Mississippi New State Capitol Building in Jackson.jpg|thumb|The [[Mississippi State Capitol]] was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2016.]]

While Mississippi has been especially known for its music and literature, it has embraced other forms of art. Its strong religious traditions have inspired striking works by [[outsider art]]ists who have been shown nationally.

Jackson established the [[USA International Ballet Competition]], which is held every four years. This ballet competition attracts the most talented young dancers from around the world.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!-- .entry-content --> |url=http://www.usaibc.com/ |title=USA International Ballet Competition |publisher=Usaibc.com |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925073440/http://www.usaibc.com/ |archive-date=September 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Magnolia Independent Film Festival]], still held annually in [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]], is the first and oldest in the state.

[[George Ohr]], known as the "Mad Potter of Biloxi" and the father of abstract expressionism in pottery, lived and worked in Biloxi, MS.

===Music===

Musicians of the state's Delta region were historically significant to the development of the [[blues]]. Although by the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farm owners were black, continued low prices for cotton and national financial pressures resulted in most of them losing their land. More problems built up with the boll weevil infestation, when thousands of agricultural jobs were lost.

[[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], a native of Meridian and guitarist/singer/songwriter known as the "Father of Country Music", played a significant role in the development of the blues. He and [[Chester Arthur Burnett]] were friends and admirers of each other's music. Their friendship and respect is an important example of Mississippi's musical legacy. While the state has had a reputation for being racist, Mississippi musicians created new forms by combining and creating variations on musical traditions from Africa, African American traditions, and the musical traditions of white Southerners strongly shaped by Scots-Irish and other styles.

The state is creating a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], with dedicated markers explaining historic sites significant to the history of blues music, such as [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]]'s Riverside Hotel, where [[Bessie Smith]] died after her auto accident on [[U.S. Route 61|Highway 61]]. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. The [[Delta Blues Museum]] there is visited by tourists from all over the world. Close by is "Ground Zero", a contemporary blues club and restaurant co-owned by actor [[Morgan Freeman]].

[[Elvis Presley]], who created a sensation in the 1950s as a crossover artist and contributed to rock 'n' roll, was a native of [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]. From opera star [[Leontyne Price]] to the [[alternative rock]] band [[3 Doors Down]], to [[Gulf and western (music genre)|gulf and western]] singer [[Jimmy Buffett]], modern rock/jazz/world music guitarist-producer [[Clifton Hyde]], to rappers [[David Banner]], [[Big K.R.I.T.]] and [[Afroman]], Mississippi musicians have been significant in all genres.
