The '''Supreme Court of California''' is the [[Supreme court|highest and final court]] in the [[judiciary of California|courts of the State of California]]. It resides inside the [[Earl Warren Building]] in [[San Francisco]], overlooking Civic Center Square along with City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courts.ca.gov/3013.htm|title=Contact Us - supreme_court|website=www.courts.ca.gov|access-date=2019-09-27|archive-date=2019-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923092806/http://www.courts.ca.gov/3013.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> It also holds sessions in Los Angeles and Sacramento. Its decisions are binding on all other California [[State court (United States)|state courts]].<ref>''Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/57C2d450.htm 57 Cal. 2d 450] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004114556/http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/57C2d450.htm |date=2018-10-04 }} (1962).  In ''Auto Equity Sales'', the Court explained: "Under the doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'', all tribunals exercising inferior jurisdiction are required to follow decisions of courts exercising superior jurisdiction. Otherwise, the doctrine of ''stare decisis'' makes no sense. The decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state courts of California. Decisions of every division of the District Courts of Appeal are binding upon all the justice and municipal courts and upon all the superior courts of this state, and this is so whether or not the superior court is acting as a trial or appellate court. Courts exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law declared by courts of superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to attempt to overrule decisions of a higher court."</ref>  Since 1850, the court has issued many influential decisions in a variety of areas including torts, property, civil and constitutional rights, and criminal law. 

==Composition==
Under the original 1849 [[California Constitution]], the Court started with a chief justice and two associate justices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of the Constitutional Convention of 1849|url=http://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1849/images/const10.jpg|publisher=California Secretary of State|access-date=September 27, 2017|archive-date=January 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113150548/http://archives.cdn.sos.ca.gov/collections/1849/images/const10.jpg|url-status=live}} Art. VI, Sec. 3.</ref> The Court was expanded to five justices in 1862.  Under the current 1879 constitution, the Court expanded to six associate justices and one chief justice, for the current total of seven.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Constitution|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=VI|publisher=California Legislature|access-date=September 27, 2017|archive-date=September 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928010058/https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=VI|url-status=live}}
 Art. VI, Sec. 2, 16(a).</ref> The justices are appointed by the [[Governor of California]] and are subject to [[retention election]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levinson|first1=Jessica A.|title=Op-Ed: Why voters shouldn't be electing judges|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-levinson-end-judicial-elections-20140509-story.html|access-date=June 6, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 8, 2014|archive-date=April 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409064332/http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-levinson-end-judicial-elections-20140509-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the California Constitution, to be considered for appointment, as with any California judge, a person must be an attorney admitted to practice in California or have served as a judge of a California court for 10 years immediately preceding the appointment.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Codes Display Text|url = http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=VI|website = leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date = 2016-02-07|archive-date = 2015-10-31|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151031164758/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=VI|url-status = live}}</ref>

To fill a vacant position, the Governor must first submit a candidate's name to the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation of the State Bar of California, which prepares and returns a thorough, confidential evaluation of the candidate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/Who-We-Are/Committees-Commissions/Judicial-Nominees-Evaluation|publisher=State Bar of California|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-date=June 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606051315/http://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/Who-We-Are/Committees-Commissions/Judicial-Nominees-Evaluation|url-status=live}}</ref> Next, the Governor officially nominates the candidate, who must then be evaluated by the Commission on Judicial Appointments, which consists of the [[Chief Justice of California]], the [[Attorney General of California]], and a senior presiding justice of the [[California Courts of Appeal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Commission on Judicial Appointments|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/5367.htm|publisher=California Courts|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-date=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525184135/http://www.courts.ca.gov/5367.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The Commission holds a public hearing and if satisfied with the nominee's qualifications, confirms the nomination. The nominee can then immediately fill an existing vacancy, or replace a departing justice at the beginning of the next judicial term.

If a nominee is confirmed to fill a vacancy that arose partway through a judicial term, the justice must stand for retention during the next gubernatorial election. Voters then determine whether to retain the justice for the remainder of the judicial term. At the term's conclusion, justices must again undergo a statewide retention election for a full 12-year term.<ref>{{cite constitution |article=VI |section=16 |country=California |language= |ratified=1879 |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_6 |accessdate=2014-12-25 }}</ref> If a majority votes "no," the seat becomes vacant and may be filled by the Governor.

Five current justices were appointed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] (Liu, Cuéllar, Kruger, Groban, Jenkins) and two by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] (Cantil-Sakauye, and Corrigan). There is one [[Filipino-American]] justice (Cantil-Sakauye), one [[Hispanic]] (Cuéllar), two [[African-American]] (Kruger, Jenkins), one [[Asian-American|East Asian-American]] justice (Liu), and two [[non-Hispanic white]] justices (Corrigan, Groban).  The justices generally do not publicly discuss their political views or affiliations; however, in December 2018, Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye announced that she was leaving the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hernández |first1=Lauren |title=California's Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye leaves the GOP, registers as no-party-preference voter - SFChronicle.com |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-s-Chief-Justice-Cantil-Sakauye-13465684.php |access-date=January 9, 2019 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 13, 2018 |archive-date=January 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109062353/https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/California-s-Chief-Justice-Cantil-Sakauye-13465684.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

One justice earned an undergraduate degree from a [[University of California]] school, four from private universities in California, and two from out-of-state private universities.  Two justices earned their law degrees from a University of California law school, one from a private California university, and four from law schools at out-of-state private universities.

The most recent addition to the court is Associate Justice–Designate [[Martin Jenkins]].

===Structure===
Between 1879 and 1966, the court was divided into two three-justice panels, Department One and Department Two.<ref name="Kelly">See ''People v. Kelly'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/40C4t106.htm 40 Cal. 4th 106, 113] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004114533/http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/40C4t106.htm |date=2018-10-04 }} (2006), which explains the 1879 constitutional convention's decision to create a seven-justice court with two three-justice departments.</ref>  The chief justice divided cases evenly between the panels and also decided which cases would be heard ''en banc'' by the Court sitting as a whole.
[[File:Supremecourtofcaliforniamaincourthouse.jpg|thumb|left|The Court's headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] at the [[Earl Warren Building]] and Courthouse, which it shares with the [[California Courts of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] for the First District]]
After a constitutional amendment in 1966, the Court currently sits "in bank" ([[en banc]]) (all seven together) when hearing all appeals.  When there is an open seat on the court, or if a justice recuses himself or herself on a given case, justices from the [[California Courts of Appeal]] are assigned by the chief justice to join the court for individual cases on a rotational basis.

The procedure for when all justices recuse themselves from a case has varied over time.<ref>In a 1972 case, [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/25/474.html ''Mosk v. Superior Court''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710230715/http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/25/474.html |date=2017-07-10 }}, 25 Cal. 3d 479 (1979), judges were selected by lot to serve on the panel after all of the Supreme Court justices recused themselves: "The Chief Justice assigned six Court of Appeal justices, who were selected by lot pursuant to an order by the Supreme Court, to act on the petition."</ref> For a 1992 case, the chief justice requested the presiding justice of a Court of Appeal district (different from the one where the case originated) to select six other Court of Appeal justices from his district, and they formed an acting Supreme Court for the purpose of deciding that one case.<ref>''Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/2C4t342.htm 2 Cal. 4th 342] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005194012/http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/2C4t342.htm |date=2020-10-05 }} (1992).  All members of the Supreme Court recused themselves from the appeal of the First District's decision, so the Third District sat as an "acting" Supreme Court and gave the final opinion in the case.</ref>  However, in a later case where all members of the Court recused themselves when Governor Schwarzenegger sought a writ of mandate (''Schwarzenegger v. Court of Appeal (Epstein)''), seven justices of the Courts of Appeal were selected based on the regular rotational basis, not from the same district, with the most senior one serving as the acting chief justice, and that acting supreme court eventually denied the writ petition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=1965249&doc_no=S189114 |title=California Courts – Appellate Court Case Information |publisher=Judicial Council of California |access-date=January 3, 2011 |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107004048/http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=1965249&doc_no=S189114 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In a yet more recent case (''Mallano v. Chiang'') where all members of the Court recused themselves on a petition for review by retired Court of Appeal justices on a matter involving those justices' salaries (that apparently involved matters up to and including the 2016–2017 fiscal year), the Court ordered that six superior court judges be selected from the pool that took office after July 1, 2017 to serve as the substitute justices for the six sitting justices, with the senior judge among that group serving as the acting Chief Justice; that acting Supreme Court eventually denied the petition for review.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2258969&doc_no=S250379&request_token=NiIwLSIkXkg%2FWyBZSCM9VEhJUFw0UDxTJiJeSz1RICAgCg%3D%3D |title=California Courts – Appellate Court Case Information |publisher=Judicial Council of California |access-date=October 19, 2018 |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729195318/https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2258969&doc_no=S250379&request_token=NiIwLSIkXkg%2FWyBZSCM9VEhJUFw0UDxTJiJeSz1RICAgCg%3D%3D |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Constitution of California]] gives the Court mandatory and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases imposing [[capital punishment in California]], although the Court has sponsored a state constitutional amendment to allow it to assign death penalty appeals to the California Courts of Appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/NR76-07.PDF|title=Press release: Supreme Court Proposes Amendments To Constitution in Death Penalty Appeals|publisher=California Courts|date=November 19, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211154147/http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/NR76-07.PDF|url-status=live}}</ref>  The Court has [[discretionary jurisdiction|discretionary appellate jurisdiction]] over all cases reviewed by the Courts of Appeal; the latter were created by a 1904 constitutional amendment to relieve the Supreme Court of most of its workload so the Court could then focus on dealing with non-frivolous appeals that involved important issues of law.<ref>See ''Snukal v.

According to research by Justice Goodwin Liu, each year the Court has averaged 5,200 petitions for writs of [[certiorari]] and 3,400 petitions for [[habeas corpus]], plus 40 additional petitions from inmates already on death row.<ref name=LiuUCLA>{{cite journal|last1=Justice Goodwin Liu|title=How the California Supreme Court Actually Works|journal=[[UCLA Law Review]]|date=2014|volume=61|page=1246|url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/61-5-2.pdf|access-date=10 June 2016|archive-date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114553/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/61-5-2.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>  In an average year the Court will decide to hear 83 cases and will be required to hear appeals from 20 new inmates joining death row.<ref name=LiuUCLA/>  Each week, the Court votes on 150 to 300 petitions, paying special attention to a staff-recommended "A list" as well as to [[certified question]]s from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].<ref name=LiuUCLA/>

===Operation===
The Court is open for business year-round (as opposed to operating only during scheduled "terms" as is commonplace in jurisdictions that observe the [[legal year]]).  The Court hears oral argument at least one week per month, 10 months each year (except July and August). Since 1878, it has regularly heard oral argument each year at San Francisco (four months), Los Angeles (four months), and Sacramento (two months).

According to Justice Liu, when a case is granted review, the Chief Justice assigns the case to a justice, who, after the parties finish briefing, then prepares a draft opinion.<ref name=LiuUCLA/>  Each justice writes a preliminary response to the draft opinion, and if the assigned justice is in the minority, she may ask the Chief Justice to reassign the case to someone in the majority.<ref name=LiuUCLA/>  The Court then hears oral arguments and, immediately afterwards, meet alone to vote.<ref name=LiuUCLA/>  The California Constitution requires suspension of the justices' salaries if the Court fails to then file a decision within 90 days.<ref name=LiuUCLA/><ref>{{cite news|title=From the Bench: Supreme Justice Paterson Resigns|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18940428.2.44&srpos=3&e=------189-en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22Van+R.+Paterson%22----1894---1|access-date=July 4, 2017|work=San Francisco Call|issue=139|publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection|date=April 28, 1894|volume = 75|quote=(Justice Van R.

Throughout the year (including July and August), the justices have a conference every Wednesday the Court is not hearing oral argument, with the exception of the last week, respectively, of November and December (Thanksgiving and New Year's).  New opinions are published online on Monday and Thursday mornings at 10 a.m.  Paper copies also become available through the clerk's office at that time.

The Court is one of the few U.S. courts apart from the U.S. Supreme Court that enjoys the privilege of having its opinions routinely published in three hardcover [[law reports|reporters]].  The Court's Reporter of Decisions contracts with a private publisher (currently [[LexisNexis]]) to publish the official reporter, ''California Reports'', now in its fifth series; note that the series number changes whenever the publisher changes, although the most recent changeover to the fifth series did not involve a change in reporter. [[West (publisher)|West]] publishes California decisions in both the ''California Reporter'' (in its second series) and the ''[[Pacific Reporter]]'' (in its third series).  (The [[New York Court of Appeals]] opinions are similarly published in three reporters.)

Each justice has five assigned chambers attorneys.<ref name=LiuUCLA/> Since the late 1980s, the Court has turned away from the traditional use of [[law clerk]]s, and has switched to permanent staff attorneys.<ref>Itir Yakar, "Unseen Staff Attorneys Anchor State's Top Court: Institution's System of Permanent Employees Means Workers Can Outlast the Justices," ''San Francisco Daily Journal'', 30 May 2006, 1.</ref>  Justices Goodwin Liu, Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, and Leondra Kruger, however, have returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks for some of their staff positions.<ref name=LiuUCLA/> The Court has about 85 staff attorneys, some of whom are attached to particular justices; the rest are shared as a central staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press release: State Judicial Staff Attorneys Can Now Help Bridge the Justice Gap|url=http://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/state-judicial-staff-attorneys-can-now-help-bridge-the-justice-gap|publisher=California Courts|access-date=June 29, 2017|date=May 9, 2016|quote=Collectively, California's Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal employ over 400 staff attorneys.|archive-date=July 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715235159/http://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/state-judicial-staff-attorneys-can-now-help-bridge-the-justice-gap|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alumni News: Carin Fujisaki '85 Named Principal Attorney to Chief Justice of CA|url=http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/06/fujisaki-named-principal-attorney.php|publisher=University of California Hastings College of the Law|access-date=June 29, 2017|date=June 11, 2015|quote=The Supreme Court is a hive of activity, employing approximately 80 lawyers.|archive-date=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615071107/http://uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/06/fujisaki-named-principal-attorney.php|url-status=live}}</ref>  The advantage to this system is that the reduced turnover of staff attorneys (versus the traditional system of rotating through new law clerks every year) has improved the efficiency of the court in dealing with complex cases, particularly death penalty cases.

During its first half-century of operation, the Court struggled to keep up with its soaring caseload and very frequently fell behind, until the California Courts of Appeal were created in 1904.<ref name="Kelly" />  This resulted in provisions in the 1879 Constitution forcing the Court to decide all cases in writing with reasons given<ref>[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2014.&article=VI California Constitution, Article 6, Section 14] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200720103705/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2014.&article=VI |date=2020-07-20 }}.</ref> (to get rid of minor cases, it had often given summary dispositions with ''no'' reasons given<ref name="Kelly" />) and requiring California judges to certify in writing every month that no matter submitted for consideration had been outstanding for more than 90 days, or else they would not be paid.<ref>[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2019.&article=VI California Constitution, Article 6, Section 19] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409110350/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2019.&article=VI |date=2016-04-09 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sloss|first1=Frank H.|title=M.

Then, after the matter is formally "argued and submitted", the justices can polish and release their opinions well before reaching the 90-day deadline.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}  This differs sharply from the practice in all other federal and state appellate courts, where judges can schedule oral argument not long after written briefing is finished, but then may take months (or even a year) after oral argument to release opinions.

Because the court was extremely overloaded with cases prior to 1904, its decisions in several hundred minor cases that should have been published were not published.  A small group of lawyers eventually undertook the tedious task of plowing through the state archives to recover and compile those opinions, which were published in a separate seven-volume reporter called ''California Unreported Cases'' starting in 1913.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Peter V.|title=California Unreported Cases: Being Those Determined in the Supreme Court and the District Courts of Appeal of the State of California, But Not Officially Reported, with Annotations Showing Their Present Value as Authority|date=1913|publisher=Bender-Moss Company|location=San Francisco, CA|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaunrep18appegoog|access-date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>  Despite its name, those cases are citable as precedent, since they would have been published but for the court's disorganized condition at the time they were issued.

==Ancillary responsibilities==
The Court supervises the lower courts (including the trial-level [[California superior courts]]) through the [[Judicial Council of California]] and the California Commission on Judicial Performance, and also supervises California's legal profession through the [[State Bar of California]]. All lawyer admissions and disbarments are done through recommendations of the State Bar, which then must be ratified by the Supreme Court. California's bar is the largest in the U.S. with 210,000 members, of whom 160,000 are practicing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flaherty|first1=Kristina|title=State Bar celebrates its 80th anniversary|journal=California Bar Journal|date=September 2007|url=http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/archive/Archive.aspx?articleId=87765&categoryId=87702&month=9&year=2007|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-date=June 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623144627/http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/archive/Archive.aspx?articleId=87765&categoryId=87702&month=9&year=2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Cynthia L.|title=Women Bar Presidents: Changing the Picture and Focus of Leadership|journal=Perspectives Magazine|date=Winter 2008|page=9|access-date=June 29, 2017|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_winter08_barpres.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|quote=The State Bar of California, a mandatory bar, is the largest in the nation, with 210,000 members— almost a quarter of the nation's lawyers.|archive-date=October 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001165106/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/perspectives_magazine/women_perspectives_winter08_barpres.authcheckdam.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

As the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' said in 1972:

<blockquote>The state's high court over the past 20 years has won a reputation as perhaps the most innovative of the state judiciaries, setting precedents in areas of criminal justice, civil liberties, racial integration, and consumer protection that heavily influence other states and the federal bench.<ref>Joann Lublin, "Trailblazing Bench: California High Court Often Points the Way for Judges Elsewhere," ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 20 July 1972, 1.</ref></blockquote>

Statistical analyses conducted by [[LexisNexis]] personnel at the Court's request indicate that the decisions of the Supreme Court of California are by far the most followed of any state supreme court in the United States.<ref>Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''" Followed Rates" and Leading State Cases, 1940–2005'', <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C. Davis L.

Many important legal concepts have been pioneered or developed by the Court, including [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]], [[fair procedure]], [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]], [[palimony]], [[insurance bad faith]], [[wrongful life]], and [[market-share liability]].

The [[major film studios]] in and around [[Hollywood]] and the high-tech firms of [[Silicon Valley]] both fall under the Court's jurisdiction. Thus, the Court has decided a number of cases by, between, and against such companies, as well as several cases involving Hollywood celebrities<ref>See, e.g., ''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15697443080038926320 NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v.

The California Supreme Court and all lower California state courts use a different writing style and [[Case citation|citation]] system from the federal courts and many other state courts. California citations have the year between the names of the parties and the reference to the case reporter, as opposed to the national standard (the [[Bluebook]]) of putting the year at the end.  For example, the famous case ''[[Marvin v. Marvin]]'', which established the standard for non-marital partners' ability to sue for their contributions to the partnership, is rendered ''Marvin v. Marvin'' (1976) 18 Cal.3d 660 [134 Cal.Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106] in California style, while it would be ''Marvin v. Marvin'', 18 Cal. 3d 660, 557 P.2d 106, 134 Cal. Rptr. 815 (1976), in Bluebook style.  The California citation style, however, has always been the norm of common law jurisdictions outside the United States, including England, Canada and Australia.

While the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justices indicate the author of an opinion and who has "joined" the opinion at the start of the opinion, California justices always sign a majority opinion at the end, followed by "WE CONCUR," and then the names of the joining justices.  California judges are traditionally not supposed to use certain ungrammatical terms in their opinions, which has led to embarrassing fights between judges and the editor of the state's official reporters.  California has traditionally avoided the use of certain French and Latin phrases like ''[[en banc]]'', ''[[certiorari]]'', and ''[[mandamus]]'', so California judges and attorneys use "in bank," "review," and "mandate" instead (though "in bank" has become quite rare after 1974).

Finally, the Court has the power to "depublish" opinions by the Courts of Appeal (as opposed to the federal practice of ''not'' publishing certain "unpublished" opinions at all in the federal case reporters).<ref name=CRC8.1105>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=eight&linkid=rule8_1105|title=Rule 8.1105.

* ''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'' (1989),<ref>48 Cal.3d 644, 257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814 (1989).</ref> the Court withdrew from the expansive form of NIED set forth in ''Dillon'' and imposed a rigid bright-line test for recovery in bystander NIED cases.  The ''Thing'' decision included extensive ''[[dicta]]'' hostile to plaintiffs which more generally limited the scope of recovery for both the tort of [[negligence]] and [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] damages in California.
* ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' (1990),<ref>51 Cal. 3d 120, 271 Cal. Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479 (1990).</ref> the Court held that patients do not have intellectual property rights in profits from medical discoveries made with their body parts.
* ''[[Wendland v. Wendland]]'' (2001),<ref>26 Cal. 4th 519, 110 Cal. Rptr. 2d 4112, 28 P.3d 151 (2001).</ref> the Court held that in the absence of a legally recognized method of determining who should make medical decisions on the behalf of an incompetent patient, the constitutional [[right to life]] and [[Privacy laws of the United States#Constitutional basis for right to privacy|right to privacy]] granted special protection to the incompetent person.
* ''[[Yount v. City of Sacramento]]'' (2008),<ref>43 Cal.4th 885, 183 P.3d 471 (2008).</ref> the Court held that a [[criminal conviction]] does not limit an individual's right to bring civil action for deprivation of rights in cases of excessive use of force.
* ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' (2008),<ref>43 Cal. 4th 757, 183 P.3d 384, 76 Cal. Rptr. 3d 683 (2008).</ref> the Court held that [[sexual orientation]] is a protected class which requires [[strict scrutiny]] and under such scrutiny, laws prohibiting same-sex marriage are unconstitutional under the state constitution. The state electorate overturned the marriage portion of the decision that same year by enacting a popular initiative, [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], but left in place the discrimination protections.
* ''[[California Proposition 218 (1996)#The Landmark 2008 Silicon Valley Taxpayers Supreme Court Case|Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Assn., Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority]]'' (2008),<ref>44 Cal. 4th 431, 79 Cal. Rptr. 3d 312, 187 P. 3d 37 (2008).</ref> the Court unanimously held in a [[California Proposition 218 (1996)|Proposition 218]] ("Right to Vote on Taxes Act") case that courts must exercise their independent judgment in reviewing local agency legislative decisions adopting special assessments.  The highly deferential standard of review before Proposition 218 became law was grounded in [[separation of powers]].  Because the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218 were of equal dignity to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, it no longer justified allowing a local agency to usurp the judicial function of interpreting and applying the constitutional provisions that governed assessments under Proposition 218.
* ''[[People v. Diaz]]'' (2011),<ref>51 Cal. 4th 84, 244 P.3d 501, 119 Cal. Rptr. 3d 105 (2011).</ref> the Court held that the warrantless search of information in a cell phone was valid when incident to a lawful arrest.  (The holding in ''Diaz'' was eventually repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Riley v. California]]''.)
