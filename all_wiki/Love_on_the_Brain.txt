"Love on the Brain" was the first song commissioned for Rihanna's album ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]''.<ref name="genius">{{cite news|last1=Oseran|first1=Anna|title=How to Write a Song for Rihanna|url=https://genius.com/a/how-to-write-a-song-for-rihanna|accessdate=August 23, 2016|work=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> <!-- The website Genius is not an unreliable source in this case since it's an interview, it was not edited by any user, it's an interview by a journalist with a songwriter, and this part is also crucial for the article. --> Written by Norwegian songwriter and producer Fred Ball and American songwriter Joseph Angel in late 2013,<ref name="genius" /> inspiration for the song came from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Al Green]]. Ball recalled, "We wanted it to have that juxtaposition of an old school soul feel with modern lyrics. That's why [[Amy Winehouse]] was never pastiche or retro even though her music has an old soul sound."<ref name="genius" /> Ball also stated that they did not write the song with Rihanna in mind, however, his manager at [[Roc Nation]], Jay Brown, heard the song and loved it. Brown sent it to Rihanna and she also reacted similarly, writing additional lyrics.<ref name="genius" />

American producer [[Kuk Harrell]] handled the song's vocal production. Ball and Angel also supplied the song's keyboards and drums. "Love on the Brain" was recorded at [[Westlake Studios]] in Los Angeles. The vocal recording was carried out by Marcos Tovar for Allfadersup and Harrell. The song was finally mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], along with mixing assistants Chris Galland, Jeff Jackson and Ike Schultz, before being mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.<ref name="credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.rihannanow.com/music/anti-deluxe-edition/|title=Anti (Deluxe Edition) {{!}} Rihanna {{!}} Credits|publisher=Rihannanow.com|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref>
