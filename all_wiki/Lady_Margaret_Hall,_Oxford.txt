The college was founded in 1878, closely collaborating with [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]]. Both colleges opened their doors in 1879 as the first two [[women's college]]s of Oxford. The college began admitting men in 1979.<ref name=":3" /> The college has just under 400 [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] students, around 200 [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] students and 24 visiting students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/student-numbers?wssl=1|title=Student numbers {{!}} University of Oxford|website=Ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}</ref> In 2016, the college became the only college in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to offer a [[Foundation Year]] for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

In 2018, Lady Margaret Hall ranked 21st out of 30 in Oxford's [[Norrington Table]], a measurement of the performance of students in finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/undergraduate-degree-classifications?wssl=1|title=Undergraduate Degree Classifications {{!}} University of Oxford|website=Ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>

The college's colours are blue, yellow and white. The college uses a [[coat of arms]] which accompanies the college's motto ''"Souvent me Souviens"'', an [[Old French]] phrase meaning "I often remember" or "Think of me often", the motto of [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Lady Margaret Beaufort]], for whom the college is named.

The current principal of the college is [[Alan Rusbridger]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11300452/Guardian-editor-Alan-Rusbridger-to-become-principal-of-Oxford-college.html|title=Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger to become principal of Oxford college|date=17 December 2014|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|agency=Press Association}}</ref> Notable alumni and students of Lady Margaret Hall include [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Michael Gove]], [[Nigella Lawson]], [[Josie Long]], [[Ann Widdecombe]] and [[Malala Yousafzai]].

== History ==

=== Founding ===
[[File:Lady Margaret Beaufort, Lady Margaret Hall (Oxford).jpg|thumb|Lady Margaret Beaufort, after whom the college is named]]
In June 1878, the ''[[Association for the Education of Women|Association for the Higher Education of Women]]'' was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall, while T. H. Green founded [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]].<ref>''Alden's Oxford Guide''. Oxford: Alden & Co., 1958; pp. 120–21</ref> Lady Margaret Hall opened its doors to its first nine students in 1879. The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker's shop on [[Little Clarendon Street]].<ref name="Lannon">{{cite magazine|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|magazine=Times Higher Education|date=30 October 2008}}</ref> Despite the college's [[High Anglican]] origins, not all students were devout Christians.

The college was named after [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], patron of scholarship and learning. The first principal was [[Elizabeth Wordsworth]], the great-niece of the poet [[William Wordsworth]] and daughter of [[Christopher Wordsworth]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]].

=== Growth and development ===
With a new building opening in 1894 the college expanded to 25 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Margaret Hall|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/oxon/vol3/pp341-343|website=British History Online|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/New-Old-Hall.aspx|title=LMH, Oxford - New Old Hall|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>

The land on which the college is built was formerly part of the manor of Norham which belonged to [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]]. The college bought the land from St John's in 1894, the other institution driving a hard bargain and requiring a development price not only on the practical building land but also on the undevelopable water meadows. However, this land purchase marked a change in ambition from occupying residential buildings for teaching purposes to erecting buildings befitting an educational institution.

In 1897, members of Lady Margaret Hall founded the Lady Margaret Hall Settlement,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmhs.org.uk/about/|title=Lady Margaret Hall Settlement :: About|website=Lmhs.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref>  as part of the [[settlement movement]]. It was a charitable initiative, originally a place for graduates from the college to live in North Lambeth where they would work with and help develop opportunities for the poor.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lady Margaret Hall Settlement|url=http://www.lmhs.org.uk/about/|website=The Lady Margaret Hall Settlement (LMHS)|publisher=LHMS|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Lady Margaret Hall Settlement|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/bad738d3-4687-4399-b178-57d793f2c10b|website=The National Archives|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref> Members of the college also helped found the Women's University Settlement, which continues to operate to this day, as the Blackfriars Settlement in south London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/history|title=Our History|website=www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

Before 1920, the university refused to give [[academic degree]]s to women and would not acknowledge them as full members of the university. (Some of these women, nicknamed the [[steamboat ladies]], were awarded [[ad eundem degree|''ad eundem'']] degrees by [[Trinity College Dublin]], between 1904 and 1907.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Timeline of the History of Women in Trinity|url=https://www.tcd.ie/about/trinity/events/Womens_Centenary/timeline.php|website=A Century of Women in Trinity College|accessdate=8 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129225449/https://www.tcd.ie/about/trinity/events/Womens_Centenary/timeline.php|archive-date=29 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>) In 1920 the first women graduated from the college at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] and the principal at the time, [[Henrietta Jex-Blake]], was given an [[honorary degree]].<ref name="lmh.ox.ac.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/history-and-archives/college-timeline|title=College Timeline|website=Lady Margaret Hall|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] women were not permitted to fight on the front line and thus many of the students and fellows took up other roles to aid in the war effort, becoming nurses, firefighters and ambulance drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/lmh-objects/ambulance-driver-1918|title=Ambulance driver, 1918|website=Lady Margaret Hall|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The Fellows' Lawn was dug up and the students grew vegetables as part of the [[Dig for Victory]] campaign.<ref name="lmh.ox.ac.uk"/>

In 1979, one hundred years after its foundation, the college began admitting men as well as women; it was the first of the women's colleges to do so, along with [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/11627451.display/|title=Principal led switch to mixed-sex college|website=Oxford Mail|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>

=== Members of the college ===
In 1919 [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J. R.R. Tolkien]] started to give private tuition to students at Oxford, including members of LMH where his tuition was much needed given the limited resources and tutors the college had in its early years. Later his daughter, [[Tolkien family|Priscilla Tolkien]], attended the college, graduating in 1951.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=by0dzzQ6m8sC&pg=PA669&lpg=PA669|title=J.R.R.

== Foundation year ==
Lady Margaret Hall is the only Oxford college to offer a [[foundation year]]; the scheme recruits students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds, and offers successful applicants lower grade requirements than the standard Oxford entry grades. Students choose a subject to specialise in, and also take courses in study skills and other general subject areas,<ref name="University Times Foundation"/><ref name="LMH Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/prospective-students/foundation-year/lmh-foundation-year-students/studying-foundation-year|title=Studying on the Foundation Year|publisher=Lady Margaret Hall|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> with the aim that they progress to an undergraduate degree at the college after a year of study.<ref name="Guardian foundation">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/20/oxford-college-lady-margaret-hall-scheme-recruit-disadvantaged-students|title=Oxford college launches pilot scheme to recruit disadvantaged students|last=editor|first=Richard Adams Education|date=2016-04-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Pupils live in the college and have access to the same university facilities, both academic and social, as other students.<ref name="LMH Foundation"/>

== Buildings and grounds ==
[[File:LMH Hall.png|alt=The Hall, LMH|thumb|The Hall, LMH]]

The development of the college's buildings is perhaps best thought of as a zigzag beginning in the 1870s at the end of Norham Gardens and making its way down towards the River Cherwell and then running back towards Norham Gardens forming quadrangles on the return journey. The following account of the buildings moves through the college as these spaces emerge for a visitor entering the college at the Porters' Lodge and walking to the river - because of the way the college developed the dates and styles of the buildings enclosing the quadrangles are not all of a piece.

=== Leatare Quadrangle ===
[[File:Leatare Quadrangle, Lady Margaret Hall Oxford.jpg|thumb|Leatare Quadrangle]]

The Leatare quadrangle was completed in March 2017 and includes both the college's newest and oldest buildings. The main entrance consists of the front gates flanked by classical columns along with the porters' lodge (2017). On the North West side the Donald Fothergill Building (2017) contains student accommodation while the Clore Graduate Centre (2017) extends further out to the South East towards the University Parks.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/alumni/new-buildings-2007-2017|title=New buildings 2007-2017|website=Lady Margaret Hall|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}</ref>

The college's oldest buildings are along the South East side of the Leatare Quadrangle. The college's original house, a white brick gothic villa, is now known as Old Old Hall, while the adjoining red brick extension designed by [[Basil Champneys]] is known as New Old Hall (1884).<ref name=":0" /> Old Old Hall originally housed the college chapel until the construction of the Deneke building.

Opposite the entrance is the imposing Wolfson West (1964) which was previously the entrance to the college.

Old Old Hall, which had been built as a speculative development on land leased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], was described as an "ugly little white villa" by the college's founder, [[Edward Talbot (bishop)|Bishop Talbot]] in his 1923 history of the college.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1587104|title=Sir Reginald Blomfield's Designs for the Garden of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|first=Eileen|last=Stamers-Smith|date=3 August 1996|journal=Garden History|volume=24|issue=1|pages=114–121|doi=10.2307/1587104}}</ref> On several occasions in the twentieth century consideration was given to demolishing the earliest buildings of the college, but the temptation was resisted.

The only remaining visible evidence of the road which used to run alongside Old Old Hall and past the steps of Talbot Hall are the two large [[Tilia|linden trees]], which used to line the pavement before the road was removed to allow expansion of the college. The two smaller trees were planted during construction of the quadrangle. The recent expansion designed by [[John Simpson (architect)|John Simpson Architects]] was modelled after the [[Porta Maggiore]] in [[Rome]], in conjunction with the simple façade of the Wolfson West building.

The MCR, located in the Clore Graduate Centre, is named for the first female [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] - [[Benazir Bhutto]], who studied at the college from 1973 to 1977.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8661000/8661776.stm|title=BBC - Oxford University's famous south Asian graduates|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-30}}</ref>

=== Wolfson Quadrangle ===
[[File:LMH Talbot Hall.png|thumb|The Wolfson Quadrangle outside Talbot Hall]]

The architect of the main early college buildings, including Lodge, Talbot and Wordsworth, was [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]], who had earlier worked on other educational commissions such as [[Shrewsbury School]], and [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. He used the [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance style]] of the 17th century for the buildings and chose red brick with white stone facings, setting a tone the college was to continue to follow in later work.
These buildings describe the south and east of the Wolfson Quadrangle and run out into the gardens to the east.

Blomfield was also involved in establishing and planning the gardens.

The central block, the Talbot Building (1910) on the North East of the main quad houses Talbot Hall and the Old Library (currently a reception and lecture room),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/Talbot-Hall.aspx|title=LMH, Oxford - Talbot|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> while the accommodation for students and tutors is divided between three wings, the Wordsworth Building (1896), the Toynbee Building (1915) and the Lodge Building (1926).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/Eleanor-Lodge.aspx|title=LMH, Oxford - Eleanor Lodge|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>

Talbot Hall contains some fine oak panelling donated by former students to honour Elizabeth Wordsworth and, prior to the Deneke building, was used as a dining hall for the students. In recent years, it is used to house termly live music nights among other college events. [[File:Lady Margaret Hall Library.jpg|thumb|Lady Margaret Hall Library]]The portraits in the Hall include the  work of notable artists; among the portraits of principals are:
* Sir J. J. Shannon's portrait of [[Elizabeth Wordsworth|Dame Elizabeth]],
* Philip de Laszlo's of [[Henrietta Jex-Blake|Miss Jex-Blake]],
* Sir Rodrigo Moynihan's of [[Lynda Grier|Dr Grier]]
* Maud Sumner's of [[Lucy Sutherland|Miss Sutherland]].
In the old Library is a fine marble statue by Edith Bateson.

On the North West is Lynda Grier (1962) housing the college library;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/Library.aspx|title=LMH, Oxford - Library|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> this was official opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/lmh-library|title=LMH Library|website=Lady Margaret Hall|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref> The ground floor of Lynda Grier was originally student accommodation but in 2006 it was converted into a law library, which was opened that year by [[Cherie Blair]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/Library.aspx|title=LMH Library|publisher=Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> The library was of great importance when founded as women were not permitted to use the [[Bodleian Library]] and thus is relatively large for an Oxford college. The Briggs room originally contained the entire archive of rare and antiquarian books donated to the college over the years. However, due to its size of around 2,000 books, the archive is now stored in the Lawrence Lacerte Rare Books Room in the new Law Library extension on the ground floor. The collection includes a [[Quran]] created circa 1600 and a Latin translation of [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Galileo's Dialogo]] from 1663.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/lmh/rare_books|title=Oxford LibGuides: Lady Margaret Hall Library: Special Collections|first=James|last=Fishwick|website=libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

Lynda Grier and Wolfson West were designed by [[Raymond Erith]].

In recent years the Wolfson Quadrangle, in contrast to many [[Oxbridge]] quadrangles, has been planted with wild flowers instead of an intensively managed, striped quadrangle lawn.

=== Lannon Quadrangle ===
[[File:Lannon quad LMH.png|alt=Lannon Quadrangle, Lady Margaret Hall|thumb|Lannon Quadrangle]]

Named after former principal, [[Frances Lannon|Dame Frances Lannon]], the quadrangle consists of the Sutherland Building (1971) and the Pipe Partridge Building (2010).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/Virtual-tour/Pipe-Partridge.aspx|title=LMH, Oxford - Pipe Partridge|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> Behind this is Sutherland's sister building, Kathleen Lee (1972) which houses the JCR.

The first phase of the recent plan to expand the college, the Pipe Partridge Building, was completed in early 2010 and was opened by the [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford]], [[Lord Patten of Barnes]], in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/News/Opening-of-the-Pipe-Partridge-Building.aspx|title=opening of the Pipe Partridge Building|date=26 April 2010|publisher=Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

The Pipe Partridge Building includes the 136-seat Simpkins Lee theatre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpkinsleetheatre.com/|title=Simpkins Lee Theatre|website=Simpkinsleetheatre.com|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref> a dining hall, seminar rooms and 64 new undergraduate study bedrooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsimpsonarchitects.com/pa/Lady-Margaret-Hall.html|title=Lady Margaret Hall Phase I and II|website=Johnsimpsonarchitects.com|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Chapel and Deneke ===
To the north-east extends the large Deneke block (1932) along with the hall and the college's [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine-style]] chapel where the choir practises and carol services are held in Michaelmas term. These were designed by [[Giles Gilbert Scott]]. The chapel has simple decoration with several paintings on the walls, and a statue of [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] which lies in the central section of the chapel. The passageway which leads to the chapel is referred to within the college as "Hell's Passage". The name was derived from the 19th century illustrations of Dante's Inferno, by [[John D. Batten]], which used to decorate its walls.<ref name="Hell's Passage">{{cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/principal/hells-passage-principals-blog/hells-passage |title=Hell's Passage? |publisher=lmh.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Talbot from the Sunken Gardens.jpg|thumb|Talbot Hall and the Toynbee buildings as seen from the Gardens]]

Lady Margaret Hall is one of the few Oxford colleges which backs onto the [[River Cherwell]]. It is set in spacious grounds (about {{convert|12|acre|m2}}).The grounds include a set of playing fields, netball and [[tennis court]]s, a punt house, [[topiary]], and large herbaceous planting schemes along with vegetable borders. There is a Fellows' Garden - hidden from view by tall hedgerows - and a Fellows' Lawn, on which walking is forbidden.

== Student life ==
The Junior Common Room (JCR) is a physical room as well as being the association of the undergraduate members of the college. It represents its members to the college authorities and facilitates activities, budgets as well as clubs and societies.

[[File:Clore Graduate Centre, LMH Oxford.jpg|thumb|The Clore Graduate Centre]]

Graduate students have similar support from that for the JCR in the Middle Common Room (MCR).

The Senior Common Room (SCR) performs similar functions for the dons.

=== Accommodation ===
[[File:Talbot hall lmh.png|alt=Talbot Hall LMH|thumb|Talbot Hall]]

Accommodation is always provided for undergraduates for 3 years of their study, and provided for some graduates. The accommodation is found throughout college with a ballot system giving first choice of room to the students of higher years. The Deneke building contains exclusively accommodation for first year undergraduates and students visiting from other universities.

=== Facilities ===
As well as rooms for accommodation, the buildings of Lady Margaret Hall include a chapel, a hall, a library, a bar, a lecture theatre, a gym and [[common room]]s. Most undergraduate tutorials are carried out in the college, though for some specialist subjects undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.

=== Boating ===
Given the [[River Cherwell]] running past the bottom of LMH's grounds, the students have always had a strong history of spending time by or on the river with the first boat, ''Lady Maggie'', purchased in 1885. The punt house, by tradition, opens on [[May Day]].

=== Sports ===

==== Rowing ====
[[File:Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club Rowing Blazer.png|alt=Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club Rowing Blazer|thumb|Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club Rowing Blazer]]

LMH's rowing club, [[Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club]] (LMHBC) is the largest sports club within the college. In recent years, the club has won blades in [[Oxford University Rowing Clubs|OURCs]] events multiple times. The club has a boat house shared with [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] on Boat House Island by [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadows]], along with a purpose built erg shed, constructed to aid in training.
 
The Men's 1st VIII have raced in the [[Temple Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]] on several occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lmhboatclub.wordpress.com/events/|title=Events|date=16 October 2014|website=Lmhboatclub.wordpress.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>  On multiple years including 2018 and 2019, members of the club have rowed in [[The Boat Race]], an annual competition between Oxford and Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/9908522/University-Boat-Race-men-and-women-weigh-in-at-same-event-ahead-of-Oxford-and-Cambridge-race.html|title=University Boat Race: men and women weigh in at same event ahead of Oxford and Cambridge race|first=Rachel|last=Quarrell|date=4 March 2013|accessdate=30 September 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/news/lmh-rowers-featuring-tomorrows-boat-race</ref>

The college's boat club has, like other UK Rowing Clubs, distinctive blazers which can be awarded by the club to members who attain membership of certain VIIIs or race with distinction in [[Eights Week|Summer Eights]] or [[Torpids]]. These blazers have blue and yellow trim and a blue Beaufort portcullis on them, which is the emblem of the boat club and increasingly other sports clubs.

Rowing blades commemorating success in the intercollegiate rowing competitions decorate the walls of the bar.

There are three men's football teams as well as a joint LMH-[[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] women's team.

==== Other sports ====

== Art collection ==
In light of its history, the hall has a collection of portraits of early/distinguished women academics. Early Principals Lynda Grier, Dame Lucy Sutherland and Sally Chilver, along with other members of the college, were keen collectors of contemporary art and bequeathed many of these works to the College.

A Fellow in Fine Art, [[Elizabeth Price (artist)|Elizabeth Price]], was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artuk.org/visit/venues/lady-margaret-hall-university-of-oxford-7522|title=Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford {{!}} Art UK|website=artuk.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref>

The college's art collection includes works by:
* [[Maggi Hambling]]
* [[John Singer Sargent]]
* [[Stanley Spencer|Sir Stanley Spencer]]
* [[Philip de László]]

== Coat of arms ==
The college's [[coat of arms]] features devices that recall those associated with its foundation:

* The [[portcullis]] is from the arms of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]
* The bell is a symbol of the Wordsworth family.
* The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dogs]] represent Edward Talbot

The original coat of arms consisted of three daisies intertwined and bore the motto - "Ex solo ad solem" meaning "From the earth to the sun" and can be seen to adorn Talbot hall, and the Wordsworth and Toynbee buildings. The previous crest gave its name to one of the early college student publications from the 1890s - The Daisy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/lmh-objects/daisy|title=The Daisy|website=Lady Margaret Hall|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>

After the 50th anniversary of the college, the crest was replaced, now encompassing features which represent the history and founding of the college.

== Culture and traditions ==

=== Literature ===
In [[Philip Pullman|Phillip Pullman]]'s [[The Secret Commonwealth]] the character [[Lyra Belacqua]] attends an Oxford college, St Sophia's, which bears many similarities to Lady Margaret Hall: from its location on the map seen in 'Lyra's Oxford' to being one of the first colleges to offer women an education.

A thinly disguised version of the college appeared as "Lady Matilda's College" in an episode of ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]];'' portions of the episode were filmed within the hall.

The grounds, along with those of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], were the basis for Fleet College in the American author [[Charles Finch]]'s novel set in Oxford University, ''[[The Last Enchantments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelastenchantments.tumblr.com/post/70920173517/this-is-lady-margaret-hall-oxfords-first-college|title=The Last Enchantments|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>

''Death on the Cherwell'' by [[Mavis Doriel Hay]] includes a St Simeon's College, located approximately on the site of Lady Margaret Hall.

''[[Fire and Hemlock]]'' by [[Diana Wynne Jones]] had a St Margaret's College, which is based on Lady Margaret Hall.

=== Royal Visits ===
[[Elizabeth II|HM The Queen]] visited the hall in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/about-lmh/lmh-library|title=LMH Library|website=Lady Margaret Hall|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>

=== Steam Locomotive ===
A [[Great Western Railway]] [[GWR 6959 Class|6959 Class]] locomotive named "Lady Margaret Hall", number 7911, was built in 1950.

It was one of the 'Modified Hall' class and it was in service in the South East until December 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatwestern.org.uk/m_in_hal_hall7.htm|title=Great Western Railway Hall class details|website=Greatwestern.org.uk|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref>

=== Gardens ===
Students may not walk on the quadrangles or Fellows' lawn, however there is a custom of permitting them to do so on completion of their final examinations. There is a circular wooden bench dedicated to [[Iris Murdoch]] in the college gardens where she used to go walking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cherwell.org/2016/11/27/iris-murdochs-oxford-life/|title=Iris Murdoch's Oxford Life|last1=Sheridan|first1=Benn|website=Cherwell|publisher=OSPL|accessdate=22 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Formal Hall ===
The college's candlelit [[Formal Hall]] is held every Friday of term.

Lady Margaret Hall is one of nine Oxford colleges to use the 'two-word' Latin grace, this grace is also used by five colleges at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The person presiding at High Table says the grace in two parts at formal meals. The first half of the grace, the ''ante cibum'', is said before the meal starts and the second, the ''post cibum'', once the meal's conclusion. It is as follows:

''Benedictus benedicat'' - "May the Blessed One give a blessing"

''Benedicto benedicatur'' - "Let praise be given to the Blessed One" or "Let a blessing be given by the Blessed One"

In contrast to some other colleges, gowns are not worn to formal hall, though they are still required at special occasions such as the Scholars' dinner and the Founders' and Benefactors' dinner.

=== Poet in Residence ===
The college has a poet in residence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/news/kieron-winn-new-poet-residence-lmh|title=Kieron Winn is new Poet in Residence at LMH|website=Lady Margaret Hall|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>
