Established in 1984, it is now published daily online and weekly on print format by Dikgang Publishing House in the capital, [[Gaborone]]. ''Mmegi'' used to be Botswana's only independent newspaper to be published daily.

The newspaper's name means "the reporter" in [[Tswana language|Setswana]] and its strapline is "News we need to know daily". Until 1989, it was called '''''Mmegi wa Dikgang/The Reporter'''''.
