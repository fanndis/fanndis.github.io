For fifteen years she practiced law, representing mostly [[organized labor]]. She participated in three cases in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], including, in 1985, the landmark case of ''[[Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority]]'', which established the line between the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] and the states. She then went into [[academia]], teaching law, philosophy, and [[women's studies]], before she retired from [[Brandeis University]] in 2002.

In 2006, Hirshman released ''Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World''<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670038121 ''Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World''] – Amazon listing</ref> in which she developed the arguments in her 2005 article “Homeward Bound" in favor of women working, to use their capacities, be independent and be of benefit to the larger society, and addressed some of the criticism of her earlier work.<ref>[https://prospect.org/article/homeward-bound-0 ''Homeward Bound''] -The American Prospect, November 21, 2005</ref>

In June 2012, Hirshman released her new book, a social movement study, ''Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution.''

She is at work at present on a history of abolition, ''Black and White.''

== Criticism ==
According to Hirshman's own biographical byline for periodicals, she "landed spot No. 77" on author [[Bernard Goldberg]]'s list of ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]'' "with almost no effort." Goldberg criticized Hirshman for comments she made in a segment produced by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in October 2004. Hirshman's comments involved young, well-educated women who chose to give up high-paying, high-powered, and prestigious jobs in order to stay home and take care of their children. In the segment, Hirshman argued that this kind of decision would only lead to a lesser life for these women: "These women are choosing lives in which they do not use their capacity for very complicated work, they're choosing lives in which they do not use their capacity to deal with very powerful other adults in the world, which takes a lot of skill. I think there are better lives and worse lives."{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Hirshman was also criticized by feminist bloggers such as [[Leslie Morgan Steiner]] and economists such as [[Heather Boushey]] for having insufficient [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] for her contention that women were dropping out of the U.S. [[labor market]],<ref>[http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/opt_out_2005_11_2.pdf ''Are Women Opting Out? Debunking the Myth''] – CEPR, December 2005</ref> a charge which Hirshman says does not change her conclusions.<ref>[http://insidehighered.com/views/2005/12/09/hirshman ''Is Your Husband a Worse Problem Than Larry Summers?''] – Inside Higher Ed, 12/9/05</ref> Women, she says, who opt to [[housewife|stay at home]] are disproportionately among the educated elite and however many there are, their decision affects the gender composition of the people who run the society and the way that other women, in the workplace or not, think about their lives.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
