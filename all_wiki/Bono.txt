==Early life==
Bono was born Paul David Hewson in the [[Rotunda Hospital]] in Dublin, Ireland, on 10 May 1960,<ref>{{cite book |title=Bono: In the Name of Love |last=Wall |first=Mick |year=2006 |publisher=Andre Deutsch Ltd |isbn= 978-0-233-00177-7 |page= 17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RupSPwAACAAJ |access-date=5 September 2013}}</ref> as the second child of Iris (née Rankin) and Brendan Robert "Bob" Hewson; Bono's brother, Norman, is eight years his senior. Bono was raised in the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] suburb of [[Finglas]].<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 15</ref><ref name="Bono - Evening Herald">{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/its-where-i-shaped-my-future-says-bono-3324323.html |title=It's where I shaped my future, says Bono |newspaper=[[Evening Herald]] |publisher=Herald.ie |date=12 December 2012 |access-date=5 September 2013}}</ref> The Hewson household was an [[Interfaith marriage in Christianity|interfaith Christian]] one; Bono's mother was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and his father was a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 17</ref><ref name="Bono on Bono" /> His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised [[Anglican]] and the second Catholic.<ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy">{{cite book|title=Unforgettable Fire: The Definitive Biography of U2|first=Eamon|last=Dunphy|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=978-0-446-51459-0|location=New York|year=1987|url=https://archive.org/details/unforgettablefir00eamo}}</ref> Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.<ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy" /> Bono's teenage musical idols were [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Marc Bolan]] of [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Cormac |last=McSherry|title=Bono's Teenage Kicks|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 June 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/jun/17/bono |access-date= 3 January 2020}}</ref>

He went to the local primary Glasnevin National School.<ref>Matthews (2008), p. 8</ref> Bono's mother died on 10 September 1974, after suffering a [[cerebral aneurysm]] at her father's funeral.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /> Many U2 songs, including "[[I Will Follow]]", "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Three (U2 EP)|Out of Control]]", "[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]" and "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]", focus on the loss of his mother.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /><ref name=010197DailyTelegraph>{{cite news|title=Growing Up With U2|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Neil|last=McCormick|date=1 January 1997}}</ref><ref name=Schruers>{{cite journal|title=U2: Small Victories in a Rock and Roll Struggle of Sound and Emotion Report|first=Fred|last=Schruers|date=May 1983|journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician Magazine]]}}</ref>

After attending St. Patrick's grammar school for a year, Bono began to attend [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]], a multi-denominational school in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]].<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 18</ref> During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a [[surrealist]] street gang called "Lypton Village". One of his closest childhood friends, [[Guggi]], was also in Lypton Village. The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was "Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang",<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 39</ref> then just "Huyseman", followed by "Houseman", "Bon Murray", "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street", and finally just "Bono".<ref name="Bono on Bono">{{cite book|last=Assayas|first=Michka|title=Bono on Bono: Conversations with Michka Assayas|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|isbn=978-0-340-83276-9|location=London|year=2005}}</ref> "Bono Vox" is an alteration of ''Bonavox'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates to "good voice". It is said he was nicknamed "Bono Vox" by his friend [[Gavin Friday]]. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to "good voice", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as "Bono" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.<ref name="Bono on Bono" />

After Bono left school, his father told him he could live at home for one year, but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 59</ref>

==Musical career==

===U2===
[[File:U2 21081983 01 800b.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a light-skinned man singing into a microphone.

{{Main|U2}}
On 25 September 1976, Bono, [[The Edge|David Evans ("The Edge")]], his brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] and [[Adam Clayton]] responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student [[Larry Mullen, Jr.|Larry Mullen Jr.]] to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Beach Boys]] songs.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Henke|first=James |title=Blessed Are the Peacemakers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 June 1983 |issue=397|pages=11–14}}</ref>

The band went by the name "Feedback" for a few months, before changing to "The Hype" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the [[Virgin Prunes]], the remaining four officially changed the name from "The Hype" to "[[U2]]". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'"<ref>{{cite journal |title = Bono in San Antonio |journal = U2 Magazine |issue = 3 |date = May 1982 }}</ref> When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/bono-takes-piano-lessons_02_06_2006 |title = U2—Bono Takes Piano Lessons |magazine = [[Contactmusic.com]] |date = 6 February 2006 |access-date = 14 February 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:Sting-Bono-Conspiracy of Hope-by Steven Toole.jpg|thumb|Bono (right) with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] during [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] in 1986]]
Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which often have social and political themes.<ref name=ATU2comBonoBio>{{cite web |url = http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/ |title = Bono: Biography from @U2 |publisher = atU2.com |access-date = 19 November 2010 }}</ref> His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as "[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]" from the band's album ''[[October (U2 album)|October]]'' and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" from ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''.<ref name=Stockman>Stockman (2005)</ref> During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'', ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' eras.<ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /> Following the [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]] that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /> IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /> These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]".<ref name="Bono on Bono" /> The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the ''Rattle and Hum'' film, but it was left in.<ref name=RattleandHum>{{cite video |people = Hamlyn, Michael (producer), and Joanou, Phil (director) |year = 1988 |title = [[Rattle and Hum]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] }}</ref> Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.

[[File:Bono as The Fly Cleveland 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bono as his alter-ego "The Fly" on the [[Zoo TV Tour]] in 1992]]
U2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /><ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /> During the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]] several of [[Zoo TV Tour#Bono's stage personae|his stage personae]] were showcased; these included "The Fly", a stereotypical rock star; "Mirror Ball Man", a parody of American [[televangelists]]; and "MacPhisto", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the [[Satan|Devil]].<ref name="Bono on Bono" /><ref name=ATU2comBonoBio />

During performances, Bono attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible. He is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience.<ref name="Bono on Bono" /> At the [[Live Aid|Live Aid concert]] in 1985, Bono leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]". In 2005, during U2's [[Vertigo Tour]] stop in Chicago, he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song "[[An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart]]".<ref name="Bono on Bono" /><ref name=VertigoDVD>{{cite video |people = O'Hanlon, Ned (producer), and Hamilton, Hamish (director) |year = 2005 |title = [[Vertigo 2005: Live From Chicago]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = 3DD Entertainment }}</ref> Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.

While accepting the [[60th Golden Globe Awards#Best Original Song|2003 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] for "[[The Hands That Built America]]", Bono called the award "really, really fucking brilliant!" during the live television broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boliek |first=Brooks |title=Appeals court throws out FCC indecency ruling |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |date=5 June 2007 |access-date=1 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707012358/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |archive-date=7 July 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In response, the [[Parents Television Council]] condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=PTC condemns NBC |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=20 January 2003 |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |access-date=16 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211001/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> Although Bono's use of "fuck" violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ahrens |first = Frank |title = FCC Says Bono Profanity Violated Standards, but Won't Fine NBC |pages = E1 |work = The Washington Post |date = 19 March 2004 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6242-2004Mar18&notFound=true |access-date = 16 July 2007 }}</ref>

Since 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved in campaigning for third-world debt relief and raising awareness of the plight of Africa, including the AIDS pandemic. In the past decade Bono has met with several influential politicians, including former United States President [[George W. Bush]] and former Canadian Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].<ref name=GuardianStory>Denny, C., & Black, I. (15 March 2002).

In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists [[Richard Tomlinson]] and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his [[ONE Campaign]] while at the same time "U2 was racking up $389&nbsp;million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ...

Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of [[African Aid Action]]. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/bono/32704|title=Bono and Bob Geldof increase Africa's problems say charity|date=23 November 2007|work=NME.COM|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref> Bono responded to his critics in ''Times Online'' on 19 February 2006, calling them "cranks carping from the sidelines.
