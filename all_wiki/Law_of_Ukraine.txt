{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}
The legal system of [[Ukraine]] is based on the framework of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and belongs to the Romano-Germanic legal tradition. The main source of legal information is codified law. [[Customary law]] and [[case law]] are not as common, though case law is often used in support of the written law, as in many other legal systems. Historically, the Ukrainian legal system is primarily influenced by the French [[Code Civil|civil code]], [[Roman Law]], and traditional Ukrainian customary law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The new civil law books (enacted in 2004) were heavily influenced by the German [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] .{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The primary law making body is the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] (''Verkhovna Rada''), also referred to as the legislature ({{lang-uk|законодавча влада|translit=zakonodavcha vlada}}). The power to make laws can be delegated to lower governments or specific organs of the State, but only for a prescribed purpose. In recent years, it has become common for the legislature to create "framework laws" and delegate the creation of detailed rules to ministers or lower governments (e.g. a province or municipality).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} After laws are published in [[Holos Ukrayiny]] they come into force officially the next day.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7068453/ Laws discommunization and status OUN and UPA published in "Holos Ukrayiny"], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (20 May 2015)</ref>

==Areas==
Ukrainian law is commonly divided into [[Public law]], [[Private law]], and [[International law]]. These areas of the legal system are further subdivided into [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] (including [[Family law]], [[Inheritance law]], [[Contract law]] and [[Commercial law]], [[Law of Obligations]], [[Property law]], [[Intellectual property law]], [[Companies law]], [[Land law]], and [[Tort law]]),  [[Criminal law]], [[Constitutional law]] (including laws on the structure of the state), [[Administrative law]], and [[International law]].

===Civil law===
[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] regulates the everyday life of citizens and other legal entities, such as corporations. The main code of Ukrainian civil law is the Civil Code of Ukraine. It comprises provisions governing ownership, intellectual property rights, contracts, torts, obligations, inheritance law, and the definition of legal entities. The code introduces new types of business contracts into the legal practice, including factoring, [[franchising]], rent service, and inherited contracts. Civil litigation is governed by the Civil Procedural Code of Ukraine.

===Criminal law===
[[Criminal law]] deals with the prosecution and punishment of criminal offenses. The Criminal Code of Ukraine contains the written criminal laws of Ukraine. There is no [[capital punishment]] in Ukraine. The maximum [[criminal punishment]] is [[life imprisonment]], which can be reduced by decree of the [[President of Ukraine]] to 25 years of imprisonment, but only after 20 years of sentence service. The Parliament of Ukraine has the power of [[amnesty]] for prisoners not serving life sentences.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Criminal proceedings, investigation, and court examination in criminal trials are regulated by The Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine, which was not changed since 1962 when Ukraine was a republic of the Soviet Union till the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] passed the new Code of Criminal Procedure in April 2012.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/113202/ Yanukovych mum about Tymoshenko], [[Kyiv Post]] (September 20, 2011)<br>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/48278 Criminal-Political Code], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (3 May 2012)</ref>

===Constitutional law===
[[Constitutional law]] frames the constitution and the structure of Ukraine. It regulates the powers of democratic institutions, the organization of elections and the division of power between central and local government. See also the article on the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. Only the Constitutional Court of Ukraine is allowed to determine the constitutionality of laws created by the legislature.

===Administrative law===
[[Administrative law]] is the area of law that regulates the operation of the various levels of Ukrainian Government, including the process for people and legal entities to appeal decisions by the government. This code is referred to as the Administrative Code of Ukraine.

===International law===
[[International law]], also referred to as  the Law of Nations, involves the application of international laws in Ukraine. International agreements, ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine, are a part of Ukrainian legislation. The Constitution of Ukraine allows the direct application of most international laws in Ukrainian courts. If an international agreement of Ukraine prescribes rules other than those set by the Law of Ukraine, the rules of that international agreement shall apply. Laws regulating jurisdiction with an international aspect, such as  because parties come from different countries, are not part of international law, but form a specific branch of civil law.

On September 2005, the Law of Ukraine on [[Private International Law]] was enacted.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Law sets the procedure for the regulation of private legal relations which are subject to other legal systems in addition to that of Ukraine.

===Commercial law===

The Code regulates the fundamentals of commercial activity, including business entities, property basis, responsibility for violations, peculiarities of legal regulation, and foreign commerce regulation.

[[File:Схема системи судів загальної юрисдикції.gif|thumb|right| Courts system of Ukraine]]

[[Courts]] in Ukraine are divided  by [[jurisdiction]] including [[constitutional court]]s, general (criminal and civil jurisdiction) courts, economic courts, and [[administrative courts]]. There is also the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]], the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]], [[Appellate Court]]s (in every Region [[oblast]] of Ukraine), and [[Judicial system of Ukraine|District Court]]s in every [[city]], [[town]], or [[raion]] (which is a subdivision of oblast). As well, there is the High Administrative Court of Ukraine, Local Administrative Courts in every administrative district, usually [[oblast]], the High Commercial Court of Ukraine, Local Commercial Courts in every administrative district, usually [[oblast]], and [[Military court]] in every Appellate Court in every regional [[oblast]]. There is also the Tertiary Court created in accordance to the law "On Tertiary Court" and registered in [[Ministry of Justice]] of Ukraine.

In order to become a [[judge]] in Ukraine, one must be 25 years old. Newly inducted judges are appointed by the President of Ukraine and serve for five years. Afterwards, judges are elected for life by the Parliament of Ukraine. Judges are not elected by the citizenry as practiced in many western countries. The judicial branch of power in Ukraine is not completely independent. To detain or arrest a judge, special permission by the Parliament of Ukraine is needed. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A judge shall not refer to political parties and trade unions, as well as participate in any political activity, have representative mandate, occupy any other paid posts, or do any other paid work except that which is scientific in nature, teaching or creative value. According to the law, a judge, while executing justice, shall follow the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine and shall ensure full, thorough and objective consideration of the cases adhering to the terms set by law. They are also obliged to take measures concerning prevention of unauthorized dissemination of the information the state and/or commercial entity considers secret or is confidential and became known to him/her in the process of doing official duties. Moreover, the Law requires a judge to refrain from the actions that defame a judge and may cause doubt that she/he is objective, as well as unprejudiced and independent.

The Law sets the system of guarantees of judge's professional activity which are necessary to approve unprejudiced and objective decisions. The Law guarantees to judges their personal immunity, secrecy of court decisions, legal protection, as well as material and social provision. The Law also prohibits any not envisaged by law interference in judge's activity concerning justice execution, detention or arrest of a judge without the consent of the ''Verkhovna Rada'' until bill of indictment concerning him/her is carried out by the court.

==Law schools==
Ukraine has taken steps to reform its education frameworks in consistence with the Bologna process. By the mid-2000s, Universities started granting undergraduate [[Bachelor of Laws]] degrees (about 3 years for full-time students and 4 years for part-time students) and graduate [[Master of Laws]] degrees (about 5 years for full-time students and 6 years for part-time students). In Soviet times, the only undergraduate degree (following a 10-year secondary education) was a 5-year Specialist Diploma, with a thesis requirement, usually placing it somewhere between a bachelor's and master's degree in the West. Degrees are awarded by authorities of the State Examination Board of University. The University degree gives people the right to engage in professional legal activities in Ukraine as a legal advisor. However, judges and criminal defense attorneys must take an additional state licensing exam.

==Post-graduate education==
The post-graduate system has not been reformed. Law [[academic degree]]s in Ukraine are the Candidate of Science of Jurisprudence (CSJ) and Doctor of Science of Jurisprudence (DSJ), equivalent to [[Doctor of the Science of Law]] (L.Sc.D.)
The [[Diploma]] is awarded after the successful defense of [[dissertation]] ([[thesis]]) by the [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK). Full text of all defended dissertations are kept in the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine]].

===Fields of study===

Scientific degrees awarded by VAK are classified into an established list of specialties, grouped into the following major sections.

*12.00.01 Theory of Law
*12.00.02 [[Constitutional Law]]
*12.00.03  [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]]

==Notaries==
[[Notary]] in Ukraine is based on the guidelines set forth by the law entitled "On Notariate". According to the law, the Notariate is a system of bodies and officials obliged to certify rights, certify facts that have legal force and perform other notary actions as stated in the law with the purpose of giving them legal force.
In Ukraine, notary operations are carried out by state notaries, private notaries or officials of executive bodies of local (village, settlement, city) councils, if there are no notaries therein. The  difference between state and private notaries is the service fees imposed  by public notaries are fixed by the state, whereas the only aspect regulated by the State in regards to private notaries is the  price floor.

Any person who considers occupation of the notary post must be a citizen of Ukraine, have higher legal education (university, academy, institute), work on probation during 6 months in a state notary office or at private notary, pass a qualification exam and receive a certificate permitting notary actions. A person with any outstanding convictions cannot be a notary by law.

The Certificate permitting notary activities may be abrogated by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine in the following cases:
- on notary's own initiative;
- loss of Ukrainian citizenship or departure to permanent residence outside Ukraine;
- notary's non-conformity to the occupied post because of health condition preventing him from accomplishment of notary activities;
- coming into force of conviction sentence against notary.

Notaries are not allowed by law to work in courts, police, and prosecutor offices, nor represent citizens in courts or any other government offices. The major role of notaries in Ukraine is to notarize documents and contracts between persons in accordance to Civil Code of Ukraine. Every notarized document, agreement, contract, etc. is issued on numerated, special paper form, protected by security features and is registered in the  notary's records which is kept after completion in regional ([[oblast]]) archives indefinitely. A notary database is kept and accessible to public on the official website of the [[Ministry of Justice]] of Ukraine. As of 2007, about 13,000 registered notaries practice in Ukraine.

==Criminal justice system==
Criminal [[Criminal procedure|Investigations]] are carried out under official authority by law enforcement personnel
such as the [[Police]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/en/index;jsessionid=F410EEB754842B2A0A83336CE809820A |script-title=ru:Мвс України |language=ru |publisher=Mvs.gov.ua |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>  the tax police (tax militia), [[Public Procurator]]s (Public Prosecutors),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.gov.ua/ |script-title=ru:Генеральна прокуратура України. Офіційний інтернет-портал / Стартова сторінка |publisher=Gp.gov.ua |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=2011-11-01 |language=ru }}</ref>  and the [[Security Service of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbu.gov.ua/sbu/control/en/index |title=The Security Service of Ukraine |publisher=Sbu.gov.ua |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>

In Ukraine and other civil law jurisdictions, the [[jury]] holds equal power to three professional [[judge]]s. The [[jury]] and judges first consider the question of guilt. Then, if applicable, they consider the penalty to apply. Juries are only used for severe felony cases with a ten-year or higher sentence.

==Prison system==
The State Department of Ukraine for Enforcement of Sentences oversees the prison system of Ukraine.<ref>Detailed information is on the [http://www.kvs.gov.ua  official website] of the department.</ref>

As of 2007, the total prison population in Ukraine was 240,000 people out of the 48 million population.

Prisons in Ukraine are classified as pre-trial or remand prisons (SIZO), high security prisons, medium security prisons, and low security prisons.

Those who are charged with [[criminal offense]]s which entail sentencing for three years or more are arrested and held before trial in investigative isolation during the period of [[criminal investigation]] and after sentencing are moved to the prison as indicated by the courts in the sentencing decision. Bail is rarely used by courts in Ukraine.

==Identification==
In Ukraine, every person over 18 years of age must carry a [[passport]] or (for foreigners) an [[alien (law)|alien]] document. A person unable to provide passport is allowed  to be arrested and held in police custody for up to 72 hours in order to establish the identity thereof.
