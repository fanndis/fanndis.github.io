==Lawsuit with Kesha==
{{Main|Kesha v. Dr. Luke}}
In September 2013, Rebecca Pimmel, a fan of [[Kesha]], set up a petition to "free" Kesha from Gottwald's management and accused Luke of "stunting" Kesha's creative growth as an artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7485711/kesha-fan-petition-free-dr-luke|title=Ke$ha's Concerned Fans Have Started A Petition To Free Her From Dr. Luke|date=September 23, 2013|website=Idolator.com}}</ref> The petitioners concur with the position stated in Kesha's TV series documentary, ''[[Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life|My Crazy Beautiful Life]]'', in which Luke serves as an executive producer, that she had little creative control of her second album, ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadey.net/2013/09/kehas-director-tweets-photo-fans-revolting-dr-luke/|title=Ke$ha's Director Tweets Photo Of Fans Revolting Against Dr. Luke - arcadey|work=arcadey|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

In January 2014, shortly after Kesha was admitted to a rehab center for [[bulimia nervosa]], Kesha's mother, [[Pebe Sebert]], made allegations that pressure for Kesha to lose weight came from Gottwald. Sebert claimed that Gottwald said that Kesha looked "like a refrigerator" which instigated her [[eating disorder]]. Gottwald denies these claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.radio.com/2014/01/10/keshas-mom-blames-dr-luke-for-daughters-eating-disorder-producer-responds/|title=Kesha's Mom Blames Dr. Luke for Daughter's Eating Disorder, Producer Responds|website=Radio.com|date=10 January 2014|access-date=January 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112103753/http://news.radio.com/2014/01/10/keshas-mom-blames-dr-luke-for-daughters-eating-disorder-producer-responds/|archive-date=January 12, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 2014, Kesha sued Gottwald, claiming sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, gender violence, civil harassment, violation of California's laws against unfair business practices, infliction of emotional distress (both intentional  and negligent), and negligent retention and supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6281709/kesha-suing-dr-luke|title=Kesha Suing Dr. Luke for Alleged Sexual Assault & Emotional Abuse|work=Billboard|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/242979442/Kesha-Complaint|title=Kesha Complaint|work=Scribd|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> Gottwald responded by filing a countersuit alleging that Kesha's lawsuit was an attempt by Kesha, her mother, and her new management firm to extort him into releasing her from her contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/10/14/kesha-sexual-assault-dr-luke-abuse-lawsuit-drugs/|title=Kesha -- Sues Dr. Luke for Sexual Assault and Battery|date=October 14, 2014|work=TMZ|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>

A preliminary injunction in which Kesha sought to be released from her contract was denied on February 19, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/19/kesha-dr-luke-denied-legal-request-record-label-rape|title=Kesha denied legal request to escape contract with man she alleges raped her|last=Gajanan|first=Mahita|date=February 19, 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref> Before her legal battle against Gottwald, in 2011, Kesha had previously sworn under oath that the producer had never assaulted or drugged her in a deposition for a lawsuit against her former managers at DAS Communications, a key piece of evidence that played a role in the court ruling in favor of the defense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/kesha-trial-dr-luke-deposition-video-denies-sexual-advances-roofie|title=VIDEO: Kesha Denied Gottwald 'Made Sexual Advances,' Roofying Her in 2011 Deposition|website=People.com|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> In April 2016, Kesha claimed that she had been offered freedom from her contract if she recanted her rape allegations against Gottwald.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/04/entertainment/kesha-rape-claims-freedom-feat/index.html|title=Kesha: I was offered 'freedom' to recant rape claims|website=Cnn.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>

Since Gottwald's countersuit was in New York, the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on incidents alleged to have occurred in California. Kesha filed suit in California, but a Los Angeles superior court judge froze Kesha's lawsuit until Gottwald's lawsuit, for breach of contract and defamation, was settled.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/07/kesha-dr-luke-lawsuits-new-york-california|title=The end of #FreeKesha: judge's ruling brings pop star back to square one|first=Molly|last=Redden|date=April 7, 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

On April 6, 2016, New York Judge Shirley Kornreich dismissed Kesha's claims of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and gender violence. "While Kesha's [claim] alleges that she was sexually, physically and verbally abused by Gottwald for a decade, she describes only two specific instances of physical/sexual abuse," Kornreich wrote. "And the most recent event described was alleged to have happened in 2008 and so falls outside of the [[statute of limitations]]." The judge dismissed Kesha's [[hate crime]] claim because the filings "do not allege that Gottwald harbored animus toward women or was motivated by gender animus when he allegedly behaved violently toward Kesha ... Every rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime." Kesha's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress was dismissed by the judge because "claims of insults about her value as an artist, her looks, and her weight are insufficient to constitute extreme, outrageous conduct intolerable in civilized society."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kornhaber|first1=Spencer|title=The Legal Facts About Kesha's Loss|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/kesha-dismissal-statute-of-limitations-dr-luke/477261/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=7 April 2016|language=en-US}}</ref>
