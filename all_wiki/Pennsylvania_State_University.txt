[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in 1882, and broadened the curriculum.

In the 1970s, the university became a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]].

The largest of the university's 24 campuses, [[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park]] is  located in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] borough and [[College Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania|College Township]] in [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], a site chosen because it is near the geographic center of the state. University Park is a city within Pennsylvania with its own ZIP code (16802). With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 50 percent,<ref>{{cite web |title=Penn State University--University Park |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/penn-state-6965|work=[[US News and World Report]]|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref> it is the most selective campus in the Penn State system, primarily due to the fact that students select University Park as their first-choice campus at a far greater rate than the university's other undergraduate campuses.<ref name="upark competitive">{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/admissions/counselors/campuses/uppopularity.htm |title=Why Is Admission to University Park So Competitive? |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910113143/http://www.psu.edu/admissions/counselors/campuses/uppopularity.htm |archive-date=September 10, 2006 |date=August 29, 2006 |author=Undergraduate Admissions Office |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> During the fall 2018 semester, 40,363 undergraduate students and 5,907 graduate students were enrolled at University Park.<ref name="enrollment upark">{{cite web|url=https://budget.psu.edu/factbook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2018Enr&FBPlusIndc=N|title=Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Fall Enrollment|work=Penn State Fact Book|publisher=University Budget Office.

Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the [[Lock Haven, PA|Lock Haven]] – [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] branch line of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|first=Christopher T.|last=Baer|title=Named Trains of the PRR including Through Services|year=2009|url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf|website=prrths.com}}</ref> Today, the nearest [[Amtrak]] passenger rail access is in [[Tyrone, PA|Tyrone]], 25 miles to the southwest. Intercity bus service to University Park is provided by [[Fullington Trailways]], [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], and [[OurBus]].

== Organization and administration ==
Penn State is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.<ref name="state approps">{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |title=Spanier Testifies for More Funding |last=Horan |first=Kevin |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041834/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |archive-date=October 31, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Initial reports concerning the 2007–2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.<ref name="approps 0708">{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |title=Penn State To Receive Increased Appropriations |last=Boyer |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041856/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |archive-date=October 31, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.<ref name="approp request 07-08">{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/President/AppropRequest200708/Table2.asp |title=2007–08 Appropriation Request |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |publisher=University Budget Office.

Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang "We Shall Overcome", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.<ref>''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''.

The Materials Research Institute was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for Interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.<ref name="aboutmri">{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |title=About MRI |author=Materials Research Institute |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912072004/http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |archive-date=September 12, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="mri">{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/|title=Materials Research Institute|author=Materials Research Institute|accessdate=August 27, 2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matse.psu.edu/ret/tresslerbio |title=Dr. Richard E.

They partner with groups ranging from Boulevard, UPUA, Greek Life, and more to receive over 8,000 food donations a year. The club was also awarded the Class Gift of 2017 in the form of an endowment.<ref name="2017 Class Gift">{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Waldhier|title=Class of 2017 Pledges Support to Lion's Pantry, the Student Food Bank|date=October 26, 2016|work=[[PSU News]]|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/434135/2016/10/26/campus-life/class-2017-pledges-support-lions-pantry-student-food-bank|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'' has continuously been ranked as one of the top college newspapers by the Princeton Review. The paper, which was founded in 1904, provides news, sports and arts coverage, and produces long-form features. It publishes in print on Mondays and Thursdays while classes are in session. Since the summer of 1996, the traditional paper publication has been supplemented by an online edition. Online content is published every day. Penn State's commonwealth campuses receive a weekly copy of the paper, titled ''The Weekly Collegian''.

''[[Onward State]]'' is a student-run blog geared towards members of the university's community. The blog, which was founded in 2008, provides news, event coverage and opinion pieces. ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' named the blog the "Best Alternative Media Outlet" in February 2009.

The Underground is a multicultural student-run media site devoted to telling the untold stories within the Penn State community. The publication seeks to foster the multicultural student voice through creating an open forum of discussion and promoting diversity and community involvement. The media site was founded in 2015.

[[WKPS|The LION 90.7 FM (WKPS-FM)]] was founded in 1995 as a replacement for Penn State's original student radio station WDFM. The LION broadcasts from the ground floor of the [[HUB–Robeson Center]], serving the Penn State and State College communities with alternative music and talk programming, including live coverage of home Penn State football games.

CommRadio is operated by the [[Penn State College of Communications]]. It was founded in the spring of 2003 as an internet-based audio laboratory and co-curricular training environment for aspiring student broadcasters. It airs both sports coverage and news. Other programming includes student talk shows, political coverage, AP syndicated news, and soft rock music. In recent years, ComRadio broadcasters have won numerous state awards for their on-air work.

''La Vie'' (the Life), the university's annual student yearbook, has been in production documenting student life continuously since 1890.<ref name="psu_lavie">{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://psulavie.org/|publisher=PSU Lavie|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> ''La Vie 1987,'' edited by David Beagin, won a College Gold Crown for Yearbooks award from the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1988 Collegiate Crown Recipients |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/1988-collegiate-crown.html |publisher=[[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] |accessdate=August 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114110936/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/1988-collegiate-crown.html |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Kalliope'' includes works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and visual art.<ref name="Kalliope Magazine">{{cite web|title=Kalliope Magazine |url=http://english.la.psu.edu/kalliope/about.html |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |author=Kalliope |publisher=Penn State English Department |archive-date=December 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225033947/http://english.la.psu.edu/kalliope/about.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, ''Klio'', an online publication, provides students with literary pieces in the fall semester.

''Valley'' is Penn State's student-run life and style magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valley Magazine |url=http://www.valleymagazinepsu.com|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> It was founded in 2007.

The student-run humor magazine is ''Phroth'', which publishes two to four issues each year. Its roots date back to 1909 when it was called ''Froth''. Several ''Froth'' writers and editors have gone on to win fame: [[Julius J. Epstein]] wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) and won three [[Academy Award]]s; [[Jimmy Dugan]] wrote for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', and ''The New York Times''; and [[Ronald Bonn]] was a producer with ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]''.<ref name="Phroth Magazine">{{cite web|title=Phroth Magazine |url=http://www.phroth.com/history/ |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |author=Phroth |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611065006/http://www.phroth.com/history/ |archive-date=June 11, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition, Penn State's newspaper readership program provides free copies of ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as local and regional newspapers depending on the campus location (for example, the ''[[Centre Daily Times]]'' in University Park). This program, initiated by then-President Graham Spanier in 1997,<ref name="newspaper">{{cite web |url=http://www.newspapers.psu.edu/|title=Newspaper Readership Program|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=February 11, 2007}}</ref> has since been instituted on several other universities across the country.<ref name="newspaper2">{{cite web|title=The Collegiate Readership Program: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://college.usatoday.com/the-collegiate-readership-program-frequently-asked-questions/|website=USAToday.com|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}</ref>

Penn State's mascot is the [[Nittany Lion]], a representation of a type of [[mountain lion]] that once roamed what is now University Park. The school's official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink.

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, as evidenced by its rankings in the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.<ref name=dcup>{{cite web|title=Nittany Lions No. 9 in Final Directors' Cup Standings; Penn State Earns Eighth Top 10 Finish in the Survey's 15 Years|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/062608aab.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref>

Despite widespread success in the overall athletic program, however, the school is best known for its [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football team]], which draws a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second largest [[seating capacity]] of any stadium in the nation,<ref>{{cite web|last=Fortuna |first=Matt |accessdate=September 24, 2008 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |title=Beaver To Rule Arenas |date=March 17, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202110638/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |archive-date=December 2, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> with an official capacity of 106,572 slightly behind Michigan Stadium with an official capacity of 107,601. For decades, the football team was led by coach [[Joe Paterno]]. Paterno was in a close competition with [[Bobby Bowden]], the head coach for [[Florida State]], for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. This competition effectively ended with Paterno still leading following Bowden's retirement after the [[2010 Gator Bowl]]. In 2007, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Paterno inducted into College Football Hall of Fame |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/192048/2007/11/30/paterno-inducted-college-football-hall-fame|publisher= Pennsylvania State University |date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref> Paterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division 1 history.<ref>{{cite news|title=With Penn State wins restored, Joe Paterno the winningest coach again |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/01/16/ncaa-joe-paterno-wins-restored-penn-state-settlement/21867685/ |accessdate=November 27, 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85.

The school's wrestling team has also become noticed. Under [[Cael Sanderson]], the Nittany Lions won eight national titles in a nine-year span, from 2011 to 2019.

The university opened a new [[Penn State All-Sports Museum]] in February 2002. This two-level {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.<ref name="sports museum">{{cite web|title=GoPSUsports.com – Official Home of Penn State Athletics |url=http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723052027/http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |archive-date=July 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
In addition to the school funded athletics, club sports also play a major role in the university, with over 68 club sport organizations meeting regularly to date. Many club teams compete nationally in their respective sports. The Penn State Ski Team, which competes as part of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) in the Allegheny Conference, as well as the Penn State Swim Club, which competes in the American Swimming Association – University League (ASAU), are just a few examples. Some other clubs include baseball, [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[karate]], [[crew (sport)|crew]], and sailing.

Penn State's most well known athletic cheer is "We are...Penn State." Typically, the students and cheerleaders shout, "We are," followed by a response of "Penn State" from the rest of the fans. By tradition, this is done three times, and followed by "Thank you..." "... You're welcome!"
