In the critically acclaimed drama ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'' (2005), Theron portrayed a single mother and an [[iron mine]] worker experiencing sexual harassment. David Rooney of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: "The film represents a confident next step for lead Charlize Theron. Though the challenges of following a career-redefining Oscar role have stymied actresses, Theron segues from ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' to a performance in many ways more accomplished [...] The strength of both the performance and character anchor the film firmly in the tradition of other dramas about working-class women leading the fight over industrial workplace issues, such as ''[[Norma Rae]]'' or ''[[Silkwood]]''."<ref>Rooney, David.

On 4 December 2009, Theron co-presented the draw for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, accompanied by several other celebrities of South African nationality or ancestry. During rehearsals she drew an [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] ball instead of [[France national football team|France]] as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to [[Thierry Henry]]'s handball controversy in the [[France vs Republic of Ireland (2010 FIFA World Cup Play-Off)|play-off match]] between France and Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/theron-has-a-ball-at-fifas-expense-1962410.html |title=Theron has a ball at FIFA's expense |first= Jason |last= O'Brien |work=[[The Irish Independent]]|date=3 December 2009|access-date=8 June 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&fArticleId=5273884 Charlize puts Ireland in the finals]. 4 December 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429033910/http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&fArticleId=5273884 |date=29 April 2015}}</ref> The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/FIFA-shock-as-Charlize-Theron-picks-Ireland-as-first-team-for-World-Cup-78329492.html |title=FIFA shock as Charlize Theron picks Ireland as first team in World Cup draw, Hollywood star pulls stunt on World Cup officials in South Africa |publisher=Irishcentral.com |access-date=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303172637/http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/FIFA-shock-as-Charlize-Theron-picks-Ireland-as-first-team-for-World-Cup-78329492.html |archive-date=3 March 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Following a two-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with the black comedy ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]''. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim, particularly for her performance as a depressed divorced, alcoholic 37-year-old [[ghostwriter]]. [[Richard Roeper]] awarded the film an A grade, stating "Charlize Theron delivers one of the most impressive performances of the year".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/youngadult.aspx |title= Young Adult Review |first= Richard |last= Roeper |author-link= Richard Roeper |publisher= Richard Roeper & The Movies / [[Reelz Channel]] |access-date= 21 April 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120419074420/http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/youngadult.aspx |archive-date= 19 April 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and several other awards.

In 2011, Theron spoke about her method of working on roles: "When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it – and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about [the character] all the time – I observe things, I see things and file things [in my head], everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with [a character's] nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time to do my job, to do the honest truth".<ref name=fji>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012|title=High School Disunion: Charlize Theron, Diablo Cody & Jason Reitman on 'Young Adult'|work=[[Film Journal International]]|author-link=Frank Lovece|first=Frank|last=Lovece|date=30 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130180408/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012|archive-date=30 November 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=30 November 2011}}</ref>
