The '''Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting''' occurred on December 14, 2012, in [[Newtown, Connecticut]], United States, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people, including 20 children between six and seven years old, and six adult staff members. Earlier that day, before driving to the school, he shot and killed his mother at their Newtown home. As [[first responders]] arrived at the school, Lanza committed [[murder–suicide|suicide]] by shooting himself in the head.

The incident is the deadliest [[mass shooting]] at an elementary or high school in U.S. history, and the [[Mass shootings in the United States#Deadliest mass shootings since 1949|fourth-deadliest mass shooting]] overall.{{efn|The 2007 [[Virginia Tech shooting]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Mass School Shootings: A History |author=Effron, Lauren |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/mass-school-shootings-history/story?id=17975571 |publisher=ABC News |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref> the 2016 [[Orlando nightclub shooting]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Deadliest U.S. mass shootings, 1984-2016|url=http://timelines.latimes.com/deadliest-shooting-rampages/|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}</ref> and the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] were deadlier.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hui|first1=Mary|title=Las Vegas shooting: CBS fires executive who said victims were 'Republican gun toters' who did not deserve sympathy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/las-vegas-shooting-latest-today-cbs-fires-vp-hayley-geftman-gold-republican-gun-toters-facebook-a7979946.html|accessdate=October 4, 2017|work=The Independent|date=October 3, 2017}}</ref>}} The shooting prompted renewed debate about [[gun control in the United States]], including proposals to make the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|background-check system]] universal, and for new [[Gun law in the United States|federal and state gun legislation]] banning the sale and manufacture of certain types of semi-automatic [[firearms]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] with more than ten rounds of ammunition.

A November 2013 report issued by the Connecticut State Attorney's office concluded that Lanza acted alone and planned his actions, but provided no indication why he did so, or why he targeted the school. A report issued by the Office of the Child Advocate in November 2014 said that Lanza had [[Asperger syndrome]] and as a teenager suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]] and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], but concluded that they had "neither caused nor led to his murderous acts." The report went on to say, "his severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems ... combined with an atypical preoccupation with violence ... (and) access to deadly weapons ... proved a recipe for mass murder".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141126233253/http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of the Child Advocate], p.9, section 36</ref>

Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school [[psychologist]] Mary Sherlach were meeting with other faculty members when they heard, but did not recognize, gunshots.

Lanza next went to another first-grade classroom nearby; at this point, there are conflicting reports about the order of events. According to some reports, the classroom's teacher, [[Victoria Leigh Soto]], had concealed some of the students in a closet or bathroom, and some of the other students were hiding under desks.<ref name="articles.courant.com"/> Soto was walking back to the classroom door to lock it when Lanza entered the classroom.<ref name=FTN130421p5/> Lanza walked to the back of the classroom, saw the children under the desks, and shot them. First grader Jesse Lewis shouted at his classmates to run for safety, and several of them did. Lewis was looking at Lanza when Lanza fatally shot him.<ref name=FTN130421p6/> Another account, given by a surviving child's father, said that Soto had moved the children to the back of the classroom, and that they were seated on the floor when Lanza entered. According to this account, neither Lanza nor any of the occupants of the classroom spoke. Lanza stared at the people on the floor, pointed the gun at a boy seated there, but did not fire.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christoffersen|first=John|date=September 29, 2013|title=Fear permeates young lives of Newtown witnesses|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_24200882/fear-permeates-young-lives-newtown-witnesses|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003032053/http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_24200882/fear-permeates-young-lives-newtown-witnesses|archive-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> The boy ran out of the classroom.<ref name="Michael P.

===Survivors===
First grade teacher Kaitlin Roig, 29 years old, hid 14 students in a bathroom and barricaded the door, telling them to be completely quiet to remain safe.<ref name="afp"/><ref name="ctnews"/> It is believed that Lanza bypassed her classroom, which was the first classroom on the left side of the hallway; possibly because, following a lockdown drill weeks earlier, Roig had failed to remove a piece of black construction paper covering the small window in her classroom door. Lanza may have assumed that Roig's classroom was empty because the door was closed and the window covered.<ref name="articles.courant.com"/>

School library staff Yvonne Cech and Maryann Jacob first hid 18 children in a part of the library the school used for lockdown in practice drills. Discovering that one door would not lock, they had the children crawl into a storage room, where Cech barricaded the door with a filing cabinet.<ref name="nytimes1"/><ref name="nytimes6"/><ref name="Newtown school massacre victims identified"/>

Music teacher Maryrose Kristopik, 50, barricaded her fourth-graders in a tiny supply closet during the rampage.<ref name="nydailynews78"/> Lanza arrived moments later, pounding on the door and yelling, "Let me in," while the students in Kristopik's class quietly hid inside.<ref name="huffingtonpost1"/>

Two third-grade students, chosen as classroom helpers, were walking down the hallway to the office to deliver the morning attendance sheet as the shooting began. Teacher Abbey Clements pulled both children into her classroom, where they hid.<ref name="nydailynews7"/>

Laura Feinstein, a reading specialist at the school, gathered two students from outside her classroom and hid with them under desks after they heard gunshots.<ref name="Tales of Sandy Hook heroism, young and old"/> Feinstein called the school office and tried to call 911, but could not connect due to lack of reception on her cell phone. She hid with the children for approximately 40 minutes, at which point law enforcement came to lead them out of the room.<ref name="'Absolutely heartbreaking': Sandy Hook teacher's terrifying experience"/>

===Shooter's suicide===

===Final reports===
==== State Attorney's report ====
The final report of the State Attorney summarizing the investigation into the shooting was published on November 25, 2013. It concluded that Adam Lanza had acted alone, and that the case was closed. The report noted that "[Lanza] had a familiarity with and access to firearms and ammunition and an obsession with mass murders, in particular the [[Columbine High School massacre|April 1999 shootings]] at Columbine High School in Colorado." The report did not identify a specific motive for the shooting, stating, "The evidence clearly shows that the shooter planned his actions, including the taking of his own life, but there is no clear indication why he did so, or why he targeted Sandy Hook elementary school."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/25/sandy-hook-shooter-adam-lanza-report |title=Sandy Hook report – shooter Adam Lanza was obsessed with mass murder |work=The Guardian |date=November 25, 2013 |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25097127 |title=Newtown gunman Adam Lanza had 'obsession' with Columbine|work=BBC News |date=November 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref>

On the question of Lanza's state of mind, the report noted "significant mental health issues that affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact with others, even those to whom he should have been close ... What contribution this made to the shootings, if any, is unknown as those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior." The report found no evidence that Lanza had taken drugs or medication that would have affected his behavior, and observed, "'Why did the shooter murder twenty-seven people, including twenty children?' Unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively, despite the collection of extensive background information on the shooter through a multitude of interviews and other sources."<ref name = "final_report" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sandy-hook-killer-adam-lanza-acted-alone-and-had-an-obsession-with-mass-killings-such-as-columbine-says-report-8963342.html |title=Sandy Hook massacre: Adam Lanza acted alone and had an obsession with mass killings|work=The Independent |date=November 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

On December 27, 2013, police released thousands of pages of documents pertaining to the investigation. In accordance with law, the names of victims and witnesses were redacted or withheld. The summary report included information about items found on Lanza's computer equipment, including writings and material about previous mass shootings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police Release Documents On Newtown Massacre|url=http://articles.courant.com/2013-12-28/news/hc-sandy-hook-state-police-report-20131227_1_adam-lanza-nancy-lanza-yogananda-street|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014|date=December 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=No Motive In Newtown Report, But Many Details About Lanza|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/25/247219204/no-motive-in-newtown-report-but-many-details-about-lanza|first=Bill|last=Chappell|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=January 29, 2015|date=November 25, 2013}}</ref> A former teacher of Lanza's noted that he exhibited antisocial behavior, rarely interacted with other students, and was obsessed with writing "about battles, destruction and war."<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Police file on Newtown yields chilling portrait|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/police-file-on-newtown-yields-chilling-portrait-of-shooter-and-more-details-of-rampage/2013/12/27/2d09a548-6f4b-11e3-b405-7e360f7e9fd2_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 28, 2013|date=December 27, 2013}}</ref>

====Report of the Office of the Child Advocate====
The Report of the Office of the Child Advocate concluded:  "There was not one thing that was necessarily the tipping point driving Lanza to commit the Sandy Hook shooting. Rather there was a cascade of events, many self-imposed, that included: loss of school; absence of work; disruption of the relationship with his one friend; virtually no personal contact with family; virtually total and increasing isolation; fear of losing his home and of a change in his relationship with Mrs. Lanza, his only caretaker and connection; worsening OCD; depression and anxiety; profound and possibly worsening anorexia; and an increasing obsession with mass murder occurring in the total absence of any engagement with the outside world. Adam increasingly lived in an alternate universe in which ruminations about mass shootings were his central
preoccupation".<ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of the Child Advocate], p.104</ref>

The authors also noted that despite multiple developmental and mental health problems, Lanza had not received adequate mental health treatment. They wrote: "It is fair to surmise that, had Lanza's mental illness been adequately treated in the last years of his life, one predisposing factor to the tragedy of Sandy Hook might have been mitigated".<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of the Child Advocate], p.107</ref>

The report also tentatively disagreed with the conclusions of the State Attorney about why Lanza targeted Sandy Hook. They noted that "According to the FBI, shooters are likely to target places or people that are familiar to them ... The elementary school may have been targeted because he could overpower people, a dynamic that is very important for mass shooters as they do not want to be thwarted".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Education===
Lanza attended Sandy Hook Elementary School for four and a half years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2012/12/18/adam-lanza-sandy-hook-student/1777525/ |title=Classmate says Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook school |first=Gary |last=Stoller |first2=Oren |last2=Dorell |date=December 19, 2012 |access-date=September 22, 2018 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]}}</ref> He began at Newtown Middle School in 2004,<ref name="courantMedicalRecords">{{cite news |url=http://www.courant.com:80/hc-adam-lanzas-medical-records-reveal-growing-anxiety-20141121-story.html |title=Adam Lanza's Medical Records Reveal Growing Anxiety |first=Alaine |last=Griffin |first2=Josh |last2=Kovner |date=June 30, 2013 |access-date=September 22, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Hartford Courant]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302081135/http://www.courant.com/hc-adam-lanzas-medical-records-reveal-growing-anxiety-20141121-story.html |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> but according to his mother was "wracked by anxiety".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/adam-lanzas-pediatric-records-reveal-growing-anxiety/ |title=Adam Lanza's Pediatric Records Reveal Growing Anxiety |date=June 29, 2013 |access-date=September 22, 2018 |first=Alaine |last=Griffin |first2=Josh |last2=Kovner |work=[[PBS]]}}</ref> She told friends that her son started getting upset at middle school because of frequent classroom changes during the day.

===Developmental and mental health problems===
Lanza presented with developmental challenges before the age of three. These included communication and sensory difficulties, socialization delays, and repetitive behaviors. He was seen by the New Hampshire Birth to Three intervention program and referred to special education preschool services.<ref name="Child Advocate 2014, p.7" /> Once at elementary school, he was diagnosed with a [[sensory processing disorder|sensory-integration disorder]]. Sensory-processing disorder does not have official status by the medical community as a formal diagnosis but is a common characteristic of autism.<ref name="spd">{{cite web|title=Newtown Shooter Lanza Had Sensory Processing Disorder|url=http://abpcnews.go.com/Health/newtown-shooter-adam-lanza-sensory-processing-disorder-controversial/story?id=18532645|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> His anxiety affected his ability to attend school and in 8th grade he was placed on "homebound" status, which is reserved for children who are too disabled, even with supports and accommodations, to attend school.<ref name="Child Advocate 2014, p.8">[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School], Office of the Child Advocate, 2014, p.8.</ref>

When he was 13, Lanza was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]] by a psychiatrist, Paul Fox.<ref name="The Reckoning"/> When he was 14, his parents took him to Yale University's Child Study Center, where he was also diagnosed with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD). He frequently washed his hands and changed his socks 20 times a day, to the point where his mother did three loads of laundry a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/newtown-shooting-police-file-101561.html |title=Police release documents on Newtown massacre |publisher=Politico.com |date=December 27, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref> He also sometimes went through a box of tissues in a day because he could not touch a doorknob with his bare hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/adam-lanza-newtown-school-shooter-remains-enigma-despite-files-1.6684722|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229114153/http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/adam-lanza-newtown-school-shooter-remains-enigma-despite-files-1.6684722|archive-date=December 29, 2013 |title=Adam Lanza, Newtown school shooter, remains enigma despite files |work=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref>

Lanza was treated by Robert King, who recommended extensive support be put in place and prescribed the antidepressant [[Citalopram|Celexa]]. He took the medication for three days. His mother Nancy reported: "On the third morning he complained of dizziness. By that afternoon he was disoriented, his speech was disjointed, he couldn't even figure out how to open his cereal box. He was sweating profusely ... it was actually dripping off his hands. He said he couldn't think ... He was practically vegetative".<ref name="The Reckoning"/> He never took the medication again.<ref name="yale">{{cite news|title=Sandy Hook shooter treated at Yale|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/22/sand-hook-shooter-treated-at-yale/|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=Yale Daily News|date=January 22, 2014}}</ref> A report from the Office of the Child Advocate found that

In a 2013 interview, Peter Lanza said he suspected his son might have also suffered from undiagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in addition to his other conditions. Lanza said that family members might have missed signs of the onset of schizophrenia and psychotic behavior during his son's adolescence because they mistakenly attributed his odd behavior and increasing isolation to Asperger syndrome.<ref name="The Reckoning"/><ref name=FRONTLINE>{{cite news|title=Raising Adam Lanza|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2336615746/|accessdate=December 11, 2013|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|date=February 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Falco"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first=Liz|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/photos-details-emerge-newtown-mass-shooter-adam-lanza-124951161.html |title=New photos, details emerge of Newtown mass shooter Adam Lanza &#124; The Lookout |publisher=Yahoo!

Lanza appears to have had no contact with mental health providers after 2006. The report from the Office of the Child Advocate stated: "In the course of Lanza's entire life, minimal mental health evaluation and treatment (in relation to his apparent need) was obtained. Of the couple of providers that saw him, only one — the Yale Child Study Center — seemed to appreciate the gravity of (his) presentation, his need for extensive mental health and special education supports, and the critical need for medication to ease his obsessive-compulsive symptoms".<ref name="Child Advocate 2014, p.8"/>

Investigators found Lanza was fascinated with mass shootings, such as the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the [[Virginia Tech shooting]] and the [[Northern Illinois University shooting|Northern Illinois University 2008 shooting]]. Among the clippings found in his room, there was a story from ''The New York Times'' about a man who shot at schoolchildren in 1891. His computer contained two videos of gunshot suicides, movies that showed school shootings and two pictures of Lanza pointing guns at his own head.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218072027/http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/25/justice/sandy-hook-shooting-report/ Sandy Hook killer took motive to his grave]</ref><ref name="ConneticutPost">{{cite news|title=Computer evidence shows Lanza's interest in pedophilia|url=http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Computer-evidence-shows-Lanza-s-interest-in-5156605.php#photo-5651099|accessdate=November 19, 2017|first=Dirk|last=Perrefort|work=[[Connecticut Post]]|date=January 19, 2014}}</ref> It was also claimed that he had edited Wikipedia articles about mass murderers.<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Alaine|last1=Griffin|first2=Josh|last2=Kovner|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/newtown-sandy-hook-school-shooting/hc-adam-lanza-online-posts-20130630-story.html|title=Mass Murders Captivated Online User Believed To Be Adam Lanza|date=June 30, 2013|website=[[Hartford Courant]]|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref>

This only came to light after Lanza died, because he never permitted others to access his bedroom, including his mother. Lanza had also taped over the windows with black plastic garbage bags to block out sunlight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/25/justice/sandy-hook-shooting-report/ |title=Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza took motive to his grave |publisher=CNN |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218072027/http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/25/justice/sandy-hook-shooting-report/ |archive-date=December 18, 2013 }}</ref> He had cut off contact with both his father and brother in the two years before the shooting and at one point communicated with his mother, who lived in the same house, only by email.

===Final months===
According to a report by the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut in November 2014, Lanza may have suffered from [[anorexia nervosa]]. The authors wrote that "Anorexia can produce cognitive impairment and it is likely that anorexia combined with an autism spectrum disorder and OCD compounded Lanza's risk for suicide".<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of Child Advocate], p.102.</ref> They also noted that at the time of his death, Lanza "was anorexic (he was six feet tall (183 cm) and weighed 112 pounds (51 kg)), to the point of malnutrition and resultant brain damage."<ref>{{Cite report |date=November 21, 2014 |title=Shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School |url=http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf |page=102 |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>

He was also living in almost total isolation in his room, spending most of his time on the internet playing ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and other video games. The report stated that he "descended" into a world where his only communication with the outside world was with members of a cyber-community, "a small community of individuals that shared his dark and obsessive interest in mass murder".<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of Child Advocate], p.100.</ref>

In the weeks before the killings, Lanza's mother was considering moving him to another town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nancy-lanza-had-considered-moving-with-her-son-to-washington-state-friend-says/|title=Nancy Lanza had considered moving with her son to Washington state|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=November 18, 2012}}</ref> She planned to purchase a [[recreational vehicle]] for him to stay in so that potential purchasers could see the house without disturbing him.<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of Child Advocate], p.103</ref> The Report of the Child Advocate stated that:

{{quote|In the wake of Mrs Lanza's stated plan to move out of Sandy Hook in 2012, and perhaps stimulated by fears of leaving the "comfort zone" of his home, Adam planned and executed the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of Child Advocate], p.8</ref> His severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems were combined with an atypical preoccupation with violence. Combined with access to deadly weapons, this proved a recipe for mass murder".<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Office of Child Advocate], p.9.</ref>}}

James Knoll, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] at [[SUNY Upstate Medical University]], was consulted about what motivated Lanza to kill. Knoll states that Lanza's final act conveyed a distinct message: "I carry profound hurt — I'll go ballistic and transfer it onto you."<ref name="The Reckoning"/>

The final report into the shooting by the State Attorney, published in November 2013, noted that "[Lanza] played video games often, both solo at home and online. They could be described as both violent and non-violent. One person described the shooter as spending the majority of his time playing non-violent video games all day, with his favorite at one point being ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''"

The report described his liking for ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', which he played frequently for hours with an acquaintance at a movie theater in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] which had a commercial version of the game, and also played the game at home.<ref name = "final_report" /> ''Dance Dance Revolution'' is a non-violent exercising game where "the user is required to move their feet rhythmically in response to video cues". According to the Report by the Office of the Child Advocate, Lanza would play the game for hours on end using it as a distraction from his inner turmoil. The report said "he would whip himself into a frenzy, a behavior consistent, possibly, with a need to contain anxiety-producing impulses and thoughts. There were days when he would not do anything else but ''Dance Dance Revolution''.<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/oca/lib/oca/sandyhook11212014.pdf Report of the Child Advocate], p 98</ref>

In February 2015, the family of one of the victims, Victoria Soto, applied for [[trademark]] protection for her name. The reason for this was to help prevent others from misusing Soto's name on social media and for the benefit of the memorial fund set up in her name.

In March, it was announced that parents of children and teachers killed in the shooting had filed lawsuits against the estate of Nancy Lanza. The suits are based on a claim that she did not properly secure her firearms, which allowed her son, a person with mental health issues, to gain access to them. The attorneys representing the families said Lanza is believed to have had homeowner's insurance on her home worth more than $1 million and they are seeking compensation based on that.<ref name=2015lawsuits>{{cite news|last1=Polansky|first1=Rob|title=Nine Sandy Hook families sue Lanza estate|url=http://www.wfsb.com/story/28472592/nine-sandy-hook-families-sue-lanza-estate|accessdate=March 15, 2015|agency=WFSB|publisher=Eyewitness News 3|date=March 13, 2015}}</ref>

On April 17, 2018, radio host and conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] was sued for defamation by three parents whose children were killed in the shooting.

Paul Vance. The rifle is a Bushmaster version of a widely made AR-15, the civilian version of the M-16 rifle used by the U.S. military. The original M-16 patent ran out years ago, and now the AR-15 is manufactured by several gunmakers. Unlike the military version, the AR-15 is a semiautomatic, firing one bullet per squeeze of the trigger. But like the M-16, ammunition is loaded through a magazine. In the school shooting, police say Lanza's rifle used numerous 30-round magazines.}}</ref>
