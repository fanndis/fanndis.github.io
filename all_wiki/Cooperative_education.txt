'''Cooperative education''' (or '''co-operative education''') is a structured method of combining [[learning environment|classroom-based education]] with [[internship|practical work experience]]. A cooperative education experience, commonly known as a "'''co-op'''", provides academic credit for structured job experience. Cooperative education is taking on new importance in helping young people to make the [[school-to-work transition]]. Cooperative learning falls under the umbrella of work-integrated learning (alongside internships, service learning and clinical placements) but is distinct as it alternates a school term with a work term in a structured manner, involves a partnership between the academic institution and the employer, and generally is both paid and intended to advance the education of the student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafce.ca/coop-defined.html|title=Co-operative Education Definition|website=www.cafce.ca|access-date=2016-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408215700/http://www.cafce.ca/coop-defined.html|archive-date=2016-04-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[University of Waterloo]] operates the world's largest [[Higher education|post-secondary]] co-op program in the world, with nearly 20,000 co-op students enrolled over three semesters in more than 120 programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Co-operative Education |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/about-co-operative-education |website=University of Waterloo |publisher=University of Waterloo |access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=University of Waterloo: Rankings |url=https://www.macleans.ca/schools/university-of-waterloo/ |website=Maclean's |publisher=Rogers Media. |access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The world’s largest co-op program |url=https://ontariosuniversities.ca/stories/the-worlds-largest-co-op-program/ |website=Ontario Universities |publisher=Council of Ontario Universities |access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cooperative Education in Canadian Universities |url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Campus/Cooperative-Education.html |website=canadian-universities.net |publisher=Hecterra Publishing Inc. |access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref>

==Schneider's foundations==
While at [[Lehigh University]] at the beginning of the 20th century, [[Herman Schneider]] (1872&ndash;1939), engineer, architect, and educator, concluded that the traditional [[Classroom|learning space or classroom]] was insufficient for technical students {{harv|Smollins|1999}}. Schneider observed that several of the more successful Lehigh graduates had worked to earn money before graduation. Gathering data through interviews of employers and graduates, he devised the framework for cooperative education (1901). About that time, Carnegie Technical Schools, now [[Carnegie Mellon University]], opened and thereby minimized the need for Schneider's co-op plan in the region around Lehigh University. However, in 1903 the [[University of Cincinnati]] appointed Schneider to their faculty. In 1905 the UC Board of Trustees allowed Schneider to "try this cooperative idea of education for one year only, for the failure of which they would not be held responsible". The cooperative education program was launched in 1906, and became an immediate success. The University of Cincinnati returned to the matter in its September 2005 board meeting, declaring the 100-year trial period of one hundred years of Cooperative Education officially ended, for the success of which the Board resumed full responsibility.

Schneider, beginning from the rank of [[assistant professor]], would rise through the rank of dean of engineering (1906&ndash;1928) to become interim president (1929–32) of the University of Cincinnati, based largely upon the strength of the co-op program. Throughout his career, he was an advocate for the co-op framework. His thirty years of service to the University of Cincinnati are partly credited for that institution's worldwide fame. In 2006 the University of Cincinnati unveiled a statue of dean Schneider outside the window of his office in Baldwin Hall.

In 1965, The Cooperative Education and Internship Association (CEIA) created "The Dean Herman Schneider Award" in honor of the contributions made by Dean Schneider in cooperative education. The award is given annually to an outstanding educator from faculty or administration. In 2006 The University of Cincinnati established the Cooperative Education Hall of Honor "to give a permanent place of honor to individuals and organizations that have made a significant qualitative difference in the advancement of Cooperative Education for the benefit of students".

==Post-Cincinnati evolutions==

In 1909, seeing the possibility of co-op education, [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began using co-op in their engineering program, becoming only the second institution in America to do so. By 1921, [[Antioch College]] had adapted the co-op practices to their liberal arts curricula, for which reason many called co-op the "Antioch Plan." In 1919 the General Motors Institute (GMI) was opened following this model to train new General Motors hires. This school was later renamed [[Kettering University]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=Empfehlungen zur Entwicklung des Dualen Studiums|last=Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung|publisher=Wissenschaftsrat|year=2013|pages=22–23}}</ref>

The [[Drexel University]] four-year co-op program launched in the [[Drexel University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] in 1919 with the participation of just three academic majors. This stemmed from the University's founder [[Anthony Joseph Drexel|Anthony J. Drexel's]] belief that Drexel University should prepare its men and women for successful careers through an education that balanced classroom theory with real world practice. In 1925, the five-year co-op program took hold in the chemical engineering department, which would later become the foundation of Drexel's cooperative education program. Today, the cooperative education program supports students of more than 75 different disciplines, making it one of the largest programs in the nation.

In 1922, Northeastern University emphasized its commitment to co-op by extending it to the College of Business Administration. As new colleges opened at Northeastern, such as the College of Liberal Arts (1935) and College of Education (1953), they became co-op schools as well. By the 1980s, Northeastern was the acknowledged leader in co-op education across the world.{{harv|Smollins|1999}}

In 1926, Dean Schneider invited those interested in forming an [[Association of Co-operative Colleges]] (ACC) to the [[University of Cincinnati]] for the first convention. The idea took hold, and was followed by three more annual conventions. In 1929, the [[Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education]], now called [[American Society for Engineering Education]] (ASEE), formed the [[Division of Cooperative Engineering Education]], incorporating the membership of the ACC {{harv|Auld|1972}}.

In 1957, the first Canadian co-operative education program began at the University of Waterloo with an inaugural class of 75. This program was seen as a joke and was not expected to succeed, however it quickly became a model for other co-op programs across Canada. These programs were based on both the sandwich education model popularized in Britain and the new American co-op programs. Canadian co-op programs generally follow a four-month school system interspersed with four month work terms. This common system allows employers to hire students from multiple institutions with common timelines and training programs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=McCallum|first=B.A|date=1 January 1988|title=They Said It Wouldn't Work (A History of Cooperative Education in Canada)|journal=Cooperative Education & Internship Association}}</ref>

In 1961, the Ford and Edison Foundations commissioned a study of co-operative education, published as ''Work-study college programs; appraisal and report of the study of cooperative education,'' (James Warner Wilson and Edward H Lyons, New York: Harper). That study resulted in the formation of the National Commission for Cooperative Education (NCCE). NCCE remains today to promote and lobby for co-operative education in the United States. Its membership comprises sponsoring corporations and organizations (not individuals) from academia and business.

Within Canada, the need for connections between co-op programs became clear by 1973. The [http://www.cafce.ca/ Canadian Association for Co-operative Education (CAFCE)] began with 29 educators from 15 institutions. In its first form, it did not include any employers or industry representatives. The institutions felt that they should decide on an integrative plan for co-op education prior to admitting employers as members. In 1977, employers, HR representatives and recruiters began to join CAFCE.<ref name=":0" />

By 1962, about 150 academic institutions used co-op education, in one form or another. Many were outside of engineering. The need for professional support of non-engineering programs became obvious, and the membership of ASEE, in 1963, began the Cooperative Education Association. To reflect its membership more accurately, it was eventually (sometime in the 1990s or early 2000s) named the Cooperative Education and Internship Association, it remains today as the professional association for co-operative education outside of ASEE.

Much of those early efforts of NCCE focused on lobbying and promoting co-operative education. In 1965, the federal Higher Education Act provided support specifically for co-operative education. Funding continued from the federal government through 1992, when Congress ended its support of co-operative education. In all, a total of over $220 million was appropriated by the federal government toward co-operative education.{{harv|Carlson|1999}}

In Canada, regulation of co-operative education programs is overseen by CAFCE. Programs can apply for accreditation after the first class of co-op students has graduated. In order to be accredited, 30% of time spent in the program must be devoted to work experience, and each experience must last at least 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafce.ca/accreditation.html|title=Accreditation|website=www.cafce.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}</ref>

In 1979, educators from Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States (Northeastern's President, Kenneth Ryder), met to discuss work-related programs in their respective countries. In 1981 and 1982, this group, headed by President Ryder, convened an international conference on cooperative education. In 1983, several college and university presidents, educational specialists, and employers from around the world (including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) formed the World Council and Assembly on Cooperative Education to foster co-operative education around the world. In 1991, it renamed itself the [http://www.waceinc.org/ World Association for Cooperative Education (WACE)]. By 2005, that Association boasted a membership of over 1,000 individuals from 43 different countries.

== In Australia ==

Co-operative education is common in most Australian high schools, and has been integrated into many university courses as a part of making up final grades. Australian institutions often refer to co-operative education as Work Placement, VET or Prac.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceed.uwa.edu.au/|title=An Overview of CEED|last=Australia|first=The University of Western|website=www.ceed.uwa.edu.au|language=EN|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite book|title=Duales Studium in Zahlen 2016|last=Silvia Hofmann, Maik Koenig|publisher=Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung|year=2017}}</ref>  All of these involve students going out into their field of choice and joining that field of a set number of weeks in unpaid work.

== In Germany ==
In [[Germany]], the significance of cooperative education has increased in the few last years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Education at a Glance 2017|date=2017|publisher=OECD}}</ref> Cooperative education programs now have an important profile in the education system.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Dual Studieren im Blick|last=Krone|first=Sirikit|publisher=Springer Fachmedien|year=2015|isbn=978-3-658-03429-0|location=Wiesbaden|pages=26–51}}</ref>

In 2013, the importance was underlined in a paper by the [[Economic Council Germany|economic council]], including an official definition of the dual study program.

The council defined to main characteristics:
* Duality: Two learning facilities must be provided: an [[Higher education|academic study]] and a [[Vocational education|vocational training]] area. There should be a duality between these facilities with agreements and cooperation in adjusting educational content and educational goals.
* The study has to meet the criteria defined by the [[education minister]] conference in order to be approved as an academic study.<ref name=":12"/>
The goal is to enable dual qualification of academic and skilled worker knowledge with a focus on high academic standards.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book|title=Empfehlung des Hauptauschusses des Bundesinstituts für Berufsbildung vom 21.Juni 2017 zum dualen Studium|last=Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz und für Verbraucherschutz|year=2017}}</ref>

=== Delimitation to vocational training ===

A cooperative study program is a combination of an academic study at a university or vocational college and a vocational education.<ref name=":22" /> The programs typically lead to a [[bachelor's degree]]. There are also a few [[Master's degree|Master's]] programs.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Qualitätsentwicklung im dualen Studium|last=Sigrun Nickel; Vitus Püttmann|publisher=Stiftverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft|year=2015}}</ref> [[Vocational education|Vocational training]] focuses on a practical education and the degree is below a university degree. [[Vocational school|Trade schools]] focus on educating [[skilled worker]]s.<ref name=":02" />

=== Development ===

The first kinds of cooperative education programs, in terms of studies with integrated practical phases, started in 1970. The next step was the foundation of a new tertiary education institution, a [[vocational university]]. That enabled the establishment of a cooperative study program, originally founded in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. More people had been graduating from [[high school]] with the highest school certificate: "[[Abitur]]". This had led to an increase in the number of students attending university and a decrease of trainees and apprentices in vocational trainings. On the one hand, companies were afraid of a lack of skilled workers. On the other hand, there was a need for higher qualified workers which were not provided by vocational training while universities could not provide skilled worker qualifications.<ref name=":3" />

In 1995, the [[education minister]] conference declared vocational university as equivalent to University of Applied sciences.

1996, the science council recommended an increased focus on cooperative education. There were 45 cooperative programs in 1995. This number increased to 100 by the year 2000.

In 2004, the education minister conference approved a vocational university degree as equivalent to a university's bachelor's degree.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.akkreditierungsrat.de/fileadmin/Seiteninhalte/KMK/Vorgaben/KMK_Berufsakademien.pdf|title=Einordnung der Bachelorausbildungsgänge an Berufsakademien in die konsekutive Studienstruktur Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 15.10.2004}}</ref>

Baden Württemberg's vocational universities were merged as [[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University|DHBW, cooperative state university Baden-Württemberg]] in 2009. Other vocational universities were also being approved as state universities.<ref name=":12" /> From 2004 to 2014 the number of students has increased from 40,982 to 100,739. There were 47,458 companies providing cooperative study programs in 2016 compared to 18,168 in 2004.<ref name="auto"/> Small companies as well as large companies have established programs in different apartments. For example, large companies who annually employ many students include [[Aldi]], [[Bayer]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Henkel]], [[Hochtief]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Peek & Cloppenburg]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[Siemens]] and [[Volkswagen]].<ref name="Wegweiser Duales Studium"/>

There are different dual curriculum programs. The number of courses grew from 512 in 2014 to 1,592 in 2016. They can be summarised in the following areas of study: 38% Engineering, 34% economic sciences, 12% computer sciences, 10% social services, education, healthcare, nursing, 6% Other.<ref name=":22" />

=== Perspectives ===

There is a contract between the three participating parties: employee, employer and student over the time of the study. Mostly, the employer provides payment which is slightly above the payment for a vocational training. Some companies also pay student fees.<ref name=":3" /> Since most universities are public there are no student fees just dues which are around $400 a semester.<ref name="dhbw-mannheim.de"/> There are usually agreements including a guaranteed employment after the program. Therefore, some contracts include terms where students commit to stay with the company for two years after the program. Even without guaranteed employment, chances of getting a job are high anyway. Around 72% of students stay with the sponsoring company after studies for at least two to five years.<ref name="Deloitte">{{Cite book|title=Wie viele Ihrer Absolventen des dualen Studiums, die durch das Unternehmen ausgebildet wurden, sind mittelfristig (3 – 5 Jahre) in Ihrem Unternehmen geblieben?|publisher=Deloitte|year=2015}}</ref> A common issue is that many students want to do their masters afterwards. Not all companies are willing to support a master program since they argue that the result is not worth the investment.<ref name=":3" />

== In Canada ==

=== Governing Bodies ===
Since 1973, [[Canada]] has had a national body representing cooperative education and work integrated learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cewilcanada.ca/about-us.html|title=About Us - Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada|website=www.cewilcanada.ca|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> This national body used to be called CAFCE (Canadian Association for Co-op Education) and was renamed CEWIL Canada (Cooperative Education and Work Integrated Learning Canada) in 2017. This organization has representatives from Canadian post-secondary institutions and employers who work together to develop resources to promote the highest quality of post-secondary work-integrated learning programs. CEWIL Canada works to establish national standards for WIL programs.  The organization also allows for delivery of training opportunities and best practice sharing.  CEWIL maintains a national database on WIL with data from more than fifty post-secondary member institutions. CEWIL reports that over 75,000 students are participating in co-operative education programs across the country. Canadian students who work in cooperative education earn close to $20 per hour and represent a wide range of disciplines and programs, ranging from science, engineering, business, arts and technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cewilcanada.ca/about-us.html|title=About Us - Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada|website=www.cewilcanada.ca|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>

=== Canadian Terminology ===
Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is the commonly accepted term for a wide range of experiential learning opportunities in Canada. Work Integrated&nbsp;Learning (WIL) is considered to be inclusive of educational &nbsp;programs &nbsp;that &nbsp;incorporate &nbsp;a workplace-based component that has connections to the classroom through various learning goals designated in the students' program or curriculum. It is widely accepted that WIL opportunities have value and produce benefit for students and employers, including &nbsp;employment &nbsp;readiness &nbsp;(such &nbsp;as &nbsp;gaining &nbsp;job-related &nbsp;skills &nbsp;and &nbsp;knowing &nbsp;what &nbsp;kind &nbsp;of &nbsp;job opportunity &nbsp;a &nbsp;student would want &nbsp;to &nbsp;have after &nbsp;graduation).<ref name=":03">{{Cite book|last=Kramer|first=Miriam|title=Work-Integrated Learning and Career-Ready Students Examining the Evidence|publisher=Higher Education Strategy Associates|year=2011|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=1, 13}}</ref> Students participating in WIL can experience new environments, tasks, colleagues for typically a shorter period of time.  Work Integrated Learning includes [[Cooperative Education]] which is typically a paid work experience of three, four, eight, twelve or sixteen months.<ref name=":03" /> When surveyed by Miriam Kramer in a study in 2011, 92% of students Agreed or Strongly Agreed that their co-op work term had a positive impact on critical & analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills. <ref name=":03" /> In Canada, another grouping of industry and education professionals came together to create The Business Higher Education Roundtable (BHER).  The BHER was established by the Business Council of Canada in 2015 and works on two goals:  1.  Helping young Canadians transition from higher education to workplaces through collaborative partnerships and post-secondary institutions and 2. Strengthen research and innovation partnerships between Canadian companies and post-secondary institutions. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bher.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/BHER-Academica-report-supplement.pdf|title=Taking the Pulse of Work-Integrated Learning in Canada|date=2020-01-29|website=Business/Higher Education Roundtable}}</ref> The BHER reports that about half of all Canadian university students take part in some form of WIL and 65-70% of Canadian college students takes part in WIL programs.

=== Co-operative education benefits ===
For the Canadian Post-Secondary Student, it is considered to be a benefit to add a co-operative work term to an undergraduate degree.  Jeela Jones, representing the [[University of Ottawa]], completed a qualitative study on students' co-operative work experience.  She states that bringing theoretical concepts out of the classroom and into a related vocational workplace can produce educational benefits.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jeela|title=Connected Learning in Co-operative Education|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ901299.pdf|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|via=ERIC}}</ref>  She researched the concept of Connected Learning in co-operative work terms, which is a learning approach where learners gain knowledge through connecting with people and things, while feeling safe in their environments, they can develop themselves. <ref name=":1" />  Jeela Jones explained the results of her study emphasizing the importance of relationships with supervisors as mentors, who pushed learners beyond their comfort zones.  Many students interviewed for this study commented that despite many challenges that were faced in their co-op experience, that it was a worthwhile experience that allowed them to build new skills, meet new industry connections and become increasingly motivated, self-confident and career-oriented.<ref name=":1" />

==Co-op models==
From its beginnings in Cincinnati in 1906, cooperative education has evolved into a program offered at the secondary and post-secondary levels in two predominant models {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995}}. In one model, students alternate a semester of academic [[coursework]] with an equal amount of time working, repeating this cycle several times until graduation. The parallel method splits the day between school and work, typically structured to accommodate the student's class schedule. Thus, like school-to-work (STW), the co-op model includes school-based and work-based learning and, in the best programs, "connecting activities" such as seminars and teacher-coordinator work site visits. These activities help students explicitly connect work and learning.

Other models, such as the sandwich model and the American-style semester model instead have students work a 40-hour work week for a set amount of time, typically between 12 weeks and six months. After this period is over, students return to the classroom for an academic semester after which they may have another work term. This cycle often repeats multiple times, adding a year or more to the students' university career. In this model, students' do not receive a summer break from school but instead are either working or in school for 12 months of the year.<ref name=":0" /> Before or during this work experience students may complete activities designed to maximize their learning on the job, such as online workplace conduct courses or reflective activities.<ref name="Deloitte"/>

Co-op's proponents identify benefits for students (including motivation, career clarity, enhanced employability, vocational maturity) and employers (labor force flexibility, recruitment/retention of trained workers, input into curricula) as well as educational institutions and society (ibid.). Beyond informal and anecdotal evidence, however, a familiar refrain in the literature is the lack of well-done research that empirically demonstrates these benefits ({{harvnb|Barton|1996}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|Stull|Vinsonhaler|1996}}). {{harvtxt|Barton|1996}} identifies some of the research problems for secondary co-op as follows: federal data collection on high school co-op enrollments and completions ceased in the 1980s; some studies use data in which co-op was not isolated from other work experience programs. {{harvtxt|Ricks|Cutt|Branton|Loken|1993}} describe other problems: due to lack of a clear or consistent definition of cooperative education, researchers cannot accurately identify variables and findings cannot be compared; theory is not well developed; theory, research, and practice are not integrated; and co-op research does not adhere to established standards.

Another set of problems involves perceptions of the field and its marginalization. Because of its "vocational" association, co-op is not regarded as academically legitimate; rather, it is viewed as taking time away from the classroom {{harv|Crow|1997}}. Experiential activities are necessarily rewarded in post-secondary promotion and tenure systems (except in certain extenuating situations), and co-op faculty may be isolated from other faculty ({{harvnb|Crow|1997}}; {{harvnb|Schaafsma|1996}}). Despite the current emphasis on contextual learning, work is not recognized as a vehicle for learning {{harv|Ricks|Cutt|Branton|Loken|1993}}. {{harvtxt|Schaafsma|1996}} and {{harvtxt|Van Gyn|1996}} agree that the field places too much emphasis on placements rather than learning. {{harvtxt|Wilson|Stull|Vinsonhaler|1996}} also decry the focus on administration, logistics, placements, and procedures.

Some institutions are fully dedicated to the co-op ideal (such as [[Northeastern University]], [[Drexel University]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology|RIT]], [[Kettering University]], [[LaGuardia Community College]], and [[Purdue University]]). In others, the co-op program may be viewed as an add-on and therefore is vulnerable to cost cutting {{harv|Wilson|Stull|Vinsonhaler|1996}}. Even where co-op programs are strong they can be threatened, as at Cincinnati Technical College when it became a comprehensive community college {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995}} or [[LaGuardia Community College|LaGuardia]] during a budget crisis {{harv|Grubb|Badway|1998}}. For students, costs and time to degree completion may be deterrents to co-op participation {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995}}. Other deterrents may include financial barriers, aversion to moving frequently due to family obligations or other pressures as well as difficulty managing the job search during a school semester.

==New approaches==
Despite these problems, there is optimism about the future of co-op education; "Social, economic, and historic forces are making cooperative education more relevant than ever" {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995|p=17}}, including emphasis on university-industry-government cooperation, a fluid and demanding workplace, new technology, the need for continuous on-the-job learning, globalization, and demands for accountability {{harv|John|Doherty|Nichols|1998}}. Federal investments in school-to-work and community service have resulted in a number of initiatives designed to provide "learning opportunities beyond the classroom walls" {{harv|Furco|1996|p=9}}. Because this has always been a principle of co-op, the field is in a position to capitalize on its strengths and the ways it complements other experiential methods in the effort to provide meaningful learning opportunities for students. To do this, however, cooperative education must be redesigned.

For {{harvtxt|Wilson|Stull|Vinsonhaler|1996}}, a new vision involves conceiving, defining, and presenting co-op "as a curriculum model that links work and academics – a model that is based on sound learning theory" (p.&nbsp;158). {{harvtxt|Ricks|1996}} suggests affirming the work-based learning principles upon which co-op is based. These principles assert that cooperative education fosters self-directed learning, reflective practice, and transformative learning; and integrates school and work learning experiences that are grounded in adult learning theories.

Fleming (2013)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Jenny|date=April 2013|title=Stakeholder perspectives of the influences on student learning|journal=New Zealand Association for Cooperative Education}}</ref> suggests that a new practical and research focus should be on the relationship between educational institutions and employers – institutions should take more initiative when it comes to training supervisors to be effective mentors. This would maximize the success of the work term and the amount the student learns, while also increasing the quality and quantity of the students' work. Drewery and Pretti (2015) echo this as they call for greater attention on the relationship between the student and the supervisor, explaining that this relationship can greatly impact the students' satisfaction with the co-op term and the benefits they gain from it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Drewery|first=David|last2=Pretti|first2=Judene|last3=Pennaforte|first3=Antoine|year=2015|title=Conceptualizing the quality of cooperative work term experiences: An exploration from the student's perspective|journal=World Association for Cooperative Education}}</ref>

{{harvtxt|Schaafsma|1996}} also focuses on learning, seeing a need for a paradigm shift from content learning to greater understanding of learning processes, including reflection and critical thinking. Co-op is an experiential method, but learning from experience is not automatic. Therefore, {{harvtxt|Van Gyn|1996}} recommends strengthening the reflective component that is already a part of some co-op models. "If co-op is only a vehicle for experience to gain information about the workplace and to link technical knowledge with workplace application, then its effectiveness is not fully developed" {{harv|Van Gyn|1996|p=125}}. A Higher Education Council of Ontario paper reviewing the University of Waterloo's [https://uwaterloo.ca/professional-development-program/ PD] programs states that the reflective element of the program is one of the main strengths, as it encourages students to review their own experiences and learn from their work terms.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Pretti, TJ |author2=Noel, Tonya |author3=Waller, Gary |date=2014|title=Evaluation of the effectiveness of an online program to help co-op students enhance their employability skills: A study of the University of Waterloo's professional development program (WatPD)|journal=Higher Education Council of Ontario}}</ref> Maureen Drysdale suggests in a 2012 paper that the reflective elements of co-op allow students to increase their career and personal clarity relative to non-co-op students.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Drysdale|first=Maureen|date=2012|title=elf-concept and tacit knowledge : Differences between cooperative and non-cooperative education students.|journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Cooperative Education}}</ref>

The [[Bergen County Academies]], a public magnet high school in [[New Jersey]], utilizes co-op education in a program called Senior Experience. This program allows all 12th grade students to participate in cooperative education or an [[internship]] opportunity for the full business day each Wednesday. Students explore a wide range of career possibilities. This new approach was recognized as an educational best practice and has been adopted as a state educational initiative for 12th grade students.

[[Wilfrid Laurier University]] offers a wide variety of Community Service Learning (CSL) courses under the umbrella of [[Experiential learning|Experiential Learning]] programs.  Community Service Learning provides academic credit for participation in a placement within a community service organization.  CSL course examples include psychology, human rights and human diversity, youth and children’s studies, business, kinesiology, global studies, history, health studies, and geography.  Completing a CSL placement allows students to blend hands-on learning, community service and classroom learning in one experience.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://students.wlu.ca/work-leadership-and-volunteering/community-and-workplace-partnerships/community-service-learning/index.html|title=Volunteering at Laurier {{!}} Students - Wilfrid Laurier University|website=students.wlu.ca|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Many learning outcomes can be achieved through Community Service Learning.

== Negative implications ==
Although there are many benefits to the co-operative education programme, there are some downsides. The negative implications do not fully compromise the number of students undertaking the study, but rather how the programme will affect the government's future funding for education.<ref name=":12"/> A huge burden that co-operative education brings to the education institution is financial struggles. The financial struggles come from the schools and universities who put pressure on the departments of education for funding to keep the programme going.<ref name=":12"/>

Implications directly to the students who participate in co-operative education is mainly based on direct learning at their institution, whether it is school or university. The co-operative education programme takes students away from school or university. As a student misses a consecutive number of school days, they can start to fall behind in school work and will eventually be unable to cope with their workload.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.det.nsw.edu.au/vetinschools/worklearn/worklearnpolicy.html|title=Workplace Learning Policy – Implementation Details|website=www.det.nsw.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> For students who attend school and also participate in the co-operative education programme, commonly called Work Placement or VET courses, they are no longer eligible to be granted direct entry into university. This then gives the student an option of [[Technical and further education|TAFE]] entry, a university certified bridging course or go on to full-time work after completion of graduation.

==Integrating experiential methods==

School-to-work and service learning have also been promoted as ways to link theory and practice through meaningful experiential learning experiences. {{harvtxt|Furco|1996}} outlines the similarities between school-to-work and service learning. Although school-to-work, service learning, and co-op have different goals, each of his points also applies to cooperative education:

*Based on the [[philosophy]] that learners learn best through active engagement in meaningful activities
*View of students as active learners and producers of knowledge
*Use of such instructional strategies as contextual learning and application of knowledge to real situations
*Requirement for schools to establish formal partnerships with outside entities
*Concern for integrating school experiences and external experiences

The Community Service Scholarship Program at [[California State University]]-Fresno combines cooperative education with service learning. Students receive co-op/internship credit and scholarships for completing a placement at a community service site {{harv|Derousi|Sherwood|1997}}. As in traditional co-op work placements, students get real-world training, opportunities to explore career options, and enhanced employability skills such as communication, problem solving, and leadership as well as awareness of community and social problems. Combining co-op and service learning thus prepares students for roles as workers and citizens.

Research on highly successful co-op programs in Cincinnati {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995}} and at [[LaGuardia Community College]] {{harv|Grubb|Badway|1998}} shows that they share the basic philosophy and fundamental characteristics of the educational strategy of school-to-work. The reconceptualization of co-op should recognize and build upon this connection. At the same time, lessons from successful co-op programs can benefit the broader STW movement.

There is a need for broader definition of acceptable models for integrating work and learning. {{harvtxt|Barton|1996}} and {{harvtxt|Wilson|Stull|Vinsonhaler|1996}} identify a variety of work-based learning activities taking different names: co-op, internships, externships, apprenticeship, career academies, etc. Work-based learning programs should look for connections and develop collaborative relationships. The alternating and parallel co-op models may not meet the needs of returning adult students and dislocated workers needing retraining {{harv|Varty|1994}}. Alternatives such as extended-day programs emphasizing mentoring should be considered.

Connecting activities to integrate school- and work-based learning are an essential part of [[School-to-work|STW]]. At LaGuardia, the required co-op seminar helps students make connections by giving them a structure within which to reinforce employability skills, examine larger issues about work and society, and undertake the crucial activities of critical reflection {{harv|Grubb|Badway|1998}}.

{{harvtxt|Grubb|Badway|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995}} found that the value of cooperative education is embedded in the culture of the institution (LaGuardia) and the region (Cincinnati). In this supportive culture, employer support does not have to be repeatedly obtained and there are clearly understood long-term expectations on all sides (schools, employers, students). This "informal culture of expectations around work-based learning may be more powerful in the long run than a complex set of regulations and bureaucratic requirements" {{harv|Grubb|Villeneuve|1995|p=27}}.

However, even LaGuardia has found it difficult to sustain co-op culture over time {{harv|Grubb|Badway|1998}}. "The only way in which STW programs can find a permanent place in schools and colleges is for the work-based component to become so central to the educational purposes of the institutions that it becomes as unthinkable to give it up as it would be to abandon math, English, or science" {{harv|Grubb|Badway|1998|p=28}}.

{{harvtxt|Finn|1997}} believes that the answer lies in going beyond reconceiving co-op as an "educational strategy, pedagogy, model, methodology, or curriculum" {{harv|Finn|1997|p=41}}. She asserts that it is time for cooperative education to develop and define its body of knowledge, investigate its unique phenomena-e.g., the concept of learning from experience, and clarify and strengthen the qualifications of co-op practitioners. For {{harvtxt|Ricks|1996}}, cooperative education is inherently committed to improving the economy, people's working lives, and lifelong learning abilities. It can thus position itself to serve the experiential learning needs of students into the 21st century.

Cates and Cedercreutz (2008) demonstrate that the assessment of student work performance as pursued by co-op employers, can be used for continuous improvement of curricula. The methodology, funded by the Fund for Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) has been developed to a level allowing institutionalization. The methodology could, when implemented over a larger front, provide a substantial competitive advantage for the entire field.

{{refimprove section|date=November 2014|note: links to school web sites are not reliable sources}}
*Work-study (federally subsidized campus employment) in the later twentieth century became a formal and major component of [[Student financial aid in the United States]].
*The [[University of Waterloo]] has a co-operative education program with more than 19,000 students enrolled in co-op programs and more than 5,200 active co-op employers. Their five-year co-op program includes twenty four months of work experience. Enrolling in the co-op program at the University of Waterloo does not guarantee co-op employment. The school requires students to have a minimum of sixteen to twenty months of valid work experience (depending on the program of study) to successfully complete their academic program. Despite a high percentage of employment via the coop program, many students obtain employment by other methods, including a student's personal networks and unpaid full-time volunteering positions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Co-operative Education|url = https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/about-co-operative-education|access-date = 2015-09-25}}</ref>
*Since its inception in 1975, the co-operative education program at  [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU) has grown to more than 8,400 students seeking paid work experiences across the globe. SFU's co-op programs span the faculties of Applied Sciences, Arts & Social Sciences, Business, Communication, Art & Technology, Education, Environment, Health Sciences, and Science. The University has worked with over 6,000 employers worldwide. An SFU student has won the Canada-wide title "Co-op Student of the Year" four times.
*[[Wilfrid Laurier University]] and the [[Laurier School of Business & Economics|Lazaridis School of Business & Economics]] provide a co-op business program with a competitive entry limited to about one-third of the students who start the [[BBA]] program in their first-year. It offers three four-month work terms. Additionally, the school offers a co-op [[MBA]] program for high calibre students with less than two years of work experience.
* The [[University of British Columbia]]'s co-operative education program includes over three thousand students from the faculties of Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Forestry, Kinesiology, and Science. 
* The [[University of Victoria]] (UVic)'s [https://www.uvic.ca/coopandcareer/index.php co-operative education program] offers hands-on learning opportunities for close to half of UVic students, with the number growing each year. Optional or mandatory co-op is available in almost every academic discipline. All UVic co-op students complete a professional practice course prior to their first work term, including intercultural training to help them contribute positively to diverse workplaces. Students also reflect on each work term experience using a competency-based framework. UVic's Co-op Program includes dedicated support for Indigenous and international students, and has developed unique international co-op exchange partnerships with employers and post-secondaries around the globe. The program launched in 1976.  
*All [[Antioch College]] students participate in the college's Co-Op Program as part of their academic requirements for graduation.  Under the program, students spend a total of four twelve-week terms, distributed throughout their undergraduate years, working as paid, full-time employees in local, national, or international settings.  The program at Antioch, which is located in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], began in 1921.
* The [[University of New South Wales]] (NSW) in [[Sydney]] provides an industry linked Co-op Scholarship. Students receive a scholarship of A$17,000 per annum for each year of their degree and current offerings span twenty four areas in business, engineering, science, and the built environment. Along with industry experience, the Co-op Program incorporates leadership and professional development in addition to networking and mentoring opportunities.
* The [[Florida Institute of Technology]] has a condensed cooperative education program allowing students to graduate in four years with three-semester work terms. This program is only followed by engineering students and requires students to take online coursework while they are working full-time as a cooperative education student.
*[[Drexel University]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has one of the nation's oldest, largest, and best-known cooperative education programs. 91% of undergraduate students in over 75 majors participate in the co-op program. During their time at Drexel, students experience up to three different co-ops and gain up to 18 months of working experience. With over 1,700 employers in its network, Drexel's cooperative education program connects students with industry leaders across 35 states and 45 countries. Drexel's cooperative education program allows students to not only explore future careers, but also bring their cooperative education experiences back to the classroom. As a result of cooperative education, Drexel students graduate having already built a professional network, and they typically receive higher starting salaries than their counterparts from other schools. Students may also elect to participate in a Research Co-op to prepare them for a career in research or graduate school or an Entrepreneurship Co-op that will, in collaboration with the Close School of Entrepreneurship, assist them in establishing their own ongoing business. Specialized co-op experiences are also offered at the graduate level.
*[[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] has a co-operative education program started in 1909. The program places about five thousand students annually with more than 2,500 co-op employers in Boston, across the United States, and around the globe. A student graduating from Northeastern with a five-year bachelor's degree has a total of eighteen months of internship experience with up to three different companies. 
* [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) began cooperative education in 1912. 
* [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech) started cooperative education in 1912. 
*[[Kettering University]] in [[Flint, Michigan]], enrolls students in co-operative education from their first year on campus, specializing in engineering, science, and management degree programs.

Originally exclusive to students in the College of Engineering, the co-op program is now available to students in 48 different disciplines in 8 of the academic colleges on campus. Purdue offers 5-session and 3-session co-op programs but differs from most universities in that students spend all 5 or 3 work sessions with the same employer, earning raises and gaining progressive responsibilities for each subsequent work rotation, for a total of 12–16 months of work experience. Both programs are 5-year academic programs, though students only pay tuition while studying on campus and pay a small administrative fee during each co-op work rotation. As of July 2014, there were over 600 students enrolled in co-op programs and over 500 qualified employers with locations around the nation and across the globe.
