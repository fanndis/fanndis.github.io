The '''New Zealand National Party''' ({{lang-mi|Rōpū Nāhinara o Aotearoa}}),<ref>{{cite web|title= Ngā Rōpū Pāremata|url= https://www.parliament.nz/mi/mps-and-electorates/political-parties/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament Pāremata Aotearoa|accessdate= 5 May 2017|language= mi}}</ref> shortened to '''National''' ({{lang|mi|Nāhinara}}) or the '''Nats''',<ref name=":0" /> is a [[centre-right]]<ref name="Papillon et al"/> [[political party in New Zealand]]. It is one of two [[major parties]] that largely dominate contemporary [[New Zealand politics]], alongside its traditional rival, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].

National formed in 1936 through amalgamation of [[conservative]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] parties, [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]] and [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]] respectively, and subsequently became New Zealand's second-oldest extant political party.<ref name="Raymond 2005 32">{{cite book |last= Raymond |first= Miller |title= Party Politics in New Zealand|year= 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Australia |pages= 32}}</ref> National's predecessors had previously formed [[United–Reform Coalition|a coalition]] against the growing [[labour movement]].

After the [[1949 New Zealand general election|1949 general election]], [[Sidney Holland]] became the first [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] from the National Party, and remained in office until 1957. [[Keith Holyoake]] succeeded Holland, and was defeated some months later at a general election by the Labour Party in [[1957 New Zealand general election|1957]]. Holyoake returned to office for a second period from [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960]] to 1972. The party's platform shifted from moderate [[economic liberalism]] to increased emphasis on [[state interventionism]] during [[Robert Muldoon]]'s National government from [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975]] to [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984]]. In [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990]] [[Jim Bolger]] formed another National government, which continued the radical [[free-market]] reforms initiated by the preceding Labour government. The party has since advocated [[free enterprise]], reduction of taxes and limited state regulation. Following the first [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]], the National Party governed in a coalition with the populist [[New Zealand First]] Party. National Party leader [[Jenny Shipley]] became New Zealand's first female prime minister in 1997; her government was defeated by a Labour-led coalition in [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999]].

The National Party was most recently in government from [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] to 2017 under [[John Key]] and [[Bill English]]; it governed with [[confidence and supply|support]] from the centrist [[United Future]], the classical-liberal [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]] and the indigenous-rights-based [[Māori Party]]. At the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]] the party gained 44.4 percent of the party vote and won 56 seats, making it then the largest [[caucus]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="2017 general election results">{{cite web |title= 2017 General Election – Official Result|url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate= 7 October 2017}}</ref> National was unable to form a government following the election and {{as of | 2020 | lc = on}} remains the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|Official Opposition]].

==History==
===Formation===
{{See also|Historic conservatism in New Zealand|Historic liberalism in New Zealand}}
The National Party was formed in May 1936, but its roots go considerably further back. The party came about as the result of a merger between the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] (known as the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] until 1927, except for a short period between 1925 and 1927 when it used the name "National Party") and the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]].<ref name="Raymond 2005 32"/> The United Party gained its main support from the cities, and drew upon [[business]]es for money and upon [[middle class]] electors for votes,<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Raymond|title=Party Politics in New Zealand|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Australia|pages=28–31}}</ref> while the Reform Party had a [[rural]] base and received substantial support from [[farmer]]s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Raymond|title=Party Politics in New Zealand|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Australia|pages=29}}</ref> who then formed a substantial proportion of the population.
{{Formation of New Zealand National Party}}

Historically, the Liberal and Reform parties had competed against each other, but from 1931 until 1935 a [[United–Reform Coalition]] held power in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Raymond|title=Party Politics in New Zealand|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Australia|pages=31–32}}</ref> The coalition went into the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] under the title of the "National Political Federation", a name adopted to indicate that the grouping intended to represent New Zealanders from all backgrounds (in contrast to the previous situation, where United served city-dwellers and Reform served farmers). However, because of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and a perception that the existing coalition government had handled the situation poorly, the National Political Federation lost heavily in 1935 to the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], the rise of which had prompted the alliance.  The two parties were cut down to 19 seats between them. Another factor was a third party, the [[New Zealand Democrat Party (1934)|Democrat Party]] formed by [[Albert Davy]], a former organiser for the coalition who disapproved of the "socialist" measures that the coalition had introduced. The new party split the conservative vote and aided Labour's victory.<ref>Adams 1980{{page needed|date=May 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Adam Hamilton (1926).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Hamilton]] was the first leader of the National Party.]]
In hopes of countering Labour's rise, United and Reform decided to turn their alliance into a single party.<ref name="founded"/> This party, the New Zealand National Party, was formed at a meeting held in [[Wellington]] on 13 and 14 May 1936. Erstwhile members of the United and Reform parties made up the bulk of the new party.<ref name="founded"/> The United Party's last leader, [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]], Prime Minister from 1930 until 1935, opened the conference; he served as Leader of the Opposition from May until November, when former Reform MP [[Adam Hamilton]] was elected the first leader. Hamilton led the party into its first election in 1938.  He got the top job primarily because of a compromise between Forbes and Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]], neither of whom wished to serve under the other. Hamilton, however, failed to counter Labour's popular [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]] effectively. Because of this, perceptions that he remained too much under the control of Coates and because he lacked real support from his party colleagues, Hamilton failed to prevent Labour's re-election in [[1938 New Zealand general election|1938]].
In 1940 [[Sidney Holland]] replaced Hamilton. [[William Polson]] "acted effectively as Holland's deputy".<ref>Gustafson{{nonspecific|date=November 2017}}</ref> One former Reform MP [[Bert Kyle]] resigned in 1942 in protest at the "autocratic" behaviour of Holland and the new party organisation.<ref name="Adams 1980">Adams 1980</ref>

In the [[1943 New Zealand general election|1943 election]] Labour's majority was reduced, but it remained in power. In the [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946 election]], National also failed to unseat Labour. However, in the [[1949 New Zealand general election|1949 election]], thirteen years after the party's foundation, National finally won power, and Holland became prime minister.

===First Government (1949–1957)===
{{Main|First National Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:Sidney George Holland (1953) 2.png|upright|thumb|[[Sidney Holland|Sir Sidney Holland]] was the first National Prime Minister, 1949–1957]]
Sidney Holland was finance minister as well as prime minister in the new government. In 1949 National had campaigned on "the private ownership of production, distribution and exchange". Once in power the new Holland Government proved decidedly administratively conservative, retaining, for instance, compulsory unionism and the [[welfare state]] set up by the previous Labour Government.<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Colin |title=National Party – Formation and rise |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/page-1 |publisher=Te Ara |accessdate=15 August 2020 |date=1 July 2010}}</ref>

In 1951 the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|Waterfront Dispute]] broke out, lasting 151 days. The National government stepped into the conflict, acting in opposition to the maritime [[trade union|union]]s. Holland also used this opportunity to call the 1951 [[1951 New Zealand general election|snap election]]. Campaigning on an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] platform and exploiting the Labour Opposition's apparent indecisiveness, National returned with an increased majority, gaining 54 parliamentary seats out of 80.

In the [[1954 New Zealand general election|1954 election]], National was elected to a third term, though losing some of its seats. Towards the end of his third term, however, Holland became increasingly ill, and stepped down from the leadership shortly before the general election in 1957. [[Keith Holyoake]], the party's long-standing deputy leader, took Holland's place. Holyoake, however, had insufficient time to establish himself in the public mind as Prime Minister, and lost in the [[1957 New Zealand general election|election later that year]] to Labour, then led by [[Walter Nash]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1957 – key events – The 1950s |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/the-1950s/1957 |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=15 August 2020}}</ref>

===Second Government (1960–1972)===
{{Main|Second National Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:Keith Holyoake (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]], Prime Minister, 1957 and 1960–1972]]
Nash's government became very unpopular as Labour acquired a reputation for poor economic management, and much of the public saw its [[Black Budget (New Zealand)|1958 Budget]], known since as the "Black Budget", as miserly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian Roper|title=State and economy in New Zealand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLG0AAAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=204|isbn=9780195582734}}</ref> After only one term in office, Labour suffered defeat at the hands of Holyoake and the National Party in the [[1960 New Zealand general election|elections of 1960]].

Holyoake's government lasted twelve years, the party gaining re-election three times (in [[1963 New Zealand general election|1963]], [[1966 New Zealand general election|1966]], and [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969]]). However, during this period [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|Social Credit]] arose, which broke the National/Labour duopoly in parliament, winning former National seats from 1966. Holyoake retired from the premiership and from the party leadership at the beginning of 1972, and his deputy, [[Jack Marshall]], replaced him.<ref name="Adams 1980"/>

Marshall suffered the same fate as Holyoake. Having succeeded an experienced leader in an election-year, he failed to establish himself in time. Marshall had an added disadvantage; he had to compete against the much more popular and charismatic [[Norman Kirk]], then leader of the Labour Party, and lost the ensuing [[1972 New Zealand general election|election]]. Unpopular policies, including initiating clear felling of parts of the Warawara kauri forest, also needlessly alienated voters.<ref name="Adams 1980"/>

===Third Government (1975–1984)===
{{Main|Third National Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:Muldoon 26 June 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Muldoon|Sir Robert Muldoon]], Prime Minister, 1975–1984]]
Within two years the National Party removed Marshall as its parliamentary leader and replaced him with [[Robert Muldoon]], who had previously served as [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]. An intense contest between Kirk and Muldoon followed. Kirk became ill and died in office (1974); his successor, [[Bill Rowling]], proved no match for Muldoon, and in the [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975 election]], National under Muldoon returned comfortably to power.

The Muldoon administration, which favoured [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] economic policies, arouses mixed opinions amongst the [[free-market]] adherents of the modern National. [[Bill Birch]]'s "[[Think Big]]" initiatives, designed to invest public money in energy self-sufficiency, stand in contrast to the party's {{As of|2007|alt= contemporary}} views.<ref name="Scharpf-Schmidt" /> Muldoon's autocratic leadership style became increasingly unpopular with both the public and the party, and together with disgruntlement over economic policy led to an attempted leadership change in 1980. Led by ministers [[Derek Quigley]], [[Jim McLay]], and [[Jim Bolger]], the challenge (dubbed the "colonels' coup") against Muldoon aimed to replace him with [[Brian Talboys]], his deputy. However, the plan collapsed as the result of Talboys' unwillingness, and Muldoon kept his position.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gustafson|first1=Barry|title=His Way: a Biography of Robert Muldoon|date=2013|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=9781869405175|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tRaAwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA109|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:National Party Logo 1970s.png|upright|left|thumb|A former National Party logo, used during the Muldoon era]]
Under Muldoon, National won three consecutive general elections in 1975, [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] and [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981]]. However, public dissatisfaction grew, and Muldoon's controlling and belligerent style of [[leadership]] became less and less appealing. In both the 1978 and 1981 elections, National gained fewer votes than the Labour opposition, but could command a small majority in Parliament because of the then-used [[First Past the Post]] electoral system.

Dissent within the National Party continued to grow, however, with rebel National MPs [[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]] causing particular concern to the leadership, threatening National's thin majority in parliament. When, in 1984, Marilyn Waring refused to support Muldoon's policies on visits by nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships, Muldoon called a snap [[1984 New Zealand general election|election]]. Muldoon made the television announcement of this election while visibly [[drunkenness|inebriated]], and some believe<ref name="Adams 1980"/> that he later regretted the decision to "go to the country". National lost the election to Labour under [[David Lange]].

===Fourth Government (1990–1999)===
[[File:Jim Bolger at press conference retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jim Bolger]], Prime Minister, 1990–1997]]
{{Main|Fourth National Government of New Zealand}}
Shortly after this loss, the National Party removed Muldoon from the leadership. [[Jim McLay]], who had replaced Brian Talboys as deputy leader shortly before the election, became the new leader. McLay, an urban liberal with right-wing views on economics, however, failed to restore the party's fortunes. In 1986 [[Jim Bolger]] took over the leadership with the support of centrists within the party.

In the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]] National defeated Labour in an electoral landslide and formed a new government under [[Jim Bolger]]. However, the party lost some support from Muldoon era policy based conservatives when it continued the economic reforms which had ultimately led to the defeat of the previous Labour government—these policies, started by Labour Party Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] and popularly known as [[Rogernomics]], centred on the [[privatisation]] of state assets and on the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. These policies alienated traditional Labour supporters, who saw them as a betrayal of the party's social service based character, but did not appear to appease the membership base of the non-parliamentary party either, which still had a significant supporter base for the [[Statism|statist]] intervention style policies of the Muldoon Government.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Many more conservative and centrist National supporters preferred Muldoon's more authoritarian and interventionist policies over the free-market liberalism promoted by Douglas. However, the new National Party Finance Minister, [[Ruth Richardson]], strongly supported Rogernomics, believing that Douglas had not gone far enough. Her policies—dubbed "[[Ruthanasia]]"— encouraged two MPs to leave the National Party and form the [[New Zealand Liberal Party (1992)]]. Richardson's views also met with considerable opposition within the National Party Parliamentary Caucus and for a time caused damage to the party's membership base.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill English staying on through 2020|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98192081/bill-english-staying-on-through-2020|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

At the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], National was narrowly able to retain government owing partly to a slight economic recovery and the opposition being split between three competing parties. National's unprecedented eighteen-seat majority had virtually disappeared and the country faced an election night [[hung parliament]] for the first time since [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]], with National one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. Final [[special vote]]s counted over the following days revealed National had won {{NZ electorate link|Waitaki}}, allowing it to form a government with the majority of one seat but required the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches ([[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House. At the same time as the election, however, a referendum took place which established the [[mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] electoral system for future use in New Zealand general elections as widespread dissatisfaction with the existing political system led to reform. This would have a significant impact on New Zealand politics. Some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, [[United New Zealand]] in mid-1995 whilst other splinter parties emerged. And, as a result of the new electoral mechanics, the [[New Zealand First]] party, led by former National MP and former Cabinet minister [[Winston Peters]], held the balance of power after the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]. After a prolonged period of negotiation lasting nearly two months, in which New Zealand First played National and Labour off against each other (both parties negotiated complete coalition agreements), New Zealand First entered into a coalition with National despite the fact many expected Peters to form such a coalition with Labour.

Under the coalition agreement, Peters became [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and had the post of [[Treasurer]] especially created by the Crown for him. New Zealand First extracted a number of other concessions from National in exchange for its support. The influence of New Zealand First angered many National MPs, particularly [[Jenny Shipley]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill English staying on through 2020|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98192081/bill-english-staying-on-through-2020|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Jenny Shipley 2013 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jenny Shipley|Dame Jenny Shipley]], Prime Minister, 1997–1999]]
When, in 1997, Shipley toppled [[Jim Bolger|Bolger]] to become National's new leader, relations between National and its coalition partner quickly deteriorated. After Shipley sacked Peters from [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] in 1998, New Zealand First split into two groups and half the MPs followed Peters out of the coalition but the remainder broke away, establishing themselves as independents or as members of new parties of which none survived the 1999 election. From the latter group National gained enough support to continue in government with additional confidence support of [[Alamein Kopu]] a defect Alliance List MP.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill English staying on through 2020|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98192081/bill-english-staying-on-through-2020|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 October 2017}}</ref> The visibly damaged National Government managed to survive the parliamentary term, but lost the [[1999 New Zealand general election|election]] to Labour's [[Helen Clark]] and the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]]'s [[Jim Anderton]], who formed a coalition government leaving National in opposition for nine years.

===Opposition (1999–2008)===
Shipley continued to lead the National Party until 2001, when [[Bill English]] replaced her. English, however, proved unable to gain traction against Clark, and National suffered its worst-ever electoral defeat in the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], gaining only 27 of 120 seats.<ref name="2002 election">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Official Count Results – Overall Status|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/partystatus.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=7 August 2013|website=|publisher=Electoral Commission}}</ref> Many hoped that English would succeed in rebuilding the party, given time, but a year later polling showed the party performing only slightly better than in the election. In October 2003 English gave way as leader to [[Don Brash]], a former governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]] who had joined the National Parliamentary caucus in the 2002 election.

Under Brash, the National Party's overall popularity with voters improved markedly. Mostly, however, the party achieved this by "reclaiming" support from electors who voted for other centre-right parties in 2002. National's campaigning on race relations, amid claims of preferential treatment of [[Māori people|Māori]], and amid their opposition to Labour Party policy during the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore-and-seabed controversy]], generated considerable publicity and much controversy.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Nigel |title=Iwi/kiwi billboard |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/33891/iwikiwi-billboard |publisher=Te Ara |accessdate=15 August 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Strong campaigning on a tax-cuts theme in the lead-up to the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], together with a consolidation of centre-right support, may have contributed to the National Party's winning 48 out of 121 seats in Parliament. National, however, remained the second-largest party in Parliament (marginally behind Labour, which gained 50 seats), and had fewer options for forming a coalition government. With the formation of a new Labour-dominated Government, National remained the major Opposition party. Before the leadership of John Key, the National Party had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} through adoption of [[anti-abortion]] and anti-[[same-sex marriage]] policies.

In the 2005 general election run up, it was revealed that the Exclusive Brethren had distributed attack pamphlets critical of the Labour party and praising of National to letterboxes throughout New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10345281|title=Exclusive Brethren trot out new leaflets|last=Cheng|first=Derek Cheng, Derek|date=12 September 2005|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=14 October 2018|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> Labour insisted that National had close ties to and prior knowledge of these attacks, which was repeatedly denied by National. It was later admitted by the leader Don Brash that he indeed did have knowledge of the plan, a statement that was contradicted by MP Gerry Brownlee who subsequently denied the National party had any foreknowledge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10344635|title=Brash knew about Exclusive Brethren pamphlets|date=8 September 2005|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=14 October 2018|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>

After the 2005 election defeat Don Brash's leadership of National came under scrutiny from the media, and political watchers speculated on the prospect of a leadership-challenge before the next [[2008 New Zealand general election|general election due in 2008]]. Don Brash resigned on 23 November 2006, immediately before the release of [[Nicky Hager]]'s book ''[[The Hollow Men (book)|The Hollow Men]]'', which contained damaging revelations obtained from private emails. [[John Key]] became the leader of the National caucus on 27 November 2006. Key fostered a more "centrist" image, discussing issues such as [[child poverty]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

[[File:John Key February 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|[[John Key|Sir John Key]], Prime Minister, 2008–2016]]
On 8 November 2008 the National Party won 58 seats in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|general election]]. The Labour Party, which had spent three terms in power, conceded the election and Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] stepped down. National formed a minority government under [[John Key]] with [[confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply]] support from the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]] (5 seats), the [[Māori Party]] (5 seats) and [[United Future]] (1 seat). On 19 November the Governor-General swore in the new National-led government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key and ministers sworn in |url= http://www.guide2.co.nz/politics/news/key-and-ministers-sworn-in/11/3999|website=guide2.co.nz|date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> In Key's first Cabinet he gave the ACT Party's [[Rodney Hide]] and [[Heather Roy]] ministerial portfolios outside Cabinet, and the Māori Party's [[Tāriana Turia]] and [[Pita Sharples]] the same. United Future leader [[Peter Dunne]] retained his ministerial post outside Cabinet which he had held within the immediately preceding [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]].

National came to power in the continuing wake of a [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]]. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, Finance Minister [[Bill English]] made budget deficit-reduction his main priority for the first term. The government also [[Taxation in New Zealand|cut taxes]] on all income; the top personal tax rate was lowered from 39% to 38% and then 33% in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Questions and Answers – 25 May 2010 {{!}} Scoop News|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1005/S00416/questions-and-answers-25-may-2010.htm|accessdate=15 June 2017|work=scoop.co.nz|date=25 May 2010}}</ref>

At the [[2011 New Zealand general election|26 November 2011 general election]], National gained 47.31% of the party vote, the highest percentage gained by any political party since MMP was introduced, helped by a lower voter turnout and the misfortunes of its traditional support parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill English staying on through 2020|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98192081/bill-english-staying-on-through-2020|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 October 2017}}</ref> A reduced wasted vote enabled the party to gain 59 seats in Parliament, one more than in 2008. National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with ACT (one seat) and United Future (one seat) on 5 December 2011, enabling it to form a minority government with the support of 61 seats in the new 121-seat Parliament. National also re-entered a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Māori Party on 11 December 2011 for extra insurance, despite the parties differing on National's contentious plans to partially sell (or "extend the mixed ownership model to") four state-owned enterprises. This nearly led to a cancellation of the agreement in February 2012 over [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|Treaty of Waitangi obligations]] for the mixed ownership companies, and again in July 2012 over water rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The government introduced the "mixed ownership model" plan, in which the Government planned to reduce its share in [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]], [[Mercury Energy|Mighty River Power]] and [[Solid Energy]] from 100% to 51% and [[Air New Zealand]] from 74% to 51%, and [[privatization|sell off]] the remainder. The plans to sell down Solid Energy were later axed due to the company's poor financial position. [[2013 New Zealand asset sales referendum|A citizens-initiated referendum]] on the sell-downs returned a 67.3% vote in opposition (on a turnout of 45.1%).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/2013_citizens_referendum/ |title=Citizens Initiated Referendum 2013: Final Result |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref>

The National Government won a third term at the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]]. The National Party won 47.04% of the party vote, and increased its seats to 60.

The party's principles, last revised in 2003, include "loyalty to our country, its democratic principles and our Sovereign as Head of State; national and personal security; equal citizenship and equal opportunity; individual freedom and choice; personal responsibility; competitive enterprise and rewards for achievement; limited government; strong families and caring communities; sustainable development of our environment."<ref name="Palffy">{{cite book |last1=Palffy |first1=Georgina |title=New Zealand|date=2008|publisher=New Holland Publishers |isbn=9781860114052 |pages=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLgN7gqw0boC&pg=PA65|accessdate=5 February 2017|language=en}}</ref> National supports a limited [[welfare state]] but says that work, merit, innovation and personal initiative must be encouraged to reduce unemployment and boost [[economic growth]].

===Voter base===
The National Party's core [[Base (politics)|base]] has traditionally comprised [[European New Zealanders]] ([[Pākehā]]), social conservatives and rural voters,<ref>Gold, Hyam, "The Social Bases of Party Choice in New Zealand" (paper presented to Australasian Political Studies Association Conference, Melbourne, 1984)</ref> although it targets other groups too.

==Organisation==
[[File:Vote National in Kaikoura, 2014.jpg|thumb|left|National Party election campaigners in [[Kaikoura]], 2014]]
In the 1930s National first emulated and then outstripped Labour in building a large low-fee membership, with wide [[grassroots]] support. By the mid-1970s it claimed to have around 200,000 members. Since 1981 National (as well as the Labour Party) has suffered a steady decline in membership. By the early 2000s party membership was below 30,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Party membership, 1938–2002 |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/graph/33893/national-party-membership-1938-2002 |work=Te Ara |accessdate=15 August 2020}}</ref>

National features both regional and [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]]-level organisational structures.  National traditionally had a strongly decentralised organisation, designed to allow electorates and the five regions to appeal to the unique voter base in their area. However, in light of the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election result]], in which the party suffered a significant loss of its support base, a review of the party organisation resulted in decisions to weaken the regional structure and to implement a more centralised structure. The restructuring was ostensibly planned to make the party organisation more "appropriate" for the [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] electoral system, where votes are cast for a countrywide party list.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, Gregory R. ''[http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/302 Electoral Reform and the Centralisation of the New Zealand National Party]'', MA thesis, [[Victoria University of Wellington]]</ref>

Currently, the affairs of the party are centrally governed by a Board of Directors, comprising the party leader, one caucus representative, the party's general manager and seven elected members. The board elects a party president from within its members. An Annual Conference determines party [[policy]], and elects members to the Board of Directors. The party is subdivided into Electorate Committees; each committee sends six delegates to Annual Conference, including a chair and any [[MPs]] from within the electorate.<ref name="constitution">{{cite web|title=Constitution and Rules of the New Zealand National Party|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/National_party_rules_0.pdf|edition=25th|publisher=New Zealand National Party|date=October 2016|access-date=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221005803/https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/National_party_rules_0.pdf|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
