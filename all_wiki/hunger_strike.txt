A '''hunger strike''' is a method of [[non-violent resistance]] or pressure in which participants [[fasting|fast]] as an act of political [[protest]], or to provoke the feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] in others, usually with the objective to achieve a specific goal, such as a policy change. Most hunger strikers will take liquids but not solid food.

In cases where an entity (usually the [[State (polity)|state]]) has or is able to obtain custody of the hunger striker (such as a [[prison]]er), the hunger strike is often terminated by the custodial entity through the use of [[force-feeding]].

==Early history==
{{sources|date=August 2020}}
[[Fasting]] was used as a method of protesting injustice in pre-Christian [[Ireland]], where it was known as ''Troscadh'' or ''Cealachan''.<ref>Ellis, Peter Bereford. The Druids (Eerdmans, 1998). pp. 141-142.</ref>
It was detailed in the contemporary civic codes, and had specific rules by which it could be used. The fast was often carried out on the doorstep of the home of the offender.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Brehon Laws |volume=4 |page=490}}</ref> Scholars speculate this was due to the high importance the culture placed on hospitality. Allowing a person to die at one's doorstep, for a wrong of which one was accused, was considered a great dishonor.<ref>Joyce, Patrick Weston, A Smaller Social History of ancient Ireland (Longman, Green & Co, 1906), Chapter IV: The Administration of Justice, p.86. Found online at https://www.libraryireland.com/SocialHistoryAncientIreland/I-IV-6.php</ref> Others say that the practice was to fast for one whole night, as there is no evidence of people fasting to death in pre-Christian Ireland. The fasts were primarily undertaken to recover debts or get justice for a perceived wrong. There are legends of [[Saint Patrick]], the patron saint of Ireland, using the hunger strike as well.<ref name=Beresford>{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=David|title=Ten Men Dead|year=1987|publisher=Atlantic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-87113-702-9}}{{pn|date=November 2018}}</ref>

In [[India]], the practice of a hunger protest, where the protester fasts at the door of an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of the practice prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it.<ref name=Beresford/> This Indian practice is ancient, going back to around 750 to 400 BC. This can be known since it appears in the ''[[Ramayana]]'', which was composed around that time. The actual mention appears in the ''Ayodhya kanda'' (the second book of the ''Ramayana''), in ''Sarga'' (section) 103. [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] has gone to ask the exiled [[Rama]] to come back and rule the kingdom. Bharata tries many arguments, none of which work, at which point he decides to engage in a hunger strike. He announces his intention to fast, calls for his charioteer Sumantra to bring him some sacred [[Kusha grass]] (which Sumantra will not do, since he is too busy looking at Rama's face, so Bharata has to get the grass himself), and lies down upon the grass in front of Rama. Rama, however, is quickly able to persuade him to abandon the attempt. Rama mentions it as a practice of the [[brahmanas]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Medical view==
In the first three days, the body is still using energy from [[glucose]].<ref>C. J. Coffee, Quick Look: Metabolism, Hayes Barton Press, Dec 1, 2004, p.169</ref> After that, the [[liver]] starts processing [[body fat]], in a process called [[ketosis]]. After depleting fat, the body enters a "[[starvation]] mode".<ref>C. J. Coffee, Quick Look: Metabolism, Hayes Barton Press, Dec 1, 2004, p.169</ref> At this point the body "mines" the muscles and vital organs for energy, and loss of [[bone marrow]] becomes life-threatening. There are examples of hunger strikers dying after 46 to 73 days of strike, for example the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Examples==

===British and American suffragettes===
[[File:Poster - Votes for Women - Man Prisoner Fed by Force, March 1911. (22896718036).jpg|thumb|1911 Poster Votes for Women (UK) re William Ball force-fed hunger strike|alt=|224x224px]]
[[File:Djuna Barnes Clipping.jpg|thumb|Clipping from ''World Magazine'', September 6, 1914.]]
In the early 20th century [[Women's suffrage|suffragettes]] frequently endured hunger strikes in British prisons. [[Marion Wallace Dunlop|Marion Dunlop]] was the first in 1909.  She was released, as the authorities did not want her to become a [[martyr]].  Other suffragettes in prison also undertook hunger strikes.  The prison authorities subjected them to [[force-feeding]], which the suffragettes categorized as a form of [[torture]]. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]'s sister [[Mary Jane Clarke|Mary Clarke]] died shortly after being force-fed in prison, and others including [[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton]] are believed to have had serious health problems caused by force feeding, dying of a [[heart attack]] not long after.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Simon|title=Psychiatry in Prisons: A Comprehensive Handbook|url=https://archive.org/details/psychiatryprison00wils|url-access=limited|year=2009|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1843102236|author2=Ian Cumming|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychiatryprison00wils/page/n156 156]}}</ref> [[William Ball (suffragist)|William Ball]], a working class supporter of women's suffrage, was the subject of  a pamphlet ''Torture in an English Prison''  not only due to the effects of force-feeding, but a cruel separation from family contact and mental health deterioration, secret transfer to a lunatic asylum and needed lifelong mental institutional care.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rise up, women! : the remarkable lives of the suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2018|isbn=9781408844045|location=London|pages=289, 293|oclc=1016848621}}</ref>  

In 1913 the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913]] (nicknamed the "Cat and Mouse Act") changed policy.  Hunger strikes were tolerated but prisoners were released when they became sick.  When they had recovered, the suffragettes were taken back to prison to finish their sentences. About 100 women received [[Hunger Strike Medal|medal]]s for hunger striking or enduring [[force-feeding]].

Like their British counterparts, American suffragettes also used this method of political protest. A few years prior to the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], a group of American suffragettes led by [[Alice Paul]] engaged in a hunger strike and endured forced feedings while incarcerated at the [[Occoquan Workhouse]] in Virginia.

===Irish republicans===

Hunger strikes have deep roots in Irish society and in the Irish psyche. Fasting in order to bring attention to an injustice which one felt under his lord, and thus shame him, was a common feature of [[Brehon Laws|early Irish]] society and this tactic was fully incorporated into the [[Brehon]] legal system. The tradition is ultimately most likely part of the still older Indo-European tradition of which the Irish were part.<ref>[[D.A. Binchy]], "A Pre-Christian Survival in Mediaeval Irish Hagiography," in ''Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 168–178</ref><ref>[[Rudolf Thurneysen]], "Das Fasten beim Pfändungsverfahren," ''Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie'' 15 (1924–25) 260–275.</ref>

The tactic was used by [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicans]] during the [[Irish revolutionary period|1916–23 revolutionary period]]. Early use of hunger strikes was countered with [[force-feeding]], culminating in 1917 in the death of [[Thomas Ashe]] in [[Mountjoy Prison]]. During the [[Anglo-Irish war]], in October 1920, the [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Terence MacSwiney]], died on hunger strike in [[Brixton prison]]. Two other Cork [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) men, [[Joe Murphy (Irish Republican)|Joe Murphy]] and [[Michael Fitzgerald (Irish Republican)|Michael Fitzgerald]], died in this protest. Over a period of 94 days, from August 11 to November 12, 1920 John and Peter Crowley, Thomas Donovan, Michael Burke, Michael O'Reilly, Christopher Upton, John Power, Joseph Kenny and Seán Hennessy, demanding reinstatement of political status and release from prison, undertook a hunger strike at the [[Cork County Gaol]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/11/13/109801275.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=END HUNGER STRIKE OF CORK PRISONERS; Sinn Féin Leader Absolves Them and They Take Food After 94 Days' Fast.

During the 1920s, the vessel {{HMS|Argenta}} was used as a military base and [[prison ship]] for the holding of [[Irish republican]]s by the British government as part of their [[internment]] strategy post [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 [[Civilian Internee|internee]]s, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result. There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. By February 1923, under the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|1922 Special Powers Act]] the British were detaining 263 men on ''Argenta'', which was moored in [[Belfast Lough]]. This was supplemented with [[internment]] at other land based sites such as [[Larne]] [[workhouse]], [[Crumlin Road (HM Prison)|Belfast Prison]] and [[Derry Gaol]]. Together, both the ship and the workhouse alone held 542 men [[Habeas corpus|without trial]] at the highest internment population level during June 1923.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

After the end of the [[Irish Civil War]] in October 1923, up to 8,000 [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]] prisoners went on hunger strike to protest their continued detention by the [[Irish Free State]] (a total of over 12,000 republicans had been interned by May 1923). Two men, [[Denny Barry]] and Andrew O'Sullivan, died on the strike. The strike, however, was called off before any more deaths occurred. The Free State subsequently released the women republican prisoners. Most of the male republicans were not released until the following year.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Under [[Éamon de Valera|de Valera]]'s [[Government of the 7th Dáil|first Fianna Fáil government]] in 1932, military pensions were awarded to dependants of republicans who died in 1920s hunger strikes on the same basis as those who were [[killed in action]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1932/act/24/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5|title=Army Pensions Act, 1932, Section 5(2)|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017|quote=the word "killed" includes ... death as an immediate result of refusing to take nourishment while detained in prison }}</ref> During [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the state of emergency]] of [[World War II]] [[Government of the 10th Dáil|another De Valera government]] interned many IRA members, three of whom died on hunger strike: [[Sean McCaughey]], [[Tony D'Arcy]] and [[Sean (Jack) McNeela]]. Hundreds of others carried out shorter hunger strikes during the de Valera years.

The tactic was revived by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in the early 1970s, when several republicans successfully used hunger strikes to get themselves released from custody without charge in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. [[Michael Gaughan (Irish republican)|Michael Gaughan]] died after being force-fed in [[Parkhurst Prison]] in 1974. [[Frank Stagg (Irish republican)|Frank Stagg]], an IRA member being held in [[Wakefield Prison]], died in 1976 after a 62-day hunger strike which he began as a campaign to be [[repatriate]]d to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book | last = White | first = Robert | title = Ruairí Ó Brádaigh: The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0253347084 | pages = 246–247}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = O'Donnell | first = Ruán | title = Special Category: The IRA in English Prisons Vol.1: 1968-78 | publisher = [[Irish Academic Press]] | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-7165-3142-5 | page = 364 }}</ref>

====Irish hunger strike of 1981====
{{Main|1981 Irish hunger strike}}
{{See also|Anti H-Block|HM Prison Maze}}
In 1980, seven prisoners, six from the IRA and one from the [[Irish National Liberation Army]], in the [[Maze Prison]] launched a hunger strike as a protest against the revocation by the [[British Government]] of a [[prisoner of war|prisoner-of-war]]-like [[Special Category Status]] for [[paramilitary]] prisoners in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book | last = White | first = Robert | title = Out of the Ashes: An Oral History of the Provisional Irish Republican Movement | publisher = Merrion Press | year = 2017 | page = 173 | isbn = 9781785370939}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Dillon | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Dillon | title = The Dirty War | publisher = [[Arrow Books]] | year = 1991 | pages = 288 | isbn = 978-0-09-984520-1}}</ref> The strike, led by [[Brendan Hughes]], was called off before any deaths, when the British government seemed to offer to concede their demands; however, the British Government then reneged on the details of the agreement. The prisoners then called another hunger strike the following year. This time, instead of many prisoners striking at the same time, the hunger strikers started fasting one after the other in order to maximise publicity over the fate of each one.<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Provos The IRA & Sinn Féin | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-7475-3818-2 | page = 237}}</ref>

[[Bobby Sands]] was the first of ten [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] [[paramilitary]] prisoners to die during the 1981 hunger strike. There was widespread sympathy for the hunger strikers from Irish republicans and the broader [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] community on both sides of the [[Irish border]]. Sands was elected as an MP for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] to the United Kingdom's's [[Houses of Parliament]] and two other prisoners, [[Paddy Agnew (Irish republican)|Paddy Agnew]] (who was not a hunger striker) and [[Kieran Doherty (hunger striker)|Kieran Doherty]], were elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] by electorates who wished to register their opposition to the British Government's policy. The ten men survived without food for 46 to 73 days,<ref>[http://www.morrigan.net/starryplough/apr2005/apr2005.pdf The Starry Plough on 1981 Irish hunger strikes]</ref> taking only water and salt, before succumbing. After the deaths of the men and severe public disorder, the British Government granted partial concessions to the prisoners, and the strike was called off. The hunger strikes gave a significant [[propaganda]] boost to a previously severely demoralised IRA.

===Gandhi and Bhagat Singh===
{{unsourced section|date=June 2020}}
{{see also|List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi}}
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] was imprisoned in 1922, 1930, 1933 and 1942. Because of Gandhi's stature around the world, British authorities were loath to allow him to die in their custody; Gandhi engaged in several famous hunger strikes to protest British rule of India.

In addition to Gandhi, various others used the hunger strike option during the Indian independence movement. Such figures include [[Jatin Das]] (who fasted to death) and [[Bhagat Singh]]. It was only on the 116th day of their fast, on October 5, 1929 that Bhagat Singh and [[Batukeshwar Dutt]] gave up their strike (surpassing the 97-day world record for hunger strikes which was set by an Irish revolutionary). During this hunger strike that lasted 116 days and ended with the British succumbing to his wishes, he gained much popularity among the common Indians. Before the strike his popularity was limited mainly to the Punjab region.

===Potti Sriramulu===
{{unsourced section|date=June 2020}}
[[Potti Sriramulu]] was an Indian revolutionary who died after undertaking a hunger strike for 58 days in 1952 after Indian independence in an attempt to achieve the formation of a separate state, to be known as [[Andhra State]]. His death became instrumental in the [[States Reorganisation Commission|linguistic re-organisation of states]].

He is revered as ''Amarajeevi'' (Immortal being) in Coastal Andra for his role in achieving the linguistic re-organisation of states. As a devout follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], he worked for much of his life to uphold principles such as truth, non-violence and patriotism, as well as causes such as [[Harijan]] movement to end the traditional alienation of, and accord respect and humane treatment to those traditionally called "[[untouchability|untouchables]]" in Indian society.

===Cuban dissidents===

On April 3, 1972, [[Pedro Luis Boitel]], an imprisoned poet and dissident, declared himself on hunger strike. After 53 days on hunger strike, receiving only liquids, he died of starvation on May 25, 1972. His last days were related by his close friend, poet [[Armando Valladares]]. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana|Cólon Cemetery]] in [[Havana]].

[[Guillermo Fariñas]] did a seven-month hunger strike to protest against the extensive [[Censorship in Cuba|Internet censorship in Cuba]]. He ended it in Autumn 2006, with severe health problems although still conscious.<ref name="RWB">{{cite web |url=https://rsf.org/en/news/guillermo-farinas-ends-seven-month-old-hunger-strike-internet-access |title=Guillermo Fariñas ends seven-month-old hunger strike for Internet access |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=January 20, 2016 }}</ref> [[Reporters Without Borders]] awarded its cyber-freedom prize to Guillermo Fariñas in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rsf.org/en/news/cyber-freedom-prize-2006-awarded-guillermo-farinas-cuba |title=Cyber-freedom prize for 2006 awarded to Guillermo Fariñas of Cuba |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=January 20, 2016 }}</ref>

[[Jorge Luis García Pérez]] (known as Antúnez) has done hunger strikes. In 2009, following the end of his 17-year imprisonment, Antúnez, his wife Iris, and Diosiris Santana Pérez started a hunger strike to support other political prisoners. Leaders from Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Argentina declared their support for Antúnez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directorio.org/pressreleases/note.php?note_id=2389 |title=Additional Latin American Leaders Join in Solidarity with Antúnez |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027130847/http://www.directorio.org/pressreleases/note.php?note_id=2389 |archivedate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directorio.org/pressreleases/note.php?note_id=2357 |title=Young Uruguayans Support Antúnez, Cuban Political Prisoners |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027130843/http://www.directorio.org/pressreleases/note.php?note_id=2357 |archivedate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>

On February 23, 2010, [[Orlando Zapata]], a dissident arrested in 2003 as part of a crackdown on opposition groups, died in a hospital while undertaking a hunger strike that had been ongoing for 83 days, in Cuba's "Kilo 8" prison. He had declared the hunger strike in protest of the poor conditions of the prison in which he was held.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8533350.stm|title=Cuban prison hunger striker Orlando Zapata Tamayo dies|publisher=BBC News|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  He was one of 55 prisoners of conscience in Cuba to have been adopted by Amnesty International.  He was charged with an array of offences, including "resistance", "contempt", and "disrespect".

==Legal situation==
Article 8 of the 1975 [[World Medical Association]] [[Declaration of Tokyo]] states that doctors are not allowed to force-feed hunger strikers. They are supposed to understand the prisoner's independent wishes, and it is recommended to have a second opinion as to the capability of the prisoner to understand the implication of his decision and be capable of informed consent.

:Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the physician as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, he or she shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgement  should be confirmed by at least one other independent physician. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the physician to the prisoner.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-tokyo-guidelines-for-physicians-concerning-torture-and-other-cruel-inhuman-or-degrading-treatment-or-punishment-in-relation-to-detention-and-imprisonment/ | title=WMA - the World Medical Association - WMA DECLARATION OF TOKYO – GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICIANS CONCERNING TORTURE AND OTHER CRUEL, INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT IN RELATION TO DETENTION AND IMPRISONMENT}}</ref>

The World Medical Association (WMA) recently revised and updated its Declaration of Malta on Hunger Strikers.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-malta-on-hunger-strikers/ | title=WMA - the World Medical Association-WMA Declaration of Malta on Hunger Strikers}}</ref> Among many changes, it unambiguously states that force feeding is a form of inhumane and degrading treatment in its Article 21.

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) is a member of the WMA, but the AMA's members are not bound by the WMA's decisions, as neither organization has formal legal powers.  The AMA has formally endorsed the WMA Declaration of Tokyo and has written several letters to the US Government and made public statements in opposition to US physician involvement in force feeding of hunger strikers in contravention of medical ethics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/04/30/1940121/ama-force-feeding-gitmo|title=American Medical Association Opposes Force-Feeding Prisoners On Hunger Strike At Gitmo}}</ref> The [[United States]] [[Code of Federal Regulations]] rule on hunger strikes by [[prisoner]]s states, "It is the responsibility of the Bureau of Prisons to monitor the health and welfare of individual inmates, and to ensure that procedures are pursued to preserve life."
