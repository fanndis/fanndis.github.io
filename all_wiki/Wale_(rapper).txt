Production for ''Ambition'' took place at ZAC Recording in Atlanta, Georgia with The Board Administration Producer Tone P. Anticipation for ''Ambition'' was incited through the release and heavy viral promotion of mixtape, ''The Eleven One Eleven Theory'' done under Wale's label, The Board Administration. ''The Eleven One Eleven Theory'' debuted August 17, 2011, on ''Life and Times'' in honor of Wale's Twitter milestone of reaching one million followers and was purposefully made with the intent to build widespread anticipation for the November 1, 2011, scheduled release date of ''Ambition''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ralphfolarin.com/blog/2011/08/new-mixtape-wale-the-eleven-one-eleven-theory | title=New Mixtape: Wale – "The Eleven One Eleven Theory | work=Wale's Official Blog | publisher=Wale Music | date=August 17, 2011 | accessdate=August 18, 2011 | author=Admin | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022034140/http://ralphfolarin.com/blog/2011/08/new-mixtape-wale-the-eleven-one-eleven-theory | archive-date=October 22, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref> This marketing strategy was the [[wikt:brainchild|brainchild]] of The Board Administration CEO Le'Greg O.
