The '''Master of Philosophy''' ('''MPhil'''; [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Magister Philosophiae}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Philosophiae Magister}}'') is a [[postgraduate]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. An MPhil typically includes a taught portion and a significant research portion, during which a thesis project is conducted under supervision. An MPhil may be awarded to postgraduate students after completing taught coursework and one to two years of original research, which may also serve as a provisional enrollment for a [[PhD]] programme.

==Australia==
In Australia, the Master of Philosophy is a research degree which mirrors a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in breadth of research and structure. Candidates are assessed on the basis of a thesis. A standard full-time degree often takes two years to complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studyat.uwa.edu.au/courses/master-of-philosophy-research |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218233632/http://www.studyat.uwa.edu.au/courses/master-of-philosophy-research |archive-date=2014-02-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7500 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201160039/http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=7500 |archive-date=2014-02-01 }}</ref>

==Belgium and Netherlands==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2019}}
In [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], the MPhil is a special research degree, and is only awarded by selected departments of a university (mostly in the fields of arts, social sciences, archaeology, philosophy and theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students aiming for an academic career. After finishing these programmes, students normally pursue a PhD programme.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science decided in 2009 not to recognize the MPhil degree. Accordingly, Dutch universities stopped awarding this degree and now award the legally-recognized [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]] degrees instead.<ref>[http://www.aanstaande-studenten.leidenuniv.nl/masteropleidingen/masteropleidingen/mphil-graad-niet-meer-verleend.html De MPhil graad wordt niet meer verleend], Leiden University. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726114420/http://www.aanstaande-studenten.leidenuniv.nl/masteropleidingen/masteropleidingen/mphil-graad-niet-meer-verleend.html |date=July 26, 2009 }}</ref>

==Canada==
The MPhil is offered at some Canadian universities as a two-year degree involving coursework, examinations, and practice at academic writing. At some institutions, successful completion leads to a guaranteed place on a PhD course with "advanced standing", reducing the length of the PhD by a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Master of Philosophy Program |url=https://www.queensu.ca/english/graduate-program/master-philosophy-program |website=Queens University |publisher=Queens University Canada |access-date=8 August 2018}}</ref>

==India==
Indian universities offer MPhil degrees as the most advanced master's degree in the fields of arts, science and humanities. The duration is typically two years long and includes both a taught portion and an extensive research portion. Several universities offer enrollment in their integrated MPhil–PhD program and MPhil degree holders are usually exempted from some of the doctoral coursework requirement. In July 2020, the [[Government of India]] announced that, as part of its new [[National Education Policy]], MPhils would be discontinued in India.<ref>https://www.livemint.com/education/news/mphil-to-be-discontinued-and-other-key-points-in-national-education-policy-11596022845294.html</ref>

==Finland==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}
In Finland, the regular master's degree ''filosofian maisteri'' translates to "Master of Philosophy". As in English, the term "[[philosophy]]" does not imply a specialization in theoretical philosophy. These degrees are regular master's degrees, not special "higher" degrees (cf. [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] and Doctor of Philosophy). In the past, ''filosofian maisteri'' signified that the degree was earned through actual studying, in contrast to honorary master's degrees that were granted upon application to bachelor's degree graduates.

==Malaysia==

In Malaysia, the MPhil degree is commonly offered in a number of older and more-established universities in Malaysia, including the University of Malaya, Multimedia University (MMU), Wawasan Open University, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC), Monash University Sunway Campus (MUSC) and Curtin Malaysia Campus. In most cases, the MPhil is largely a research degree, with only a minor taught component. On a case-by-case basis, candidates must pass a ''viva voce'' examination before the degree is awarded. For UNMC and MUSC, the Faculty of Engineering offers a standalone MPhil degree which will lead to the PhD.

The MPhil is normally regarded as a more prestigious master's degree than typical taught master's degrees such as the MA, MSc or MEng. Specifically for the University of Malaya, if the desired field of research does not belong to any of the specialized faculties, it is normally categorized under the MPhil supervised by the Postgraduate Institute.

In November 2012, the [[Malaysian Qualifications Agency]] issued programme standards for postgraduate studies in which MPhil is attributed to Master programme by research and mixed mode (coursework and research).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mqa.gov.my/portal2012/default/en/pubs_gp.cfm|title=Quality Assurance Documents|access-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706165055/http://www.mqa.gov.my/portal2012/default/en/pubs_gp.cfm|archive-date=6 July 2012}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}}

==Norway==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2019}}
In Norway, the degree of MPhil was a master's degree (180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits) at a level equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] or MSc However, unlike a standard MA or MSc, which have a thesis worth 60 ECTS,{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} the MPhil has a research workload of up to 180 ECTS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mphfeng/components|title=Programme components – Master of Philosophy in English Linguistics and Language Acquisition|first=Christian|last=Fossen|website=www.ntnu.edu|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428213037/https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mphfeng/components|archive-date=28 April 2018}}</ref> Upon completion, the MPhil graduate usually qualifies for acceptance to a PhD program. Nevertheless, the MPhil is most often taken as a standalone qualification.

The MPhil degree was considered to be equivalent to US and UK PhD degrees and from the early 1900s the PhD established itself as the usual translation of Danish and Norwegian master's degrees into English. This must be seen in the context of the fact that the PhD originally designated research education in the US and eventually equivalent degrees in the UK which had a similar scope and fulfilled a similar function as the master's degree in Denmark and Norway, as the final degree taken at the beginning of a research career, while the doctorates in Denmark and Norway were often taken by middle-aged and well-established academics. In Denmark and Norway, PhD in the 20th century was therefore not necessarily or necessarily regarded as identical to a "doctorate" as understood in Denmark and Norway. Also in the UK, PhD was explicitly introduced as a "lower doctorate" according to US model calculated on younger researchers than those who took the traditional doctorates, and the PhD degree was awarded without defense and with less ceremonial [https://no.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister]

==Pakistan==
In Pakistan, the MPhil is one of the most advanced master's degrees offered by public and private universities in several different fields of study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Pages/DAIs/HEC-Recognized-Universities.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109202927/http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Pages/DAIs/HEC-Recognized-Universities.aspx |archive-date=2016-11-09 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=February 2019}} This is usually a two-year full-time program which includes teaching and research that leads to the PhD. The degree of MPhil also serves as a requirement to gain admission into a Doctoral program in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Spain==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}
In Spain, the MPhil degree is equivalent to the ''[[Diploma de Estudios Avanzados]]'', or DEA.{{according to whom|date=February 2019}} In order to obtain it, the student has to complete a full year of doctoral courses and training in research methods, as well as doing original research towards a thesis.

==United Kingdom==
In most UK universities, the MPhil is a research degree.<ref name="Master's Characteristics">{{cite report|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Masters-Degree-Characteristics-15.pdf|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement|date=September 2015|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|pages=12|access-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006014405/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Masters-Degree-Characteristics-15.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The completion of an MPhil typically requires two years of full-time (or five years or more of part-time study) and the submission of coursework and a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate (typically 25,000 to 50,000 words).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} It is common for students admitted into a PhD program at a UK university to be initially registered for the degree of MPhil, and then to transfer (or upgrade) to the PhD upon successful completion of the first (or sometimes the second) year of study: this will often involve the submission of a report or dissertation by the student, and possibly an oral examination or presentation.<ref name="Master's Characteristics"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/research-degrees/degrees-we-offer/master-of-philosophy-mphil|title=MPhil - Research Degrees - Open University|first=The Open|last=University|website=www.open.ac.uk|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928143131/http://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/research-degrees/degrees-we-offer/master-of-philosophy-mphil|archive-date=28 September 2017}}</ref> Conversely, a PhD candidate may transfer to an MPhil programme or be awarded the degree of MPhil if they do not meet the requirements for the award of a PhD.

Usage can be different at the ancient universities. The MPhil at Oxford and Cambridge can be either a taught degree or a research degree, and may take one or two years, depending on the course. [[Cambridge University]] offers one- and two-year-long MPhil degree programs across all of its departments and faculties.<ref name="cam-ord7">{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/prospec/studying/qualifdir/glossary.html#tmphil|title=Qualifications|access-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128225254/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/prospec/studying/qualifdir/glossary.html#tmphil|archive-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> This takes the place of the MA at other universities, as the [[Oxbridge MA]] is awarded to [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] graduates  after a certain period without any further study. At [[Oxford University]], the MPhil is usually a two-year master's degree, although some programs are one-year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/research.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205051146/http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/research.shtml |archive-date=2009-02-05 }}</ref> The MPhil requires a lengthy thesis and more examinations than a one-year master's degree (such as the MSc or [[Master of Studies|MSt]]). The [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient Scottish universities]], who for historical reasons award the [[Scottish MA]] upon completion of four-year first degree programs in arts and humanities subjects, differ in their use of MPhil or MLitt for postgraduate research degrees, but are slowly standardizing to the MPhil as a research degree and the MLitt as a taught degree.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==United States==
Although most American universities do not award the MPhil, a few award it under certain circumstances. At some of those institutions (including [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]], [[George Washington University]], [[The New School]], and the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]), the degree is awarded to [[PhD]] candidates when they complete their required coursework and qualifying examinations prior to the completion and defense of a doctoral [[dissertation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://architecture.yale.edu/school/academic-programs/doctor-philosophy-program#Master%E2%80%99s%20Degree|title=Doctor of Philosophy program|at=Master's Degree|publisher=Yale School of Architecture|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/doctoral-program/academics/degree-requirements/master-philosophy|title=Master of Philosophy|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019–2021|title=New York University Bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Science|url=https://gsas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/gsas/documents/bulletins/GSAS_Bulletin_2019-21.pdf|publisher=New York University}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/phd-requirements|title=PhD Requirements|publisher=Department of Economics, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, George Washington University|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newschool.edu/milano/public-urban-policy-phd-curriculum/|title=Public and Urban Policy (PhD)|work=The New School|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Governance,-Policies,-Procedures/Detail?id=4324|title=Mphil Application|website=www.gc.cuny.edu|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> This formalizes the more colloquial "[[All But Dissertation]]" status; as such, defense of a dissertation proposal is sometimes required for conferral.
