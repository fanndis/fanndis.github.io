'''Sheikh Mujibur Rahman''' ({{lang-bn|শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান}}; 17 March 1920&nbsp;– 15 August 1975), shortened as '''Sheikh Mujib''' or just '''Mujib''', was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the "[[Pater Patriae|Father of the Nation]]" in Bangladesh. He served as the first [[President of Bangladesh]] and later as the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] from 17 April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web |title=Who is Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose birth centenary Bangladesh is observing today |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-who-is-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-whose-birth-centenary-bangladesh-is-observing-6317512/ |website=The Indian Express |access-date=28 May 2020 |ref=17 March is the birth anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (1920–1975), the founding leader of Bangladesh and the country’s first Prime Minister. He is referred to as Sheikh Mujib or simply Mujib, the title ‘Bangabandhu’ meaning ‘friend of Bengal’. |language=en |date=17 March 2020}}</ref> He is considered to be the driving force behind the independence of Bangladesh. He is popularly dubbed with the title of "Bangabandhu" ({{transl|bn|''Bôngobondhu''}} "Friend of Bengal") by the people of Bangladesh. He became a leading figure in and eventually the leader of the [[Awami League]], founded in 1949 as an [[East Pakistan]]–based political party in [[Pakistan]]. Mujib is credited as an important figure in efforts to gain political autonomy for East Pakistan and later as the central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Thus, he is regarded "Jatir Janak" or "Jatir Pita" ({{transl|bn|''Jatir Jônok''}} or {{transl|bn|''Jatir Pita''}}, both meaning "[[Father of the Nation]]") of Bangladesh. His daughter [[Sheikh Hasina]] is the current leader of the Awami League and also the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

An initial advocate of [[Democracy in Bangladesh|democracy]] and [[Socialism in Bangladesh|socialism]], Mujib rose to the ranks of the Awami League and East Pakistani politics as a charismatic and forceful orator. He became popular for his opposition to the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis in Pakistan, who comprised the majority of the state's population. At the heightening of sectional tensions, he outlined a [[Six point movement|six-point autonomy plan]] and was jailed by the regime of Field Marshal Ayub Khan for treason. Mujib led the Awami League to win the [[1970 Pakistani general election|first democratic election of Pakistan]] in 1970. Despite gaining a majority, the League was not invited by the ruling military junta to form a government. As civil disobedience erupted across East Pakistan, Mujib indirectly announced independence of Bangladesh during a [[7 March Speech of Bangabandhu|landmark speech on 7 March 1971]]. On 26 March 1971, the Pakistan Army responded to the mass protests with [[Operation Searchlight]], in which Prime Minister–elect Mujib was arrested and flown to solitary confinement in West Pakistan, while Bengali civilians, students, intellectuals, politicians and military defectors were murdered as part of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. During Mujib's absence, many Bengalis joined the [[Mukti Bahini]] and, helped by the [[Indian Armed Forces]], defeated the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After Bangladesh's independence, Mujib was released from Pakistani custody due to international pressure and returned to Dhaka in January 1972 after a short visit to Britain and India.

Mujib became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh under a parliamentary system adopted by the new country. He charged the provisional parliament to write a new [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]] proclaiming the four fundamental principles of "nationalism, secularism, democracy, and socialism", which reflect his political views collectively known as [[Mujibism]]. The Awami League won a huge mandate in the country's first general election in 1973. However, Mujib faced challenges of rampant unemployment, poverty and corruption, as well as the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]]. The government was criticized for denying constitutional recognition to indigenous minorities and human rights violations by its security forces, notably the National Defence Force or [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] paramilitary. Amid rising political agitation, Mujib initiated [[One party rule|one party]] socialist rule in January 1975. Six months later, [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|he and most of his family were assassinated]] by renegade army officers during [[15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|a coup]]. A martial law government was subsequently established. In a 2004 BBC poll, Mujib was voted the ''[[Greatest Bengali of all time]]''.<ref name="SMR1">—{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3623345.stm|title=Listeners name 'greatest Bengali'|date=14 April 2004|access-date=16 April 2018|work=BBC}}<br />—{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/04/17/stories/2004041703001700.htm|title=International : Mujib, Tagore, Bose among 'greatest Bengalis of all time'|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 April 2004|last1=Habib|first1=Haroon}}<br />—{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/04/16/d4041601066.htm|title=Bangabandhu judged greatest Bangali of all time|work=The Daily Star |date=16 April 2004}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
[[File:House of Bangabandhu Tungipara.jpg|thumb|left|The house where Mujib was born in Tungipara]]

Mujib was born in [[Tungipara Upazila|Tungipara]], a village in [[Gopalganj District (Bangladesh)|Gopalganj District]] in the province of Bengal in British India,<ref name="REF">{{cite book |last=Harun-or- Rashid |year=2012 |chapter=Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> to [[Sheikh Lutfur Rahman]], a serestadar (court clerk) of Gopalganj civil court, and his wife [[Sayera Khatun|Sheikh Sayera Khatun]]. He was born into a [[Bengali Muslim]] family as the third child in a family of four daughters and two sons.<ref name="REF"/>

In 1929, Mujib entered into class three at Gopalganj Public School, and two years later, class four at Madaripur Islamia High School.{{sfn|Kādira|2004|p=440}} From very early age Mujib showed a potential of leadership. His parents noted in an interview that at a young age, he organized a student protest in his school for the removal of an inept principal.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Mujib withdrew from school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery, and returned to school only after four years, owing to the severity of the surgery and slow recovery.{{sfn|Mujibur Rahman|2012|p=9}}

Later, he passed his Matriculation from Gopalganj Missionary School in 1942, Intermediate of Arts from Islamia College (now [[Maulana Azad College]]) in 1944 and BA from the same college in 1947.<ref name="REF"/> After the partition of India, he got himself admitted into the [[University of Dhaka]] to study law but could not complete it due to his expulsion from the University in early 1949 on the charge of 'inciting the fourth-class employees' in their agitation against the University authority's indifference towards their legitimate demands. After 61 years, in 2010, the expulsion has been withdrawn terming the expulsion as unjust and undemocratic.<ref name="REF"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Ahammed  |first=Rakib |title=DU rights historic wrong |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-150811 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref><ref name=BD>[https://m.bdnews24.com/en/detail/bangladesh/248617 Mujib's DU expulsion order withdrawn]</ref>

==Political activism in British India==
[[File:Mujib-Suhra.gif|thumb|Mujib (right) with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy in 1949]]

Mujib became politically active when he joined the [[All India Muslim Students Federation]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ahmad |first1=Syed Nur |year=1985 |orig-year=First published in Urdu in 1965 |editor-last1=Baxter |editor-first1=Craig |translator-last=Ali |translator-first=Mahmud |title=From martial law to martial law: politics in the Punjab, 1919–1958 |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |location=Boulder, Colorado |page=338 |isbn=978-0-86531-845-8 |quote=Sheikh Mujibur Rahnan ... entered politics in 1940 in the A11-India Muslim Students Federation and later was a student at Islamia Co1lege, Calcutta.}}</ref>

He joined the [[All India Muslim League|Bengal Muslim League]] in 1943. During this period, Mujib worked actively for the League's cause of a separate [[Muslim]] state of Pakistan, and in 1946 he went on to become general secretary of the Islamia College Students Union. M. Bhaskaran Nair describes that Mujib "emerged as the most powerful man in the party" because of his proximity to [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]].<ref name="Nair1990">{{cite book |last=Nair |first=M.

After obtaining his BA degree in 1947, Mujib was one of the Muslim politicians working under Suhrawardy during the [[Direct Action Day|communal violence]] that broke out in Calcutta, in 1946, just before the [[partition of India]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Zillur Rahman |date=1996 |title=The Third World Charismat: Sheikh Mujib and the Struggle for Freedom  |publisher=University Press Limited |location=Dhaka |page=32 |isbn=978-984-05-1353-6}}</ref>

== Leader of Pakistan ==

===Early political career===

After the [[Partition of India]], Mujib chose to stay in the newly created Pakistan. On his return to what became known as East Pakistan, he enrolled in the University of Dhaka to study law and founded the [[East Pakistan Muslim Students' League]]. He became one of the most prominent student political leaders in the province. During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for socialism as the solution to mass poverty, unemployment, and poor living conditions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/75909/Bangabandhu-wanted-to-establish-socialism-within-Democratic-state-framework:-Amu |title=Bangabandhu wanted to establish socialism within Democratic state framework: Amu |newspaper= Daily Sun |date= 14 September 2015 |access-date= 3 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Bengali language movement ===
[[File:Rally on 21Feb1954 Abdul Hamid and Bangabandhu.jpg|thumb|Rally on 21 February 1954 by Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Mujibur Rahman marching barefoot to pay their tributes to the Language Movement Martyrs]]

Following the declaration of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] on 21 March 1948, that the people of East Bengal would have to adopt [[Urdu]] as the state language, protests broke out amongst the population.<ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite book |last=Al Helal |first=Bashir |year=2012 |chapter=Language Movement |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Mujib immediately decided to start a movement against this former planned decision of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. In the same year on 2 March a conference was held at Dhaka University's Fazlul Haq Muslim Hall, with leaders of different political parties. In this conference, discussions about the movement against the Muslim League were discussed. From here on, the decision of the constitution of the All-party Parliamentary Council was decided. The strike was celebrated in Dhaka on 11 March 1948, at the direction of this council. During the strike, some other political activists, including Mujibur, were arrested in front of the secretariat building. But due to pressure from the student protest, Mujib and other student leaders were released on 15 March. On the occasion of their release the [[Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad]] (National Language Action Committee) arranged a rally which took place at Dhaka University.<ref name="JSToldenburg">{{cite journal

On 11 September 1948 he was again arrested

On 21 January 1949, Mujib was released from prison. Out of jail, he again became involved in the demand for the demand of the fourth class employees, for which he was fired from the university. But he refrained from acquiring these fines as illegal. In continuation of this, on 26 April, Muslim League-backed candidate Shamsul Haq won a by-election in Tangail. Mujib [[hunger strike]]d in front of [[Vice Chancellor]]'s residence for the success of his movement, for which he was again arrested. At that time he was expelled from Dhaka University. He was accused of leading the movement of the fourth-class workers' rights in the university. On 23 June Suhrawardy and Maulana Bhasani East Pakistan Awami Muslim League.{{clarify|date=June 2020}} After the formation, Mujib left the Muslim League and joined this new team. He was elected joint general secretary of party East Pakistan. He  got out of prison in late June. After release he joined the movement against the food crisis. In September of that year he was temporarily detained for violating Section 144 but was released immediately.<ref name=BD/>

In early January 1950, the Awami Muslim League held an anti-famine procession in Dhaka on the occasion of the arrival of Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] to East Pakistan. Mujib was arrested this time because of his leadership. He was imprisoned for two years. On 26 January 1952, Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Khwaja Nazimuddin]] announced that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. In spite of being kept in jail after this announcement, Mujib played a special role in organizing protests. He played the role of guiding the state [[Bengali language movement]] by issuing instructions from jail. After this it was decided to observe 21 February as the day of recognition for state language. At the same time Mujib decided to observe the fast on 14 February from jail. His fasting lasted 13 days. On 26 February, he was released from jail.<ref name="REF" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Bishwas |first=Sukumar |date=2005 |title=Bangladesh Liberation War, Mujibnagar Government Documents, 1971 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-1tAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Mawla Brothers |location=Dhaka |page=167 |isbn=978-984-410-434-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://dailyasianage.com/news/11509 |title= The lighthouse of Bengali mentality |author= Dr. Atiur Rahman |newspaper= The Asian Age |date= 21 February 2016 |access-date= 3 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="BAL">{{cite web |url= http://www.albd.org/bangabandhu/bangabandhu.htm| title = Political Profile of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

Mujib left the Muslim League to join [[Maulana Bhashani]] and [[Yar Mohammad Khan]] in the formation of the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]], the predecessor of the Awami League. Maulana Bhashani was elected as president while Yar Mohammad Khan was the treasurer. He was elected joint secretary of its East Bengal unit in 1949. While Suhrawardy worked to build a larger coalition of East Bengali and socialist parties, Mujib focused on expanding the grass-roots organization.<ref name="samsuddin">Abu Zafar Shamsddin, Atmasriti (Self-memories) -1st part, Dhaka, 2011.</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}} In 1953, he was made the party's general secretary, and elected to the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] on a [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition ticket in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kamran |first=Tahir |date=July–December 2009 |title=Early phase of electoral politics in Pakistan: 1950s |url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/7-Tahir%20Kamran.pdf |journal=South Asian Studies |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=277–278 }}</ref> Serving briefly as the minister for agriculture during A. K. Fazlul Huq's government, Mujib was briefly arrested for organizing a protest of the central government's decision to dismiss the United Front ministry.

He was elected to the second [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] and served from 1955 to 1958.<ref name="REF" /> The government proposed to dissolve the [[Historical regions of Pakistan|provinces]] in favour of an [[One Unit|amalgamation]] of the western provinces of the Dominion of Pakistan in a plan called One Unit; at the same time the central government would be strengthened. Under One Unit, the western provinces were merged as [[West Pakistan]] during the creation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956. That year East Bengal was renamed as [[East Pakistan]] as part of One Unit at the same time. Mujib demanded that the Bengali people's ethnic identity be respected and that a popular verdict should decide the question of naming and of official language:

<blockquote>Sir [President of the Constituent Assembly], you will see that they want to place the word "East Pakistan" instead of "East Bengal." We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word "Bengal" has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in the Constitution. Why do you want it to be taken up just now? What about the state language, Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.<ref>Official Report, ''Debates'', page 296, Pakistan Constituent Assembly, 1955</ref></blockquote>

In 1956, Mujib entered a second coalition government as minister of industries, commerce, labour, anti-corruption and village aid. He resigned in 1957 to work full-time for the party organisation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Aftabuddin Ahmed |first=Mir |date= 26 March 2017 |title=From Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to our Bangabandhu |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/independence-day-special-2017/sheikh-mujibur-rahman-our-bangabandhu-1381261 |work=The Daily Star |access-date= 3 August 2017}}</ref>

In 1958 General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] suspended the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] and imposed [[martial law]]. Mujib was arrested for organizing resistance and imprisoned till 1961.<ref name="REF" /> After his release Mujib started organising an underground political body called the [[Swadhin Bangal Biplobi Parishad]] (''Free Bangla Revolutionary Council''), comprising student leaders, to oppose the regime of Ayub Khan. They worked for increased political power for Bengalis and the independence of East Pakistan. He was briefly arrested again in 1962 for organizing protests.<ref name="BAL" />

Unrest over continuing denial of democracy spread across Pakistan and Mujib intensified his opposition to the disbandment of provinces. In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled ''Our Charter of Survival'' at a national conference of opposition political parties at [[Lahore]],<ref name="REF" /> in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani federation with a weak central government.<ref name="JSTOR2" /> According to his plan:

<blockquote>
# The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore Resolution and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected on the basis of the universal adult franchise.
# The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defense and foreign affairs, and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
# Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.
# The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal center will have no such power. The Federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.
# There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.
# East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.

Mujib's points catalysed public support across East Pakistan, launching what some historians have termed the ''[[six point movement|6-point movement]]''&nbsp;– recognized as the definitive gambit for autonomy and rights of Bengalis in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news |last=Manik |first=M.

Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army and after two years in jail, an official sedition trial in a military court opened. Widely known as the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]], Mujib and 34 Bengali military officers were accused by the government of colluding with Indian government agents in a scheme to divide Pakistan and threaten its unity, order and national security. The plot was alleged to have been planned in the city of [[Agartala]], in the Indian state of [[Tripura]].<ref name="REF" /> The outcry and unrest over Mujib's arrest and the charge of sedition against him destabilised East Pakistan amidst large protests and strikes. Various Bengali political and student groups added demands to address the issues of students, workers and the poor, forming a larger "11-point plan." The government caved to the mounting pressure, dropped the charges on 22 February 1969 and unconditionally released Mujib the following day. He returned to East Pakistan as a public hero.<ref name="Agartala Conspiracy Case forty years on">{{cite news |last=Ahsan  |first=Syed Badrul |date=18 June 2008 |title=Agartala Conspiracy Case forty years on |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-41580 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> He was given a mass reception on 23 February, at Racecourse ground and conferred with the title ''Bangabandhu'', meaning ''Friend of the Bengal'' in Bengali.<ref name="Agartala Conspiracy Case forty years on"/>

Joining an all-parties conference convened by [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]], President of Pakistan, in 1969, Mujib demanded the acceptance of his six points and the demands of other political parties and walked out following its rejection. On 5 December 1969 Mujib made a declaration at a public meeting, held to observe the death anniversary of Suhrawardy, that henceforth East Pakistan would be called "Bangladesh":

<blockquote>There was a time when all efforts were made to erase the word "Bangla" from this land and its map. The existence of the word "Bangla" was found nowhere except in the term Bay of Bengal. I on behalf of Pakistan announce today that this land will be called "Bangladesh" instead of East Pakistan.<ref name="BAL" /></blockquote>

Mujib's declaration heightened tensions across the country. The West Pakistani politicians and the military began to see him as a separatist leader. His assertion of Bengali cultural and ethnic identity also re-defined the debate over regional autonomy.<ref name="Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Struggle for Independence">{{cite book |title=Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Struggle for Independence: UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Declassified Documents, 1962–1971 |author=Enayetur Rahim and Joyce L.

In the Pakistani general elections held on 7 December 1970, the Awami League under Mujib's leadership won a massive majority in the provincial legislature, and all but two of East Pakistan's quota of seats in the new [[National Assembly of Pakistan]], thus forming a clear majority.{{sfn|Kaushik|Patnayak|1995|p=295}}<ref name="REF" /><ref>{{cite book |title= The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |page= 264 |author= Meghna Guhathakurta and Willem van Schendel |year= 2003 |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |isbn= 9780822353188}}</ref>

== Governing Bangladesh ==
=== Struggle for national reconstruction ===
[[File:Mujib and Ford.jpg|thumb|250px|Mujib, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, with U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1974]]
Mujib briefly assumed the provisional presidency and later took office as the prime minister.

A new country, Bangladesh, begins with a lot of "rampage and rape of Bangladesh economy" by the Pakistani occupation force. In January 1972 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported:

<blockquote>In the aftermath of the Pakistani army's rampage last March, a special team of inspectors from the World Bank observed that some cities looked "like the morning after a nuclear attack." Since then, the destruction has only been magnified. An estimated 6,000,000 homes have been destroyed, and nearly 1,400,000 farm families have been left without tools or animals to work their lands. Transportation and communications systems are totally disrupted. Roads are damaged, bridges out and inland waterways blocked. The rape of the country continued right up until the Pakistani army surrendered a month ago. In the last days of the war, West Pakistani-owned businesses—which included nearly every commercial enterprise in the country—remitted virtually all their funds to the West. Pakistan International Airlines left exactly 117 rupees ($16) in its account at the port city of Chittagong. The army also destroyed bank notes and coins, so that many areas now suffer from a severe shortage of ready cash. Private cars were picked up off the streets or confiscated from auto dealers and shipped to the West before the ports were closed.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877626,00.html |url-access=limited|title= BANGLADESH: Mujib's Road from Prison to Power |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=17 January 1972 |access-date= 1 September 2017}}</ref><ref name= theasian>{{cite news |url= http://dailyasianage.com/news/77958/bangabandhu-cared-about-the-poor |title= Bangabandhu cared about the poor

The politicians elected in 1970 formed the provisional [[Jatiyo Sangshad]] (parliament) of the new state. The Mukti Bahini and other militias amalgamated to form a new [[Bangladesh Army]] to which Indian forces transferred control on 17 March. Mujib described the fallout of the war as the "biggest human disaster in the world," claiming the deaths of as many as 3&nbsp;million people and the rape of more than 200,000 women.<ref name= theasian/>

Although the state was committed to [[secularism]], Mujib soon began moving closer to [[Political aspects of Islam|political Islam]] through state policies as well as personal conduct.<ref name="SAAGI" /> He revived the [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh|Islamic Academy]] (which had been banned in 1972 for suspected collusion with Pakistani forces) and [[Prohibition|banned]] the production and sale of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and banned the practice of [[gambling]], which had been one of the major demands of Islamic groups.<ref name="SAAGI" /> In his public appearances and speeches, Mujib made increased usage of Islamic greetings, slogans, and references to Islamic ideologies. In his final years, Mujib largely abandoned his trademark "Joy Bangla" salutation for'' '[[Khuda Hafez]]' ''preferred by religious Muslims. He also declared a common amnesty to the suspected war criminals, on some conditions, to get the support of far right groups as the communists were not happy with Mujib's regime. He declared, "I believe that the brokers, who assisted the Pakistanis during the liberation war has realized their faults. I hope they will involve themselves in the development of the country forgetting all their misdeeds. Those who were arrested and jailed in the Collaborator act should be freed before the 16 December 1974".<ref name="SAAGI">{{cite web

The [[Bangladesh famine of 1974|1974 famine]] further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture&nbsp;– the mainstay of the economy.

In response, he began increasing his powers. In 1974, Mujib declared a [[state of emergency]]. On 25 January 1975, the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Bangladesh#Fourth amendment|Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh]] was passed, replacing the parliamentary system with a presidential system, reducing the power of the [[Jatiya Sangsad|National Parliament]] and [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]], and codifying a [[One-party state]] into law.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Restoration of his public image awaited the election of an Awami League government in 1996, which was led by his eldest daughter, [[Sheikh Hasina]], the leader of the party. 15 August has since been commemorated as "National Mourning Day". The country keeps it flags lowered to half-mast in this day as a sign of mourning.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bangladesh-remembers-founding-leader/article19499449.ece |title= Bangladesh remembers founding leader |newspaper= [[The Hindu]]|access-date= 16 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2017/08/14/79785/To-pay-debt-to-Bangabandhu |title=To pay debt to Bangabandhu |publisher= [[The Financial Express (Bangladesh)|The Financial Express]] |first= Maswood |last=Alam Khan |date= 14 August 2017 |access-date= 15 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/116477/National-Mourning-Day-today|title=National Mourning Day today|work=Prothom Alo |access-date=29 April 2017}}</ref> In 2016, the Awami League government passed a law that criminalized any criticism of Mujibur Rahman.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Afsan|title=Must laws protect Sheikh Mujib's honour and 1971 history?|url=http://opinion.bdnews24.com/2016/08/29/must-laws-protect-sheikh-mujibs-honour-and-1971-history/|access-date=8 September 2016|agency=bdnews24.com|issue=1|publisher=bdnews24.com|date=29 August 2016}}</ref>

* After one year of independence and Mujib rule, ''Time'' magazine wrote:

{{quote|text=In sum, Bangladesh had little reason to enjoy a happy first birthday. If it is not the "basket case" that [[Henry Kissinger]] once called it, neither has it become the Shonar Bangla (Golden Bengal) envisioned by Mujib. How much this is the fault of Mujib is a moot question. It is true that he has had little time in which to combat some of Bangladesh's immense problems. Nevertheless, some critics contend that he has wasted some time playing the role of popular revolutionary figure (such as personally receiving virtually any of his people who call on him) when he should have been concentrating more on serious matters of state. If, as expected, he is elected in March, Mujib will face a clear test of whether he is not only the father of Bangladesh but also its savior.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bangladesh: Not Yet Shonar Bangla |date=1 January 1973 |magazine=Time |page=32}}</ref>

* ''Time'' magazine wrote ten days after his death:

{{quote|Mujib returned to the most tumultuous welcome Dacca had ever seen—and a staggering array of problems in probably the poorest (and most densely populated) country on earth. There were virtually no civil servants and little industry. Ports were clogged, railroads destroyed, the educated elite savaged. Worse, what had not been destroyed in war was soon destroyed by a devastating drought in 1973 and floods last year that inundated three-quarters of the country.{{pb}}Laudable Objectives. Facing spreading violence—there had been at least 6,000 political murders since independence—Mujib declared a state of emergency last December. He subsequently banned extremist parties on both the left and the right, brought the press under government control, and cracked down on corruption.{{pb}}The moves met with general favor in Bangladesh, but there were those who were critical. "Do not forget I have had only three years as a free government," he reminded critics. "You cannot expect miracles." Yet even he seemed impatient for miracles in the end. No one ever doubted that his objectives were laudable. Mujib wanted nothing less than to build a "shonar Bangla," the golden Bengal of the poem by Rabindranath Tagore that serves as the country's national anthem.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,913420-2,00.html|title=BANGLADESH: Mujib: Death of the Founder|date=25 August 1975|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>}}
